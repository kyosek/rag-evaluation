Terms of Service", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Wag!](https://wagwalking.com/) is an app for dog sitting services.\nAccording to their [terms](https://wagwalking.com/terms), once you get acquainted with a pet care provider through Wag! platform, you cannot obtain for life pet care services from the dog sitter, off their platform. If you do, Wag! can charge your card a $1,000 referral fee and the same applies to the dog sitter.\n\nEDIT\n\nNote that the mentioned contract provision has no expiration. You are subject to $1,000 payment whenever during your lifetime you should happen to ask for a pet care service to someone met through Wag!. Is this legal?\n\nThe provision is akin to a non\\-compete clause where the dog sitter agrees not to start a separate business in competition against their employer. In that case $1,000 qualifies as a compensation for breaching the agreement. However dog sitters (like Uber drivers) are not Wag! employees, and by the way these clauses are not permissible in all jurisdictions.\nThis is might be the reason they use the term 'referral fee', anyway, the fee is many times more the value of the referred pet\\-care services: imagine to pay $10,000 for a second hand car and $50,000 for someone helping finding the seller. It is reasonable to assume nobody would willingly accept to pay such a huge fee and the only reason to enter the contract is the misrepresentation of the associated costs.\n\nAll that given:\n\n1. How such a clause is to be construed (in a court)?\n2. If they charge customers credit cards with a $1,000 referral fee, what type of legal protection will they have?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: About the part where they say that will charge your payment method, when you terminate your relationship with the company, you should send registered mail withdrawing authorization to charge your credit card thereafter, and you should notify the credit card company that further charges are not authorized. This won't change your legal liability, it just changes whether they have to first prove that you are legally liable before collecting the money.\n\nIt is problematic that only the company has the right to terminate the contract, but you can treat that as a harmless omission of wording on their part. Surely they did not intend that you are perpetually bound to the terms of the contract and the obligations in section 11\\. Of course, you have to stop using their services in order to terminate the contract. Given the nature of their service, you can send a notice (registered mail again) to them informing them that you are terminating the contract and will not be using their services.\n\nIf then some time in the future you do hire a pet walker that you met through the service, they might come after you for the $1,000 (although, at their sole discretion, they can increase that amount to $20,000 or anything else, see section 2\\). If you have prevented them from charging your credit card, they would have to get a judgement against you, meaning they would have to go for arbitration. Or, if they did charge your credit card, then you would have to initiate the proceedings to get your money back. That is, unless you opted out of arbitration within 30 days of starting the relationship. Let's assume you did opt out.\n\nThe question would then be whether a perennial \"no\\-compete\" clause would be enforceable against you. Employees are often bound to no\\-compete agreements prohibiting them from doing the same work in the same area for a certain period of time. A lifelong no\\-compete agreement would be unenforceable, at least in court, but a 6\\-month no\\-compete clause could easily be. In [Medix Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Dumrauf](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2017cv06648/344091/36/0.pdf?ts=1524130353), the court recites standard legal requirements of enforceable no\\-compete agreements, especially that they be \"reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer\". In such a case, the court would consider \"the hardship caused to the employee, the effect upon the general public, and the scope of the restrictions\", and the company would have to show that the \"full extent of the restraint is necessary for protecting its interests\". It is in principle possible that the court would find such a clause unenforceable (owing to it imposing a life\\-long obligation on you). This could be a new area of law: customer non\\-compete clauses. \nOne other point about that clause is that it is just a penalty clause, which is unenforceable (calling it a \"referral fee\" doesn't change the fact that it is a penalty clause). It can't reasonably be interpreted as a liquidated damages clause (which is enforceable). $100 might be.\n\nYou might rely on the mercy of the court, hoping that they would find such a perma\\-ban clause to be \"unconscionable\" and unenforceable; in principle, the arbitrator could find the same thing. An alternative would be to accept the conditions in the contract, and never hire that dog\\-walker on your own.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer uses the Wag! app to hire a dog walker.

The customer disputes this charge. Which of the following is most likely to be a successful legal argument for the customer in this situation?\n\nA) The \"referral fee\" is actually an unenforceable penalty clause\nB) The customer terminated their contract with Wag! by sending a registered letter\nC) The no-compete clause is only applicable to employees, not customers\nD) The charge is valid because the customer agreed to the terms of service\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct because the $1,000 fee is likely to be viewed as a penalty clause rather than a legitimate liquidated damages clause. Courts generally disfavor penalty clauses and may find them unenforceable.\n\nB) is incorrect because merely sending a termination letter doesn't necessarily invalidate all terms of the agreement, especially those meant to apply after termination.\n\nC) is incorrect because while no-compete clauses are typically associated with employees, the question here involves a different type of restrictive covenant applied to customers.\n\nD) is incorrect because agreeing to terms of service doesn't automatically make all clauses enforceable, especially if they're deemed unreasonable or against public policy.\n\nThe most promising argument is that the \"referral fee\" is an unenforceable penalty clause, as it's disproportionate to any actual damages Wag! might suffer and appears designed to discourage customers from hiring walkers directly rather than compensate for actual losses."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27736/can-congress-issue-a-legislative-pardon", "docs_id": 27736, "title": "Can Congress issue a legislative pardon?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that the President did not want to pardon someone, but Congress passed a private bill excusing a person from a violation of a law.\n\nSuppose this bill became law (either through inaction of the President or a veto override). Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through legislation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through\n>  legislation?\n\nYes.\n\nCongress has the power to retroactivity reduce the sentence for a crime for which someone has been sentenced. This was done most recently in the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/drug-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act) that reduced excessive penalties for crack cocaine relative to powder cocaine.\n\nIn the same way, when the death penalty is legislatively repealed in a state, the death sentences of the handful of people on death row at the time is often commuted legislatively.\n\nWhile Congress cannot impose criminal penalties on someone legislatively, which is a [Bill of Attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) and constitutionally prohibited, it can single out people for special treatment in a [private bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_bill), which is a constitutional exercise of legislative power at the federal level (not every state allows private bills to be enacted due to Progressive era reforms to state constitutions).\n\nFor example, private bills often eliminate the collateral effects of a criminal conviction upon a person, there is even [a standard procedure for doing so](https://www.shusterman.com/privatebillruleshouseofrepresentatives/), which is functionally equivalent to a Presidential pardon of the crime for that purposes (the vast majority of Presidential pardons are issued after the person convicted has served the sentence for the crime).\n\nA private bill cannot impair contract or property rights, which would be a prohibited *[ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law)* law. \n\nBut no one other than the federal government has a legally protected interest in keeping someone incarcerated or otherwise punishing them for a crime. Crimes are prosecuted in the name of the People and victims of crimes do not have legal rights in those proceedings except as created by statute. So, this would not be an *ex post facto* bill or a *taking* governed by the Fifth Amendment for takings of property interests. And, Congress may, by legislation, determine what the federal government will do in essentially all cases where it is not expressly prohibited from doing so (some argue that there is a minimum of federal authority vested exclusively in the President in the area of foreign affairs and military affairs, but that exclusivity of power does not extend to domestic criminal justice).\n\nBasically, anything that Congress could do for everyone via a public bill, it can do for someone in particular via a private bill, unless a specific constitutional prohibition applies, and there is no such prohibition when it comes to relieving someone from a sentence or the collateral effects of a criminal conviction prospectively via a private bill. This isn't exactly equivalent to a Presidential pardon or commutation, but it is very close to one in practical effect.\n\nFor a fuller, but somewhat outdated treatment of the issue, you can read this [1939 article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3734&context=californialawreview) in the California Law Review which acknowledged that legislative pardons were possible under existing law. \n\nThis said, government prosecutors routinely fervently oppose any retroactive criminal legislation that reduces punishment, particularly via private laws (although some countries, such as France, have constitutional requirements to retroactively reduce the sentences of anyone currently serving time for a crime whose punishment is legislatively reduced prospectively).\n\nPrivate bills that constitute legislative pardons are very rare. A [2011 law review article](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=clsops_papers) recounts how the tool of the legislative pardon (in parallel with the executive pardon which is also used much less frequency) has fallen into disuse. \n\nPart of the decline is due to the adoption of the right to appeal from a trial court criminal convictions which did not exist in the federal system until the 1890s. Until then, the only judicial relief available from a federal criminal conviction was via a writ of habeas corpus, and that was available only on very limited grounds such as a lack of jurisdiction to conduct the trial, or the non\\-existence of the crime of conviction. Conviction by a jury in a court with jurisdiction of a constitutionally permissible crime was an absolute defense to the extent of the sentence imposed to a habeas corpus petition at that time.\n\n(As a footnote, the term \"private bill\" can be confusing. In many governments with a parliamentary system, a \"private bill\" means one sponsored by an individual legislator rather than the prime minister and his or her cabinet. But, in U.S. terminology, a \"private bill\" refers to a bill with an effect limited to one person or a small number of persons who are either identified by name or by a very narrowly defined situation.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Congress passes a private bill that excuses John Doe from serving the remainder of his 10-year federal prison sentence for tax fraud.

This power includes the ability to retroactively reduce sentences or eliminate the consequences of a conviction.

According to HIPAA regulations, Sarah is considered a \"covered entity\" as a healthcare provider, regardless of how she obtained the protected health information. The definition of protected health information is broad and includes any individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form. The fact that Janet is not Sarah's patient and shared the information in a personal setting does not exempt Sarah from her obligations under HIPAA. Without written consent from Janet, Sarah's discussion of the procedure with her coworker likely constitutes a HIPAA violation.

The second is whether all civil wrongs constitute crimes and hence can be regarded as illegal acts.\n\nA *crime* is generally defined as *an act or omission that is prohibited by law*. Thus, from what I understand, states will have various statutes that are passed by their respective legislatures defining what acts/omissions constitute crimes in their jurisdiction as well as what their potential punishments will be. For example, California may have a law written in a statute somewhere saying that an individual may not assault someone and that the penalty is no more than 2 years imprisonment etc.\n\nNow suppose someone in California bumps into someone else walking on the pavement (accidently) causing the other to fall and injure themselves. In this case, because the action of bumping into someone had no malice aforethought (it was accidental), we could say that the individual has not in fact committed a crime but instead has possibly committed a *civil wrong* (a *tort*). If this is the case, are there statutes in each respective state defining exactly what acts and omissions constitute civil wrongs? If there are statutes defining these civil wrongs, surely this would mean that all actions/omissions defined by statute to be civil wrongs are also in fact *prohibited by law* ? (since there exists a statute stating that the act/omission carries with it a potential penalty etc). If this is true, all civil wrongs must necessarily be *crimes* as well as civil wrongs since they are prohibited by law because a statute declaring a potential penalty for an act/omission is functionally a prohibition by law.\n\nAm I correct in my thinking here? Is it the case that all civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they constitute actions/omissions that are prohibited by law (since there exists statutes defining them and their potential penalties)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The detailed answer depends on the jurisdiction that you are asking about (e.g. Saudi Arabia, France, US or specifically California): my answer is about the US. You should note that the term \"crime\" originally comes from Ancient Greek [\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=kri/ma), which means \"decision; judgment\": the word form is pretty stable, compared to the concepts that it is associated with. When the legal system changes, the referent of \"crime\" changes. Some facts about how the words are used are because of historically earlier concepts. At an earlier stage of English law, there was no distinction between crimes and civil wrongs, there were simply wrongs (\"tort\", in French).\n\nIn contemporary American practice, \"crime\" is a sub\\-type of offense against the government, the other being an \"infraction\" (such as a parking ticket). \"Civil wrong\" encompasses breaches of contract, breaches of trust, and \"torts\" such as trespassing and assault, and have in common that they are wrongs against an individual. If you commit a crime, it is you against the government, and one set of principles is adhered to in deciding *guilt*. If you commit a civil wrong, it is you against the individual (though it may be that the government acts as the mouthpiece when e.g. the \"citizens of California\" have been each wronged), and different principles are adhered to in deciding *liability*.\n\nThe distinction can be murky given overlap in certain cases, for example assault is both a crime, as dictated by statutory law and punishable by prison time, and also a tort (sub\\-type of civil wrong) as recognized at common law (traditionally recognized since the 13th century in England), and passed on to modern America. You can sue a person for the tort of assault, but the government prosecutes you for committing the statutory offense of assault. In the case of a lawsuit over assault, you seek compensation for the harm done do you, you do not seek punishment for an offense against society. That is the function of criminal law, to define the acts which may be punished.\n\nMost states in the US have done away with \"common law crimes\", but as far as I know the remnants of common law crime in the US are limited to \"definitions\" \u2013 punishments are set out in statutory law. An example of common law definitional inheritance is \"assault\" under [Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.36&full=true), where assault includes poisoning, transmitting HIV, and assaulting in various ways (relying on the common law definition of \"assault\"). This common law definition is then transmitted to the juror via a [set of instructions](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa7d8b5e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?contextData=%28sc.Default%29&transitionType=Default), which summarize the case law that defines \"assault\".\n\nAs you can see, there is a bright line between crimes and civil wrongs, so it is plainly not the case that all civil wrongs are crimes. A number of civil wrongs are statutorily defined (e.g. copyright infringement), and there is in the US a tendency to statutorily encode the essentials of civil wrongs as well as crimes.\n\nYou are probably right that crime is \"generally\" defined as an act or omission prohibited by law, where \"generally\" means \"by most people\", but that is because most people don't have a clear understanding of \"law\", \"statute\" and \"common law\". Here in Law SE, we tend to use \"legal\" in a very broad sense, meaning \"would probably be allowed and not incur any sanction by the courts\". Copyright infringement is not (necessarily) a crime, but it is prohibited by law, thus \"prohibited by law\" is not a good definition of crime.\n\nBecause of the distinction between \"crime\" and \"infraction\", both of which are cases of the individual vs. the government, \"crime\" has to be defined in terms of a specific aspect of the statutory law, the punishment. You can be imprisoned for committing a crime, but not for an infraction, such as a parking ticket. In Washington, [\"infraction\" is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=7.84.020) with reference to Title 76, 77, 79, or 79A RCW or RCW 7\\.84\\.030(2\\)(b) that \"is declared not to be a criminal offense and is subject to the provisions of this chapter\", such as [fishing with barbed hooks](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.15.160). Even though the government is the prosecutor in such a case, [the offense is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.84&full=true) is said to be \"civil in nature\".\n\nIn other words, the distinction is anything but clear.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between civil wrongs and crimes in the US legal system?\n\nA) All civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they are prohibited by law.\n\nB) Civil wrongs and crimes are completely separate categories with no overlap.\n\nC) Civil wrongs are always prosecuted by individuals, while crimes are always prosecuted by the government.\n\nD) Some actions can be both civil wrongs and crimes, but they are treated differently under the law and have distinct legal processes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the complex relationship between civil wrongs and crimes in the US legal system. Some actions, such as assault, can indeed be both a civil wrong (tort) and a crime. However, they are treated differently:\n\n- Civil wrongs are typically disputes between individuals or entities, seeking compensation for harm done.\n- Crimes are offenses against the state/government, seeking punishment for violations of statutory law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all civil wrongs are crimes. Many civil wrongs, like breaches of contract, are not criminal offenses.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there can be overlap between civil wrongs and crimes, as exemplified by actions like assault.\n\nOption C is oversimplified.

In the case of the skillet, **assuming** that it was properly licensed, it seems safe to assume that LucasFilms or their agent intended that it be used to create cookies using an image of Darth Vader, so that use was approved by them.

Is it correct, that I should have received at least half of the monthly salary, and if so where can I seek a legal advice? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the UK, if your official leaving date was the 16th, and you worked until the 16th, and you had lets say 4 days of holidays owed to you, you should get payment until the 16th, plus payment for the four days. Depending on how long you worked there, if they let you go instead of you quitting you might be owed more than that (statutory redundancy payment). \n\nYou should have been told on which day you receive that payment. I believe it should be on your official leaving date. And you should receive your P45 form, which should detail among other things exactly what salary you were paid, and what taxes were paid on your behalf. That should also happen as soon as possible, since you need the P45 for your next job.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Sarah worked for a UK company that paid salaries on the 28th of each month.

In Sarah's case, she worked 16 days in September and had 3 unused vacation days. Therefore, she should receive payment for 16 days of work plus payment for the 3 vacation days. Option A is incorrect because she didn't work the full month. Option B is incorrect as it doesn't account for the days she worked in September.

In the seventeenth century, English courts of law exercised an ancient jurisdiction that was inflexible and formalistic, while courts of equity exercised a more wide\\-ranging [ecclesiastical jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_jurisdiction) according to the Lord Chancellor's conscience. Law and equity were 'fused' to some extent by the [*Judicature Acts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicature_Acts) from 1873 onwards, but the distinction still has practical significance.\n\nIn many cases, equity provides a remedy where the strict application of the common law could result in **unconscionable** outcomes.

Equity may also require people to return money they have received by accident or where it would be unconscionable for them to retain it, even though there is no relationship between the parties under the common law of tort or contract.\n\nThe concept of unconscionability is closely linked to the idea of exercising powers 'faithfully.'

[In 2008, a cover act from Atlanta formed, calling itself \"Yacht Rock Revue,\"](http://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/confessions-cover-band-yacht-rock-revue/) and playing a number of songs both consistent and inconsistent with the genre, as defined by the comedy group that coined the term \"yacht rock.\" However, what Yacht Rock Revue did that the comedy series writers did not is trademark the term \"yacht rock.\" (A USPTO search reveals that Yacht Rock Revue claims ownership of U.S. Registration Number 3834195, and in June 2018 filed an additional TEAS Plus application for its merchandise.) The band has since used its trademark to cease\\-and\\-desist \"yacht rock\" marketing used by other musicians, including the recording artists whose work they perform.\n4. In 2016, the creators of the Yacht Rock comedy series began a podcast called \"Beyond Yacht Rock,\" which creates and defines artificial/arbitrary genres of music. In the process, they honed their definition of \"yacht rock\" as a musical style, [created a \"Yachtski Scale\" to score the \"yachtiness\" of a given song](http://www.yachtrock.com/yacht-or-nyacht-jay-gradient/) along a series of (principally arbitrary) metrics, and wrote vigorous critical defenses of these definitions in a \"Captain's Blog.\" They even interviewed Yacht Rock Revue on the show, and discussed the merits of the band's \"yacht rock\" material vis\\-a\\-vis their definitions.\n5. Yacht Rock Revue has openly acknowledged that it nicked the term \"yacht rock\" from the web comedy series. *Yacht Rock*'s creators have been acknowledged as founders of the genre in interviews with with [Rolling Stone magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/sail-away-the-oral-history-of-yacht-rock-49343/) and the NPR music show World Cafe. Yet various parties ([recently, sports writer Bill Simmons among them](https://twitter.com/billsimmons/status/903346781273985024?lang=en)) continue to claim ownership of the \"yacht rock\" concept under some personal definition, Yacht Rock Revue included.\n\nAre there any legal remedies for the writers of the web comedy series to:\n\n1. keep the \"yacht rock\" term from being leveraged by parties like\nYacht Rock Revue\n2. profit from their original coinage\n3. trademark their evolving definition/terminology\n4. protect their future endeavors from similar behavior, which to me seems at least partly analogous to patent trolling\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are there any legal remedies for the writers of the web comedy series\n>  to:\n> \n> \n> 1. keep the \"yacht rock\" term from being leveraged by parties like Yacht Rock Revue\n> 2. profit from their original coinage\n> 3. trademark their evolving definition/terminology\n> 4. protect their future endeavors from similar behavior, which to me seems at least partly analogous to patent trolling\n\nMultiple facts and issues matter:\n\n1. Did the original series writers have a trademark in the phrase either at common law, or by registering it?\n2. If they did have a trademark, what was the scope of goods or services covered by the trademark? Generally, a trademark can only be acquired for goods or services actually used by the person claiming it. There is no such thing as a trademark that applies universally.\n3. If they did have a trademark was it diluted to the point of becoming a generic term a la the term \"Xerox\" that lost its secondary meaning association with the goods or services of the original user of the trademark.\n4. Does the use by the radio program deceive the ordinary listener in a manner that causes the ordinarily listen to believe that the radio program is affiliated with the comedy show creators and benefits from the \"secondary meaning\" association with their show that they imparted to the term. A trademark isn't a prohibition on using the phrase, it is a prohibition on using the mark to deceptively market goods as associated with something that they are not associated with.\n5. Who owns any rights to the trademark, if there is one, and was it licensed? Often intellectual property in entertainment media is managed by multi\\-copyright owner association on behalf of IP owners who are often media companies. Typically radio stations including Sirius XM has a licensing agreement with all major management companies controlling the rights to the content that they play. It could be that a trademark is controlled by such an organization and within the scope of the station's license.\n6. Also, in addition to trademark claims, there could be claims that the station is creative derivative works of its work that is protected by copyright, subject to fair use, [sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) (i.e. has yacht rock become a genre rather than a particular comedy group's baby), and licensing considerations.\n\nThe answers to these questions must be resolved to know that answer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A comedy group creates a web series called \"Yacht Rock\" in 2005, coining the term to describe a music genre. In 2008, a cover band trademarks \"Yacht Rock\" and uses it to send cease-and-desist letters to others using the term. What is the most significant legal consideration for the original comedy group if they want to challenge the cover band's trademark?\n\nA) The comedy group's failure to trademark the term first\nB) Whether the term \"Yacht Rock\" has become generic\nC) The comedy group's copyright on their web series\nD) The cover band's acknowledgment that they took the term from the comedy group\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While all options have some relevance, the most crucial consideration is whether \"Yacht Rock\" has become a generic term (option B). If the term has lost its distinctive association with the comedy group and become widely used to describe a music genre, it may no longer be eligible for trademark protection. This is known as trademark dilution or genericide.\n\nOption A is relevant but not the most significant factor, as common law trademark rights can exist without registration. Option C relates to copyright, which is separate from trademark law and less relevant here. Option D, while interesting, doesn't directly impact the legal standing of the trademark.\n\nThe genericide issue is central because it determines whether the term can be trademarked at all, regardless of who first used it or tried to register it. If \"Yacht Rock\" is deemed generic, neither the comedy group nor the cover band would have exclusive rights to it."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74009/us-equivalent-of-no-case-to-answer-before-trial", "docs_id": 74009, "title": "US equivalent of &quot;no case to answer&quot; before trial", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At least in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, criminal defence can make a [\"no case to answer\"](https://www.defence-barrister.co.uk/submission-of-no-case-to-answer/) application *before* trial (they can also make one at the close of the prosecution's case during trial, but let's not be distracted by that).\n\nWhen they make such an application before trial, they basically assert that the prosecution's evidence is *not capable* of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That means, even if the witnesses testify it and don't get discredited, no reasonable jury would convict anyway.\n\nThe judge, when determining such an application, evaluates the would\\-be\\-given evidence and decides if it is capable of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The closest thing I heard of is \"probable cause\" but is it a full equivalent of \"no case to answer\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At the federal level, there is no real equivalent to what you're describing.\n\nA probable cause hearing evaluates the government's evidence in a similar way, but it doesn't ask whether a reasonable jury would convict. The closest I can think of is a Rule 29 motion, which *does* ask that question, but not until trial has already begun. You typically make the motion at the close of the government's case, and (if it was not successful) again at the close of your own, though I've heard tales of judges granting the motion at the end of the government's opening statement.\n\nThe states all have their own rules, but they're generally pretty similar to the federal rules in this respect, as I understand it. I don't know of any state that allows the kind of motion you're talking about, in criminal cases, at least.

A Rule 29 motion is the closest equivalent in the US federal system to a \"no case to answer\" motion. It asks whether a reasonable jury would convict based on the evidence presented, but it occurs during the trial rather than before it.\n\nD) While this might seem like a logical equivalent, the documentation does not mention any such pre-trial motion in US federal criminal proceedings that directly corresponds to the \"no case to answer\" motion.\n\nThe key difference is that in the US federal system, there is no pre-trial motion that serves the same function as the \"no case to answer\" motion.

Do they need a reason to believe that you committed a crime, or can they just detain you without any reason at all?\n\nIf you need a state, use Texas, if you need a city, use McKinney. Please make it clear under what scope the laws actually reside.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Brief detentions and reasonable suspicion\n\nYou can be briefly detained by police if they have reasonable suspicion that you committed a crime. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968\\)\n\nWhat reasonable suspicion \"means\" can only be fully understood by reference to subsequent case law (which I will expand this answer to do), but as a basis, the court said in Terry that:\n\n> the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion\n\nThis standard has been reiterated as recently as in Heien v. North Carolina 574 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), where they say \"All parties agree that to justify this type of seizure \\[a traffic stop, in the case of Heien], officers need only reasonable suspicion \u2014 that is, a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of breaking the law\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe reasonable suspicion standard was also used recently in Navarette v. California 572 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\). They reiterated that reasonable suspicion is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability, quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325, 330 (1990\\). A mere \"hunch\" does not create reasonable suspicion, but the level of suspicion required by the reasonable suspicion standard is \"obviously less than is necessary for probable cause\".\n\n### Arrests and probable cause\n\nTo be arrested, police require probable cause. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\)\n\nIn more detail, probable cause exists (from Brinegar v. U.S.):\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nAlso:\n\n> The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law\\-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers' whim or caprice.\n\nAs in the case of reasonable suspicion, the probable cause analysis is case\\-by\\-case and fact\\-intensive, so to understand the contours of probable cause will require reference to much subsequent case law.\n\nIn Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964\\) the question before the court was entirely \"whether or not the record in the case before us can support a finding of probable cause for the petitioner's arrest\". In that case, it turned out that the information they had received about the arrestee was not sufficient for probable cause, but regardless, the test the court applied was whether the police had probable cause for the arrest.\n\n### Notes\n\nWhile I am confident in the correctness of this answer, what each of these standards means will take hours of work to flesh out, which I plan to do. The courts have repeatedly reiterated and referred to these decisions/standards, but the analysis is very fact\\-intensive and is done case\\-by\\-case. Also, I realize the presentation is a little scattershot, as I'm first just looking to include relevant cases and statements the court has made about these standards, but I'll re\\-make it into a coherent story every once in a while.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith is patrolling a neighborhood in McKinney, Texas when he sees a group of teenagers leaving a house party.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding Officer Smith's actions?\n\nA) Officer Smith can detain the teenagers indefinitely without any specific reason, as police have broad authority to question civilians.\n\nB) Officer Smith needs probable cause that a crime has been committed to briefly detain and question the teenagers.\n\nC) Officer Smith cannot stop or question the teenagers at all without witnessing an actual crime being committed.\n\nD) Officer Smith needs reasonable suspicion based on specific, articulable facts to briefly detain and question the teenagers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the Terry v. Ohio case and subsequent rulings, police officers need reasonable suspicion to briefly detain individuals. This reasonable suspicion must be based on \"specific and articulable facts\" that, combined with rational inferences, warrant the intrusion. A mere \"hunch\" is not sufficient for a Terry stop.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because police cannot detain individuals indefinitely without reason. This would violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because probable cause is the higher standard required for arrests, not for brief investigative detentions. Reasonable suspicion is the appropriate standard for brief stops and questioning.\n\nAnswer C is too restrictive. Police do not need to actually witness a crime to conduct a brief investigative stop.

However, territories are federal entities and so in theory, any federal matter could be devolved to the territorial legislatures. This is hinted at with the s. 8 in your question. However, with the exception of some Aboriginal matters, the territorial acts are clear that the territorial legislatures do **not** have any competencies beyond that of the provinces (*Yukon Act* s. 20(1\\), *Northwest Territories Act* s. 25(1\\), *Nunavut Act* s. 23(2\\))\n\nThis makes our job easier: since the territorial legislatures can't legislate on criminal matters, any inconsistency with the *Criminal Code* would have to lie directly in those three territorial acts. While I could have missed something, I was unable to find any inconsistency in either the Yukon or Northwest Territory acts. So why does s. 8 of the *Criminal Code* exist? It seems to be a matter of how the legislation was historically structured: The *Criminal Code* would set the country\\-wide default, and any derogations could be placed in the territorial acts. See for example *[The King v. Standard Soap Company](https://www.canlii.org/en/nt/ntsc/doc/1907/1907canlii134/1907canlii134.html)*, 1907 CanLII 134 (NWT SC):\n\n> When the Criminal Code, 1892, was enacted, it was, by sec. 983, made applicable to the North\\-West Territories, except in so far as it was inconsistent with the provisions of the North\\-West Territories Act and the amendments thereto. As far as this case is concerned, the only Changes made in the Code by that Act are that instead of an indictment being presented by a grand jury to the Court where a person is charged with a criminal offence, the proceedings are commenced by a charge in writing setting forth the offence in the same manner as in an indictment.\n\nGrand juries no longer exist in Canada, so this inconsistency doesn't either (I speculate the original reason would have been the difficulty and expense of convening grand juries in such a sparsely populated territory).\n\nAs for Nunavut, well it seems Parliament threw the historical structure out the [Peace Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Tower) window. If you search for \"Yukon\" or \"Northwest\" in the *Criminal Code*, you'll find about 20 results each where they are mostly being treated the same as the provinces.

I will be the only owner and employee. I've been looking into sites like legalzoom and incfile as well as local business lawyers. Both business lawyers' websites and people on random online forums regarding the topic have suggested that forming an LLC using online services such as these will only provide you with generic documents that will not provide the necessary protection you need. Furthermore, once people realize that their documents from these online services do not serve their purposes or have screwed them over, they must go to a lawyer anyway to fix the mess.\n\nWhat are some concrete examples of ways using documents from online services would not provide the proper protection? What is the approximate cost to have a lawyer fix said mistakes and in what situations would I come to realize the need to consult a lawyer in person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A single person LLC document is one where it probably makes less of a difference to have it drafted by a lawyer than many other documents because it has very few tax implications and governance is elementary. The main issues would be choosing a proper LLC name and correctly choosing whether it should be member managed or manager managed (almost always, manager managed is preferred).\n\nBut, the main reason to consult a lawyer is to determine if a single person LLC as opposed, for example, to an S corporation, is really the most appropriate entity form for your business.\n\nAmong the concerns would be how this form would interact with California's community property laws, determining whether the LLC is disregarded for [state franchise taxes as well as federal income taxes](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/businesses/Structures/Limited-Liability-Company.shtml), determining what impact the LLC makes on Medicaid planning and estate planning, determining whether the ability to reduce FICA taxation in an S\\-corporation makes it worth choosing that form rather than an LLC, determining whether there are liability insurance requirements that are triggered, and determining how this form impacts health insurance structures v. other alternatives.\n\nAn attorney could also advise you on the \"care and feeding\" of the LLC so that you are clear on how to observe the proper formalities. For example, many people forget to, or don't know how to, title property in the LLC name, don't know when to obtain a separate EIN for the LLC, don't know how to sign documents in the name of the LLC, don't know how to draft an LLC authorization, don't know that the LLC must be an insured on insurance policies, etc.\n\nAlso, an attorney normally wouldn't charge very much for a very simple entity like a single member LLC Operating Agreement.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that getting a lawyer to fix a problem after the fact caused by DIY work by a client is about ten times as great as the cost of hiring a lawyer to do it correctly in the first place.\n\nFor example, a single person LLC might cost $500\\-$750 to draft in the first place including a consultation about whether it was really appropriate and a care and feeding discussion.

The key principle in serving legal documents is not the method of delivery itself, but rather the ability to prove that the recipient actually received the document.

I.e., even when the owner is *effectively permanently deprived* of their property, I have not found any practical legal mechanism for them to seek compensation.

In that case, showing that our client's particular gun was not involved in any illegitimate transaction also simultaneously made it less important as evidence, although that would not necessarily be true in general in these kinds of situations.\n\nThere is a pending case in Colorado posing similar issues, where a suburban police department essentially destroyed a guy's home in order to catch a felon with no relation to the homeowner whatsoever, who had fled into it and taken refuge there.

Then within 7 days they are to report the injury to their insurance company. They acknowledge that employers may refuse to report injuries, and clarify that the employee has a right to report the injury to the insurance company (they offer assistance in doing that).

The employee's attorney can advise the employee whether the company's alternative offer is advantageous. If one does not take action (notifying the insurance company for example), eventually they will have waived your rights for compensation.\n\nSupposing that the employee files a report with the insurance company, and the company then fires her in retaliation. This would not involve any unemployment compensation. There is no provision under the law for the state to litigate on her behalf, although the attorney general might file a class action suit if the company is engaged in widespread illegal terminations. So it would fall on the employee to litigate the matter: retaliation for filing a workman's comp claim is one of the recognized grounds for a wrongful termination suit.

However, I will say this: generally, the financial services industry, and in particular, deposit\\-taking institutions, are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than many others. (I'd usually say that insurance is also fairly\\-heavily regulated, generally.) So it's likely that there are laws and regulations that prevent banks, for instance from doing it.\n\nAs for other places... I don't intend to traverse the trillions of contracts made each day.\n\n> Why only in insurance we have this problem?\n\nYou haven't proven this.

It could also be considered to be an extension of the online services agreement rather than a separate agreement.\n\nUDAP is an acronym referring the state deceptive trade practices acts.\n\n> The unfair act involves non\\-receipt of paperless billing statements.\n\nEven with this level of detail, I don't believe it is possible to know in advance which of the agreements is implicated and which state's laws will be held to apply (or if the differences between the laws of the candidate states is even material on the issue in question).\n\nThese issues are decided on a case by case basis when there is a mishmash of facts and the outcomes are not terribly predictable.\n\nIt also isn't obvious that there is a provision covering the conduct in question in any of the three potentially relevant states. The Delaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act doesn't appear to clearly apply to financial services at all. New York's application to financial services is quite narrow and subject to an exception for conduct in conformity with federal law. A failure to provide an invoice, without more, isn't necessarily a deceptive trade practice at all.\n\nAll in all, there isn't a straightforward or easy answer to this question that can be reached from the information provided.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer in North Carolina sues a national bank for unfair practices related to non-receipt of paperless billing statements. The consumer signed three agreements: a cardmember agreement (governed by Delaware law), an online service agreement (governed by New York law), and an electronic communication consent agreement (no choice-of-law provision). Which of the following is most likely to be true regarding the applicable law for the consumer's Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) claim?\n\nA) The claim will definitely be governed by Delaware law due to the cardmember agreement's choice-of-law provision.\n\nB) The claim will be governed by New York law because the online service agreement specifically mentions \"products and services accessed via the Online Service.\"\n\nC) The claim will be governed by North Carolina law because the lawsuit was filed in North Carolina and involves a North Carolina resident.\n\nD) The applicable law will depend on which agreement is determined to be most relevant to the specific unfair act alleged, and may be subject to North Carolina public policy considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the situation involves multiple agreements with different choice-of-law provisions, and the specific nature of the unfair act (non-receipt of paperless billing statements) could potentially fall under any of the three agreements. The court would need to determine which agreement is most relevant to the specific claim and consider whether North Carolina's public policy might override the chosen law. Additionally, for the agreement without a choice-of-law provision, the court would likely apply the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant connection to the dispute. This complex scenario means that the applicable law cannot be definitively determined without further analysis of the specific facts and circumstances of the case."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87249/in-a-defamation-case-can-the-defendant-not-prove-statement-to-be-true-and-still", "docs_id": 87249, "title": "In a defamation case, can the defendant not prove statement to be true and still win the case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A male celebrity has said to a tabloid newspaper he slept with a female celebrity when they worked in a production few years ago. The female celeb is now suing him for defamation as she says that this is false; she never slept with him.\n\nIf the male celebrity decided to say he can't remember the specifics for example where and when this alleged encounter happened, is that enough of a defence for the male celebrity or does he have to provide specifics of encounter to win this case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a variety of reasons someone might not win a defamation case, some of which are defenses, and others of which are part of the basic prima facie case that every person pursing a claim must establish. The exact details vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n1. The statute of limitations for bringing suit based upon the alleged statement has passed. Many jurisdictions have especially short statutes of limitations for defamation claims. For example, in Colorado, the statute of limitations for a defamation claim is just one year, while other civil claims have two to six year statutes of limitations.\n2. The quoted statement isn't actually what was said.\n3. The statement is not defamatory in nature (i.e. it doesn't tend to harm the Plaintiff's reputation).\n4. The Plaintiff's reputation is so bad that no further statement could harm it.\n5. The court lacks jurisdiction over the claim or the case is filed in the wrong venue.\n6. The statement was substantially true. Note that this is not a defense to all types of claims called defamation in all jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions prohibit certain kinds of inflammatory negative statements (e.g. about religious figures, monarchs, dead people, family members, or disabled people) without regard to their truth, in causes of action that are seen as a subset of defamation actions. For example, Germany's criminal defamation statute prohibits some kinds of speech that would be considered insulting or \"fighting words\", effectively imposing a standing of civility in every day contexts, that applies without regard to truth. U.S. law carefully distinguishes between remedies for fraudulent lies about someone, statements that are objectionable because they implicate privacy concerns, statements that are objectionable because a person has a contractual or particularized legal duty not to say negative things about a particular individual, and statements that are disrespectful and disorderly, but not all jurisdictions draw these careful and fine lines.\n7. In context, the statement could not reasonably have been understood to be true as opposed to puffing, hyperbole, or an opinion.\n8. Failure to prove damages in jurisdictions where this is required on claims where it is required (proof of damages is not required for libel or slander per se in some jurisdictions). Some jurisdictions allow only economic damages, others allow emotional harm damages, others allow punitive damages, some allow statutory damages, and some allow some but not all of these kinds of damages.\n9. The statement is privileged or subject to a qualified privilege (e.g. statements made to law enforcement investigators, by attorneys in litigation, in court documents, by legislators in legislative debate, etc.)\n10. The statement was false but believed in good faith and with a reasonable basis to be true at the time, and at the time of the litigation, the person making the statement acknowledges its inaccuracies or a sense in which a statement meant as true could be misunderstood.\n11. Some jurisdictions make retraction of full defense or a partial defense. Some jurisdictions even make a request for a retraction a condition precedent to bringing a defamation lawsuit in some circumstances.\n12. The person bringing the lawsuit doesn't meet their burden of proof at trial. Usually, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, but truth is sometimes considered an affirmative defense which some jurisdictions place on the defendant to prove. The burden of proof could be quite relevant to the answer. Ultimately, if truth is an issue in a case, the finder of fact (jury or judge depending upon the jurisdiction and whether a jury is demanded) would have to decide what evidence is sufficient.
