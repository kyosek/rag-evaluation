When possible they can and should generally elect to be taxed as an S\\-Corp. [IRS Pub 2553](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2553.pdf) lists the criteria for S\\-Corp election.

This means that all profits are attributed to the owner for tax purposes, regardless of whether they are actually withdrawn from the business. The owner can indeed withdraw profits at will, but will be taxed on all profits of the business, even if some remain in the company's accounts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a sole owner of an LLC is not required to pay themselves a defined salary, especially if the LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership.\n\nOption B is incorrect because electing to be treated as a C-Corporation would actually prevent the owner from freely withdrawing all profits without tax consequences. C-Corporations face double taxation on distributed profits.\n\nOption D is incorrect because hiring employees does not necessarily require changing the LLC's tax election status, nor does it inherently limit the owner's ability to withdraw profits.

Based on the information provided, Bob's claim for a full refund was likely unsuccessful because he failed to prove that the contractor breached the contract or acted negligently. In cases of faulty workmanship, the client is not automatically entitled to a full refund unless there is a \"complete and utter failure of consideration.\" Instead, Bob should have sought damages for the cost of repairs or having the work redone correctly.

Exemplary damages are intended to punish the defendant for particularly malicious or reckless behavior, while attorney's fees are the costs associated with legal representation. The award of exemplary damages does not automatically include attorney's fees, and vice versa.\n\nA is incorrect because exemplary damages are not always awarded to cover attorney's fees.

This approach helps avoid accusations of insider trading by establishing a set schedule for stock sales in advance, regardless of any non-public information the insider may later become aware of.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's impractical and doesn't provide legal protection.

This is required for certain kinds of claims in certain jurisdictions as a matter of statute or court rule, which vary widely.**\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a \"replevin claim\" (i.e. a claim for expedited recovery of possession of specific tangible personal property) must be verified, and the object will be repossessed by force under court order if a timely response is not filed, often in a matter of a week or two, when the lack of a response could be due to reasons other than a lack of a good defense to the seizure.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is required when the relief requested is extraordinary relative to an ordinary lawsuit to collect an unpaid bill or recover damages from an injury in an accident, but requirements vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nHistorically, at least, there have been jurisdictions in which all complaints must be verified, and there are other jurisdictions where it is almost never required.\n\n**2\\. The lawyer wants to insulate himself from liability.**\n\nA lawyer is required to exercise due diligence to confirm that the facts in documents filed with a court are true. Normally, a lawyer is entitled to simply rely on the fact that this lawyer's clients are telling the truth. But, if the client is sketchy, it is hard to independently confirm the facts, or the facts alleged seem extraordinary, the lawyer can be mostly insulated from liability for sanction for filing a complaint that lacks a factual basis by having a client swear to the fact under penalty of perjury.\n\n**3\\. A motion for summary judgment is likely.**\n\nIn most U.S. jurisdictions, if a party defending a claim provides a factually detailed affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss a case because the facts alleged in the complaint are not true, the claim against that party will be dismissed unless the party bringing the claim files a response to the motion for summary judgment supported by a factually detailed affidavit disputing the facts alleged in the defending party's affidavit on material issues that creates a \"disputed issue of fact\" that must be resolved in an evidentiary hearing or trial by a judge or jury.\n\nIf the initial complaint contains factually detailed assertions in support of its allegations that are verified, i.e. sworn it as if by an affidavit, then that route to ending the case prematurely with a motion for summary judgment is largely thwarted.

The resident's technical violation of the one-way street regulation would be weighed against the construction crew's failure to properly close the street and any other driver's duty to maintain a proper lookout. In such cases, a jury would typically assess the negligence of all parties involved, considering factors such as the resident's cautious approach (using hazard lights and moving slowly), the construction crew's improper blocking of the street without proper signage, and the actions of any other drivers involved in a potential accident.

So my question is under which circumstances is it legally possible to file a divorce in Georgia, taking into consideration the fact that we are living separately for about a week?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Georgia, what is the minimum required period of separation before a couple can file for divorce?\n\nA) 1 week\nB) 30 days\nC) 6 months\nD) There is no minimum separation period required\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nIn Georgia, there is no minimum separation period required before filing for divorce. Unlike some other states, Georgia does not recognize legal separation as a formal status. Couples can file for divorce immediately after deciding to end their marriage, even if they have only been living separately for a short time (like a week in this case). \n\nThe confusion might arise because some states do require a separation period before divorce, but Georgia is not one of them. In Georgia, one can file for a no-fault divorce on the grounds of an \"irretrievably broken\" marriage without any waiting period.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect as they suggest specific time periods, which are not required in Georgia. Option D is correct because it accurately reflects Georgia's divorce law regarding separation periods."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92483/does-the-tesla-act-illegally-at-this-pedestrian-crossing-in-california", "docs_id": 92483, "title": "Does the Tesla act illegally at this pedestrian crossing in California?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In [this](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/teslas-full-self-driving-sees-pedestrian-chooses-not-to-slow-down/) article reporting on a Tesla in Full Self Driving (FSD) mode in California, the car is shown approaching a pedestrian crossing when a person steps on to it from the opposite side of the road. The Tesla detects the pedestrian, but elects to continue through the crossing without stopping (presumably because the pedestrian was not on their side of the road).\n\nVarious comments to that article state that what the Tesla did was illegal. But in my various googling attempts, I have not found any source that definitely states that the car *has* to stop. For example, the [CA DMV Drivers handbook](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/laws-and-rules-of-the-road/) says:\n\n> When there is a pedestrian crossing a roadway with or without a\n> crosswalk, you must use caution, reduce your speed, or stop to allow\n> the pedestrian to safely finish crossing.\n\nThe use of \"or\" here seems to imply that stopping is optional (of course I assume that means only if you have taken due care/caution)\n\nBut some of the commentators quote this from the same DMV handbook:\n\n> Pedestrians have the right\\-of\\-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. If\n> there is a limit line before the crosswalk, stop at the limit line and\n> allow pedestrians to cross the street.\n\nAnd take it to imply that the Tesla should have stopped because the crossing does have a \"limit line\".\n\nMy question is pretty simple. Did the Tesla break an actual law in California? Or is it simply a dick move that technically is not illegal?\n\nGiven the specificity of this video, I'm only really looking for answers that relate to California. I know that in other jurisdictions in the US and in other countries there may be other definitions of legality \\- which does make producing generic software for an automated car rather complex.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am aware of a view of the California law that if a pedestrian looks like they might want to cross the street, any car must stop, but this is not supported by the law, which is about \"yielding\". The law incorporates both \"yield\" and \"stop\", the former being \"and allow the other person to proceed\".\nIgnoring the photo for a moment, the requirement to yield (not stop) allows a car to continue driving when the driver is e.g. 10 ft from the crosswalk and the pedestrian is three lanes over when they enter the crosswalk, remaining in compliance with the law. The pedestrian and the driven can continue with their journey because there is no conflict.\n\nThe requirement to yield states whose right to proceed is subordinated to the other person's, in case of conflict. Turning to the video which shows what is in front but not behind, it is evident that the vehicle did not actually conflict with the pedestrian, who did not slow down in order to let the vehicle pass. The violation of social conventions is clear, in that the pedestrian enters the crosswalk while the car is 5 or so car lengths back, and can safely slow down so that there would be zero chance of hitting the pedestrian (it starts to slow but only trivially one the pedestrian is visibly 'crossing the street'). As far as I can determine, California case law has not established any numbers that constitute \"not yielding\".

The law requires drivers to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, which can involve slowing down or stopping, depending on the specific situation. This aligns with the DMV handbook's statement that drivers must \"use caution, reduce your speed, or stop to allow the pedestrian to safely finish crossing.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too absolute.

The scope of a warrant for \"electronic devices\" is strictly limited to the physical devices specified in the warrant. It does not automatically grant access to or freeze associated online accounts, social media profiles, or other digital services. For law enforcement to access or seize online accounts or prevent the owner from accessing them, these actions must be explicitly stated in the scope of the warrant. The owner generally retains the ability to access their online accounts through other means and can typically transfer their phone number to a new device unless specifically prohibited by the warrant.

They rejected the forms saying that they needed \"original\" signatures. I pointed out that the signature becomes digital when I scan the form anyway, but they insisted that I manually sign, then scan, then email the forms. All illogicality aside, is there any legal reason for this policy?\n\nBTW, this is in the United States, though I imagine if there is a legal principle behind this that it would be fairly universal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Digital signatures are sometimes allowed in the U.S., but, when they are allowed, they are allowed only in the context of a fairly specific statutory procedure for doing so.\n\nPart of the idea of a manual signature is that a human being manually writing something creates an original document that can be pulled out if necessary and has some rather distinctive aspects to it that can be examined to see if the signature is a forgery. But, in contrast, when you cut and paste a signature into a document, there is no way to know if the person doing the cutting and the pasting is really the person identified in the signature, even after the fact with forensic expert attention.\n\nAnother part of the idea of a manual signature is that the physical act of putting a pen in your hand and putting it on a physical piece of paper is a time honored and traditional way of symbolically giving assent to what it on the paper. This physical act *is* what legally constitutes your consent. Indeed, it isn't even terribly important for this aspect of the idea that it be your name. The practice of having illiterate people write an \"X\" on a signature line with the intent that they will be bound is used for this same purpose, even though it is probably not identifiable forensically (although it rules out a signature by a literate person). Tapping keys on a keyboard that cause a copy of a signature to appear in a document is arguably not distinct enough from other kinds of keyboard use to make it stand out from the other actions of a person to make it a distinctively symbolic act of assent in the way that a manual signature is distinct from simply typing or writing prose.\n\nIndeed, the importance of this manual signing activity in conferring the significance of important legal actions is memorialized in a group of statutes collectively known as the \"statute of frauds\" which says that certain kinds of legal acts are only legally effective if they are in writing and \"signed\" by the party against whom the document will be enforced. A cut and paste of a signature, even if authorized by the person whose signature it purports to be, doesn't count as a signature for statute of frauds purposes, unless legislation specifically authorizes that and the legislation that does so has limitations and safeguards built into it.\n\nThe important part is not that it is digitized \\-\\- photocopies and electronic reproductions (such as scanning and faxing) are often allowed in lieu of originals. The important part is that the signer engaged in a distinctive, individualized symbolic act to authorize the matters set forth in a document by the conventional manual means or a statutorily approved alternative.\n\nOf course, cutting and pasting scanned signatures is a very new thing under the sun. Mimeographs were expensive and were not considered individualized assent signatures either. Before that, the recognized and valid alternative to a manual signature was a seal, often in wax. But, seals fell out of favor before they were replaced with digital cutting and pasting.\n\nWe are still in transition. This transition is particularly hard certain documents that are \"real\" as opposed to being mere evidence of your intent, such as checks and promissory notes and wills where a photocopy is not considered to be equivalent to the original. It has been accepted practice to allow faxes of many kinds of contracts to be considered valid for 30 years or more, but allowing people to deposit a \"real\" document like a check electronically has only been possible for a few years.\n\nSooner or later, this requirement will cease. But, it will take time. Consider that for almost a thousand years, in order to validly sell real estate, the seller had to physically hand some dirt from that location to the buyer in what was called the \"livery of seizen\". A couple of hundred years ago, we finally dispensed with that tradition and let a signed and notarized deed take its place. The complete transition to digital signatures will no doubt happen sooner. But, we aren't there yet. \n\nThere are several \"uniform acts\" proposed as models for states to adopt on the subject such as the \"Uniform Computer information Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", but these have not been more or less uniformly adopted by the states. \n\nThere is also federal legislation on this subject in the U.S. called the \"E\\-Sign Act\" (formally the \"Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act\", 15 USC \u00a7 7001 et seq.) adopted on June 30, 2000\\.

Looking into this further, some of these websites require \"proof that you are an immediate family member or executor for account removal.\" As a business, we need to be in the latter category. What is required to be an executor? Do we have to be a part of the will for each deceased individual, or is there an alternative?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Executors and Administrators\n----------------------------\n\nThe executor of an estate is the person(s) named by the testator in their will. The executor is the legal representative of the deceased and is responsible for winding\\-up their affairs and distributing the estate's assets to the beneficiaries in accordance with the will. The executor will apply to the court for a \"grant of probate\" which gives them the legal authority (and protection) to act.\n\nIf a person dies without a will (intestate) then the person who fulfills this role is called the administrator. An administrator is appointed by the court by their issuing \"Letters of Administration\". The administrator is responsible for winding\\-up the deceased's affairs and distributing the estate's assets to the beneficiaries in accordance with the law.\n\nEither role can be filled by any legal person which means an individual or a body corporate (company). They have a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries and are legally liable if they screw things up.\n\nYour business\n-------------\n\nGreat idea!\n\nUnfortunately, with the current state of the law in most parts of the world its a non\\-starter. An executor holds a position of extreme personal and legal trust \\- they are the person that the deceased trusts to do the right thing by everyone they leave behind. I'm sure that you are trustworthy people but I (and most people) are going to want their executor to be someone like a spouse, sibling or child with whom they have familial ties, a close personal friend or a government public trustee.\n\nAt the same time, banks, insurance companies etc. will not deal with anyone but the trustee (executor or administrator) and usually not until probate has been granted. They will also require that any funds be paid into a bank account set up by the trustee in their name in trust for the deceased unless the amounts are trivial.\n\nOwnership of social media accounts is a grey area of the law at present \\- they will not release passwords except to legally authorized representatives and sometimes not even then."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A new business aims to automate the process of closing social media accounts and bank accounts for deceased individuals.

The business model faces several obstacles:\n\n1. Executors are typically named in a will and hold a position of extreme personal and legal trust, usually filled by close family members or friends.\n2. Banks and other institutions generally only deal with court-appointed executors or administrators, and usually not until probate has been granted.\n3. Social media account ownership is a legal grey area, and companies are often reluctant to release information even to legally authorized representatives.\n4.

The voices in his head also contributed to the assaults.

Both the US and the UK give *post\\-mortem* 70 years of copyright protection to authors' material. Does the answer depend on where the book was published?\n\n**Note**: this question is particularly relevant in the context of copyright defined in terms of \"end of calendar year\". This seems to be the issue in the definition of copyright protection length. For instance, see page 3 of [this document](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf) for the US, and the Notes at the end of [this page](https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p10_duration).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright under the Berne Convention relies on the concept of \"country of origin\". This is the country where the work was first published or, for simultaneous (i.e. within 30 days) publishing the country that gives the *shortest* copyright term. While the country of origin may be disputed, particularly for works first published on the internet, every work has one, even if a court may need to decide which it is.\n\nTherefore the relevant time of death is the one in the country of origin.\n\nFor your UK/USA example, the country of origin if the works had been published simultaneously is the UK because, based on the time of death, it has the shortest copyright term: one year shorter than the USA\n\nFor a country entirely within one time zone, like the UK, this is straightforward. For countries that span multiple time zones, this will depend on the local law regarding time.\n\nFor example, the Australian *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* says:\n\n> **ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901 \\- SECT 37**\n> \n> \n> **Expressions of time**\n> \n> \n> Where in an Act any reference to time occurs, such time shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be deemed in each State or part of the Commonwealth to mean the legal time in that State or part of the Commonwealth.\n\nAt face value, as applied to the Copyright Act 1968 for an Australian work, this could mean that the work would have a years further protection in Western Australia than in New South Wales. However, such an interpretation would be unconstitutional as Commonwealth law must apply equally in each state and territory of the Commonwealth.\n\nWhen such a case comes up, the judge would need to hear the evidence and make a decision. We cannot speculate what that decision will be but some arguable possibilities include:\n\n* if the author died in Australia, the date in the place where they died\n* the date on their death certificate, being the *official* date\n* the date in the specific place where the work was created\n* the date of their death in Canberra, being the national capital."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author dies on January 1, 2000, at 1:30 AM in Sydney, Australia (which is December 31, 1999, at 9:30 AM in Los Angeles).

For simultaneous publishing, the country with the shortest copyright term is considered. In this case, based on the author's death date, Australia and the UK would consider the death date as January 1, 2000, while the US would consider it as December 31, 1999. This means the UK and Australia would have a copyright term ending December 31, 2070, while the US term would end December 31, 2069. Since we must use the shortest term for simultaneous publication, all countries would use the US date, making the copyright expire on December 31, 2069 in all countries. The complexity of time zones and potential legal interpretations make this a challenging question, but the principle of using the shortest term for simultaneous publication is key."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1390/doctor-sending-private-information-over-whatsup-for-consultation", "docs_id": 1390, "title": "Doctor sending private information over whatsup for consultation", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a doctor sends screen grabs, taken by his smartphone, of different patients' confidential health files to other doctors for quick consultation, does that potentially violate any law?

Many people think that this is a low end estimate.\n\nAlso, sometimes a jury will acquit a defendant in a case where they think that the defendant was actually legally guilty because of extraordinary circumstances, and so the jury will disregard the law and acquit. This practice is called \"jury nullification.\"\n\nAnd, as other answers have noted, sometimes the prosecution or the judicial system screws up for reasons that are unforeseeable, after a not guilty plea, in a way that makes proving your guilt difficult or impossible.\n\nBasically, if you \"roll the dice\" there is some non\\-zero chance you will be acquitted, while if you plead guilty, there is none.\n\nAlso, sometimes court decisions will change the law in way favorable to you after the trial, and as long as your case is still on direct appeal from the conviction, you can benefit from those changes in the law, which you cannot if you simply plead guilty without any concessions.\n\nLikewise, if you are innocent and the evidence is currently strongly against you, but you wish to preserve the ability to later attack the conviction based upon future newly discovered evidence, not pleading guilty is generally necessary to preserve that option.\n\nAnother circumstance where going to trial but losing can still be worth it, is where there are extenuating circumstances that make your conduct understandable, even if it is not a legally valid defense. Getting these facts in front of the judge in a fuller fashion, as a trial can make possible, can convince the judge that while you are legally guilty, that you deserve leniency.\n\nGoing to trial typically results in a longer sentence, even without a plea bargain, however, so going forward with a hopeless trial is rarely a good move."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is facing overwhelming evidence against them in a criminal trial, with no possibility of a plea deal or lesser sentence.

The relevant statute is [here](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186/Section15B). A security deposit must be deposited in a separate account (1e), a signed receipt must be given upon receipt of the deposit (2b), the deposit must go in an interest\\-bearing account with a receipt showing name and location of bank and account number provided within 30 days (3a), also note that \"Failure to comply with this paragraph shall entitle the tenant to immediate return of the security deposit\". Subsection 4 requires returning the deposit within 30 days (not \"waiting at least 30 days\", much less 30 *working* days), minus deductions for damage, specified under 4(iii) as damage *excluding* normal wear and tear (light bulbs burning out). This does not include cleaning. and \"No deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section\".\n\nSubsection 6 says:\n\n> The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the\n>  security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to\n>  recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the\n>  premises...\n\nand the conditions triggering that forfeiture include under (6a) failing to deposit the funds per (3\\), or (6c)\n\n> uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts\n>  with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such\n>  provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant\n>  a waiver of any provision of this section\n\nwhich may be the case here and (6e)\n\n> fails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof\n>  to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in\n>  accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any\n>  interest thereon, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy.\n\n(\"within\" means \"after N days or less\"). \n\nSubsection 7 states that \n\n> If the lessor or his agent fails to comply with clauses (a), (d), or\n>  (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount\n>  equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance\n>  thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of\n>  five per cent from the date when such payment became due, together\n>  with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nAnd subsection (8\\) statutorily states DaleM's point about contract terms not being above the law:\n\n> Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this\n>  section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any\n>  provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy\n>  and therefore void and unenforceable.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the Massachusetts courts interpret this as being an automatic severability clause.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nSecurity deposit law in Massachussets seems to be one of those cases where professional legal advice is virtually mandatory. Subsection 3a says\n\n> Any security deposit received by such lessor shall be held in a\n>  *separate*, interest\\-bearing account in a bank, located within the\n>  commonwealth *under such terms as will place such deposit beyond the\n>  claim of creditors of the lessor*, including a foreclosing mortgagee or\n>  trustee in bankruptcy, and *as will provide for its transfer to a\n>  subsequent owner of said property*\n\nAn attorney would be typically required to understand what the italicized portions mean. A reasonable interpretation would be that you have to set up an escrow bank account on behalf of the tenant. To do that, though, the tenant must cooperate to some extent (providing a Social Security number, providing acceptable ID). There is no law requiring a tenant to cooperate, which apparently puts the landlord in a legal bind.\n\nThe trick is that the statute has been interpreted \"functionally\" in [Karaa v. Kim 86 Mass. App. Ct. 714](http://masscases.com/cases/app/86/86massappct714.html) citing [Neihaus v. Maxwell 54 Mass. App. Ct. 558](http://masscases.com/cases/app/54/54massappct558.html) as simply meaning that the landlord cannot deposit the security money into their own personal bank account. In Neihaus, the landlord handed the problem over to a property management company, which had in place suitable accounting procedures so that the desiderata of being beyond the claim of creditors, being in a bank in the commonwealth, and being separate, were satisfied. In the case of Karaa, the tenants did not ever supply a Social Security number: the court ruled that the tenants action did not excuse violation of the statute, stating \"The failure of the tenants to provide a Social Security number did not preclude the Karaas from establishing a separate account in compliance with \u00a7 15B(3\\)(a)\".

The deposit must be returned within 30 days, not 45 business days.\n3. Deductions for cleaning and replacing light bulbs (normal wear and tear) are not permitted.\n\nAccording to subsection 6 of the law, including provisions that conflict with the statute and attempting to enforce them can result in the landlord forfeiting the right to retain any portion of the security deposit.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Clinic A is legally obligated to turn away all former clients of Clinic B to avoid violating Dr. X's non-compete agreement.\n\nB) The non-compete agreement between Dr. X and Clinic B is automatically binding on Clinic A, preventing them from accepting any of Clinic B's former clients.\n\nC) Clinic B's action of telling the client not to visit Clinic A may be considered acting in bad faith and could potentially be grounds for damages.\n\nD) Dr. X's non-compete agreement allows Clinic B to legally prevent their former clients from seeking services at any competing clinic, regardless of which veterinarian they see.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because Clinic A has not entered into any contract with Clinic B, and the non-compete agreement is between Dr. X and Clinic B only. Clinic B telling their client not to visit Clinic A could be seen as interfering with Clinic A's business operations without proper legal grounds, potentially acting in bad faith. This action could potentially lead to damages if Clinic A decides to pursue legal action.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because Clinic A is not bound by Dr. X's non-compete agreement with Clinic B and is not obligated to turn away Clinic B's former clients. Option D is incorrect because non-compete agreements typically cannot prevent clients from freely choosing their service providers, especially if they're seeing a different doctor at the new clinic."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23977/can-i-make-a-privacy-policy-on-my-own-for-free", "docs_id": 23977, "title": "Can I make a privacy policy on my own for free?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the Problem that I want to start a web application which has access to the users files on dropbox and co.

[Click wrap (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_wrap) user agreements are legally binding in many jurisdictions.\n\nEven if you don't access files and information \\- such as personal information or files \\- you still need a clear TOS for your App, for both your users' and your own legal protection.\n\n> But I am a poor student who don't want invest money into a lawyer to\n>  write me a privacy policy ... I do not plan to get paid for (this\n>  app)...\n\nBeing a free or paid App doesn't make a difference when it comes to the TOS, if you need one, and if you need to pay for one to be drafted.\n\nBut not investing money in a lawyer can be a critical mistake if your App will be distributed on the popular App directories like Google Play and iTunes and your TOS does not clearly and legally outline all possible usage and data polices. Lawyers have experience in covering all the bases.\n\n> Is there any way I can do this privacy policy on my own?\n\nSure, you can: [https://www.google.com/search?q\\=privacy\\+policy\\+generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=privacy+policy+generator) But you run considerable legal liability not having a TOS that correctly and legally addresses all users' privacy concerns and clearly outlines what you do to insure security.

Like *how long do you save data? When will you delete it? How secure is it? Can the user ask for deletion? What happens if you get hacked? What about users in countries other than the US? Users under 18 years old? You must use arbitration for any disputes?* And on and on.\n\nThe considerable legal liability of using a non\\-professionally drafted TOS means you run the risk of getting sued.

Which of the following approaches regarding the privacy policy and terms of service (TOS) is most appropriate and legally sound?\n\nA) Create a simple \"I save all your data\" policy to cover all bases without detailing specific data usage.\n\nB) Use a free online privacy policy generator to create a basic TOS without legal consultation.\n\nC) Forego a privacy policy altogether since the app is not intended to generate profit.\n\nD) Invest in professional legal assistance to draft a comprehensive privacy policy and TOS that addresses all potential scenarios and liabilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While options A, B, and C may seem attractive to a student with limited resources, they all carry significant legal risks. Option A is overly broad and fails to address specific concerns users may have about data usage and security. Option B, using a generic online generator, may miss crucial legal points specific to the app's functionality. Option C ignores the legal necessity of having a privacy policy, regardless of the app's profit status.\n\nOption D, though potentially costly, is the most appropriate and legally sound approach. A professionally drafted TOS and privacy policy will comprehensively address important issues such as data storage duration, deletion policies, security measures, user rights, jurisdictional considerations, and dispute resolution procedures. This approach minimizes legal liability and provides clear protection for both the developer and users, which is crucial when dealing with sensitive user data from services like Dropbox."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50269/can-i-claim-if-customs-open-damage-my-parcel-even-though-contents-clearly-labe", "docs_id": 50269, "title": "Can I claim if Customs open &amp; damage my parcel even though contents clearly labelled &amp; nothing was found", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A model train was sent from Canada to UK \\& clearly marked.

This law was in effect well before Ted Cruz's birth in 1970. Therefore, Ted Cruz would have been considered a U.S. citizen at birth due to his mother's U.S. citizenship, despite his father being a Canadian citizen. The Salon article's reference to a 1961 Supreme Court ruling was actually interpreting the law as it stood in 1906, not the law in effect in 1970. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the law as of 1970.
