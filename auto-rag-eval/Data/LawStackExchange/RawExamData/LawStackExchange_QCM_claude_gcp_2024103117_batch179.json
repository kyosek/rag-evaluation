Specifically whether it is \"features\" or \"code\" or something else that is usually copyrighted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Video game copyrights are really not significantly different from book or movie copyrights. One of the most basic principles of copyright is that one cannot copyright an idea only the words and images used to express an idea. The question quotes 17 USC 102(b) which is the US law establishing this distinction. A Similar plot point or device is not a copyright infringement. Such common tropes as \"budding romance obstructed by differing values\" is not protected by copyright. Neither, I would think is this device of auto\\-generated characters in a video game.\n\nOne cannot lawfully copy or closely imitate the actual words or images or sounds in someone else's protected work (without permission). That is the essence of copyright. (There are limited exceptions such as fair use / fair dealing.)\n\nWhat complicates this and confuses many is the concept of a *derivative work*. When a character or setting is described in significant detail, a detailed, point\\-by\\-point imitation of that setting may be enough to make the newer work \"based on\" the older work, and thus a derivative work. Unauthorized sequels are often held to be derivative works, for example, or unauthorized \"guest appearances\" in which a well\\-know or clearly established character from one work is used in another. If a modern detective goes into partnership with Sam Spade, say, or if Spiderman should be an important supporting character in a newly written novel. Similarly a new fantasy set in Tolkien's Middle\\-Earth or a new comic in Gotham City would probably be derivative.\n\nOne of the things protected by copyright is the right to create or authorize derivative works, and courts have held that use of a distinctive character an make a work derivative. But for this to apply the character must be distinctive and recognizable. A general type, such as a detective or superhero (or a large city) is not enough; there must be sufficient imitation to make it clearly the use of a character or setting from a copyrighted work, with a detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity would be needed.\n\nA game feature such as this \"mercenaries\" concept would not make another work using it a derivative work, or at least I don't think it would. But ultimately such decisions are made by a court when and if a copyright holder sues an alleged infringer. Whether a work is derivative or not is a very fact\\-based decision, and so the exact specifics of the case may well matter.\n\nIf one is considering imitating some general feature of a previous work, it may be wise to consult a lawyer with IP expertise.

In video games, this means that while the exact code, artwork, or specific implementation of a feature may be protected, the general concept or game mechanic is not. The \"mercenaries\" feature in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, while similar to Shadow of Mordor's \"nemesis\" system, is not necessarily a copyright infringement because it's implementing a similar concept rather than copying specific code or assets. This aligns with the principle stated in 17 USC 102(b) that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, or methods of operation. Game companies can legally implement similar features as long as they create their own unique expression of the idea."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2242/why-is-it-possible-to-sue-non-original-distributers-of-pirated-items", "docs_id": 2242, "title": "Why is it possible to sue non-original distributers of Pirated items?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I apologise in advance if this is a silly question.\n\nLet's say you have a person A who bought a song from an online service, and is distributing it without permission.

No name, no birthdate, no address info), but this leaves me with very little to work with in the event of scenarios a) and b) occurring.\n\nI have read the question, [Identity verification prior granting access to personal data \\[GDPR]](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45012/identity-verification-prior-granting-access-to-personal-data-gdpr) , but I take issue with the GDPR reference in the answer, where it states:\n\n> Per Recital 64, you should use \u201call reasonable measures\u201d to verify the identity of the data subject who requests access. However, you should not keep data for the sole purpose of being able to respond to requests. (Compare also the data minimization principle and Art 11\\).\n\nI have problems with this statement because if I don't store the name of my user, how can I possibly ever verify that it is the owner of the data who is requesting either i) erasure, or ii) portability of data? The only way I could possibly envision this is by only offering the option to logged in users, but surely there must be an offline option as well, for users who no longer have access to the system?\n\nSo, what is the minimum gathered user details that I would need in order to satisfy a) and b) whilst still meeting GDPR?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is less of a compliance question, and more of an infosec question. On one hand, you want to be able to restore access to an account to users who have lost their access. On the other hand, you must prevent unauthorized access e.g. from hackers. These factors must be balanced.\n\nWhether you'll fulfil a data subject access request will generally follow the same criteria as deciding whether you'll reset someone's access credentials, so I'll mostly discuss identity verification in general.\n\nTrying to validate names is generally pointless from a security perspective, since the name on the account might not be real, or because validation documents like scans from a passport can be easily forged. When a service has identity validation measures like requesting a copy of photo ID, or requesting a photo of you holding up a validation code written on paper, that doesn't actually help validating that the person requesting access *is* the account owner, but that the person requesting access *appears* to be a natural person, and now documents about their identity are on file.\n\nA lot of information like names, birthdates, or addresses is also not at all secret and could be easily guessed by a malicious actor.\n\nMost websites work by equating access with control over an email account. If you can receive a password reset code over email, you have access. In effect, this delegates the responsibility of account recovery to the email or OAuth provider.\n\nSo the issue is what happens when someone loses their email account, which is not entirely uncommon for accounts that are multiple years old.\n\nOne reasonable (and likely GDPR\\-compliant solution) is to deny access when someone loses their account. Quite a lot of services operate this way.\n\nA milder form of this is to email the old address that someone is trying to take over the account, and turn over the account only if you have other evidence of ownership *and* there has been no reply over multiple weeks. Since this is part of an identity verification measure, I don't think the GDPR's normal 1 month deadline would apply. However, this approach is very risky: an attack can succeed through the mere *inaction* of the true account holder, and it would arguably be a data breach if you give access to the wrong person \u2013 safer for erasure requests only. Also, emails like \u201cclick here or we'll delete your account\u201d look a lot like spam (I get a lot of those about alleged problems with my Paypal account).\n\nA potentially more reasonable approach is to use questions about the account to verify ownership. When did they create the account? When did they last use it? Can they answer questions about non\\-public content of the account? (But don't let an attacker choose the questions!)\n\nYou see some older sites that ask the user to select a \u201csecurity question\u201d for recovery purposes. But this isn't a best practice \u2013 they are frequently the *weakest link* in an authentication system. If the user answers truthfully, the answer may be easy to guess or discover for an attacker. E.g. the infamous \u201cwhat is your mother's maiden name\u201d question is horrendously insecure in the age of Facebook. If the user provides a more secure answer, that is essentially just another password that's even easier to lose than an email account.\n\nHigh\\-value accounts typically offer a secondary authentication method as a fallback. E.g. my bank can send me new access codes via physical mail. GitHub can optionally link a Facebook account for recovery purposes. But these measures would be overkill for most cases. Especially collecting a physical address for the sole purpose of offering account recovery would likely violate the GDPR's data minimization principle, though it may be fine when the user opts in with freely given consent.\n\n**To summarize:** what you're trying to do is extremely difficult, because you've need to balance different security aspects: keeping malicious actors out, and letting legitimate account owners in. Whereas I'd resolve that by *denying* any account recovery or subject access requests, other approaches exists with other risk profiles.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to be both GDPR-compliant and reasonably secure for verifying user identity in case of account lockouts or data requests?\n\nA) Collecting and storing extensive personal information like full name, birth date, and physical address for all users\nB) Using security questions chosen by the user during account creation, such as \"What is your mother's maiden name?\"\nC) Implementing a system where account recovery is primarily based on access to the registered email account, with limited additional verification for special cases\nD) Requiring all users to link their account to a social media profile for identity verification purposes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most balanced approach that aligns with both GDPR principles and security best practices. Using email as the primary method for account recovery is common and generally secure, as it delegates the responsibility to the email provider. It also doesn't require storing excessive personal data, adhering to GDPR's data minimization principle. The \"limited additional verification for special cases\" allows for some flexibility in handling more complex situations without compromising overall security or privacy.\n\nOption A violates GDPR's data minimization principle by collecting more data than necessary. Option B relies on security questions, which are often considered a weak link in authentication systems and can be easily guessed or discovered by attackers.

Joe says nothing under questioning. At trial, Joe's defense is that at the time of the robbery, he was in Sheffield drinking beer with his brother.\n\nOn the basis of common sense, a jury could think: \"Surely if Joe were really innocent, he would have told the police of his alibi at the time he was questioned, and saved himself a lot of trouble.

Yes, that does seem more plausible.

The clause is primarily intended to warn suspects that if they have a legitimate alibi or other information that could help their case, not mentioning it during questioning could harm their defense later in court. This is not meant to force confession or intimidate innocent people, but rather to prevent situations where a suspect's silence inadvertently makes them appear less credible when they present their defense at trial.

Jury nullification, while potentially influential in inspiring similar actions by other juries, does not establish enforceable legal precedent in the way that case law does. Juries are tasked with finding facts, not interpreting law, and their decisions do not officially report legal interpretations. Therefore, jury nullification cannot set binding legal precedent (eliminating option A). Juries do not provide legal interpretations that influence future judicial rulings in an official capacity (ruling out option B). Finally, an acquittal through jury nullification at a higher court does not automatically overturn verdicts in similar cases at lower courts, as each case is treated individually (invalidating option D).

The swearing out of a complaint or rebutting evidence in all Federal civil matters (some states allow for the same) must contain an affidavit or an \"unsworn declaration\" that swears out the facts to be true and accurate, even though not notarized, and is based on fact and not supposition. It is subject to the same penalties of perjury if one lies as if you swear on a bible and testify in court or on a \"sworn\" affidavit. Affidavits need not be sworn before God, or on a bible. You have a right to just \"affirm\" that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth....and not \"so help me God\". Many courts don't use a bible at all anymore. \n\n28 U.S.C. 1746 relates to these \"Unsworn Declarations Under Penalty Of Perjury\"\n\nIt is not b/c you don't believe in God that you'd use this...you always have the option of swearing out even a declared affidavit or testifying without swearing on a bible if you're an atheist. They just leave out the \"before God\" part.\n\nAffidavits are the norm, however, in Federal Courts that have an expedited docket this is typically used when it could take a while to get a notary and the evidence is due. (In some states lawyers are automatically notaries but in others they aren't). The ability to swear out a complaint or contest a deposition without having to wait on a notary can be the difference between making your deadline or not. It's commonly used when records custodians are called to certify the authenticity of documents produced pursuant to subpoena or other formal request. Under F.R.Civ.P 56 declarations usually are not within the type of evidentiary categories that can be used at the summary judgment phase. \n\nIf it's a small misstatement you would probably be faced with a fine. If it's a total lie, outright, you'd be looking at jail time (say a records custodian removed evidence and swore out it was the complete business record in a fraud case). 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1621 discusses perjury generally (in federal actions).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a federal civil case, a document is filed with the following statement: \"I, [name], declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71746, that the following is true and correct:\" What is the primary purpose of including this statement?\n\nA) To invoke divine punishment for lying\nB) To replace the need for a notary public\nC) To allow only atheists to file documents\nD) To expedite the court's docket processing\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary purpose of including this statement is to replace the need for a notary public. This \"unsworn declaration\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71746 allows individuals to submit statements with the same legal weight as a sworn affidavit, without the need for notarization. It's particularly useful in federal courts with expedited dockets, where waiting for a notary could cause missed deadlines. The declaration carries the same penalties for perjury as a sworn statement, making it a legally binding alternative to traditional notarized affidavits. This method is not specifically for atheists (option C is incorrect), doesn't involve divine punishment (A is incorrect), and while it can help expedite processes, that's not its primary purpose (D is incorrect)."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57502/does-a-dual-citizen-who-changes-their-name-in-one-country-have-an-obligation-to", "docs_id": 57502, "title": "Does a dual citizen who changes their name in one country have an obligation to change it in the other?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am asking specifically with regard to the USA and Australia, although I am interested in more general answers also.\n\nAs per the title, I am wondering if someone immigrates (in this case to the US) and changes their name (an option granted when obtaining citizenship), do they have an obligation to change it in other countries they may be a citizen of?\n\nMy thinking is no, as each country has their own courts and records, and as long as all names are declared and there is no malicious intent, no laws are being violated, but I am unsure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nBoth your country of origin and your new home country will only care of your name as in the documents issued by each of them respectively.\n\nMind though that absence of obligation to synchronize your names does not mean that you can freely use both identities within one country.

V and [here](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdard/MI_Modified_2009_Food_Code_396675_7.pdf). The primary focus of those health codes is preventing the introduction of toxic substances or pathogens. There is obviously no law against serving meat, nor is there any law against half\\-and\\-half pizza. The only possible prospect for a health law addressing your interest would be via the allergy avenue (yes, you do not allege to be allergic to anything \u2013 my point is that even if you did, this would not help your cause). There are some provisions regarding training and informing when it comes to \"major food allergens\", which however is defined as\n\n> Milk, EGG, FISH (such as bass, flounder, cod, and including crustacean\n>  shellfish such as crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (such as\n>  almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans\n\nor proteins derived from the above. Note that mammal meat is not included (it may be an individual allergen, but it is not a statutory major food allergen).\n\nEven if you wanted to sue, you would have a very hard time establishing that you were damaged. First you would have to establish that they have a legal obligation to serve you \"vegetarian food\" (crucially undefined). You might be able to establish that they made such a promise.

According to the documentation, there are no specific health code violations for serving vegetarian and meat options on the same platter. The health codes primarily focus on preventing toxic substances and pathogens. Meat is not classified as a major food allergen under Michigan law. The student would have difficulty establishing damages in a lawsuit, as there is no legal obligation for the dining hall to serve strictly vegetarian food.

There may also be a requirement that the crime occurred in the citizen's presence, or that the citizen was unable to contact the police instead.\n\nIs evidence obtained by a vigilante admissible?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the United States, the constitutional [**exclusionary rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule) generally prevents evidence from being admitted if the government obtained it illegally. [I answered a general question about the scope of the exclusionary rule here.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17851/how-far-does-the-fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree-doctrine-extend/19507) However, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by a private individual: *Burdeau v. McDowell*, [256 U.S. 465](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/256/465/case.html) (1921\\).\n\nIn *Burdeau*, the defendant's papers had been stolen and turned over to the government, which proposed to present them as evidence to a grand jury. The Supreme Court said:\n\n> In the present case, the record clearly shows that no official of the federal government had anything to do with the wrongful seizure of the petitioner's property ... there was no invasion of the security afforded by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure, as whatever wrong was done was the act of individuals in taking the property of another ... We assume that petitioner has an unquestionable right of redress against those who illegally and wrongfully took his private property under the circumstances herein disclosed, but with such remedies we are not now concerned.\n\nHowever, the exclusionary rule in some states goes beyond the Fourth Amendment. For example, [article 38\\.23 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure](http://codes.findlaw.com/tx/code-of-criminal-procedure/crim-ptx-crim-pro-art-38-23.html) provides that evidence illegally obtained 'by an officer *or other person*' is inadmissible. This provision was apparently enacted to deter vigilantes: Bubany and Cockerell, '[Excluding Criminal Evidence Texas\\-Style: Can Private Searches Poison the Fruit?](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/10601/1554/12TexTechLRev611.pdf)' 12 *Texas Tech Law Review* 611 (1981\\), p 625\\.\n\nCan such evidence be admitted even if the vigilante is not present?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that no exclusionary rule applies, evidence obtained by a vigilante can potentially be admitted through the testimony of a police officer or other witness, subject to the rule against [**hearsay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay) and the question of reliability.\n\nThe rule against hearsay means that a police officer cannot give evidence that a vigilante told them that the accused was guilty. Evidence of this kind is not admissible because the accused has no opportunity to challenge the reliability of the source of the information in cross\\-examination.\n\nThe rule against hearsay does not apply when the probative value of the evidence does not depend on the truth of the absent vigilante's assertion. If the evidence provided by the vigilante is really 'damning' then it might fall into this category. For example, a vigilante might provide the police with a weapon that has the accused and victim's DNA on it, or tell the police that incriminating evidence can be found at a particular location.\n\nA police officer can then give evidence that the weapon was tested and found to have matching DNA, or a search warrant was executed and the incriminating evidence was found. There is no admissibility issue here. However, the fact that the police were tipped off by a vigilante who has broken the law and is not present to face court may cause the jury to reject the evidence as unreliable (ie. it could have been planted).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A vigilante captures a suspected drug dealer and turns them over to the police along with video evidence of the dealer selling drugs. The vigilante obtained this evidence by secretly installing cameras in the dealer's apartment without their knowledge or consent. In a U.S. federal court, how would this evidence likely be treated?\n\nA) The evidence would be automatically inadmissible due to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule.\nB) The evidence would be admissible, but the vigilante must testify in court for it to be considered.\nC) The evidence would likely be admissible, but its reliability may be questioned by the jury.\nD) The evidence would only be admissible if the vigilante had performed a legal citizen's arrest.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Burdeau v. McDowell case, the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by private individuals. Therefore, the evidence would likely be admissible in a federal court, even though the vigilante obtained it illegally. However, the fact that a vigilante who broke the law to obtain the evidence is not present in court may cause the jury to question the reliability of the evidence. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the exclusionary rule applies to government actions, not private individuals. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the evidence can potentially be admitted through police testimony without the vigilante present, subject to hearsay rules. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the admissibility of the evidence is not dependent on whether the citizen's arrest was legal, but rather on who obtained the evidence (private individual vs. government agent)."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77642/litigating-personal-injury-in-germany-due-to-lack-of-proper-testing", "docs_id": 77642, "title": "Litigating personal injury in Germany due to lack of proper testing", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read various articles that litigating for damages due to injury against medical professionals or clinics is an uphill battle.

The presence of a clearly visible sign that outlines the consequences of unauthorized parking creates a de facto contract between the property owner and anyone who chooses to park there. This sign communicates the terms (towing and fee) that a parker agrees to by leaving their vehicle in that spot.

When Matthew obtains a patent on his algorithm, then nobody else is allowed to use that algorithm without Matthew's permission until the patent expired.\n\nThe problem, though, is that many jurisdictions do not recognize patents on software algorithms (the European Union, for example).

Patents prevent others from using the patented method without permission, even if they independently develop a similar solution.\n\nCopyright only protects the specific expression or implementation of an idea, not the idea itself.

Once the algorithm is published or becomes known, trade secret protection is lost. Patents, on the other hand, provide protection even after the method is disclosed.\n\nIt's important to note that software and algorithm patents are not recognized in all jurisdictions.

Or is this immunity waived by the federal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes and No. The Federal U.S. Government as well as each individual state and territory claim Soverign Immunity to a limited degree. In the case of Federal Government, they claim Soverign Immunity to a near limitless degree (more on this in a moment), while States and Territories claim \"State Soverign Immunity\" which grants them immunity with respect to all soverign powers granted under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo clarify, each U.S. State is seperately soverign in all matters not explicitly allocated to the Federal Government by the U.S. Constitution and all constitutionally written laws. Where the Constitution does not in writing claim a power for the federal government nor reserver a power for the state government, the power is assumed to be state government. So a State can claim immunity for a police situation but not a law it makes regarding immigration or foriegn policy, since that is the exclusive wheelhouse of the Feds. Per the 11th amendment, states can only be sued in state court by citizens of the state, while non\\-state citizens wishing to sue a state must sue in the Federal Court (Which for the purposes of the trial may adopt the defendant State's laws and regulations for the purposes of questions of fact and law brought up in the suit).\n\nAll U.S. States and the Federal Goverment additionally wave Soverign Immunity under specific conditions outlined in laws. In the case of the Federal Government, the laws governing when this immunity is waived are governed by the [Federal Torts Claims Act (1946\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act) and the [Tucker Act (1887\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Act). The FTCA covers intentional torts by the Federal Government, while the Tucker Act typically covers matters related to contractual obligations or monitary interactions with the federal government. Things that may be sued for include but are not limited too:\n\n* Intentional Torts committed by Government Agents in their Official Capacity (i.e. When the FBI violates your rights or maliciously investigates you).\n* Contractual disputes where the Government is a party to the Contract, either in written or implied terms.\n* Constitutional Claims (i.e. The Government may have violated the Constitution. These tend to be for non\\-monitary relief such as mandemuses, though the 5th Amendment's Taking Clause can be invoked of the government took property and does not justly compensate.).\n* Individual Agencies of the Government when the monitary claim is not drawn from the U.S. Treasury (the agencies own allocated budget is used to pay).\n* Refund for taxes paid\n\nIn all cases, a Judge will determin if the Government, under the laws, can be sued. If in the example of a government employee being sued, the Justice Department will first make a determination if the employee was acting as an agent of the government when they committed the tortious act, and then will declare themselves *Respondent Superior* through the agency of employement. From there, the case becomes a suit against the Federal Government and FTCA immunity waiver is determined by a Judge.\n\nFor example, lets say you (Mr. Rapt) sue Special Agent Jimmy Jones of an intentional tort that he committed in the course of his duty as an FBI agent. The DOJ will first declare that they are *Respondent Superior* in the case of Rapt v. Jones, thus turning the case to Rapt v. United States Government, Department of Justice, Federal Beura of Investigations, and Jones (Rapt v. United States, et. al.). From here, the Judge who gets the case then determins if the U.S. Government under FTCA can be sued by Rapt, based on Rapt's citizenship status (usually permanent legal residents are covered as citizens for this point, but I can say for certain in this particular law), ripeness (the suit must be filed within 2 years of the incident or first knowledge), and immunity waiver under FTCA.\n\nIn the case of the State Government, they should have similar laws, but I'm not going to identify all 50 individual laws here. Additionally, the 11th Amendment permits U.S. Congress to waive a State's immunity to suit in certain cases (mostly comes up with the Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment.).\n\nAs a fun point, in all cases where a government appears as a defendant in a suit, it is automatically a Bench Trial, as the government usually include a waiver of their right as defendant to a jury trial. The thinking here is that, as a country that was founded by rebelling against the government, a jury of 12 of the government's citizens aren't going to give them any slack at trial, where as a judge (who they pay) is much more likely.\n\nTL;DR: Both questions are yes. The immunity is waived under federal law for certain cases, but it is a judge who will make the ruling if the specific case meets the aformentioned waived immunity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a U.S. citizen is suing the federal government for an intentional tort committed by an FBI agent, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding sovereign immunity and the legal process?\n\nA) The case will automatically be dismissed due to sovereign immunity, as the federal government cannot be sued under any circumstances.\n\nB) The case will proceed directly to trial, as the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) automatically waives sovereign immunity for all intentional torts committed by federal agents.\n\nC) The Department of Justice will first determine if the FBI agent was acting within their official capacity, and if so, will declare themselves respondeat superior, transforming the case into a suit against the federal government. A judge will then determine if immunity is waived under the FTCA.\n\nD) The case will be heard by a jury, who will decide whether sovereign immunity applies based on the specific circumstances of the tort committed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate description of the process. When a federal agent is sued for an intentional tort committed in the course of their duties, the Department of Justice first evaluates whether the agent was acting within their official capacity. If so, they declare themselves respondeat superior, effectively making the case against the federal government rather than the individual agent. The case then becomes subject to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), under which a judge, not a jury, determines whether sovereign immunity is waived for that particular case. This process ensures that while the government maintains sovereign immunity in general, there are specific circumstances under which it can be sued, as outlined in the FTCA. Options A and B are incorrect as they present extreme positions that don't reflect the nuanced reality of sovereign immunity waivers. Option D is incorrect because in cases where the government is a defendant, it's automatically a bench trial, not a jury trial."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37712/can-an-insurance-company-drop-you-after-receiving-a-bill-and-refusing-to-pay", "docs_id": 37712, "title": "Can an insurance company drop you after receiving a bill and refusing to pay?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In June of 2018, I had a dental procedure done that ended with a total cost of about $1400\\.\n\nAt the time, I was under my parents dental insurance.

The insurance company later dropped the patient and refused to pay, stating the patient was ineligible due to no longer being a full-time student. The dentist is now billing the patient for the full amount. What is the most accurate assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The insurance company is legally obligated to pay since the policy was active at the time of the procedure.\nB) The patient can refuse to acknowledge the debt as it should be the insurance company's responsibility.\nC) The patient is responsible for the full amount but should negotiate with the dentist for a reduced rate.\nD) The dentist office is at fault for not verifying the patient's eligibility before the procedure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the patient is ultimately responsible for the debt from the moment of service. The insurance company can legally refuse to pay if the policy terms were violated (in this case, the patient no longer being a full-time student). The patient cannot claim it's the insurance company's debt, as the debt belongs to the patient. The dentist office is not typically at fault for insurance verification issues.

The plaintiffs are suing everyone they think is even remotely related to the election, and a number of those defendants haven't responded to the summons.\n\nNormally, if a defendant fails to respond to a summons, the plaintiff can get a default judgement and the requested relief is granted. However, in this case, the core of that relief is:\n\n* Permanent injunctive relief in the form of a new federal election for Congress, President, and Vice President;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from ever holding public office or participating in any way in an election campaign to public office other than exercising their own right to vote;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from violating Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights described herein,\n\nMost of it looks like it's either outside the power of the court to grant, outside the power of the defendants to provide, or both.

It argues in essence:\n\n* A Texas federal court can't assert jurisdiction over Georgia defendants.\n* A federal court can't entertain claims against state officials in their official capacities for the kind of relief requested.\n* The plaintiffs lack standing to sue.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction defenses (and lack of personal jurisdiction defenses) are also not barred from being raised later in a motion to vacate the judgment, by a default judgment.\n\nThe Texas federal court can also sanction parties for filing frivolous claims by, for example, awarding all of the costs and attorney fees incurred by the defendants against the party bringing the suit in a motion requesting that relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 against the parties and/or their attorney.\n\nI would not be surprised if the Plaintiffs' attorney in this case, Paul M. Davis, was disbarred and bankrupted by it.\n\nClass action lawsuits can't proceed as such until certified by the court.\n\nFurthermore, a summons has to be personally hand delivered with a complaint to be served in a way that is sufficient to result in an entry of a default judgment, even if the complaint is otherwise valid. This is unlikely to have occurred in all 600\\+ cases.\n\nThere are several instances in which a \"clerk's default\" has been entered, but that simply indicates that a return of service (even if facially defective) was filed by the Plaintiff and that the number of days set forth in the summons for a response has lapsed.

In cases like this, where the complaint seeks relief that is beyond the court's power to grant or fails to state a valid legal claim, a federal court can dismiss the case sua sponte (on its own initiative) even without a motion from the defendants. The court must review the complaint for jurisdiction and valid claims before entering any default judgments. Given the nature of the relief sought in this case (e.g., ordering a new federal election, barring individuals from public office), it's likely that the court would find issues with subject matter jurisdiction and the validity of the claims.

When making this claim I had a naive expectation of the process as follows:\n\nA) Fill out a form online or in\\-person to sue the defendant, and be contacted to schedule a court date after turning that in.\n\nB) Arrive at court and win or lose the case.\n\nC) Have my winnings collected by the court and sent to me.\n\nC\\-alt) Receive a letter that it was appealed which includes a new court date.\n\nReturn to \\[B] for next level court...\n\n---\n\n**Reality**\n\nHowever, by following the advice provided by the few helpful members of the court staff I could find, I have instead followed this process:\n\n1\\) Fill out a form in person to file my small claims case with my local magistrate, which I understand is the first level court (similar to step \\[A]).\n\n2\\) Wait and receive a court date via mail (similar to step \\[A]).\n\n3\\) Call just before the date to see if the defendant declared an 'intent to defend' (I think it was called). When they didn't I did not need to show for court and received a 'default judgement'; in short I won (similar to step B above; and here's where it really diverges)\n\n4\\) Wait 30 days (the appeals period), and then I need to take action and contact the court get a notice of judgement (I think it was called) (part of \\[C]).\n\n5\\) Then I was told to go to the prothonotary (new word for me) and get a certification of judgement on file. Then I should take a copy of that an hour away to file it with the courthouse in the defendants county. My understanding that this doesn't actually do anything to help me collect my money; it's just part of the process (part of \\[C]).\n\n6\\) Then I need to get a writ of execution, which I believe is a court order for the defendant to pay me? I think this is supposed to help me collect my judgement, but I don't know what to do with that as I never made it to this stage (part of \\[C]).\n\n4\\-alt) Receive a notice of appeal from the county court (I guess this is the next level court, so part of \\[C\\-alt]). Something about a 'praecipe (another new word for me) to enter rule to file complaint and rule to file'. The defendant appealed so I followed this path.\n\n5\\-alt) Drive to the county prothonotary and file another form. There is no title but it appears to be a brand new complaint (part of \\[C\\-alt]?).\n\n6\\-alt) After giving that new form to the court, I was instructed to take a copy home and mail it to the defendant's address.

It's like telling a child to fill a pot with water, then put it on the stove, then turn on the stove, and so on without explaining that the purpose is to make spaghetti or explaining why and how the noodles get cooked.

And given the limits of small claims cases and low dollar values of many of the injustices us commoners face on a daily basis, in contrast to the high price of law advice, speaking with a lawyer would cost more than a win would provide and is thus an impractical option.\n\nA synopsis of the administrative steps taken as part of a small claims case would provide a lot of clarity and a solid foundation to launch from.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The process of collecting a judgment once you win one is really no different in small claims court than it is in any other court, and as you note, it isn't easy. You may decide that once you have won, that it is easier to turn the judgment over to a collection agency or an attorney to collect (admittedly at a price). \n\nOften, garnishment of wages and bank accounts is the easiest way to collect, although placing a judgment lien on their real property (which you probably did in step 5\\) works too if you are willing to wait until the property is sold.\n\nOf course, once there is an appeal, you are basically back to square zero and have to establish that the default judgment is valid and that they have no shown valid grounds for setting it aside (which they probably haven't), by following the proper appellate process.\n\nMany court houses and public libraries have books on the small claims process and on enforcing judgments (with books on the latter often entitled \"creditor's rights\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a small claims case in Pennsylvania, after winning a default judgment, what is typically the next step in the process to collect the judgment?\n\nA) Immediately receive payment from the court\nB) Wait 30 days and then contact the court for a notice of judgment\nC) File a new complaint with the county prothonotary\nD) Send a demand letter to the defendant\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: After winning a default judgment in a small claims case, the correct next step is to wait 30 days (which is the appeals period) and then contact the court to get a notice of judgment. This is described in step 4 of the \"Reality\" section in the original post. Option A is incorrect because courts do not automatically collect and distribute judgments.

[\u00a730 of the UK law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/30) seems to be what is relevant: usage requires \"sufficient acknowledgement\". It is not clear whether [\u00a733](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/education) on educational use is relevant (is this \"non\\-commercial\"; is this \"instruction\").\n\nSufficient acknowledgment relates to moral rights, covered in Ch. 4 of the law. \u00a72 says that moral rights\n\n> subsist in favour of the author, director or commissioner of the work,\n>  whether or not he is the owner of the copyright\n\nand [\u00a777](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/77) articulates this right to be identified as author or director. In that respect, to comply with the acknowledgement requirement, you would not acknowledge your local source (Netflix) or Channel 4\\. But the owner of moral rights must assert them per [\u00a7 78](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/78). You need to carefully read this chapter because there is also a moral right to not be falsely held to be an author, and a right to object to derogatory treatment.\n\nAs for whose law you have to care about, the possibilities are broad, because a work is probably protected under the laws of many nations. I might sue you under US law because my work is protected by US copyright law and that is convenient for me, but I might also sue you under UK law or Swedish law, depending on where you live or where you infringed copyright (took the screen shot; created the slide; displayed the slide; hosted the video).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A speaker is preparing a TEDx talk that references themes from the TV show Black Mirror.

These rights belong to the author, director, or commissioner of the work, regardless of who owns the copyright. The law requires acknowledging these individuals rather than the distributor (Netflix) or broadcaster (Channel 4). However, this is only necessary if the rights holder has asserted their moral rights under Section 78. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Netflix is just a distributor and not the original rights holder.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the effects of this Act?\n\nA) It completely abolished the distinction between common law and equity, both practically and intellectually.\n\nB) It allowed any court to award both common law and equitable remedies, but maintained the intellectual distinction between common law and equity.\n\nC) It merged the common law and equity courts, but required litigants to specify whether they were seeking common law or equitable remedies.\n\nD) It established that common law principles would prevail in cases of conflict between common law and equity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Judicature Act 1873 allowed any court to award both common law and equitable remedies, eliminating the practical distinction between common law and equity courts. However, it maintained the intellectual distinction between the two systems. The Act specifically stated that in cases of conflict, equitable principles would prevail over common law principles. Option A is incorrect because while the practical distinction disappeared, the intellectual distinction remained. Option C is incorrect because the Act removed the requirement for litigants to choose between common law and equity courts. Option D is incorrect because the Act actually established that equity, not common law, would prevail in cases of conflict."}}
