These are two core [ethical principles](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/news_pub_judicialconduct_Principles_en.pdf) set out by the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC). (However, the CJC is clear that these principles \"do not set out standards for defining judicial misconduct.\")\n\nDepending on what is leading the judge to such a high rate of appellate intervention, the underlying cause may warrant removal. The possible reasons that the CJC can recommend a judge to be removed are listed at [s. 65(2\\)(a) to (d) of the *Judges Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/j-1/page-10.html#h-337775):\n\n> Where, in the opinion of the Council, the judge in respect of whom an inquiry or investigation has been made has become incapacitated or disabled from the due execution of the office of judge by reason of\n> \n> \n> (a) age or infirmity,\n> \n> \n> (b) having been guilty of misconduct,\n> \n> \n> (c) having failed in the due execution of that office, or\n> \n> \n> (d) having been placed, by his or her conduct or otherwise, in a position incompatible with the due execution of that office,\n> \n> \n> the Council, in its report to the Minister under subsection (1\\), may recommend that the judge be removed from office.\n\nFor some examples where the CJC recommended removal of a judge, see:\n\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Paul Cosgrove (2009\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Report_to_Minister_Justice_Cosgrove.pdf) (in which the CJC declined to consider whether serious incompetence could be a ground for removal; instead basing the recommendation for removal on serious misconduct that was damaging to the administration of jusice and the public's confidence in the judiciary);\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Robin Camp (2017\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Camp_Docs/2017-03-08%20Report%20to%20Minister.pdf).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Judge Smith has been serving on the bench for 15 years in Canada. Recently, it was discovered that 95% of her rulings have been overturned on appeal in the last 5 years. The Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) is reviewing her case. Which of the following is the MOST likely outcome of this review, assuming no other factors are at play?\n\nA) The CJC will immediately remove Judge Smith from her position due to the high overturn rate.\nB) The CJC will recommend Judge Smith's removal to the Minister of Justice based on failure in the due execution of office.\nC) The CJC will take no action, as the overturn rate alone is not grounds for removal.\nD) The CJC will issue a formal reprimand to Judge Smith but cannot recommend removal based solely on the overturn rate.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While a 95% overturn rate alone doesn't automatically lead to removal, it strongly suggests that Judge Smith may have \"failed in the due execution of that office\" as per section 65(2)(c) of the Judges Act. This high rate indicates a potential serious problem with the judge's performance of duties, which could warrant a recommendation for removal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the CJC doesn't have the power to directly remove judges; they can only recommend removal to the Minister of Justice.\n\nAnswer C is unlikely because while the overturn rate alone might not be grounds for removal, such an extremely high rate (95%) would almost certainly prompt further investigation and action.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the CJC can recommend removal if they find that the judge has failed in the due execution of their office, which this situation strongly suggests. The overturn rate isn't the sole factor, but it's indicative of a potentially serious issue that could lead to a removal recommendation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live at Vancouver, BC, Canada. My fiancee and I are contracting a so\\-called [low\\-cost tenant home insurance with Square One](https://www.squareoneinsurance.ca/tenant-insurance). We've started this insurance 2 years ago and have been paying 44\\.27 CAD per month.\n\nAt the moment we signed for this insurance, I specifically asked the insurer a few questions of whether potential damages I could think of would be covered. Among these potential damages I asked whether a red wine stain on the carpet would be covered. The answer was \"yes\".\n\nRecently, I accidentally touched my glass of red wine with my elbow while eating and made a red wine stain on my carpet! I contacted (by phone) the insurance and they answered by email afterward:\n\n> We regret to inform you that your policy does not cover the loss reported to us. More specifically, your policy does not insure loss or\n>  damage to property you rent, except for the unintentional damage to the premises or contents resulting from fire, explosion, water damage\n>  or smoke insured under this policy. We direct you to Section 7\\.3\\.1 (e) of your insurance policy for the specific wordings. As such, your claim\n>  file is now being closed\n\nI am not sure I fully understand what is included in the term \"premises\". \n\n* Am I supposed to be covered?\n* If yes, what should I do to force Square One to respect our contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume this is the landlord's carpet. Your insurance covers damage caused by fire, explosion, water damage or smoke. The \"premise\" is the place you're renting, and some examples of content that you are renting would be whatever furnishing came with the place, carpets, and curtains. By the written contract (based on their email summary), you are not covered for damage to rented carpeting owing to wine spillage. However, to be certain, you should look for the relevant portion of the contract to see if the language of the contract matches their conclusion about non\\-coverage. There is a tiny chance that the wording is actually ambiguous and they interpret the wording in a way favorable to them, but to make any progress if that is the case, you'd have to sue them, and hope that the court rules in your favor. \n\nOral amendments to contracts are sort of possible, but I think there is no chance that they would agree to your contention claim that that you have an oral modification of the contract. You would need to prove exactly what you asked and how they responded (something better than fervently maintaining that you asked X and they said Y because *nobody* actually remembers conversations verbatim from 2 years ago). Contracts usually have clauses saying that \"this contract is the whole contract\", explicitly denying that there can be oral amendments. This is a general rule for contracts in Canada: see [Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Financial Corporation, 2000 ABCA 151 (CanLII)](http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2000/2000abca151/2000abca151.html)\n\n> When the deal is complete in the written contracts, and not subject to\n>  an escrow, other evidence (parol evidence) is inadmissible to vary or\n>  contradict a clear written contract: Chant v. Infinitum Growth Fund\n>  (1986\\) 1986 CanLII 2740 (ON CA), 15 O.A.C. 393, 55 O.R. (2d) 366,\n>  369\\-70 (C.A.); Case Threshing Machine Co. v. Mitten (1919\\) 59 S.C.R.\n>  118, 49 D.L.R. 30\\.

According to the insurance company's response, the policy only covers unintentional damage to the premises or contents resulting from fire, explosion, water damage, or smoke. The red wine stain does not fall under these categories. Furthermore, while the tenant claims to have asked about red wine stain coverage when purchasing the insurance, proving an oral modification to the contract would be extremely difficult. Canadian contract law generally follows the principle that when a deal is complete in written contracts, parol evidence (oral statements) is inadmissible to vary or contradict a clear written contract. Additionally, insurance contracts typically include clauses stating that the written contract is the entire agreement, explicitly denying the possibility of oral amendments. Therefore, despite the tenant's recollection of the conversation, it would be very challenging to enforce any verbal agreement that contradicts the written policy."

In child custody cases, judges make decisions based on the \"best interests of the child\" standard. This standard allows the judge to consider a wide range of factors, including parental mental health. A diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder would be one such factor, but it wouldn't automatically determine the outcome. The judge would consider how (if at all) the GAD impacts the parent's ability to care for the child, along with many other aspects of both parents' situations and abilities. There are very few categorical rules in custody decisions, so options A and B are incorrect as they suggest automatic outcomes. Option D is also incorrect because mental health diagnoses, including GAD, can be relevant to custody decisions and wouldn't be disregarded entirely."

Say they are lower than if a lawyer was hired.\n\nJurisdiction: any common law country.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In New Zealand, a successful litigant in person is entitled to recover disbursements but not costs. This rule can be traced back many centuries to passages in Sir Edward Coke\u2019s *The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England* (E and R Brooke, London, 1797\\). At page 288 he said:\n\n> Here is expresse mention made but of the costs of his writ, but it\n>  extendeth to all the legall cost of the suit, but not to the costs and\n>  expences of his travell and losse of time, and therefore *costages*\n>  commeth of the verb *conster*, and that againe of the verb *constare*, for\n>  these costages must *constare* to the court to be legall costs and\n>  expences.\n\nIn [*Lincoln v Police*](https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/88/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/d902e7f6-9784-4bd0-ae57-8eb24d5a63ce/d902e7f6-9784-4bd0-ae57-8eb24d5a63ce.pdf) Mr Lincoln, self\\-represented computer engineer who won the case, claimed 104 hours of his time spent on legal research and court proceedings at his usual rate $90 per hour.\n\nThe court held:\n\n> There is no rule permitting costs to be claimed by a lay litigant for\n>  his or her work in preparing for and presenting their case. This is\n>  consistent with the long\\-standing practice not to award costs to a\n>  litigant in person... ...because it is a rule of practice rather than\n>  a rule of law not to award costs to a litigant in person, there may be\n>  exceptions.

This is based on long-standing legal principles, as exemplified by the New Zealand case law provided. While there may be rare exceptions, such as cases of general public importance or instances where the litigant also serves as an expert witness, the standard practice is to limit recovery to actual expenses incurred. Option A is incorrect as courts typically don't award costs for a litigant's own time. Option C is too extreme, as disbursements are usually recoverable. Option D describes a possible exception but not the general rule. Therefore, B is the most accurate statement reflecting the typical approach in common law jurisdictions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm curious how royalties are handled for orchestral compositions (e.g. symphonies, concerti, quartets, etc.) in modern times (20th Century and later).\n\nFor example, [Dmitri Shostakovich's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich) compositions are presumably still under copyright in Western Europe and the USA, since it's been less than 75 years since his death, and all his compositions were published after January 1, 1923\\.\n\n(I'm picking Shostakovich in particular since I've grown fond of his symphonies, concerti, and other works in the past few years and have amassed a collection of CD's and digital downloads of many recordings and performances. His body of work would presumably fall under current copyright laws internationally, e.g. [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), etc. since all his compositions were published in the 20th Century.)\n\nFirst example:\n\n[Andr\u00e9 Previn](http://www.andre-previn.com/) conducts a studio performance of Shostakovich's [8th Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_%28Shostakovich%29) with the [London Symphony Orchestra](http://lso.co.uk/), recorded for EMI/Angel records. The record label [releases the album](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0013F46YW) for commercial sale.\n\n1. Does the composer receive any royalties from the sale of this recording?\n2. I'm assuming the record label collects mechanical royalties and profits from the sale of the album \\- do they usually give a flat fee or a percentage of sales (or both) to the orchestra?\n\nSecond example:\n\nThe [Pacific Arts Trio](http://www.overgrownpath.com/2006/03/good-night-and-good-luck-shostakovich.html) (also featuring Previn) stages a performance of Shostakovich's [Piano Trio, Op. 67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Trio_No._2_%28Shostakovich%29). This performance is presumably for a paying audience, of which the trio is expected to earn some performance royalties as a \"...life raft for the three of us.\"\n\n3. Does the composer receive any royalties from this particular performance? Or, from any contemporary public performance of his compositions still falling under copyright protection?\n4. If not from particular public performances, then is the composer's only source of royalties from publishing the written work (i.e. sheet music score)?\n\nPlease note that I'm using the present tense wherever I can here to inquire about how copyright protection and performance royalties work in the modern sense. I already have a *pretty* good idea (still unclear on some parts) how royalties work for contemporary popular rock/country/R\\&B music, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All that has changed is the identity of the copyright holder which has passed on to other(s) through the relevant laws for inheritance. This would be no different if the composer had sold their rights during their lifetime.\n\nJust like [this](http://qz.com/644048/paul-mccartneys-long-and-winding-road-to-reclaim-the-rights-to-his-beatles-songs/) only the other way around.\n\nMany countries have statutory royalty schemes for music where the composer *cannot* prohibit recordings or broadcasting of their works and is paid a fixed amount per performance/play/sale.\n\nTo be clear: barring other contractual arrangements (for example, members of an orchestra are usually employees of the orchestra and copyright material they create belongs to their employer), the composer has copyright in the music, the lyricist has copyright in the lyrics and the performer(s) (musicians, conductor, sound technicians etc.) have copyright in the performance.",

The recording is then sold commercially. Who is likely to receive royalties from the sale of this recording?\n\nA) Only Shostakovich's estate, as the original composer\nB) Only the orchestra and record label\nC) Shostakovich's estate, the orchestra, and the record label\nD) No one, as the music is now in the public domain\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while Shostakovich's estate would likely receive royalties as the copyright holder of the composition, they would not be the only beneficiary.\n\nB is incorrect because it excludes Shostakovich's estate, which would still hold the copyright to the composition.\n\nC is correct. Shostakovich's estate would receive royalties as the copyright holder of the composition (since it's been less than 75 years since his death). The orchestra would likely receive payment for their performance, either as a flat fee or a percentage of sales. The record label would collect mechanical royalties and profits from the sale of the album.\n\nD is incorrect because Shostakovich's works are not yet in the public domain. Copyright typically extends for 70 years after the death of the author in many countries, and Shostakovich died in 1975.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright duration, royalty distribution in classical music recordings, and the multiple parties involved in music copyright."

That is, you keep doing what the contract says you should do. Did you do that?\n\nIf you didn't keep making payments then you have broken the lease and the lien\\-holder can take whatever actions the contract and local law allow.\n\nIf the Texas\\-based person was the leaseholder then their actions are probably lawful.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The lessee was justified in withholding payments until receiving proof of contract transfer, and the repossession was illegal.\n\nB) The Texas company had no right to repossess the car without providing comprehensive documentation of the contract transfer.\n\nC) The lessee should have continued making payments as per the original contract terms, regardless of the claimed transfer, to avoid breaching the lease agreement.\n\nD) The original leasing company was obligated to inform the lessee about the contract transfer, and their failure to do so invalidates the transfer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to contract law, contracts are generally transferable without the need for agreement from all parties, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the contract. The lessee's obligation was to continue making payments as per the original contract terms, regardless of the claimed transfer. By withholding payments, the lessee likely breached the lease agreement, giving the lienholder (whether the original company or the Texas company) the right to repossess the vehicle according to the contract terms and local laws. While it's understandable to be cautious about paying an unknown party, the prudent action would have been to continue payments to the original company while seeking clarification, rather than stopping payments altogether."

Another way of wording this question is: would federally decriminalizing marijuana mean that state criminalization is contradictory?\n\nProstitution for example is not a crime or even illegal under federal law, though it is a crime in almost every state. Given this example, it seems like marijuana would remain illegal under state law (if applicable), though I'm not confident about my intuition here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If such a bill passes as written, it removes any federal criminal prohibitions against marijuana (assuming their research was sufficiently thorough), and raises marijuana to the same legal status as celery salt, which simply is not mentioned by federal criminal law. There would be no federal declaration that marijuana is now legal, and therefore, when federal law is silent, state law can say something. If silence at the federal level precluded state law on the topic, there could be not any state law \u2013 the Supremacy Clause only addresses *conflicts*. The bill could also be written to include a positive declaration that there shall be no laws against marijuana, and *that* would create a conflict with state law.\n\nOften, conflicts are avoided by crafting a jurisdictional difference, such as having laws that only apply while on federal property, or w.r.t. federal employees. The Constitution is structured to separate what the federal government can do versus what state governments can do, so that conflicts don't arise \u2013 however, the Commerce Clause ends up being used to expand federal power (e.g. the Controlled Substances Act). As Nate Eldredge comments, there is a huge difference between what is allowed under federal vs. (certain) state laws w.r.t. fireworks, and even town\\-to\\-town variations in fireworks laws. Numerous \"professional\" acts are completely legal w.r.t. federal law but are illegal at the state level. No federal law prohibits me from practicing as an attorney: it's state law that does that (likewise, being a cosmetologist or selling beer).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: If federal legislation is passed to remove marijuana from the list of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, which of the following statements would be most accurate regarding state-level marijuana laws?\n\nA) All state laws criminalizing marijuana would immediately become void due to the Supremacy Clause.\n\nB) States would be required to legalize marijuana to align with federal policy.\n\nC) States would retain the authority to criminalize marijuana under their own laws.\n\nD) The federal government would be obligated to enforce marijuana legalization in all states.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. If federal legislation removes marijuana from the list of controlled substances, it would essentially make federal law silent on the issue of marijuana criminalization, similar to how federal law is silent on many other substances or activities. This silence at the federal level does not create a conflict with state laws, nor does it compel states to change their laws.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause only addresses conflicts between federal and state laws, not federal silence. In this scenario, states would retain the authority to criminalize marijuana under their own laws, just as they do with many other activities that are not federally criminalized (such as prostitution in most states, or certain professional licensing requirements).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Supremacy Clause only invalidates state laws that conflict with federal law, not when federal law is silent. Option B is incorrect because federal decriminalization doesn't require states to legalize. Option D is incorrect because the federal government typically doesn't enforce state-level laws, and decriminalization at the federal level doesn't create an obligation to enforce legalization."

To summarize, they imply that they would be legally protected from civil suits from former members who are being disciplined. Would this actually work? My first thought is that it doesn't make sense that a person who leaves cannot revoke their consent, especially since this wasn't a binding contract of any sort.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Guinn v. Church of Christ](https://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/1989/10494.html), plaintiff withdrew from the church after an internal investigation of her conduct. The church apparently held as a matter of religious doctrine that she must repent of her sins, also that withdrawing from the church is doctrinally impossible. The transgressions were widely publicized within the church; a lawsuit over outrage and invasion of privacy ensued. The upshot of the appeal is that the church can be held liable for post\\-withdrawal actions, but before that, the church has a privilege to communicate such transgressions (the church is not subject to secular judicature of its actions w.r.t. its members).\n\nContract law is not relevant here, what matters is that a person can knowingly and intelligently waive their right to litigate against a party, and while one is a member of the church which has such a waiver as part of their disciplinary doctrine, one cannot sue the church for its doctrinary actions as long as the actions do not constitute a threat to public safety which would justify state interference. Although the church argued that church membership is irrevocable, the court found that \"Just as freedom to worship is protected by the First Amendment, so also is the liberty to recede from one's religious allegiance\". Given that plaintiff had withdrawn consent yet the church subsequently announced the transgressions without her consent, the church was thus found to be liable.\n\nIn [Stepek v. Doe](https://casetext.com/case/stepek-v-doe), the court similarly affirmed that a church enjoys a privilege against charges of defamation, when the plaintiff continues to operate within the church, not having left the church.\n\nSo it can \"work\", to some extent. The person can always withdraw consent; the person has no legal recourse in case consent has not been withdrawn. The article is correct as far as it goes, which is not far enough: it errs in not stating what the legal consequences of of the transgressor leaving the church are.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the church's legal position?\n\nA) The church can legally announce John's transgression because he signed a consent form when joining, which cannot be revoked.\n\nB) The church cannot legally announce John's transgression under any circumstances, as it would be a violation of privacy.\n\nC) The church can legally announce John's transgression only if it does so before John officially leaves the church.\n\nD) The church can legally announce John's transgression at any time, as religious organizations are exempt from privacy laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the case law presented, particularly Guinn v. Church of Christ, the church has a privilege to communicate transgressions of its members as long as the individual remains a member of the church. However, once a person withdraws from the church, they effectively revoke their consent, and the church can be held liable for post-withdrawal actions. Therefore, the church can legally announce John's transgression only if it does so before John officially leaves the church. After John leaves, the church no longer has the legal protection to disclose his transgressions without potential liability."

I think you would be writing things differently if you had as court judgement in this regard. And how did it happen? In my experience, there are several scenarios:\n\n* You were **tricked** into revealing your credentials, or **your own** computer was compromised to gain your credentials, or you re\\-used the same credentials on different systems and one of those was compromised. The most likely scenario by far.\n* There was a security breach on the **site of the game company**, either revealing your credentials or allowing direct access.\n* There was an accidental software bug on the site of the game company which affected your inventory.\n* There was a deliberate software change on the site of the game company which affected your inventory, e.g. to improve play balance.\n\nThe latter three options are all *possible*, but the first option happens much more frequently. And from the viewpoint of the company, this is indistinguishable from you acting foolishly and losing it. The thief would have been acting with your credentials, after all.\n\nAnd that is where the term you quote comes in. The company is in a contractual relationship with their customers, so they cannot disclaim **all** responsibility for everything that happens through their terms of service. In some jurisdictions, sneaking an illegal clause into the boilerplate terms of service weakens the legal force of the whole document, so they make this sort of disclaimer.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: A client and a service provider had a contract that expired on December 31, 2018, which included a clause for the client to provide a $10,000 per night hotel suite. The service was never rendered as the provider didn't request it. Now, the client offers a $6,000 per night suite instead. If the service provider accepts the $6,000 offer, what is their legal position regarding the original $10,000 clause?\n\nA) The service provider can sue for the $4,000 difference in small claims court.\nB) The service provider has no legal claim to the additional $4,000 as the original contract has expired.\nC) The service provider must reject the $6,000 offer to maintain their right to sue for the full $10,000.\nD) The service provider can accept the $6,000 offer and still sue for $10,000 in civil court.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The original contract expired on December 31, 2018, and the $10,000 suite clause is no longer legally binding. By accepting the new offer of a $6,000 suite, the service provider is entering into a new agreement. They have no legal basis to claim the additional $4,000 from the expired contract. Accepting the current offer does not preserve any rights from the previous, expired agreement. The other options are incorrect because they assume the original contract terms are still valid or enforceable, which they are not due to the contract's expiration."

I'm neither taking, nor considering, legal action.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is legal, and good policy, because the later explanation could create conflicting policies and notions as to what the \"agreement\" is. The TOS is probably created by a lawyer who interviewed the website owner to figure out what they wanted, then wrote legal language to do that. If you ask tech support how to interpret the TOS, you probably are not getting a legally\\-correct statement (assuming that the tech support guy isn't also a lawyer). Rather than take a risk that a customer would defend their action in court by arguing \"they said I could!\", the website may elect to not make promises that they don't want to keep.\n\nInstead, if you want to understand the agreement, you hire your own lawyer, then propose a hypothetical action, to see how the law interprets the language of the agreement. For example \"can I rent out my Netflix password so that other people can use it?\". The lawyer would then read the TOS and relevant cases law, and would advise you whether this is allowed under the TOS (it is not). Alternatively, you could read up on relevant aspects of the law and figure it out yourself.\n\nWebsite TOS is basically driven by copyright law, the technical necessity of some kind of automatic copying in order to use a web page, and the legal requirement that you can't copy without permission of the copyright holder. The TOS is the set of conditions that you must satisfy in order to be permitted to use the site. So many questions reduce to issues of copyright law and permission to copy \\*can you legally \"permit\" the copying of materials you upload?).",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a GDPR question concerning a small non\\-profit organization. The organization is quite informal. Although it has many regular meetings, all these meetings are open to the public. As such, most of those who attend, even many regular attendees, are not officially registered members of the organization.\n\nThe organization would like to keep track of those who attend for follow\\-up purposes. I have three related questions about what the GDPR permits. In the first two cases, the organization does not make any formal announcement that it is tracking the attendance of whom attends. (However, attendance numbers are occasionally mentioned informally, so it is not a secret, either.)\n\nFirst, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to take a count of how many people attend without recording any names? In this case, the organization groups the counts by the general age (child, teenager, or adult) and gender (male or female) of the attendees, but no names are recorded. These attendance numbers are shared among the organization members and are occasionally announced to all meeting attendees. (I would think that this is authorized.)\n\nSecond, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to record the attendees by name, including their general age and gender as mentioned above? The names are obtained through informal contact with the attendees during meetings; attendees are never explicitly asked if they want their attendance recorded. These attendance lists with names are shared only among organization members on follow\\-up committees. (This is the main case that I have questions about under the GDPR.)\n\nThird, in case either or both of the above cases are not authorized under the GDPR, is there any legal way that attendance by name can be recorded and shared among designated organization members? The primary hesitation to formally requesting authorization is that the organization wants attendance records to be as accurate as possible and if some attendees do not grant authorization, then the records will never be accurate. I have heard that one way to accomplish this would be to verbally announce at the beginning of each meeting that attendance is recorded, or to conspicuously post a written notice to this effect at the entrance. Would either of these fulfill GDPR obligations? Or is there an alternative solution?\n\nIn any answer, I would appreciate it if you could cite specific relevant sections of the GDPR so that I can learn the law better.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The scope of the GDPR is entered when personal data is being processed in a structured manner.\n\nPersonal data is any information relating to identifiable data subjects (definition in Art 4(1\\)). \"Peter attended the meeting on the 14th\" is personal data. \"That woman with the blue handbag said she wanted to return on the 25th\" is personal data. However, aggregate statistics do not relate to individuals, and are typically not personal data. \"On the 14th, we had 25 attendees\" is not personal data.\n\nNot all use of personal data is within the scope of the GDPR. For example, the GDPR would not apply if two organizers talk about who attended the meeting. However, Art 2(1\\) says the GDPR applies when personal data\n\n* is processed wholly or partially with automated means (e.g. computers, smartphones), or\n* forms a filing system or is intended for a filing system (e.g. keeping notes on attendees, keeping attendance lists)\n\nIf GDPR applies, the organization would be responsible for ensuring compliance with its rules and principles, summarized in Art 5\\. Primarily, this means:\n\n* having a clear purpose for processing\n* selecting a suitable Art 6 legal basis for that purpose (e.g. *consent* or a *legitimate interest*)\n* only processing the minimum data necessary for achieving that purpose\n* determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of the processing activities\n* preparing for data subject rights, in particular by providing an Art 13 privacy notice when collecting data from the data subjects\n\nThere are of course some complexities in the details. When the legal basis is \"consent\" (opt\\-in), the organization would have to ensure that this consent was freely given and sufficiently informed. Per Art 7(4\\), consent would not be freely given if that consent was a condition for access to the meeting. Using \"legitimate interest\" (opt\\-out) can be more flexible, but it requires performing a balancing test to show that the legitimate interest isn't outweighed by the data subjects' interests, rights, and freedoms. Roughly, relying on a legitimate interest is appropriate when the data subjects can reasonably expect the processing activity to occur.\n\nRegarding **point 1**, keeping general counts and aggregate statistics about attendees is probably OK since it wouldn't be personal data. If you are very conscientious about this, you could round all counts and use categories like \"0\\-4 attendees, 5\\-9 attendees\" for each facet, which makes it more difficult to make inferences about individuals. But the fundamental point is that all your data should relate to attendees as a whole, never to individuals.\n\nRegarding **point 2 and 3**, this is a question of legal basis. Since you gather names through informal conversations, I think that attendees would be weirded out if they learned that you kept detailed records on their attendance. So I think that you probably wouldn't have a legitimate interest here. However, being upfront with this and offering an opt\\-out could change this.\n\nOn the aspect of keeping detailed notes on data from informal conversations, I'd like to point out H\\&M's EUR 35 million fine back in 2020 (summary on [GDPRHub.eu](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=HmbBfDI_-_H%26M)). In a callcenter, managers used to have conversations with employees. These conversations touched on anything from vacation experiences to health problems, marriage problems, and religious beliefs. All of that is fine. What was not fine is that the managers went full Stasi and kept detailed notes about all of this on a shared drive and used that information for management decisions. This went on until a configuration error made those files accessible to all employees. This violated all the points in the basic compliance process outlined above: the records had no clear purpose, no suitable legal basis, contained way more data than necessary (and even Art 9 special categories of data like information on health or religious beliefs which have extra protection), did not have appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, and did not fulfill data subject rights like the Art 13 right to be informed.\n\nIn case this non\\-profit is a church or religious organization that had its own comprehensive data protection rules before the GDPR came into force in 2018, those can continue to apply per Art 91\\. This could probably address some issues of legal basis, but cannot circumvent the GDPR's general principles.",

It is also common for foreign attorneys to take the New York bar exam \\- several thousand people do that each year \\- in which case they have a springboard to appear *pro hac vice* in other states. The NY exam is well\\-understood in this way, in terms of training and support that might be offered in the country of origin. But one\\-off appearances, particularly by in\\-house counsel, also take place routinely.\n\nMany states, including California, also have a category of \"foreign legal consultant\", someone who is retained to advise on the law of the specific foreign jurisdiction in question, but who isn't allowed to appear in court.\n\nIn the current version of the California Rules of Court, *pro hac vice* is covered in [Rule 9\\.40](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=nine&linkid=rule9_40). On its face, this rule only applies to attorneys who are \"eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States\". There is a broad exception in 9\\.40(h),\n\n> This rule does not preclude the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal from permitting argument in a particular case from a person who is not a licensee of the State Bar, but who is licensed to practice in another jurisdiction and who possesses special expertise in the particular field affected by the proceeding.\n\n\"Another jurisdiction\" is not facially limited to U.S jurisdictions, so it may be that the higher state courts could admit a foreign attorney. I do not know of an example either way.\n\nIn general, California's licensing requirements for lawyers have often been strictly interpreted. The State Bar Act (Business and Professions Code, 6000\\-6243\\) says that:\n\n> No person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar.\n\nAn attorney appearing *pro hac vice* is temporarily registered with the State Bar once their application has been approved by the court. This general licensing regime, which aims to protect the public against dishonest or incompetent practitioners, has been held (e.g. in *Birbrower v. Superior Court* 17 Cal. 4th 119 (1998\\)) to imply\n\n> a strong public policy favoring the practice of law in California by licensed State Bar members.\n\nOccasional admission *pro hac vice* does not extend to doing regular legal work of other kinds, including giving legal advice, preparing documents, and so on \\- and certainly not to maintaining a permanent physical office in California, or advertising to the public. If you would like to do those things then the state would like you to take their own bar exam, in which case (if you pass!) you are in the same situation as any other California lawyer.\n\nThere is a fairly recent exception for international commercial arbitration (*not* applicable to normal arbitration about things like disputes over personal property). The Code of Civil Procedure, 1297\\.185, now says that if you are a\n\n> member of a recognized legal profession in a foreign jurisdiction, the members of which are admitted or otherwise authorized to practice as attorneys or counselors at law or the equivalent,\n\nand meet various other conditions, then you can participate in arbitration work on a \"fly in, fly out\" (FIFO) basis. You don't need to register or pay a fee. (But, per 1297\\.187, you still need *pro hac vice* permission to appear as counsel in an actual court.) Additionally, if you FIFO, the Federal government will have visa requirements at the point you try to FI.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently attended a talk related to government workplace harassment law. The presenter repeatedly used the term *nexus* (i.e., a *causual nexus*) to describe any situation where actions outside of the workplace could be seen as related to workplace harassment.\n\nAfter the talk I found an interesting article by [Prof. Jeanette Cox on the American Bar Association website on First Amendment Rights in the workplace](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/15/winter-2015/chill-around-the-water-cooler.html), but it doesn't speak to the extent an employee must modify speech in their personal life to avoid liability for workplace harassment. \n\n**What are the limits of behavior on personal time that might be considered a *causal nexus* for a harassment case?** I'm assuming that any such behavior would have to also be conjunct with behavior that occurred in the workplace involving the same individuals.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Nexus\" means \"connection\". A \"causal nexus\" in this context is a connection that causes harassment at work.\n\nThere isn't any bright line dividing behavior on personal term that does or does not meet this test. The law does't work that way. Instead, there is a fairly vague test (in legal theory this is called a \"standard\" as opposed to a \"rule\") and there are examples of conduct that does or does not meet the test.\n\nA lot of the more obvious examples would be the kind of situations that come up in small town life.\n\nFor example, suppose that the worker who is being harassed is the firm courier, and has only about half a dozen main stops that she visits several times a week, all of which are businesses or government agencies run by people who are part of the Pessimists Club together, whose members have beer and rubber chicken at a member's bar together every Tuesday night. In that context, saying lewd and suggestive things about the courier whom a member employs over a poker game with the people who run all of her main stops in connection with her job might have a causal nexus for harassment case purposes with her job, effectively enlisting everyone she has to do business with in her job in a campaign of harassment against her.\n\nIn contrast, suppose that someone who is engaging in iffy conduct that doesn't quite cross the line of harassment at work towards this courier goes to that Pessimists Club meeting and targets his crass comments not at the courier but his ex\\-girlfriend towards whom he has engaged in lots of harassing conduct. His comments about his ex\\-girlfriend would not have a causal nexus to the courier's workplace and probably wouldn't be something that could be considered to determine if he was engaged in workplace harassment. This would be true even though small town gossip made his harassment of his ex\\-girlfriend common knowledge which make the courier take otherwise ambiguous conduct from him much more seriously knowing his modus operandi and capacity for escalating the situation.\n\nBut, ultimately, one has to make a rather holistic evaluation of the entire situation to determine if there is a causal nexus or not between non\\-workplace behavior and alleged workplace harassment.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A manager at a small company frequently attends local community events where he interacts with employees and clients outside of work hours. At one such event, he makes inappropriate comments about a female employee's appearance to a group that includes some of her coworkers and clients. The female employee later files a workplace harassment complaint. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the potential legal implications of the manager's behavior at the community event?\n\nA) The manager's comments have no relevance to workplace harassment as they occurred outside of work hours and company property.\n\nB) The manager's comments automatically constitute workplace harassment because they were made about an employee, regardless of the setting.\n\nC) The manager's comments may be considered to have a causal nexus to workplace harassment, depending on the overall context and impact on the work environment.\n\nD) The manager's comments are only relevant if he repeats them verbatim in the workplace.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of \"causal nexus\" in workplace harassment cases means there must be a connection between behavior outside the workplace and its impact on the work environment. In this scenario, the manager's comments at a community event, while technically occurring outside of work, may still be considered relevant to a workplace harassment case because:\n\n1. The comments were made about an employee.\n2. Other coworkers and clients were present, potentially affecting workplace relationships and the employee's professional reputation.\n3. The setting involved a mix of personal and professional contacts, blurring the line between work and personal time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because behavior outside work can be relevant if it has a causal nexus to the workplace. Option B is too absolute, as not all out-of-work comments automatically constitute harassment. Option D is too narrow, as the impact of the comments, not just their repetition, is what matters. Option C correctly captures the nuanced approach courts would take in evaluating such a situation, considering the overall context and impact on the work environment."

If you can't prove the negative and potentially harmful information you publish on your public blog is true, don't publish it at all.\"\n\nThen what about Newpapers? Reviewers? Vloggers? That doesn't make any sense. Anyone could sue anybody then, where is freedom of opinion here and what about something someone publishes which you take for a true statement, that turns out to be false? I mean this is ridiculous. How can this be true?\n\nLets say Tom posts an article and mentions that John was sued 3 months ago. Can John then go ahead and sue Tom for Libel if John was sued 5 months ago claiming it hurt his reputation? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Anyone could sue anybody then\n\nYes, anyone can sue anyone for anything at any time \\- that's what equality under the law means. Of course, if you sue and *lose* things get expensive. If you do it a lot, then you can be designated a [vexatious litigant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexatious_litigation) and lose the right to sue without the court's permission.\n\nThe only people who have protection from being sued for libel are parliamentarians for statements the make *in* the chamber in some jurisdictions (see [parliamentary privilege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_privilege)).\n\nYou can't sue people for expressing opinions, only for misstating a fact. For example, if you write or say that I'm a d\\#%^head then that is not actionable: whether I am or am not is an opinion, not an objective fact. If you say I am a thief and I have never been convicted of stealing, that is actionable because I am objectively not a thief. If I am facing charges of theft then I am an \"alleged thief\": if you say that you are fine, if you say I am a thief, I can sue.\n\nThe misstatement must do damage: for your example where I misstate the date of the event, that is not actionable because the timing is not the damaging part of the statement, the fact of the litigation is and that part is factually accurate.\n\nAnd, yes, newspapers, radio stations and tv broadcasters get sued *all the time* \\- that's why they have big legal departments.\n\nLibel law differs between jurisdictions.

Which of the following is most likely to be true regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The blogger is protected by freedom of speech and cannot be sued for libel.\nB) The restaurant can only sue if they can prove a significant drop in customers due to the blog post.\nC) The blogger can be sued for libel, but will automatically win the case if they remove the post.\nD) The restaurant can sue the blogger for libel, and the blogger may be held liable if they cannot prove the statement was true.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The statement made by the blogger is presented as a fact, not an opinion, and it could potentially damage the restaurant's reputation. In cases of libel, the burden of proof often falls on the defendant (the blogger in this case) to show that their statement was true. If they cannot prove the truth of their claim, they may be held liable for damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because freedom of speech does not protect knowingly false statements that damage reputation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because proof of actual damages is not always necessary in libel cases, especially if the statement is considered libel per se (harmful on its face).\n\nOption C is incorrect because simply removing the post does not automatically absolve the blogger of liability for the period when the false information was published."

I'm wondering how judges decide what is \"reasonable\" when the way the law is written is so subjective . \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges do not decide, jurors do (however, if a judge is the fact\\-finder, then the judge makes such a determination). The main input that the decision\\-maker gets is a jury instruction. In order to unify \"reasonable doubt\", \"reasonable price\", \"reasonable delay\" and so on, appeal is often made a mythical being, \"the reasonable man\", so reasonable force would be the degree of force the reasonable man would use in a given situation. I will draw from California criminal instructions ('cuz I have them) but similar instructions can be found across jurisdictions. For example, one instructions says \"A natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes\". Or from a negligence instruction \"A reasonable person would have known that acting in that\nway would create such a risk\". More detailed appeal to The Reasonable Person is found in the justified homicide instruction:\n\n> Defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and (he/she) must have\n>  acted only because of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to\n>  use that amount of force that a reasonable person would believe is\n>  necessary in the same situation. If the defendant used more force than\n>  was reasonable, the \\[attempted] killing was not justified.\n> \n> \n> When deciding whether the defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable,\n>  consider all the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to\n>  the defendant and consider what a reasonable person in a similar\n>  situation with similar knowledge would have believed. If the\n>  defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have\n>  actually existed.\n> \n> \n> The defendant\u2019s belief that (he/she/ \\[or] someone else) was threatened\n>  may be reasonable even if (he/she) relied on information that was not\n>  true. However, the defendant must actually and reasonably have\n>  believed that the information was true.\n\nThere is no explanation of what it means to be \"a reasonable person\". Since nobody believes that they themselves are unreasonable, a simple and also wrong way of judging the matter is to subjectively judge whether *you yourself* would do the same thing, if you were in that situation. \n\nVery often, instructions do not even bother to say what \"reasonable\" means, so (re interpreting expert testimony) \"You may disregard any opinion that you find unbelievable, unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence\"; (re *corpus delicti*) \"That other evidence may be slight and need only be enough to\nsupport a reasonable inference that a crime was committed\"; \"Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to find the\ndefendant guilty, you must be convinced that the only reasonable\nconclusion supported by the circumstantial evidence is that the\ndefendant is guilty\", \"when considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable\"\n\nThe closest the law has come to articulating an objective characterization of \"reasonableness\" is in \"reasonable doubt\" instructions. One characterization is in [People v. Feldman, 71 N.E. 2d 433](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty). \n\n> It is not a doubt based upon sympathy or a whim or prejudice or bias\n>  or a caprice, or a sentimentality, or upon a reluctance of a\n>  weak\\-kneed, timid, jellyfish of a juror who is seeking to avoid the\n>  performance of a disagreeable duty, namely, to convict another human\n>  being of the commission of a serious crime\n\nA somewhat improved characterization is the Calcrim instruction\n\n> Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an\n>  abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not\n>  eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to\n>  some possible or imaginary doubt\n\nThere is room for improvement, but it points in the right direction.\n\nOn rare occasions, a law is written that actually includes a definition. [The Gas Price Spike Act HR 3784](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3784/text) said\n\n> The term \u2018reasonable profit\u2019 means the amount determined by the\n>  Reasonable Profits Board to be a reasonable profit on the sale.\n\nIt is then up to the board to subjectively determine what that profit is. (BTW this did not become law). \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt's actually very difficult to determine what reasoning judges use in those cases where they are the determiners of fact. They will likely call on their knowledge of law, asking \"are these circumstances sufficiently like past circumstance A where the defendant was convicted, or more like B where the defendant was acquitted\".",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In legal contexts, how is the concept of \"reasonableness\" typically determined in court?\n\nA) Judges always make the final decision on what is considered reasonable in every case.\nB) The law provides clear, objective definitions of reasonableness for all situations.\nC) Juries or fact-finders often decide what is reasonable based on the concept of a \"reasonable person\" and specific jury instructions.\nD) Reasonableness is determined solely by comparing the current case to past similar cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, juries (or judges when acting as fact-finders) typically determine what is considered reasonable in legal contexts. They are often guided by jury instructions that refer to the concept of a \"reasonable person\" - a hypothetical individual who exercises average care, skill, and judgment in conduct. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judges do not always make this determination; it's often left to juries.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the law rarely provides clear, objective definitions of reasonableness.

While past cases may inform decisions, they are not the sole determinant of reasonableness in current cases.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complexity of determining reasonableness in legal settings, involving jury instructions, the concept of a \"reasonable person,\" and case-by-case consideration of circumstances."

So if you're an american citizen, you will pay tax as if the income of the LLC is your income.\n\nBut what about if you are a citizen in other country? From say, Malaysian's point of view, is delaware LLC any different than Seychelles corporation? Both are just foreign entities right?\n\nMust you pay tax for any income the delaware LLC have? Assuming you don't repatriate, etc.\n\nNote: LLC is a flow through entities. Basically if I were american citizen the tax will flow through as if I don't have LLC. However, given that I am not an american citizen the tax will flow through a foreign entity. From US/Delaware points of view, the tax flow through outside. From my country points of view, an LLC in delaware owns tax. So no body claims they can tax me.\n\nThat's the idea.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, if your Delaware LLC earns money, you will pay tax in America on that money. America still taxes \"foreigners\" on *American* income, just not on\"global\" income. That is, unless the U.S. has a tax reciprocity treaty with your home country, Malaysia.\n\nI don't know about Malaysian law, but I am writing as an American about American law regarding the Seychelles (and I am not a lawyer). The following is only as an \"example.\"\n\nIf you set up an LLC in the Seychelles, you could, in theory, avoid American tax by accruing income there. In practice, if you did nothing but \"banking\" in the Seychelles, America would look at your lack of \"value added\" there, and could tax you on Seychelles income as if your corporation was American.\n\nThe way to make such a claim stick (typically in a place like Ireland), is to set up a manufacturing or operating facility (e.g. call center) there so that you were shipping goods or services from your offshore operation. Then you'd have a strong claim in America that your operation actually earned most of its income abroad, and the U.S. company was just a holding company.",

For a statement to be considered libel, it must actually identify the plaintiff in a way that the public can recognize. In this case, since no one other than the author and the real person made the connection before the lawsuit, the original work cannot be considered libel. By filing the lawsuit and making the connection public, the real person essentially consented to any potential defamation and cannot claim damages resulting from their own actions. This aligns with the concept that the plaintiff's actions contributed to any potential harm, similar to contributory negligence in other areas of law. Options A and D are incorrect because the original work doesn't meet the criteria for libel. Option C, while touching on First Amendment protections, is too broad and doesn't address the specific circumstances of this case."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of publishing such a website?\n\nA) The customer can be sued for defamation regardless of the truthfulness of the information they publish.\n\nB) The customer can only publish their experience if they have written permission from the shipping company.\n\nC) The customer can safely publish their experience as long as all information is truthful and they have evidence to support their claims.\n\nD) The customer should avoid publishing any negative information about the company to prevent potential legal issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In the United States, truth is an absolute defense against defamation claims. As long as the customer publishes truthful information and has evidence to support their claims (such as emails, phone recordings, etc.), they are protected from defamation lawsuits. Publishing evidence also tends to deter companies from pursuing frivolous lawsuits, as it would make their vexatious intent more obvious. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the legal risk, while option B incorrectly suggests that permission is required to publish truthful information about one's own experience."

That common barrier lets the neighbors both put their dogs outside securely. The fence owner is not obligated to have the fence at all by municipal or neighborhood rules. One day, the fence\\-owner suddenly decides to remove it without any advance notice, and the other neighbor's dog can't securely use the backyard anymore (or the dog even escapes!)\n\nDoes the fence owner have any duty to at least provide advance notice to his neighbor, *\"Hey, I'm going to remove the fence, it might affect your dog\"*? Or are they truly free to take down the fence on a moment's notice, regardless of who might be negatively impacted?\n\n*(this is not a real situation. This is loosely based on a real, but much more complex situation. I didn't want to post the full details, because I'm not asking for specific advice, and because the full complexity of the real situation is a lot bigger. I'm interested in the basic concepts in this hypothetical case)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends; Permission may be Required\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis depends on both the facts on the ground, and the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Residential fences are often governed by specific local laws at the municipal or county level in the US, so no generally applicable answer is possible, short of a book giving laws for each locality.\n\nCommon\\-Law Rules\n-----------------\n\nUnder the common law, followed by many but far from all US jurisdictions, the key question is whether a fence is a \"partition fence\" or not. A partition fence is one built on or near the property line that is owned jointly by the owners of the properties it divides.\n\nA fence near the property line is probably a partition fence if:\n\n* The two property owners jointly built or paid for the building of the fence;\n* Parts of the fence are on each side of the property line;\n* The owners have agreed that the fence is common property; or\n* Both owners \"use\" the fence, as by connecting it to another fence running in a different direction, or by relying on it to contain domestic animals.\n\nA Fence is probably not a partition fence if:\n\n* It is entirely clear of the property line;\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests maintains it; and\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests uses it.\n\nThe owner of one of the properties may not remove, demolish, or modify a partition fence without permission from the other. Removing or modifying a partition fence without the permission of the owner of the adjacent property is a tort, and can lead to damages for the value of the fence begin awarded.\n\nThe owners must each maintain a partition fence, often each caring for his or her side. Failing to do so may be a tort.\n\nIf a fence is not a partition fence, the owner of the land is also the sole owner of the fence, and may modify or remove it without permission from, or notice to, the owner of any adjacent or nearby property.\n\nHowever, the above common\\-law rules may be modified by local laws, and one would be wise to check, or consult a lawyer who knows how to check, before making any demands.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The page [\"Removal or Destruction of Fences\"](https://fences.uslegal.com/removal-or-destruction-of-fences/) from US legal reads:\n\n> A fence is an enclosure creating an adequate blockade around a particular land for the purpose of prohibiting intrusions from outside. A landowner can remove a fence, separating his/her land from that of his/her neighbor, when such fence is located wholly upon his/her own land. However, a landowner is not empowered to remove a partition fence without the adjacent landowner\u2019s consent. A partition fence is the joint property of adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> A fence erected on the line between the lands of adjoining owners generally belongs to the parties as tenants in common. Generally, a partition fence is built equally on both sides of the line. Until the contrary is shown, the partition fence is presumed to be the common property of both owners. An owner of adjoining land can remove a partition fence upon formal notice to adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> For an improper removal of a partition fence, an aggrieved party can bring an action for damages. The standard for measuring damages for such removal or destruction is its value at the time. The value is determined by replacement costs minus depreciation for age and use. Moreover, when someone builds a fence on another person\u2019s land without any authority to do so, the landowner can remove or destroy such fence. A person is liable for removing, destroying, or injuring a fence belonging to another person just as one who commits such acts against any kind of property belonging to another is liable\\[i]. Such person is considered a tortfeasor. However, an individual cannot remove or destroy a fence on another individual\u2019s land without his/her consent.\n\n* The page [\"Property Line and Fence Laws in Maryland\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/maryland-law/property-line-and-fence-laws-in-maryland.html) from FindLaw reads, in relevant part:\n\n> Maryland doesn't have specific rules dealing with fences. Instead, the state follows the common law practice that a fence built along a boundary line is owned in common by both property owners when both use the fence, unless otherwise agreed. A property owner is said to use a fence when they \"hook\\-up\" to the fence with another row of fence, or keep animals in the enclosure created by the fence. A fence built and used only by the builder is that person's sole property. When you purchase a new home, you take a property with an existing fence built and used by prior owners. Simply put, if you buy a property with a co\\-owned fence, you likely need to continue your maintenance of the fence.\n\n* The page [\"Is it legal for the neighbor to remove a fence on our shared property line?\"](https://answers.justia.com/question/2019/05/28/is-it-legal-for-the-neighbor-to-remove-a-693710) from Justia's \"Ask a Lawyer\" feature reads:\n\n> If both landowners paid to install a fence directly on a property line in the past, then yes, they need your permission to remove or replace the fence. Many fences are not built on a property line, but are instead just on one property or the other.\n> \n> \n> If you have had your land surveyed, you may be able to determine your exact property line. You or your neighbor are free to build new fences without permission as long as neither the fence nor any construction or excavation encroaches on the other's property.\n> \n> \n> Fences are a common property dispute, and can have long term effects. If a fence encroaches significantly on someone else's land for many years, this can actually become the new legal property line in some cases.\n\nAccording to the \"Fences\" section of the page [\"Disputes between your neighbours\"](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/for-the-public/common-legal-issues/disputes-between-your-neighbours/) from th New Zealand Law Society:\n\nIn New Zealand this is regulated by the Fencing Act 1978\\. Except where modified by individual agreements:\n\n> * Fences must be on the boundary line, though there is provision for give and take where the true boundary is difficult to fence.\n> * The cost of building or repairing a fence is borne equally between adjoining owners, unless one owner damages it, in which case the cost of repairs will fall on that owner.\n> * You can compel your neighbour to contribute to the cost of the fence bordering your two properties by following the procedures set out in the Fencing Act ...\n> * Developers of new subdivisions usually exempt themselves from contributing to the cost of a fence.\n> * Under the Property Law Act 2007, it is possible to apply to a District Court for an order to remove or alter a fence that is detrimentally affecting land or obstructing a view. Usually the cost of any removal falls on the person applying for the order.\n\n* The Booklet [\"Fences and the Law](https://Flsc.sa.gov.au/resources/FencesandtheLawBooklet.pdf) from the Legal Services Commission, South Australia states, on page 2:\n\n> Fences should be regarded as a joint\n> asset between neighbours. Even if your\n> neighbour has not paid for the fence they\n> are still a joint owner.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner, Alice, has a fence along her property line that her neighbor, Bob, has been using to keep his dog in his yard. Alice decides to remove the fence without notifying Bob. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of Alice's actions?\n\nA) Alice can remove the fence at any time without notifying Bob, as it's on her property.\n\nB) Alice must get Bob's permission before removing the fence, regardless of who owns it.\n\nC) Alice can remove the fence only if it's not considered a partition fence under common law.\n\nD) Alice must notify Bob before removing the fence, but doesn't need his permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to common law principles, the key factor is whether the fence is considered a \"partition fence\" or not. If the fence is a partition fence (jointly owned by both neighbors), Alice would need Bob's permission to remove it. However, if the fence is not a partition fence (solely owned by Alice), she can remove it without permission or notice.\n\nThe fence may be considered a partition fence if:\n- Both Alice and Bob jointly built or paid for it\n- Parts of the fence are on each side of the property line\n- They've agreed it's common property\n- Both use the fence (e.g., Bob connecting it to another fence or using it to contain his dog)\n\nIf none of these apply and the fence is entirely on Alice's property and maintained only by her, it's likely not a partition fence. In this case, Alice could remove it without permission or notice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of a partition fence. Option B is too absolute, as permission is not always required. Option D suggests notification is always necessary, which isn't accurate if the fence isn't a partition fence."

We have flu vaccines. The flu kills, I believe, **hundreds, thousands of people every year**. OSHA has never purported to regulate on that basis.\u201d (bold type added)\n\nI always considered the lack of a conjunction before the last instance of some should *not* be interpreted as the logical conjunction between operands; the relationship is represented as ambiguous as to whether it is conjunctive or disjunctive and therefore it states both remaining silent and not including a grammatical conjunction. It should be used and interpreted as \u201cand/or\u201d. Just like how allegedly it is used here.\n\nBut the English language does not use it that way. It is seen often in the terse titles of the publications of the press. For e.g. \u201cU.S., EU to discuss Russian war threat Friday\u201d.\n\nAnd for their social consensus that the lack of a grammatical conjunction means the conjunctive operator (\u201cand\u201d), the above statement would mean the following:\n\n> \u201cThe flu kills, I believe, hundreds \\[and] thousands of people every year.\u201d\n\nNow who says that in the U.S.? Who says that? No one. Close idioms would be \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d, \u201cmillions and millions\u201d or Trump\u2019s favorite: \u201cbillions and billions\u201d. There is no such idiom as \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d in General American. And no one says \u201chundreds, thousands\u201d anywhere.\n\nAnd Gorsuch never said that. It\u2019s just another level when it turns out the Wise of the nation has a(t least one) conspiracy theorist idiot among them so he had to back track.\n\nI tried reviewing and rehearing the oral arguments and search for the alleged incorrect version as well as the allegedly corrected version, but found neither versions neither in the [transcript](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/21a240_7648.pdf) nor in the [audio](https://www.supremecourt.gov/media/audio/mp3files/21A240.mp3).\n\nNow, since at most of the time there is silence while one speaks in the oral arguments before the Supreme Court, it is plausible that even the audio was doctored and the part where he would actually say \u201chundreds **of** thousands\u201d (bold type added) the word \u201cof\u201d is deleted and a new audio is up now. But it is theoretically possible that the audio still includes the word \u201cof\u201d.\n\nSo, how does neither the transcript or the audio include these remarks of Gorsuch and where are the actual files that would at least include *one* of the alleged versions?\n\nOn the backwater of this: Has the Supreme Court ever been caught falsifying its own transcripts, for example, to avoid ridicule or considerable face loss or Gorsuch would be the proud first?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Gorsuch said it in the oral arguments on [*National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor*, 21A244](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21a244.html), which is cited in the The Hill article you linked. The line is on the page numbered 121 in the [transcript](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/21a244_7k47.pdf) (which is page 122 in the PDF), and at 1:51:50 in the [audio](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2021/21A244).\n\nFrom your links, you appear to have been looking instead at the arguments in *Biden v. Missouri*, a different vaccination case argued on the same day, so it's no wonder you couldn't find it.\n\nI think your questions about falsification and so on are now moot, so I won't address them.\n\n---\n\nFrom what I heard, I would probably transcribe the line as \"the flu kills, I believe, hundreds \u2014 thousands \u2014 of people every year.\" My interpretation is that he said \"hundreds\", then paused briefly and corrected himself to \"thousands\". The official transcriber seems to have transcribed that pause as a comma, but you're right that a comma doesn't really make grammatical sense.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't sound to me like an implausible thing to say. And in any case I don't hear an \"of\", and the cadence and inflection don't match the way that a native AmE speaker would say \"hundreds of thousands\".",

Is there any law suggesting that such an inference *should* or *should not* be made?\n\n(Interested in common law jurisdictions; U.S. in particular.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Silence itself does not generally imply consent, but in the context of a history of transacting, silence in the face of continued actions by the other side can indicate consent. Here's a fun little example (*Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd.*, [\\[1964] S.C.R. 614](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii88/1964canlii88.pdf)).\n\nThe plaintiff was a tug boat company who was providing tug services for the defendant who operated an oil refinery. The large crude oil tankers coming into the refinery needed tug guidance and the plaintiff provided this. There was an undisputed verbal acceptance of a written offer for services from June 13, 1961 to July 13, 1961\\. The agreement was expressly extended twice, each for two weeks, into August 1961\\. No further authorization for extension was made.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff continued to provide tug service for the incoming tankers and continued sending monthly invoices to the defendant until February 1962\\. The defendant did not pay and denied liability for all charges after the middle of August 1961\\.\n\nThe trial judge said:\n\n> I find that the defendant knew that the *Ocean Rockswift* continued after August 1, 1961, in commission on call to assist and did assist the large tankers during the period in question, and that the plaintiff expected payment on a rental basis for its being kept in commission. The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. **The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed**.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada quoted from Anson on Contracts:\n\n> So if A allows B to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that B meant to do the work for nothing, A will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; the permission to do it, or the acquiescence in its being done, constitutes the acceptance.\n\nAnd from Williston on Contracts:\n\n> Silence may be so deceptive that it may become necessary for one who receives beneficial services to speak in order to escape the inference of a promise to pay for them.\n\nBut the Supreme Court of Canada clarified:\n\n> ... mere failure to disown responsibility to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\n\n---\n\nThis answer shows how silence can play a role from a pure common law contract perspective, without considering equitable principles. [sjy's answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/85367/46948) correctly adds that silence can be relevant to various equitable doctrines.",

Company X provided services to Company Y for 6 months beyond their initial agreement.\n2. Company X sent monthly invoices for these additional services.\n3. Company Y used the services but did not explicitly agree to extend the contract.\n4. Company Y did not object to or refuse the services during this time.\n5. Company Y now refuses to pay for the 6 months of additional services.\n\nBased on the principles discussed in Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd., what is the most likely outcome of this dispute?\n\nA) Company Y must pay for all 6 months because their silence implies consent to the contract extension.\nB) Company Y is not liable for any payment beyond the initial agreement period.\nC) Company Y may be liable for payment, but the court will closely examine the circumstances to determine if there was an implied agreement.\nD) Company Y is only liable for 3 months of additional services as a reasonable extension period.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As per the Saint John Tug Boat case, silence alone does not always imply consent or create a binding contract. However, the court will consider the entire context of the situation. In this case, Company Y's continued use of services, receipt of invoices, and failure to object could potentially be seen as acquiescence or implied agreement. The court would examine whether the circumstances were \"such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered.\" This requires a careful examination of all facts and circumstances, not just the silence itself.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because silence alone is not automatically considered consent. Answer B is too absolute, ignoring the potential for an implied agreement based on the circumstances. Answer D is arbitrary and not based on the principles discussed in the case law provided."

This Lease Contract will automatically renew month\\-to\\-month unless either party gives at least 60 days written notice to vacate or intent to move out as required by paragraph 37\\. \n\nParagraph 37\\.\nMove\\-Out Notice. Before moving out, you must give our representative advanced notice to vacate as provided below. Your written notice to vacate will not release you from liability for the full term of the Lease Contract. You will still be liable for the entire Lease Contract if you move out early (paragraph 22\\) except under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (paragraph 23\\) or the Landlord and Tenant Relationship Act (paragraph 11\\). Your written notice to vacate must comply with each of the following:\nWe must receive advanced written notice to vacate. Your written notice to vacate should comply with the terms provided in paragraph 3 of this Lease Contract. Oral move out notice will not be accepted and will not terminate your Lease Contract. \nYour written notice to vacate must not terminate the Lease Contract sooner than the end of the Lease Contract term or renew period. \nYour notice to vacate is not acceptable if it does not comply with all of the above. You must obtain from our representative written acknowledgement that we received your written notice to vacate. \n\nParagraph 15\\. \nRent Increases and Lease Contract Changes. No rent increases or Lease Contract changes are allowed before the initial Lease Contract term ends, except for changes allowed by special provisions in paragraph 10 (Note p. 10 did not pertain to this I can add it if you like) , by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us, or by reasonable changes of apartment rules allowed under paragraph 18 (community policies and rules, unrelated). If, at least 5 days before the advance notice deadling (they had a typo here \\-\\> deadline) referred to in paragraph 3, we give you written notice of rent increases or lease changes effective when the lease term or renew period ends, this Lease Contract will automatically continue month\\-to\\-month with the increased rent or lease changes. The new modified Lease Contract will begin on the date stated in the notice without necessity of your signature unless you give us written move out notice under paragraph 37\\. \n\nMy landlord failed to meet the 5 days in advance of the 60 day notice of intent to move out required to increase the rent. More plainly the lease ends on Nov/16/2016, so if I want to move out on that day then I needed to give a notice by Sept/17/2016, which means my landlord needed to give me a notice of increase by Sept 12\\. I tried in late August to get the rent increase information but they told me it was not available yet. They said typically the don't have it until \\< 60 days before the lease ends. They also said that in the lease they were not required to give notice \\> 60 days out. Anyway they notified me of the changes to rent on Sept 14\\. \n\nMy question is this since I have already failed to give a 60 day notice to move out can they charge me month\\-to\\-month after November 16 (for the first month) any more than the are currently charging me?\n\nIf they had given me the notice 2 days earlier they could have modified the Contract to reflect the monthly charges vs 15 mo. starting Nov 16\\-Dec 16 but they failed to notify me in time. Also after one month of extension their notice will have been within the 65 days they stipulated so they could increase rent in Dec 16 and on. \n\nSidebar: they are not required to give a rent increase notice \\< 60 days out, but in my opinion that means they lose the right to increase they rent for the first month. \n\nAre my thoughts correct here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two relevant sections of law in Michigan, [554\\.601 \\- 554\\.616 and 554\\.631 \\- 554\\.641](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(otw4g1xrkqviiaica3wsjeia))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-chap554), and these do not limit automatic renewal clauses (as they may in some states). So yes, since the landlord failed to give notice 5 days before the 60 day move\\-out notice deadline, then per paragraph 15 the rent cannot be increased. An interesting side\\-effect of para 15 is that since they failed to give timely notice of changes in the lease, the conditions for automatic month\\-to\\-month continuation (at the same rate) are also not satisfied.",

The landlord notifies the tenant of a rent increase on September 14, 2016.

According to paragraph 15 of the lease, if the landlord doesn't provide proper notice, the lease continues month-to-month at the current rent. However, this only applies to the first month after lease expiration. After that, the landlord's notice (given on September 14) would be valid for subsequent months. Therefore, the rent cannot be increased for the first month after lease expiration (November 17 to December 16), but can be increased thereafter."

But here goes:\n\nLast summer my family and I took a two week road trip all over western Canada, visiting Victoria, Edmonton, and lots of stops along the way. I noticed during our trip that practically every hotel we stayed at had a pool with a water slide. Some of these water slides were very high; being two and three stories tall even. \n\nI've worked in the hospitality industry before, and I know that \\-\\- in America at least \\-\\- very few hotels have water slides because they are an insurance nightmare for the property. If you own a hotel with a water slide in the US, you pay through the nose for insurance because it's practically a given that at some point, there will be an accident, someone will get hurt, and you will likely get sued over it regardless of whose fault it may have been. That's why the few that do have water slides have limited hours and charge you extra to use it. The slides always empty into a special pool or at least a roped\\-off area in the main pool that is off\\-limits to regular swimmers. There is usually a lifeguard posted to shoo people toward the exit so that the pool is clear for the next rider. There are also signs *everywhere* warning swimmers about how dangerous it can be. This is just the kind of thing Americans expect to see at a water park.\n\nWhat was peculiar to me is that the slides I encountered in Canada generally just emptied right into the main pool where other people are swimming. There were no lifeguards, few warning signs, and they were free to use as long as the pool was open. I used them a few times and you come out of them pretty fast. Very fun, but I thought it was strange that it was entirely up to me and my wife to keep our kids away from the slide so they didn't get hit by people coming down (which I'm fine with by the way \\-\\- it's called *parenting* and I'm totally OK with that).\n\nMy point is that it's a common criticism in America that we are a sue\\-happy country where we just expect that there will be a lawsuit when somebody gets hurt, whereas in Canada I got the distinct impression that people are fully expected to take their own personal responsibility to not be stupid around the water slide.\n\nIs this impression correct? Are Canadians less litigious than Americans are? If so, why? Or am I just off\\-base in my observation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, but the USA is *special*!\n-----------------------------\n\nIn [COMPARATIVE LITIGATION RATES](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Ramseyer_681.pdf)  from HARVARD, JOHN M.

This is implemented by many organisations (eg. [cifas](https://www.cifas.org.uk/dsar)) by requiring the subject to provide documents such as photo id (driving license or passport) and one from a list of documents of which I only have a bank statement.\n\nThese documents contain a lot of personal information that I THINK the organisation does not have and I do not want to provide without good reason. This includes:\n\n* Special category data\n\t+ Place and date of birth\n\t+ Facial photograph\n\t+ Nationality\n* Data useful to fraudsters\n\t+ Which bank I use\n\t+ Bank account number\n\t+ Reoccurring payments (that are the usual security questions asked when I call my bank)\n* Personally sensitive data\n\t+ Spending habits\n\t+ Driving restrictions/convictions\n\nIt would seem appropriate to request from the data controller what data they hold about me, and redact any other information. However, as this is likely to be only name and address the redacted documents are likely to be mostly a black square with little boxes of text that would do a rather poor job of verifying my identity in that anyone who knows my name and address could probably generate them.\n\nWhat are the legal limits of what a data processor can require before providing the response to a SAR? What can a data subject do to prevent further distribution of PII when trying to access data from a potentially untrustworthy data controller? Is there actually a solution that both provides for data security for the subject and verification of identify to the data controller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe GDPR requires data controllers (DCs) to exercise reasonable care when responding to an access, modification, or deletion request, to ensure that it comes from the actual Data Subject (person whose data is involved, here a DS). The GDPR does not specify just what methods must or may be used to ensure that an access (or other) request comes from the DS. It does say, in Article 12, that \"additional information\" may be requested from the DS by the DC for this purpose that is \"necessary to confirm the identity\" of the DS.\n\nIf a DC receives data for identification purposes, it must be used only for those purposes, and retained no longer than needed.\n\nPersonal Data (PD) in general must be limited according to article 5, so that data is used only for the purposes it was collected for, retained for no longer than needed, adn appropriately secured against unauthorized use or access. The DC is responsible for adhering to these limitations.

But perhaps knowing that the GDPR forbids the DC from distributing or using this data except for the purpose it was collected, that is, to identify the DS, and from retaining it longer than need be, might offer some reassurance.\n\nA DS could also ask the DC what is the minimum data needed for identification, and redact data beyond this.

The data subject is concerned about providing this information. According to GDPR principles, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The data controller is not allowed to request any additional information for identity verification.\n\nB) The data controller can freely use and retain the provided identification documents for any purpose.\n\nC) The data controller may request necessary identification information, but must use it only for verification purposes, retain it no longer than needed, and ensure its security.\n\nD) The data subject has no recourse if they believe the requested identification information is excessive.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the GDPR, data controllers are allowed to request additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject making an access request (Article 12). However, this information must be used only for the purpose of identification, retained no longer than necessary, and appropriately secured against unauthorized use or access (Article 5). The data controller is responsible for adhering to these limitations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the GDPR does allow controllers to request necessary additional information for identity verification.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it violates the purpose limitation and data minimization principles of the GDPR.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the data subject can complain to the data controller and then to the relevant supervisory authority if they believe the requested information is excessive.\n\nOption C correctly summarizes the data controller's obligations when requesting and handling identification information for subject access requests."

If it's not illegal for two companies to enter into an agreement not to poach each others' talent, why is it legal for a NAR\u00ae to state,\n\n> REALTORS\u00ae shall not solicit a listing which is currently listed exclusively with another broker.\n\nWhy is that though? I mean if I solicit a listing from a client who is locked into an exclusive listing with another broker, but the other broker isn't the procuring cause of the sale it sounds to me like the other broker will not be entitled to a commission and I will (subject to my contract). How is a non\\-compete between two brokers for a client in contract permissible in real estate, but not in other forms of employment?\n\nHere are two questions from my practice ethics quiz (not exam)\n\n> When can a REALTOR\u00ae \u201csolicit\u201d another broker\u2019s exclusive listing?\n> \n> \n> * a. Never.\n> * b. At any time \u2013 anti\\-trust laws prohibit restrictions on such activities .\n> * c.

If the owner does not initiate the contact but the REALTOR\u00ae initiates a d iscussion at a social event\u00b8 the REALTOR\u00ae can discuss the terms of a future listing.\n\nThey're saying the answer is \"C\".

If the client returns a call after the REALTOR\u00ae has initiated the dealings.\n\nThey're saying the answer is \"C\". But again, if I prospective client calls me after a general mailing (which they permit) it's not clear to my how it's legal to say we can't compete and \"deal\" in terms of future listing or for business?\n\nJust wanting to get a better idea of how these non\\-competition agreements work in real estate and what guiding law limits their use, and when they reach over into being anti\\-competitive.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They are merely telling you what the law is\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere is a tort called [interference with contractual relations](http://tlfc.com.au/interference-contractual-relations-issues-poaching-employees-competitor/#:%7E:text=The%20tort%2C%20known%20as%20interference,party%20who%20procured%20the%20breach.):\n\n> The question strikes at the heart of our economic and legal system both of which are based upon principles of freedom of contract and freedom of choice. However, **parties that freely enter contracts cannot freely breach such contracts** and Courts have shown that they are prepared in some cases to provide relief against unlawful interferences with contractual relations.\n\nIf A (the vendor) has contracted with B (the realtor) it is unlawful for a third\\-party (you) to induce A to breach their contract. If you were to approach A and they then broke their contract with B, B could sue A for breach of contract and you for interference in contractual relations.\n\nAnti\\-competition law is directed at ensuring there is a free and fair market for goods and services but once two parties have willingly entered a contract, they are no longer participating in the market.\n\nNow, if A approaches you, that's on A and hence why the answer o both questions is c.",

Under what circumstances can Sarah legally discuss a potential future listing with John without risking a lawsuit for interference with contractual relations?\n\nA) Sarah can approach John at any time to discuss a future listing, as anti-trust laws prohibit restrictions on such activities.\n\nB) Sarah can never discuss a future listing with John while he has an exclusive agreement with Tom.\n\nC) Sarah can discuss a future listing if John initiates the contact and Sarah has not directly or indirectly prompted the discussion.\n\nD) Sarah can discuss a future listing if she initiates the conversation at a social event, even if John doesn't bring up the topic first.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Sarah can legally discuss a potential future listing with John if John initiates the contact and Sarah has not directly or indirectly prompted the discussion. This aligns with the principle that it's not interference with contractual relations if the client (John) initiates the dealings. Options A and D are incorrect because they involve Sarah initiating contact, which could be seen as inducing a breach of contract. Option B is too restrictive, as there are circumstances where Sarah can discuss future listings without legal risk."

For the sake of argument, let's take\n\n> [For sale: baby shoes, never worn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn)\n\nWe can apply the Cesar\\-7 Chiffre and get\n\n> Mvy zhsl: ihif zovlz, ulcly dvyu.\n\nOr we use the NVA's TAPIR pattern:\n\n> 56644 83690 62182 90838 15005 07883 69596 41698 29183 81317 41483 76644 38289\n\nThat is obviously nonsense. But all these patterns are at least derivative of the original work. But in fact, they *full encode* the message, only in a different format, and are reversible. This means we don't just make a derivate, we made a **copy**, which can be read with the proper means.\n\n**It is the sole right of the author or rightsholder to license making copies**, no matter how they are encoded.\n\nOr to rephrase: If it is reversible, it is a copy. If it is not reversible, it is a derivative. *Neither* is allowed.\n\n### Subquestions\n\n> who is liable?\n\n* The one encoding the file committed copyright infringement for making an unlicensed copy. Period. No way around.\n* The one downloading the file committed copyright infringement by copying the unlicensed copy. No matter if they knew what it was or decoded it, they made a copy of an (encoded) unlicensed copy. Deleting the file btw does not make the copyright infringement go away.\n\n> can that person make a legitimate argument in court that he just randomly generated the \"abstract art\" \\[...] ?\n\nThat would be perjury. They chucked a whole work into an algorithm. Saying anything else but \"I chucked the work into the algorithm\" is perjury. Which incidentally can be easily proven if the algorithm is reversible \\- it will prove the input.\n\n> is the person who wrote the program \\[...] make the argument that the program isn't meant to specifically decode copyright material\n\nThey can, but they are not even on the hook for copyright infringement in the first place. They provide a tool with legitimate uses, such as transmitting messages in a secure way. Encoded files inside other images are for example used by journalists to get files out of oppressive regimes. The liability araises only at the user who uses it illegally.\n\n> But if so, would it then make a difference if the offline program decodes the file into system RAM only, and not to a file on disk?\n\nNo. Think about an ISO file. ISO files are 1:1 copies of how a CD is written. They can be burned 1:1 onto a CD without any extra preparation, which is their legitimate use: be easy to distribute and verify copies of for example installation files. ISO files can also be mounted in a virtual CD drive, which emulates a CD drive.\n\nIf you legitimately got the Windows ISO from Microsoft (or a licensed retailer) directly, you can mount it or burn it, or use it for all legitimate purposes. However, downloading the ISO for a game doesn't change that you made an illegal copy of the game, no matter that you need to mount or burn the ISO to actually access it.",

The act of encoding does not change the fact that it's a full copy of the original work, just in a different format. Claiming it was randomly generated would likely be considered perjury, as the encoding process is reversible and the original content can be proven. The creator of the decoding program is not necessarily liable if the program has legitimate uses. The downloader may also be liable, but this doesn't negate the uploader's liability.

What legal recourse do I have if I want to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Musical compositions can be, and if recent almost always are, protected by copyright. This is separate from the copyright on a recording of a performance of the work.\n\nIf you reuse a musical passage, the new work may be a *derivative work*, that is a work based on an earlier work. Or an extended musical quotation could be considered to be copyright infringement.\n\nIf this is in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the use of a section from a previous work **might** be considered to be a *fair use* ([fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\")). This is a specifically US concept in copyright law, although several other countries have a concept of *fair dealing* which is somewhat similar, although narrower.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is an inherently fact\\-based determination. There is no clear and simple bright line for what is and is not a fair use. US law ([17 USC 197](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107)) specifies four factors which are to be weighed by a court in considering the matter:\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use**. If your use is commercial that weighs against fair use, but does not at all preclude it. This factor also includes whether the use is *transformative* or not. A transformative use is one that takes the part used for a very different sort of purpose than the original. Parodies are normally transformative, for example. A quote for purposes of commentary and analysis, or criticism is normally transformative. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work**. Creative works such as fiction and *music* are more strongly protected than works such as textbooks and news stories. This probably weighs against fair use in the case described.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole**. If only a short section of a longer work is used, that weighs in favor of fair use. However very short quotes can still fail, to be held to be fair uses. In [*Harper vs Nation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) a quote of about 300 words from a 500 page book was held not to be fair use because it was \"the heart of the book\".\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** A use that significantly harms the market value of the original, or serves as a replacement for it, weigh strongly against fair use. This was a major factor in *Harper vs Nation*.\n\nEach case of claimed fair use is evaluated by looking at all four factors, and the specific facts of the case.\n\nFrom the description in the question, such a use might well be held to be fair use. Musical quotations often are. But there is no way to be sure unless a court evaluates the specific case. A lawyer specifically experienced in not only copyright law, but copyrights on music, might be able to give more specific advice.\n\nOr you could, of course, seek permission from the copyright holder, quite likely the original composer or artist. If you get permission, there is no further issue. There might be a charge, but when the use is minor, and has no commercial effect, the charge might be small or even zero provided that the source is acknowledged.",

In the United States, using a portion of a copyrighted work may be considered fair use, but this is not automatic or guaranteed. Fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering four main factors:\n\n1. The purpose and character of the use (including whether it's transformative)\n2.

Reading the text of the license, it should be\nenough, but since I have no legal background I'm not sure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In practice, it is abundantly clear to which entity the \u201cFree Software Foundation\u201d refers, even if the FSF were to change its name, even if there are unaffiliated organizations with the same name.\n\nVersion 3 of the GPL also contains a link to the FSF website, making it clear which organization this referred to in 2007 when the license text was published. If there are doubts about the identity of the FSF in the future, it will be possible to trace the identity back to the 2007 FSF e.g. through public filings that the FSF is required to make available as a non\\-profit.\n\nPrevious versions of the GPL contained an address for the FSF, which similarly disambiguates the identity of this entity at the time of writing.\n\nThe FSF also holds a trademark for the brand \"Free Software Foundation\" in the US and EU, preventing an unaffiliated organization from using this name in an international context. Of course this doesn't affect an organization in Uruguay, but it's very clear that such an Uruguyan entity is not the FSF that wrote the GPL.\n\nThe interesting questions is what happens if the FSF is dissolved. Can it assign its responsibilities and rights as the GPL license steward to someone else? I assume it can, and that the subsequent license steward would be able to produce sufficient documentation to substantiate this claim. If not, those are likely to be some interesting court cases.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), which of the following statements is true regarding the \"or later\" clause and the role of the Free Software Foundation (FSF)?\n\nA) Any organization with the name \"Free Software Foundation\" can legally publish new versions of the GPL.\nB) The FSF's identity is ambiguous in the license text, potentially allowing other entities to claim authority over future GPL versions.\nC) The FSF's identity is clearly established through various means, including website links and trademark protection, preventing confusion with similarly named entities.\nD) The \"or later\" clause automatically transfers to any successor organization if the FSF is dissolved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The FSF's identity is clearly established in several ways:\n\n1. The GPLv3 includes a link to the FSF's website, clarifying which organization it refers to as of 2007.\n2. Previous GPL versions included the FSF's physical address.\n3. The FSF holds trademarks for \"Free Software Foundation\" in the US and EU, preventing unaffiliated organizations from using the name internationally.\n4. Public filings and historical records can trace the FSF's identity back to 2007 and earlier.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not just any organization with the name \"Free Software Foundation\" can publish new GPL versions. The license text refers to a specific entity.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the license text doesn't explicitly define the FSF, there are multiple ways to identify the correct organization, as explained above.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the question of succession if the FSF is dissolved is not clearly addressed in the license text. It's an open question whether the FSF can assign its responsibilities to another entity, and how that would be legally recognized."

That company has using a third party for its main IT system and this system has been sending me e\\-mails.\n\nJust recently I've had a problem with the original company who are claiming to have sent me details on some work that I don't remember receiving. Their response was to tell me the exact time and date (to the nearest second) when I opened the e\\-mail!\n\nAfter doing a bit of analytics on other mails they sent me, I discovered the following:\n\n```\n<img src=\"http://third-party.company.com/wf/open?upn=unique-300-character-identifier\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n```\n\nFor non\\-tech people: what has happened here is that a unique image that is too small to be seen has been embedded in the mail message. When the e\\-mail is opened that image is downloaded from a remote server, which would have record the time and date the mail was opened.\n\nI am really unhappy about being tracked.\n\nFrom a legal POV:\n\n1. I've not consented to this\n2. Can the third\\-party, which is based in the UK, collect this data\n3. Can the third\\-party share it with a company in EU country\n4. I can't see any legitimate business requirement that either company could have for tracking me.\n\nLegally, where do I stand.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would seem to me that a company with which you are doing business has a legitimate reason to confirm that you did or did not receive their messages, just as they would be entitled to send you postal mail with a return receipt if they choose to. They already know the contents of the email, because they are either the sender or the receiver, so the only additional information the tracking pixel gives them is the timestamp of your access to the email.\n\nYou could perhaps stop this by instructing your browser or other email program not to download images, or to prompt you for permission on each image.\n\nSince the Irish company you are doing business with is in the EU (and you are also), the GDPR should apply. Thus they ought to have a lawful basis to process any personal data (PD) relating to you under GDPR [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/). Under \\[Article 13], when a Data Controller (DC) obtains Personal Data (PD) from the data subject, it is supposed to notify the subject that it has done so, and provide certain information to the subject. Article 13 paragraph 1 states:\n\n> Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:\n> \n> \n> * (a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller\u2019s representative;\n> * (b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;\n> * (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n> * (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1\\), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n> * (e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n> * (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1\\), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\nArticle 13 paragraph 2 states:\n\n> In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:\n\n> * (a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n> * (b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;\n> * (c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 9(2\\) \\[consent], the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\n> * (d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n> * (e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;\n> * (f) the existence of automated decision\\-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1\\) and (4\\) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nNote that the DC need not provide this information if the DS already has it. It might be buried in a long ToS document or privacy policy.\n\nThere is a somewhat similar set of information, albeit different in detail, to be provided under [Article 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) when the DC obtains PD from a third party. The obligation under article 14 does not apply when the DS already has the information, when it is impossible or unreasonably hard to comply, or in any of several other conditions.\n\nYou could request of the Irish DC that they supply you with the information required under article 13 or 14\\. You could make the same request of the \"third party company\" but they are probably acting as a Data Processor (DP) in which case the obligation is on the DC.\n\nYou could also make a data access request under [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) winch states:\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:\n\nThis is followed by a list of the details to be provided by the DC.\n\n> 2. Can the third\\-party, which is based in the UK, collect this data\n\nIf the third\\-party is acting as a Data Processor, in accordance with a contract with the DC, they have to same right to collect the information as the DC would have if the DC did this directly, and must abide by the same restrictions, They may share this data with the DC, and with others only at the DC's direction, for which direction the DC is responsible.\n\nUnder [article 27](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-27-gdpr/) a Processor not established in the EU must appoint a representative within the EU to with requests and complaints may be addressed. If the data begin processed does not include \"special\" data (mostly Personally Identifiable Information) \" and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\" no representative is required. You are entitled to request the contact info of the representative. (A DC not in the EU must also have a representative.)\n\n> 3. Can the third\\-party share it with a company in EU country\n\nUnder \\[Article 44] transfers to counties outside the EU are restricted:\n\n> Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. 2All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.\n\nArticles 45 thru 50 specify the specific situations under whch such transfers are lawful. Under article 13(1\\) (f) the DS should be informed of any intention to make such a transfer when the data is collected.\n\n> I \\[can't] see any legitimate business requirement that either company could have for tracking me.\n\nAs I mentioned above, knowing whether and when you read a communication is probably legitimate. Additional tracking might not be. I can find no law or regulation prohibiting such tracking,. but the results are surely PD subject to the GDPR and all its applicable provisions.\n\n> Legally, where do I stand?\n\nIt seems that the Irish Company may have violated the GDPR (arts 13 or 14\\) by not informing you of the information collected. You could request that info, and also access to all PD they have about you under art 15 (linked above). The relevant supervisory authority in Ireland is the  [Data Protection Commission](https://www.dataprotection.ie/). Further relevant information is available on the DPC site, and that is where a complaint could be made.\n\nThe GDPR does not, in most cases, give a DS a personal right to sue a DC. on the page [\"Raising a concern with the commission\"](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/exercising-your-rights/raising-concern-commission)\\_ the DPC writes:\n\n> In today\u2019s business world most organisations take data protection very seriously, and the majority of issues are resolved without ever needing to raise a conern \\[*sic*] with the DPC. However, if you have contacted an organisation about a personal data concern, in keeping with the guidance provided in our \u2018Know Your Rights\u2019 section and you are unhappy with the outcome, you can raise the matter with the Data Protection Commission through our online form.",

Indeed many countries will permit the student to vote by absentee ballot during the period of study.\n\nUnless the student has done something that the laws of the birth country consider to be a reason for losing voting rights or citizenship, there is no issue here. No such thing is mentioned in the question as it now stands. Indeed since the question asks about the student acquiring dual citizenship, it implies that the student has retained citizenship in the birth country, and so presumably voting rights there. The motive suggested for dual citizenship thus does not seem to make sense.\n\nTo acquire citizenship in the country of study the student would need to go through whatever process that country's laws specify. In most countries that includes a statement of intention to remain permanently in that country, and some evidence supporting that intention. The process is also likely to take rather longer than a typical course of graduate study. It is unusual for a student to gain citizenship in a country of study while still a student. It is still more unusual for a student to gain such citizenship and then return, not for just a visit, to the student's birth country.\n\nSome countries allow people being naturalized to retain citizenship in another country, some do not. Some countries allow a person who gains citizenship in another country to retain his or her birth citizenship, others do not.\n\nIf the country of study permits migrants to retain another citizenship while being naturalized, and the birth country permits a citizen to retain citizenship while being naturalized elsewhere, **and**, the student complies with the laws of the country of study for gaining its citizenship, then the student will have obtained dual citizenship. This is unusual, but it is perfectly possible if the laws om the countries involved permit it, and a good many do. But obtaining citizenship in a new country with which one had no previous connection is generally not a simple or quick process.\n\nNow, if one of the student's parents had been a citizen of the country of study, then the student might be able to obtain citizenship there by inheritance. Some countries allow this under some conditions. But that would have nothing to do with the student having gone there for study.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their citizenship and voting rights?\n\nA) The student automatically loses their Indian citizenship and voting rights upon returning to India after studying abroad.\n\nB) The student can easily obtain dual citizenship of India and Germany immediately after completing their studies.\n\nC) The student retains their Indian citizenship and voting rights unless they have taken specific actions to renounce them, but acquiring German citizenship would typically require a longer process beyond the duration of their studies.\n\nD) The student must choose between Indian and German citizenship within 30 days of returning to India, as dual citizenship is universally prohibited.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because:\n1. Studying abroad typically does not result in automatic loss of citizenship or voting rights in one's home country (India in this case).\n2. Acquiring citizenship in the country of study (Germany) usually requires a longer process than the duration of a typical postgraduate program, often including intentions to permanently reside there.\n3. Dual citizenship is possible in some cases, but it depends on the specific laws of both countries involved and is not an automatic or easy process.\n4. The student would likely retain their Indian citizenship and voting rights unless they took specific actions to renounce them or violated Indian laws regarding citizenship.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect as they present overly simplified and inaccurate scenarios. Option B is incorrect because it suggests that dual citizenship is easily obtainable immediately after studies, which is not typically the case."

Their APIs are means to access this streaming service on multiple platforms (e.g. computer, smart phone, etc).\n\nIt is almost certain\\* that the license does not allow for the creation of \"derivative works\" of the copyrighted work, which a video game would be. Thus, streaming services do not have the right to give you API access for a game (and why would they want to, even if they did have that right)?\n\nBy explicitly denying you the ability to so use their service, the streaming services are a) not breaching their license, and b) attempting to indemnify themselves in the case you do somehow use their API to play copyrighted music in your game.\n\n\\*The license would have to explicitly allow for the creation of derivative works; the copyright holders wouldn't give it away for free, because some game developers, such as the makers of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series of games, would be willing to pay for them; as far as I know, there is not a streaming service producing a rhythm game, so it would not be in the streaming services' interest to pay for such an extension of their license.",

Music streaming services purchase licenses for the music they stream, but these licenses generally do not include the right to create derivative works, which a rhythm game would be considered. The streaming services explicitly prohibit such use in their terms to avoid breaching their own licenses and to protect themselves legally. They typically don't have the rights to allow music to be used in games, and acquiring such rights would be costly without clear benefits to the streaming services themselves.

However, I cannot find a record of this court case. Can someone confirm that such a court case exists, and link me to a record of the outcome?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It does not appear to me that such a case exists. A good overview of the issues is present [at the Wikipedia post on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_employee_unionization), whose supporting citation links have mostly rotted.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) denied the right of graduate students at private colleges to unionize in 2004 in a case involving Brown University which was reversed by the NLRB on August 23, 2016\\.\n\nThis did not prevent graduate students at public universities, which are outside the jurisdiction of the NLRB from unionizing, however. Graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana\\-Champagne had their union recognized when the Illinois Court of Appeals held that they were entitled to unionize under state laws related to public employees' unions. This was one of the first cases to successfully recognize a graduate student's union after a long lull in campuses organizing.\n\nThe Wikipedia article claims that this was a 2002 decision (this could be the date that the University and the union [reached an agreement](https://www.uigeo.org/2002/06/) ([stipulations](https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/AHR/Stipulations.pdf)) regarding who was covered by the union), but the case in question appears to be *Graduate Employees Org. v. Il Educ. Labor*, 315 Ill.App.3d 278, 733 N.E.2d 759, 248 Ill.Dec. 84 (Ill. App. 2000\\), although it may have taken until 2002 to implement the ruling on remand from the Illinois Court of Appeals. Several other Illinois university graduate student unions were formed in the wake of this decision. A [2004 case](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/il-court-of-appeals/1234913.html) ([ref also](https://casetext.com/case/board-of-trustees-v-ielrb-2)) held that parking issues were beyond the scope of collective bargaining.\n\nI was not able to locate any case litigating their right to negotiate on matters of housing, however. \n\nBut, if there is such a case in Illinois, it would be in the state courts of the State of Illinois or Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board (IELRB), in the time period from 2000 to the present. You might also try looking at that graduate student union's website, which might mention such a case if it existed.",

Il Educ. Labor established the right of graduate students at public universities in Illinois to unionize.\n\nC) A 2004 case ruled that graduate student unions at Illinois public universities could not negotiate on matters of housing.\n\nD) The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student union was formed as a result of a 2016 NLRB decision.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The case Graduate Employees Org. v. Il Educ. Labor, decided by the Illinois Court of Appeals in 2000, established the right of graduate students at public universities in Illinois to unionize. This was a landmark decision that paved the way for graduate student unionization at public universities in the state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the NLRB's jurisdiction is limited to private institutions, not public universities.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while there was a 2004 case that ruled parking issues were beyond the scope of collective bargaining, there is no mention of a case specifically ruling on housing matters.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student union was recognized much earlier, following the 2000 Illinois Court of Appeals decision, not the 2016 NLRB decision which pertained to private universities."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this clause and its potential implications?\n\nA) This clause is solely a warranty disclaimer and has no effect on the property rights granted by the deed.\n\nB) The clause acts as both a grant exception and a warranty disclaimer, potentially limiting the property rights transferred and the seller's liability.\n\nC) The buyer cannot make any claims against the title policy if issues arise from exceptions listed in the title commitment, even if those exceptions are later removed in an extended coverage policy.\n\nD) This clause has no legal effect on the deed or title insurance, as it refers to a separate document (the title commitment) that is not part of the recorded deed.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The clause \"subject to all permitted exceptions raised in the title commitment ABC\" serves a dual purpose. It acts as a grant exception, potentially limiting the property rights transferred to the buyer by explicitly making the transfer subject to the exceptions in the title commitment. Simultaneously, it functions as a warranty disclaimer, as the seller is effectively stating that they are not warranting against these exceptions.\n\nThis is the most accurate answer because:\n1. It acknowledges both aspects of the clause (grant exception and warranty disclaimer).\n2. It recognizes that the clause could limit the property rights transferred, which is a key concern with such language.\n3. It doesn't overstate the clause's effect on title insurance claims, unlike option C.\n4. It correctly identifies that the clause has a legal effect, contrary to option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the grant exception aspect. Option C is too extreme, as buyers may still have valid claims against the title policy, especially for issues covered by extended policies. Option D is incorrect because the clause, despite referring to an external document, does have legal implications for the deed and potentially for title insurance."

Does this apply to student loans as well? Or is it limited to wage garnishment and due process in court like a normal debt?\n\nI.e., would the federal government bypass the courts and levy my account with no court judgement OR would they be required to sue me in court and serve a lawsuit like a normal debt?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The procedures for garnishing wages due to unpaid taxes and due to unpaid federal student loans are quite similar. Note that in most tax cases, and (it appears) in all student loan cases, you have a right to a hearing to argue against the garnishment.\n\n### IRS procedure:\n\nFrom [IRS Publication 594,](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p594.pdf) page 6:\n\n> If you don\u2019t pay your taxes (or make arrangements to settle your debt), we could seize and sell your property. We will not seize your property to collect an individual shared responsibility payment. We usually seize only after the following things have occurred.\n> \n> \n> * We assessed the tax and sent you a bill,\n> * You neglected or refused to pay the tax, and\n> * We sent you a Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your\n>  Right to a Hearing at least 30 days before the seizure.\n> \n> \n> However, there are exceptions for when we don\u2019t have to offer you a hearing at least 30 days before seizing your property. These include situations when:\n> \n> \n> * The collection of the tax is in jeopardy,\n> * A levy is served to collect tax from a state tax refund,\n> * A levy is served to collect the tax debt of a federal contractor, or\n> * A Disqualified Employment Tax Levy (DETL) is served.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> You can request a Collection Due Process hearing within 30 days from the date of your Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to a Hearing. Send your request to the address on your notice. For more information, see Form 12153, Request for a Collection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing. At the conclusion of your hearing, the Office of Appeals will provide a determination. You\u2019ll have 30 days after the determination to challenge it in the U.S. Tax Court. If Collection Due Process rights aren\u2019t available for your case, you may have other appeal options, such as the Collection Appeals Program.\n\n### Federal student loan procedure:\n\nFrom the website of the [Federal Student Aid office:](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default/collections#wage-garnishment)\n\n> With garnishment, you have the right to:\n> \n> \n> * be sent a notice that explains ED\u2019s \\[the US Dept. of Education's] intention to garnish your wages in 30 days, the nature and amount of your debt, your opportunity to inspect and copy records relating to your debt, your right to object to garnishment, and your option to avoid garnishment by voluntary repayment;\n> * be given an opportunity to enter into a written agreement under terms agreeable to ED to establish a voluntary repayment agreement;\n> * be given an opportunity for a hearing to present and obtain a ruling on\n> \t+ any objection you have to the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt;\n> \t+ any objection that garnishment of 15 percent of your disposable pay would produce an extreme financial hardship; or\n> \t+ any objection stating that garnishment cannot be used at this time because you\u2019ve been employed for less than 12 months after having previously been involuntarily separated from employment;\n> * have the garnishment action withheld by filing a timely request for a hearing, until the hearing is completed and a decision issued; ...\n\nFor student loan garnishments, there do not appear to be exceptions for the right to a hearing (in contrast to the exceptions that exist for certain IRS garnishments.) It also does not appear that there is an equivalent of the U.S. Tax Court, to which one can appeal the result of the initial hearing.",

According to the information provided, federal student loan garnishment procedures always offer the right to a hearing without exceptions. The documentation states that for student loans, \"there do not appear to be exceptions for the right to a hearing.\" In contrast, IRS garnishments for tax debts do have some exceptions where they don't have to offer a hearing at least 30 days before seizing property, such as when \"the collection of the tax is in jeopardy\" or for certain types of levies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the IRS does have a process involving notices and potential hearings before seizing assets, and student loan collections don't always require going through the court system.\n\nOption B is false for both tax debts and student loans, as both typically require some form of notice and opportunity for a hearing before garnishment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the information explicitly states that there don't appear to be exceptions to the right to a hearing for student loan garnishments, unlike some IRS cases."

John may indeed face some legal issues for not properly transferring the title, as many jurisdictions place this responsibility on the seller. However, he is not without options regarding the parking tickets. While he can't report the car as stolen (which would be a false report and potentially criminal), he can contest the tickets by providing evidence that he sold the car to Steve and was not the one violating parking ordinances. This process may be challenging and will depend on local regulations, but it's his best course of action. Options A and D are incorrect as they represent extreme scenarios that don't align with the legal realities described. Option B oversimplifies the situation, as transferring liability won't be \"easy\" given the improper title transfer."

They negotiated for their notice period plus 8 day's pay (the 8 day's pay was called a 'termination award' in the payslip). The job was 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), with an annual salary.\n\nIn the final payslip, the accrued holiday pay was calculated as each owed day being 1/260th of the annual salary (as is standard), and as it was part way through a month the final month's pay was calculated in the same way (working days in month \\* 1/260th of annual salary).\n\nHowever, the 8 days 'termination award' was calculated as only 1/365th of annual salary \\* 8\\.\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is the legal definition of 8 day's worth of annual salary for someone who works 5 days a week in the UK?\n\nDoes it make a difference if the term is \"8 working days\" as opposed to \"8 days\"?\n\nDoes it make a difference if it can be shown that the normal way for that company of working out a daily amount of salary uses the 1/260th method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The legal approach**\n\nUnless there is something unusual about the situation, the courts tend to analyse \"salaries\" as the quid pro quo for \"time work\", and when a salary expressed as an annual amount falls to be pro\\-rated, it is divided by the number of *working* days in that annual period, not the number of calendar days.\n\n\"8 days' worth of pay\" would typically be interpreted as meaning the salary attributable to performing 8 full days' worth of time work, not the salary attributable to whatever time work would be done over 8 calendar days (where some of those days would be non\\-working days).\n\nIf the agreement had been expressed as \"working days\" rather than just \"days\", that certainly would have been less ambiguous on this question.\n\nBut in the presence of ambiguity, the courts are likely to default to analysing it as meaning \"the pay attributable to a day's work\", not \"the pay attributable to the continuation of the employment contract for an additional calendar day\".\n\nThe courts are also unlikely to believe that an employer would be confused about such ordinary payroll concepts for salaried workers.\n\n**Different interpretations of \"salary\"**\n\nAlthough employers are unlikely to be confused about the law, a philosophical confusion arises in this area because there is a competing conception of a \"salary\" which is not as \"fixed time for fixed pay\", but as a regular maintenance payment to the worker which is independent of time worked or any work assessed to have been done.\n\nWhilst there may be normal hours of attendance under this conception, there may also be a latent expectation to attend outside these hours (without expecting additional pay), and also a latent expectation that brief absences or sickness absence will not be reckoned against the salary (as it would be for an hourly\\-paid worker).\n\nThere may also be an acknowledgement that the salaried worker is not always working in any practical sense during their hours of attendance (such as if their role involves overseeing or reacting to unpredictable events), or that at other times they may be working when not in attendance at work (such as study or preparation in free time, or thinking over the weekend).\n\nIn other words, the salaried worker's duty might be to keep \"office hours\", but that is not the measure of their work output or even a measure of the times when they are actually engaged in work. This is not unusual with professional or managerial workers.\n\nHowever, even where both employer and employee might acknowledge this as the reality in a particular case, the courts tend to reject this analysis as too complicated and uncertain to adjudicate upon.\n\nInstead, the courts impose law upon the parties, holding that the primary obligation for which a salaried worker is remunerated are the hours of attendance, and a \"day's pay\" is reckoned accordingly.\n\nEmployers are free to use salaries as an alternative to hourly pay or per\\-diems, but when pro\\-rating disputes come to be adjudicated by the law, the employers have a clear understanding for how the calculation will be performed.",

        "answer": "Question: Based on the legal interpretation of salaries in the UK, how would a court likely calculate \"8 days' worth of pay\" for a salaried employee who works Monday to Friday?\n\nA) As 8/365 of the annual salary\nB) As 8/260 of the annual salary\nC) As 8/52 of the annual salary\nD) As 8/12 of the annual salary\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the legal approach described in the documentation, courts tend to analyze salaries as compensation for \"time work\" when pro-rating is necessary. For an employee who works Monday to Friday, there are typically 260 working days in a year (52 weeks \u00d7 5 days). Therefore, a court would likely interpret \"8 days' worth of pay\" as 8/260 of the annual salary, representing the pay for 8 full working days.\n\nOption A (8/365) incorrectly uses calendar days instead of working days. Option C (8/52) would represent 8 weeks of pay, not 8 days. Option D (8/12) would represent 8 months of pay, which is clearly incorrect for 8 days' worth.\n\nThe courts are likely to default to analyzing pay in terms of working days rather than calendar days, even if the agreement simply states \"days\" without specifying \"working days\". This interpretation aligns with the standard practice of calculating pay for salaried employees based on their working schedule."

Continuing to operate under the guise of the cancelled LLC would be fraudulent, as there is no longer a valid legal entity behind the operations. The other options incorrectly suggest that the California registration can operate independently or that there's a grace period, which is not accurate based on the information provided."
