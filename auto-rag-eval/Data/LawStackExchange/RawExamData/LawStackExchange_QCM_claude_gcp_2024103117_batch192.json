Not long after that they tell me they're joining the army, leaving me with the full rent and 2 cats and making me give up on going to college in favor of working more hours to pay bills.\n\nThey say \"this is a courtesy letter\" as if they're being kind by informing me of my impending state of homelessness.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't paid the down payment nor the monthly payment for the cats but even then they don't even list that as the reason for my eviction, or any reason for that matter.

I work for a company that does litigation support \\- discovery. We have secure servers that we (the company) pay a lot of money for. Based on the case load we may need to scale up fast so must have expensive excess capacity on hand. \n\nWe lost some deals to bids that were less than our cost. I traced them out and almost positive they are using cloud computing. The reputable hosting companies typically have a statement about secure servers and signing for a chain of custody if they receive physical media. \n\nI ran the cost and we can get server capacity on a cloud like an Amazon or Azure for literally pennies on the dollar and get (or release) capacity on demand.\n\nThe owner claims cannot satisfy chain of custody if the data hit a cloud.

Now the customer would most likely need to give us access to the data but very easy to only give us read only access \\- they control the cloud account. Anyone doing review would have read only access. Could a customer sign a (valid) chain of custody if the data hit a cloud?\n\nI am clearly a techy. The original disc is still in a physical chain of custody. What is produced to the court is page by page tiff (or other rendition) redacted (or not) and stamped with a bates number. I know the law is the law and does not need to make sense but the original is not what is produced to the court. I am not getting touched a cloud would invalidate. Can you not just sign that Azure/Amazon was part of chain custody? It is not like the hammer that was used to crush the skull.

On the other hand, opponents don't ask for chain of custody. And when they do, it's going to take a pretty drastic series of events to diminish the admissibility or weight of the evidence in court.\n\nTen years ago chain of custody was taken more seriously but after many recent court opinions about proportionality and cooperation, lawyers don't challenge chain of custody unless something glaring appears to be wrong.\n\nI could go on, but suffice it to say \\- I don't know of any case where chain of custody made a difference in civil litigation.\n\nBe aware that adding cloud storage adds a step to your processing and production workflow. As it is, you probably receive original evidence and process the data, host it for review, and then convert to TIF for production. If the data is hosted in the cloud rather than your local server your attorneys will be waiting for you to get the data uploaded to the review platform. And then when the review is done the production might take longer because of the download. Obviously the production delay is not as severe as the upload for review. There are ways around this, like rolling the upload, but this takes more human hours because of the additional management required.\n\nI'll also add security as the reason to stay out of the cloud.

Indeed, it has been [argued](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2060713) that this limitation only applies to the legislative branch of government and not to the executive (except when exercising legislatively delegated power) or judicial branches.

The key principle is that while individuals have the right to express themselves, private platforms are not obligated to provide a forum for all types of speech.

I did ref law.stackexchange but no on else posted anything.  \n\n2\\. The closest thing I found searching this site was a reference to the Joint Guidance on the Application of FERPA and HIPAA \\- which seems only to concern info collected by the school (not assignments) and who this can be disclosed to.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are certain privacy laws regarding what schools can reveal about students. To completely answer the question, we would have to know the state and school district involved, but we can get a pretty good estimate of the legal situation from applicable federal law, [34 CFR Part 99](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl) (FERPA). That regulation addresses disclosure of student records, and they define \"record\" as \n\n> any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to,\n>  handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film,\n>  microfilm, and microfiche\n\nwhich would include any written assignment (which is somehow written, and contains \"information\"). The regulations also refer to \"personally identifiable information\", which includes the student's name, which would normally be included on any assignment turned in, but could be removed if the teacher wants to in some way redistribute the essay.\n\nSubpart D addresses disclosing PID from a record, and generally consent is required (which could be from the parent, in the case of a minor), except as specified in [\u00a799\\.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=22e4dc673ac41bbc465f0af2269cac7e&mc=true&node=sp34.1.99.d&rgn=div6#se34.1.99_131). This would include for example those within the agency or institution who have been found to have an legitimate educational interest. This would include for example another teacher, the principle, the school psychiatrist (if there is one), but not the lunch lady or janitor. This would also include the psychiatrist who contracts with the school for consultation (but isn't an employee) as long as they are under the direct control of the school. It will also include disclosure to state and local educational authorities, under certain circumstances. (This is just a fragment of the conditions for non\\-consensual disclosure: the short version is, if the disclosure is to the school psychiatrist, it is allowed).\n\n\u00a799\\.36 then addresses \"health and safety emergencies\", which allows disclosure \"if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\", where the agency \"may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals\", and if it \"determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\".\n\nOne thing to note is that this regulation imposes restrictions on the school but not directly on the employee. The institution is expected to construct rules that implement the institutional requirements on their employees. If a disclosure is contrary to federal regulation, the penalty is visited by the government on the institution; the institution will then (hopefully) have established policies that employees will have to follow. Federal regulations do not anticipate that a teacher will make a *sua sponte* decision that a certain child may be a threat to public safety and therefore discloses a record. Instead, the teacher would probably make a disclosure within the organization, at which point the organization makes a decision whether the record needs to be turned over to the police, or someone else within the organization.\n\nAs for the specific case described, since the document presumably does not contain personally identifiable information, the disclosure restrictions do not apply. They do not apply to \"legitimate\" disclosure within the organization, and may not apply to certain kinds of disclosure outside the organization, but probably would prohibit disclosure to a neighbor who happens to be a child psychologist. The organization may well have promulgated rules that apply to employees which grossly misrepresent what the FERPA rules actually say (my employer did, \"out of an abundance of caution\"), so it is possible that the disclosure is contrary to FERPA\\-inspired local policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An instructor at a public university is concerned about the disturbing content of a student's writing assignment.

Discussing the content without revealing the student's name further protects privacy while allowing for a professional assessment.\n\nC) is incorrect because while anonymizing the content might protect the student's identity, posting excerpts publicly is not a protected disclosure under FERPA and could potentially lead to identification.\n\nD) is incorrect because while FERPA does allow disclosure in health and safety emergencies, this decision should be made at an institutional level after careful consideration, not unilaterally by an instructor.

If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that it should be distinguished by some material difference between the facts of the cases; some jurisdictions allow for a judge to recommend that an appeal be carried out. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority.\n\n> b) what the treatment of that decision is on appeal, would the appeals court merely do something along the lines of a GVR or would they hear the case?\n\nA court that has the discretion on whether to hear appeals may exercise that discretion and let the wrong decision stand. They might do this if the error is not material, or the issue is not legally significantly, or the injustice is slight.\n\nA court that has no discretion or one that does and accepts the case will either overturn the lower court decision or, if they are high enough in the chain, uphold the decision and overturn the precedent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A district court judge is presiding over a case that is very similar to a precedent set by the Court of Appeals in their circuit.

Lower courts, including district courts, are bound by the precedents set by higher courts in their jurisdiction. They do not have the authority to simply disregard or overrule these precedents, even if they believe them to be unjust or outdated. The most appropriate action for a judge in this situation is to follow the binding precedent in their ruling, as they are required to do.

The documentation indicates that for most businesses (unlike lawyers), holding customer funds in separate accounts is not highly regulated. However, the key point is that these funds are held in trust for the customers and cannot be used by the company for borrowing or as collateral.

If they did, and they did not define the scope of what they would have to do in the case of a defect or malfunction, they would have to remedy it by repairs within a reasonable time; if they fail, they would have to refund or replace.\n\nThis does not mean that it is likely worth pursuing the matter in court other than maybe in small claims (See: [ohwilleke's reply to this question for a general explanation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242)).

I paid $350 to the lender for the application, and met all qualifications. Link to tax credit: <http://www.iowafinanceauthority.gov/takecredit>. \n\nNow that it is tax time, I need information from the credit approval to receive the credit on my taxes.

I'm at a lighted intersection where I have a green light (unprotected left turn) and oncoming traffic also has a green light to continue straight\n3. I'm making a right turn into a lane where existing traffic in that lane is continuing straight\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it is my responsibility to go only when it is safe to do so, considering the distance of incoming cars and their speed. When it is safe, it is also my responsibility to actually go, to avoid blocking traffic behind me.\n\n**My question: should I turn or not when the incoming traffic comes close to me and stops (or dramatically slows down enough for me to go), even though they have right of way?** This scenario actually happens to me, either because the other driver is confused or just being nice.\n\nOne possibility: by stopping, are they relinquishing right\\-of\\-way and I should go, to avoid blocking traffic behind me.

So that means that you must wait until it's safe to turn left. If you turn left and an oncoming car hits you, then it will appear as if you did not yield as required and caused the accident. You're liable.\n\nNow the situation may be more complicated if an oncoming vehicle appears to yield to you. You can choose to proceed or you can choose to wait. In your case you choose to proceed and if there is no incident, life goes on.\n\nBut you posed the hypothetical that the oncoming driver appears to yield but in fact doesn't or intentionally speeds up after you begin your turn and there is a collision.\n\nSo legally speaking the oncoming driver is at fault because intentionally causing an accident, nearly everywhere, is illegal. But how do YOU prove that happened. It's going to be your word against his unless there are bystanders who witnessed it. It's going to be an uphill battle to win in this case because it appears that you are at fault. Say you had a dashcam that shows the whole thing. Would that necessarily be convincing?

While the oncoming driver may appear to be yielding, there's no guarantee they actually intend to do so. They may be slowing for other reasons, or could even be attempting to set up an insurance fraud scenario. By waiting for the other driver to make their intentions clear (either by stopping completely or resuming normal speed), you avoid putting yourself in a potentially dangerous or legally compromising position. If they do stop completely, you can then proceed cautiously. If they resume speed, you've avoided a potential collision.

Since *the attorney\\-client privilege is with the client, it does not spread to the lawyers if the client is immunized, or does it*? If it turned out that they misled the client (deliberately or not) about the Senate's offer to expedite the testimony, this would have been an act of obstructing a nomination of a SCOTUS judge.

According to the documentation, 18 USC 1515(c) specifically states that the chapter on obstruction of justice \"does not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful, bona fide, legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding.\" This provision would likely protect Ford's lawyers from prosecution for their actions in representing her during the Senate hearing process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even if Ford were given immunity, proving corrupt intent and that the delay constituted an impediment would be challenging. Option B is incorrect because attorney-client privilege does not necessarily protect lawyers from all legal consequences if their client is immunized.

Here's a summary of [Washington firearms laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Washington), the main point of which is that for open carry, no registration is required. Transportation in state follows the unloaded / locked\\-up federal model. The open\\-carry law is [here](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270), which basically says that you can't threaten people with any weapon, but merely being in possession is not a threat.

In a vehicle, this means it should be in a locked container separate from the passenger compartment. This federal law preempts state laws on transportation.

Most subpoenas are issued in the context of pending lawsuits or criminal cases, some can be issues by certain regulatory or criminal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThere are defenses to a subpoena which can be asserted to quash the subpoena before the information is provided by the business. The main defense is that the information is privileged, for example, because it contains attorney\\-client confidences, or it is protected as a trade secret which could be disclosed to a competitor or lose its trade secret status if access to the information is not controlled.\n\nBut, generally speaking, ordinary business records of dealings that a company like Amazon has with its customers are not privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nAnother process which is available but less common when dealing with a third\\-party is a search warrant. In general, a business is not exempt from disclosing records pursuant to a criminal search warrant simply because the records involve non\\-U.S. persons.\n\nThere are also special procedures similar to, but not identical to, subpoenas under the Patriot Act such as \"national security letters\" that can be issued when national security is at issue. Unlike a typical subpoena, the process involved in a national security letter information request must generally be kept secret from the public and from the target of the investigation. National security information requests are overseen the the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court which is a non\\-adversarial court that operates much like a judge or magistrate to whom a criminal search warrant application is made, except that attorneys that practice before it must have security clearances and its proceedings operate with a much higher level of secrecy. National security inquiries are still subject to legal limitations which the FISA court evaluates, although the FISA court has a reputation for being something of a rubber stamp (there is debate over whether this reputation is well earned).\n\nThere is a detailed body of law describing what justifications are necessary for various types of record requests and what exceptions to the duty to disclose exist, but without more specifics in the question, an answer in this forum is not a place for a comprehensive treatise reviewing all of them which could fill several law review articles.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. government agency is investigating potential security threats and seeks data from Amazon's cloud services about non-U.S. customers.

The license purports to exclude the former but not the latter. So, on a literal reading, the license doesn't offend the ACL and is probably fine on that basis alone although this may not be what the licensor intended.\n\nNotwithstanding, even if \"warranty\" and \"guarantee\" are to be read interchangeably it is not clear that this would offend the ACL. Since this is a supply of [services](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caca2010265/s95a.html#services) (not goods) there are only three guarantees in the ACL: Guarantee as to due care and skill (60\\), Guarantees as to fitness for a particular purpose etc. (61\\) and Guarantee as to reasonable time for supply (62\\).\n\nIt should be obvious, given the nature of the website, that 61 and 62 are not going to be applicable. So, this leaves only 60:\n\n> If a person supplies, *in trade or commerce*, services to a *consumer*, there is a guarantee that the services will be rendered with due care and skill.\n\nBefore this ACL guarantee is engaged there needs to be a [consumer](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caca2010265/s51aca.html#consumer) (which there is) and the supply must be \"in trade or commerce\". Trade or commerce is not defined in ACL except circularly in terms of geography:\n\n> \"trade or commerce\" means trade or commerce within Australia or between Australia and places outside Australia.\n\nThis is a deliberate choice by the legislature because s51(i) of the Constitution grants the Commonwealth legislative power \"with respect to trade or commerce\" and clearly legislation cannot define a term that is used in the Constitution (without definition) but it can narrow its definition for the purposes of the Act.\n\n\"Trade or commerce\" is interpreted by the courts based on the totality of the circumstances. A supplier is \"in trade or commerce\" if they are routinely or regularly engaged in 'business' (for\\-profit or not\\-for\\-profit) and the particular supply forms part of that business. However, supplies that are 'personal' rather than 'business' in nature are not captured. Similarly, activities by a 'business' that are not \"in trade or commerce\" such as lobbying (unless their business is as a lobbyist) are excluded.\n\nNote that the Act refers to \"supply\" \\- this includes supplies that are neither contracts and/or for which the consumer provides no consideration. For example, a supermarket giving free samples of a foodstuff is a \"supply\" \"in trade or commerce\" and is captured by the ACL.\n\nWith respect to this particular site, it appears to be a private blog and therefore the supply is not \"in trade or commerce\" so the ACL guarantees are not engaged.\n\nNow, if you wanted to take something under this license, which requires you to use this license when you 'onsell' and you were doing so in the context of a \"supply\" \"in trade or commerce\" to a \"consumer\", you wouldn't be able to.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which of the following statements is true regarding the Ritchey Permissive License and its application in Australia?\n\nA) The license is invalid in Australia because it disclaims all warranties, which is not allowed under ACL.\n\nB) The license is fully enforceable in Australia because it only disclaims warranties and not guarantees, which are treated differently under ACL.\n\nC) The license's applicability in Australia depends on whether the supply is considered \"in trade or commerce\" under ACL.\n\nD) Australians are automatically prevented from accepting the license due to its conflict with ACL.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the applicability of the Ritchey Permissive License in Australia depends on whether the supply is considered \"in trade or commerce\" under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The license's disclaimer of warranties does not automatically invalidate it in Australia, as warranties and guarantees are treated differently under ACL. The key factor is whether the supply falls under \"trade or commerce\" as defined by ACL and interpreted by courts. If the supply is not \"in trade or commerce\" (e.g., a private blog), the ACL guarantees are not engaged, and the license's disclaimer may be upheld. However, if the supply is \"in trade or commerce\" to a consumer, the ACL guarantees would apply, potentially conflicting with the license's terms.

Minimum time from formally demanding possession to being legally allowed to bring suit in this situation. This is almost certainly set by statute. In Georgia, there is no waiting period for this part of the process when rent is not paid as agreed. A lawsuit can be filed the same day that a demand for possession is made by the landlord. OCGA \u00a7 44\\-7\\-50\\.\n2. The time from serving a lawsuit on the tenant to the time that the tenant is required to respond in court. This is almost certainly set by statute or court rule. In Georgia this is seven days from service of process. OCGA \u00a7 44\\-7\\-51\\. Georgia, like most states, allows \"nail and mail\" service by posting a notice on the premises and mailing a notice to the last known address of the tenant, after some reasonable effort has been made to personally service the tenant or any other adult resident, so this step will typically take about seven to ten days.\n3. The time from an appearance in court or court filing by the tenant objecting to the eviction to the time that a hearing is scheduled, in the event that the tenant raises an objection (which is easily done, even if there isn't ultimately a legally valid defense to raise). There may be a legal deadline for this in the statute or court rules, although it can usually be waived. This can also vary based on how many cases are pending relative to the number of available judges, something that usually varies seasonally. Georgia does not have a fixed time period for this step, but \"Every effort should be made by the trial court to expedite a trial of the issues.\" OCGA \u00a7 44\\-7\\-53\\.\n4. The time from an order of eviction as the conclusion of an eviction hearing until the sheriff or marshall actually carries out the eviction that has been ordered by the court. This is almost never a matter of public record or a legal mandate, and it would typically vary seasonally and over the course of a month as the staff available to carry out evictions is pretty constant, but the demand for evictions has monthly peaks that flow from month end leases and rental payment due dates, and seasonally with the end of school years and the end of calendar years being particularly busy times when delays are greater. Sheriffs have also been known to intentionally stall in holiday seasons. This part of the process in Fulton County is set forth [here](http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/images/stories/Marshal/marshal_documents/steps%20in%20the%20eviction%20process%20fact%20sheet.pdf).\n\nThe total time is the sum of these four times. \n\nMost evictions lawyers in the area would know what is typical for (3\\) and (4\\) and would also have a good grasp of how likely it is for a tenant to assert a defense (if the tenant does not, part (3\\) is skipped and a default judgment for eviction is entered on the appearance date).\n\nIn my area (in Colorado), (1\\) is three days, (3\\) is usually about two weeks and (4\\) is usually about one to three weeks, but as noted above, your experience in Atlanta, Georgia could easily vary based upon how busy the courts and the marshall are at that time.\n\nAccording to [this website](http://kimandbagwell.com/evictions/), in Georgia, it is customary to allow 3\\-10 days for step 1 even though it is not legally required, step 3 is typically one to two weeks, and step 4 is typically about two weeks. It is also possible to extent step 2 by one week from one week to two weeks with a procedural tool that most lawyers are aware of in Georgia.

If you try to talk to this DA she will act like she's not a DA and say that she can't discuss the facts. If you don't pay she'll schedule your arraignment and THAT's when you plea. Your best bet is to tell her that you are requesting evidence and in likelihood she'll put your date out far enough.\n\nYou should consider the deferral and the safety course as offers. Offers the DA makes before you get all the evidence. No, you do not have a right to see the evidence before accepting an offer. You have the right to say no to the offer.

Would I violate GDPR if I integrate the [Facebook Chat Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/facebook-chat-plugin) without adding the GDPR consent popup?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When integrating third party plugins, it is important to determine whether that third party is your data processor or another controller.\n\n* When they are your processor, you need a legal basis for the processing purpose and need to have a suitable contract with your processor.\n* When they are a data controller, you need a legal basis for the processing purposes AND a legal basis for sharing this data with the third party.\n\nWhen using Facebook tools, you have to read the fine print in their Business Terms. I will assume that when integrating the Chat Plugin, you and Facebook would act as joint controllers. Facebook would not be your data processor.\n\nSo you need a legal basis for sending data to Facebook. Some information will already be sent merely by loading the plugin in the visitor's browser \u2013 and this will happen whether or not the visitor is a Facebook member.\n\nTwo legal bases seem especially interesting: you might have a legitimate interest for loading this plugin, or you might ask for consent.\n\n* A legitimate interest requires a balancing test between your interests, and the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. The reasonable expectations of the data subject will likely be a factor as well. Here, I would suggest thinking about the reasonable expectations of a visitor who is not a Facebook member. In most cases, when you rely on a legitimate interest you must also give the opportunity to object to further processing, i.e. to opt\\-out.\n* You can base almost any processing activity on consent. This gives you a lot of flexibility at least initially, but you can't use the data for any other purpose, and must make it easy to withdraw consent.\n\nHere, I think that your legitimate interest balancing test would lead you to the conclusion that consent would be the more appropriate legal basis. But this doesn't mean that you need to show a consent banner to every user.\n\nInstead, I would suggest the following procedure before loading any third party plugin or embed (whether a Facebook chat, a Tweet, or a Youtube video). The point is that users are given an informed choice:\n\n* do not load the content by default\n* as a placeholder for the content, or in a popup when the user interacts with the placeholder, show the following information:\n\t+ what the purpose of this content/plugin/embed is\n\t+ that a third party provides the content\n\t+ who the third party is\n\t+ what personal data will be disclosed to the third party, e.g. IP addresses\n\t+ if personal data will be transferred into a non\\-EU country: information about possible risks, e.g. the US does not provide an adequate level of data protection\n\t+ where visitors can find further information about the resulting processing by the third party (e.g. the FB privacy policy)\n\t+ a link to more information in your privacy notice\n\t+ how visitors can revoke consent later\n* if the visitor clicks a button such as \u201cstart chat\u201d or \u201cload content\u201d, treat this as consent\n* store the consent for later visits, e.g. in a cookie\n* make it easy to withdraw consent, e.g. with an easy to reach button that opens a consent management tool\n\nSo instead of asking for consent when your page loads, ask for consent just in time before they're accessing something for which you need consent.\n\nBackground:\n\n* In the Fashion ID case, the ECJ has found that the provider of a website that loads Facebook social plugins such as the Like Button is a joint controller with Facebook. So the website provider is responsible for collecting and sending personal data to Facebook through this button, but they are not responsible for what Facebook later does with this data.\n* At least in Germany, it has long been standard that social plugins are only loaded upon consent, e.g. with a toggle next to the network's logo ([news report from 2011](https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-website-creates-two-click-like-button-facebook-not-amused/)).\n* The list of information to be shown in a popup was modelled after section 3\\.3\\.1 \u201cMinimum content requirements for consent to be \u2018informed\u2019\u201d in the [EDPB guidelines on consent 05/2020](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en).\n* Providing information just\\-in\\-time (just before the user takes a relevant action) and in a layered manner (key information directly, details in a privacy notice) are best practices suggested in the [WP29 guidelines on transparency](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=622227) which were later endorsed by the EDPB.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner wants to integrate the Facebook Chat Plugin without showing a GDPR consent popup to all users.

Obtains explicit consent before loading the plugin.\n4. Allows for easy withdrawal of consent.\n\nOption A violates GDPR by not obtaining any consent.

The information provided indicates that in the United States, civilian ownership of armored vehicles like the Lenco BEARCAT is generally legal with relatively minimal federal regulation. However, there may be some state and local laws that apply. The passage mentions that even tanks and howitzers can be privately owned with modest regulation, suggesting that armored vehicles would face even fewer restrictions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not indicate any strict federal prohibition on civilian ownership. \n\nOption B is inaccurate as the information doesn't mention extensive federal licensing or background checks specifically for these vehicles. \n\nOption D is too extreme, as the passage does mention some level of regulation and potential restrictions on purchasing directly from manufacturers.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the nuanced reality of generally permissive ownership with potential local restrictions and possible limitations on direct purchases from manufacturers."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43182/using-ipinternet-protocol-address-to-calculate-tax", "docs_id": 43182, "title": "Using IP(Internet Protocol address) to calculate Tax", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that if I sell things online, I need to calculate Taxes based on customer location. \n\nCan I use IP(Internet Protocol address) to locate customer or should I ask them explicitly?\n\nIf it is fine to use IP to identify customer's Country, is it fine to locate customer State/Province. \n\nI need it because Canada has different taxes in different Provinces.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You ask them explicitly, maybe adding that you need that info specifically to calculate tax.\n\nIP address is not reliable because your customers could be using VPN, Tor, or be on vacation overseas.\n\n(By the way, \"IP\" on a website about law would more likely be understood as \"Intellectual Property\", not \"Internet Protocol address\".)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An e-commerce business owner wants to ensure accurate tax calculation for customers in different locations.

As for cancellation, you have to look at the applicable laws. In Washington state, for example, [there is a law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=48.18.290) governing insurer cancellation of insurance. For insurance other than fire and medical malpractice insurance,\n\n> The insurer must deliver or mail written notice of cancellation to the\n> named insured at least forty\\-five days before the effective date of\n> the cancellation\n\nand for medical malpractice, the timing is 90 days; or 5 days for fire insurance. The net result is that all forms of insurance require written notice of cancellation.\n\nThe terms of an insurance policy can be changed by the insurer: they must tell you of these changes, and you do not have to \"ask for\" them. If you don't like the changes, you can attempt to persuade them to not make the change, or you can cancel the insurance.\n\nWhether or not an insurance broker is authorized by the insurer to act in a particular way depends on the broker's actual relationship to the insurer. In Washington state, agents and brokers are subsumed under one concept \"insurance provider\". Agents and brokers are generally not empowered by the insurer to do wholesale re\\-writings of policies (e.g. adding coverage for seismic damage for all customers). An agent or broker cannot, however, unilaterally add \"medical malpractice insurance\" specific to your homeowner's policy without your approval.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in Washington state receives a notice that their homeowner's insurance policy has been cancelled, effective in 30 days.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The cancellation is valid because the broker, as an insurance provider, has the authority to cancel policies on behalf of the insurer.\n\nB) The cancellation is invalid because Washington state law requires at least 45 days' notice for policy cancellations.\n\nC) The cancellation is valid as long as the broker can prove they were instructed by the insurer to cancel the policy.\n\nD) The cancellation is invalid because only the insurance company, not the broker, can issue cancellation notices.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Washington state law (RCW 48.18.290), for insurance other than fire and medical malpractice, \"The insurer must deliver or mail written notice of cancellation to the named insured at least forty-five days before the effective date of the cancellation.\" In this scenario, the notice was given only 30 days in advance, which is less than the required 45 days.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while brokers are considered \"insurance providers\" in Washington, they do not have the authority to unilaterally cancel policies without adhering to state laws.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because regardless of the broker's instructions, the 45-day notice requirement must still be met.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in that the insurer should be the one issuing the cancellation notice, but it's not the main reason the cancellation is invalid in this case.

Lets say I own a million dollars in real estate in an LLC. If someone has a grievance against me personally, let's say the were attacked by my dog or something and they have a valid case against me personally, can they then go and sue me for the assets in the company I own?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A business owned by a debtor is not itself liable for the debts of its owners.\n\nBut, a membership interest in an LLC is one of your assets and is normally not exempt from creditors, so legal process may be used to collect a money judgment obtained by a creditor in a suit against the membership interest owner from this asset.\n\nThere are several ways of doing this that a creditor can utilize, each of which is discussed below.\n\nCharging Orders And Writs of Garnishment\n========================================\n\nThe presumptive way for a judgment creditor to collect a judgment from a debtor's LLC membership interest asset to do this is to either garnish any monies the LLC owes to you with a writ of garnishment (so that the LLC would pay the amounts due to the debtor to the creditor instead), or to impose a \"charging order\" on the LLC interest, which is like a writ of garnishment that remains in force until the full amount of the debt authorizing the charging order is satisfied.\n\nThe downside of a writ of garnishment or charging order is that the people who control the LLC can often defer distributions to the members indefinitely, which deprives you of the funds that would otherwise have been distributed to you, but doesn't let the creditor have those funds either.\n\nSome LLCs require that certain distributions be made to owners and require that the LLC be liquidated under certain circumstances (e.g. the completion of a real estate development project). But, those LLCs are the exception rather than the rule. Normally, an LLC only makes distributions to its members when the people who control that LLC decide to do so by a majority vote of the managers or of the managing\\-members as the case may be.\n\nWrits of Execution Directed To Membership Interests\n===================================================\n\nThere is a split in authority between states (with many states not having resolved the issue) over whether you can enforce a money judgment against the owner of a membership interest not just by collecting money due to the owner as a result of the membership interest and instead use a writ of execution to seize the membership interest and sell it in a sheriff's sale to whomever bids at the sale (much like someone might seize a parcel of real estate or a car to pay a debtor's debts to a judgment creditor).\n\nIn most states, even if this is allowed, the buyer at the auction gets the right to distributions from the membership interest seized, but not a vote on how the business of the company is conducted, unless the other members agree to grant the new owner voting rights or the operating agreement of the LLC provides otherwise.\n\nAll of the remedies so far presume that the asset to be collected out of consists of the ownership interest in the LLC (analogous to shares of stock) rather than the assets of the LLC itself.\n\nReverse Piercing\n================\n\nSeizing assets of the LLC itself, rather than merely the ownership interest in the LLC, is called \"reverse piercing\". Usually, reverse piercing is not allowed. But, there are some circumstances where reverse piercing is sometimes allowed.\n\nAlmost all jurisdictions allow reverse piercing in some circumstances, but those circumstances vary considerably from state to state based upon both the language of the relevant LLC statute and the relevant case law.\n\nThere are four main circumstances that justify reverse piercing.\n\nSingle Member LLCs\n------------------\n\nOne is the case of a single member LLC where the creditor obtains ownership of 100% of the LLC. In these circumstances, courts have allowed creditors to dissolve the LLC and reach its assets, because neither the debtor nor any third party other than the creditor has any legitimate ownership interest in the property.\n\nAlter Ego Cases\n---------------\n\nAnother is the case where the assets of the LLC and the personal assets of the debtor are co\\-mingled or there is not clear documentation existing prior to the litigation establishing which underlying assets belong to the LLC and which belong to its owner. In these cases, reverse piercing is allowed because the existence of a company identity has been disregarded and there is no *de facto* distinction between company assets and personal assets. This justification for reverse piercing is sometimes called an \"alter ego\" theory.\n\nFraudulent Transfers\n--------------------\n\nA third case where reverse piercing is allowed is where the contribution of the asset to the capital of the LLC was a \"fraudulent transfer\" from the individual debtor to the LLC (e.g. if the $1 million parcel of real estate was sold to the LLC for $100 at a time when the debtor was insolvent or rendered insolvent as a result of the transfer).\n\nContributing an asset to the capital of an LLC in exchange for a membership interest with a capital account in the LLC's books set based upon the fair market value of the asset contributed to the LLC is usually not considered a fraudulent transfer, but could be in particular facts and circumstances where it has the intended effect of hindering creditors or concealing an asset.\n\nEquitable Reverse Piercing Based Upon Control Of The Entity\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA fourth case where reverse piercing is sometimes allowed is where the debtor does not own 100% of the LLC but has the ability to dissolve the LLC or force its assets to be distributed in kind to him, without the assent of the other LLC owners, because the debtor controls the LLC. Whether this is allowed or not is another issue upon which there is a split of authority and in many cases simply an absence of authority which would make such a case one of first impression in a state.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John owns 60% of an LLC that holds $2 million in real estate assets.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the creditor's ability to access the LLC's assets?\n\nA) The creditor can only obtain a charging order against John's LLC interest, limiting collection to distributions made by the LLC.\n\nB) The creditor can seize and sell John's LLC membership interest at a sheriff's sale, but the buyer would only receive economic rights, not voting rights.\n\nC) The creditor can directly seize the LLC's real estate assets through a standard writ of execution.\n\nD) The creditor may be able to use equitable reverse piercing to reach the LLC's assets based on John's control and ability to force dissolution.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement in this scenario. While options A and B describe common methods of pursuing an LLC interest to satisfy a personal debt, they don't fully address the unique circumstances presented. Option C is incorrect because standard writs of execution cannot directly seize LLC assets for a member's personal debts.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that equitable reverse piercing might be available in this case. The fact that John has the unilateral ability to dissolve the LLC and force distribution of its assets, despite not being the sole owner, creates a situation where some jurisdictions might allow reverse piercing. This falls under the \"Equitable Reverse Piercing Based Upon Control Of The Entity\" category mentioned in the source material. While not universally accepted, this approach recognizes that John's level of control effectively negates the asset protection normally provided by the LLC structure.\n\nIt's important to note that the availability of this remedy would depend on the specific jurisdiction and case law, as the text indicates there's a split of authority on this issue.

The government therefore cannot reward or punish a person for believing in skin walkers, nor for turning themselves into a coyote (if they can do it).

If the complainant can present medical records or similar evidence of malpractice or neglect taking place in the past, the defendants have to choose between being held accountable for their conduct and the following options:\n\na) destroying the evidence the complainant can present;\nb) attempting to prove that the documents pesented by the complainant were forged;\nc) forging documents which will make the complainant's evidence appear unconvincing or incomplete as a source of information about the events in question.\n\nThis is not necessarily a complete list. I suppose, several measures were designed for making these options less accessible or less appealing. I wonder, how easy is it to evade these preventive strategies? What resources at a minimum are required to this end? If a considerable number of such instances was documented, can anyone provide the common characteristics of exposed or alleged forgers in these cases? I think, if it was clear when the complainant should fear falsification of the evidence by the defendant, it would be easier to prevent forgery or prevent the forged material being accepted by the court as an authentic one. For instance, if there are several defendants, it would be wiser first to file a suit against those of them who are least likely to evade justice.\n\nI considered formulating this question without references to specific charges, I think, it would be a more interesting question, but I'm afraid it may also become too vague.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Falsification of evidence, forgery of documents, destruction of evidence (which is called \"spoliation\"), giving false testimony under oath or otherwise, and all manner of other similar conduct can make it hard to impose civil liability in the court system (or to prevent its imposition when it isn't called for), and does happen from time to time.\n\nSometimes it is more blatant and verifiable. Other times it involves testimony that you know is clearly false but proving that is difficult or impossible.\n\nIn my experience, medical malpractice defendants who are medical doctors routinely lie in testimony in ways that are non\\-verifiable, but very rarely falsify documents or provide false testimony regarding verifiable facts, frequently setting up a credibility fight for a finder of fact (i.e. judge in bench trial or jury in a jury trial). Medical doctors tend to be more honest and use fewer fraudulent litigation tactics than law enforcement officers sued in civil rights actions, but are less honest on average than business managers who are in commercial litigation who aren't in sales, and also less honest on average than professionals in mechanical and engineering fields. Fraudulent litigation conduct tends to be more common when the alleged wrongdoing is emotionally charged and personal.\n\nJudges usually take great pains to refrain from calling any witness out for lying, unless there is unequivocal evidence that an intentional lie, rather than a situation where a failure of memory or misperception led to a disputed issue of fact.\n\nThis kind of conduct almost never gives rise to criminal charges when it does happen in civil litigation. It often leads to sanctions against the litigant who uses this tactic in the context of the court case (often quite draconian ones) and it sometimes leads to ethical complaints against an attorney for someone who does this (or who does this personally) knowing that it is being done in the case, often resulting in a lengthy suspension of a license to practice law or disbarment.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of conduct can be career ending and economically unsurvivable when a court feels that someone has done so. I've seen awards in excess of $1 billion in lawsuits involving large publicly held companies where this has been documented.\n\nIdentifying cases where this happens is more art than science, and often involves a healthy amount of good luck. There is no one strategy involved in identifying it, but seeking the same information from multiple sources and finding inconsistent results, noticing subtle irregularities in documents, understanding the context of the situation and what usually happens when people are honest, are among the methods used.\n\nIt is very difficult to defeat this fraudulent efforts to present false evidence, and even when falsification is discovered it is often discovered at such a late stage that it may be difficult or impossible to remedy the harm done. It is always more expensive to deal with these kinds of tactics, although the magnitude of the extra costs varies wildly.\n\nMost of the time, it is never discovered at all unless the stakes in the case are so high that extraordinary efforts to leave no stone unturned are justified economically in the litigation.\n\nThere are tactics that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of misconduct (like securing access to documentation and taking witness statements as soon as possible and ideally before a records custodian realizes its significance), but none are foolproof.\n\nA fairly typical example of this was in a securities fraud case that I once represented plaintiffs in, in which the defendant submitted one set of bank statements in response to discovery requests from us, and the same bank statements obtained by subpoena directly from the bank revealed that the defendant had photoshopped years of bank statements in an effort to deceive the plaintiffs.\n\nGenerally speaking, the larger the bureaucracies involved in the case, and the more people who were involved in the situation, the harder it is to get away with something along these lines.\n\nFor example, in a medical malpractice case, an instance of malpractice that happens in the office of a doctor who practices alone with only one staff person who is also her husband, demonstrated by a single in house document is much easier to cover up with fraud than a pattern of conduct in a large health care provider network involving encounters with dozens of professionals at multiple large hospitals generating thousands of pages of documentation, and managed by third\\-party administrators.\n\nUltimately, there is only so much you can do to hedge against the risk that parties to lawsuits will engage in fraudulent conduct. But, because of the dire consequences that arise when someone is caught red handed doing so, this kind of litigation conduct is very rare.\n\nWhile false or misleading testimony on \"squishy\" issues of motive or opinion, or on impossible to verify points like recollections of unrecorded conversations, happens in perhaps one in five or so actively litigated cases, outright fraudulent tactics of the kinds discussed in the OP probably happens in significantly less than one case in twenty actively litigated cases, but probably does happen in at least one actually actively litigated case in two hundred cases.\n\nIn the absence of omniscience, or Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, this is the best that lawyers and the judicial system can do.\n\nThis kind of conduct is sufficiently rare that it doesn't materially upset the usefulness of the legal system for seeking recourse in civil actions. There are backstops like bankruptcy that exist, in part, in recognition of the fact that courts sometimes reach unjust results.\n\nFar more cases are wrongly decided due to attorney or judicial incompetence in cases with a complete absence of fraudulent litigation conduct, or from the misguided whims and misunderstandings of juries in cases with a complete absence of fraudulent litigation misconduct, than are wrongly decided as a result of successful fraudulent litigation misconduct.\n\nAlso, even when fraudulent tactics are used in litigation and aren't caught, these tactics don't always turn the tide in favor of the party using them in litigation, because the people who use those kinds of tactics often don't have a good understanding of what facts are and are not legally important in their cases. It also isn't uncommon for fraudulent litigation tactics to be used in cases where the person employing them is actually in the right on the merits in the absence of these tactics, even though they are unscrupulous when it comes to their responses to accusations of wrongdoing.

Statements meant only as hyperbole or parody or metaphorically, if a reasonable audience person would understand the statements in that sense, do not impose liability based upon what they would mean if taken literally.\n\n**Other Countries**\n\nAs noted in the question itself, not all countries treat statements like this the same way.

The key factors are whether the statement could be reasonably taken as literal and if it's false. Calling someone a \"CRAZY woman\" in the heat of an argument would likely be seen as hyperbole or an insult rather than a literal claim about mental health. The U.S. has strong First Amendment protections for speech, even if it's insulting. This differs from some other countries, like certain Asian nations or Germany, where insults can be more strictly regulated.

When you are physically there it is easier for you to personally assess the patient's condition rather than just taking someone else's word for it, and you have more informal access to everything that is going on in terms of people coming in and out of the patient's room, providers you wouldn't have known to speak to initiating conversations with you (e.g. there is typically an ER nurse for each shift, several residents doing rounds checking on a patient, and often also an outside specialist doctor involved in the treatment team).\n\nIt is also usually easy when you are physically in a hospital to locate someone knowledgable and familiar with the kinds of issues you are facing at the moment to provide spiritual and religious guidance if you feel this would help you make your decision, while your neighborhood clergy person may not have a good understanding of these issues since they don't come up as often for someone is doesn't frequently spend time around people being treated in hospitals or hospices. And, this kind of pastoral counseling requires not just religious knowledge but an understanding of the options that are being presented through the lens of what is religiously and morally important about the differences between the different options.\n\nWhen I was an attorney for a hospital handling these issues for the hospital, we would have been willing to work with an out of state medical power of attorney agent without their physical presence. But, the fact that this was deep in the Rocky Mountains far from other urban areas (i.e. Grand Junction, Colorado) may have influenced a willingness to be flexible since it would often take a lot of time and money for someone to arrive in person.\n\nAlso, while the medical power of attorney gives a specific person authority to act, an advanced medical directive is simply a document that goes into a patient's medical record that advises treating providers of the patient's intent and doesn't actually need next of kin approval or a medical power of attorney agent's say so to implement, although better practice is to seek that consent first in case there are any reasons why that advanced medical directive might have been procured improperly from someone lacking capacity or subsequently revoked.\n\nThere usually will be forms for a medical power of attorney agent to sign, not authorizing a particular medical procedure, but authorizing treatment in general and providing personal and financial information about the patient in connection with admitting that person. But, these days, hospitals are relatively comfortable with handling that paperwork via fax or scanned copies sent via email, and some of the more flexible hospitals will even accept photos of signed documents sent via text message.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A medical power of attorney agent living in Washington State is making decisions for an incapacitated person in California.

These include better assessment of the patient's condition, easier communication with the healthcare team, and access to pastoral counseling if needed. However, hospitals are generally willing to work with out-of-state agents and accept signed documents via fax, email, or even text message in some cases.

The distinction between a 'free state' and an 'independent state' in this context reflects France's attempt to grant Vietnam some autonomy without relinquishing overall control. A 'free state' allowed Vietnam to have its own government, parliament, army, and finances, giving it a degree of self-governance. However, it fell short of full independence, as France still maintained ultimate authority. This arrangement aligned with France's interests in the region following the complex geopolitical events of World War II and the subsequent conflicts in Indochina.

Those are one from of wage control. I think that [*West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*, 300 U.S. 379 (1937\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Hotel_Co._v._Parrish) was the key case on that issue. By the 1970s this was probably regarded as settled, and so was not raised in the challenge to the laws of that date.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the constitutional basis for Congress's power to impose wage and price controls, as exemplified by President Nixon's actions in 1971?\n\nA) The power to impose wage and price controls stems solely from the President's executive authority and does not require congressional approval.\n\nB) The constitutionality of wage and price controls was first established in Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally, which directly addressed Congress's power to regulate wages and prices.\n\nC) The constitutional basis for wage and price controls is primarily rooted in Congress's commerce power, as established through a series of Supreme Court cases dealing with various economic regulations.\n\nD) Wage and price controls are unconstitutional and were never properly challenged in court due to their temporary nature.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The constitutional basis for Congress's power to impose wage and price controls is primarily rooted in the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. This power was established through a series of Supreme Court cases, particularly during the New Deal era, that upheld various forms of economic regulation. \n\nCases such as Wickard v. Filburn, Nebbia v. New York, and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish set precedents for congressional and state authority to regulate economic activities, including prices and wages. These decisions expanded the interpretation of the Commerce Clause to allow for broad federal regulatory power over economic matters.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the President implemented the controls in 1971, the authority was delegated by Congress and based on congressional power.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally primarily addressed the issue of delegation of power to the President, not the fundamental constitutionality of wage and price controls.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because wage and price controls, in various forms, had been upheld as constitutional in multiple Supreme Court cases prior to 1971."}}
