I'm curious about the legality of renewing my secondment without informing me or without my consent.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can't tell, since we haven't seen the relevant contracts. Ordinarily a secondment agreement would be between companies X and Y, and you are not a party to the contract, therefore your agreement is irrelevant. But we don't know if you are, legally speaking, a party to the contract. Check the secondment agreement that you signed to see what it says, and if you didn't, then that's one reason why your agreement to renew is not needed.\n\nNote [this article](https://www.globalworkplaceinsider.com/2020/05/ten-essential-terms-of-secondment-agreements/) with a South African perspective on such agreements. The first point is\n\n> When agreeing to participate in a secondment, the terms of the\n> secondee\u2019s employment contract will inevitably be varied. The\n> secondment agreement must therefore provide that the secondee agrees\n> to the variation of the terms of their employment. The employer must\n> therefore ensure that the secondee agrees to the arrangement before\n> concluding the secondment agreement. The secondee must be a party to\n> the agreement or otherwise consent to the terms affecting the\n> secondee\n\nthough it is IMO a leap to conclude that the terms of your contract with X is *inevitably* varied. It might be: so check what your contract with X says. Did they unilaterally change the terms of your employment? Or is this reassignment consistent with those terms? Still, you have implicitly accepted such a reassignment by continuing for a year to work for Y without objecting to the renewal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee working for Company X has been seconded to Company Y for two years. The secondment was renewed without informing the employee. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The renewal is automatically illegal because the employee wasn't informed.\nB) The renewal is always legal as long as Companies X and Y agree, regardless of the employee's consent.\nC) The legality depends on the terms of the original secondment agreement and the employee's contract with Company X.\nD) The employee's implicit acceptance by continuing to work for a year after the renewal makes the renewal legal, regardless of other factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of renewing a secondment without informing the employee depends on several factors, primarily the terms of the original secondment agreement and the employee's contract with their primary employer (Company X). The documentation suggests that:\n\n1. Secondment agreements are typically between the two companies involved, and the employee may not be a party to this agreement.\n2. However, if the secondment varies the terms of the employee's original employment contract, the employee's consent may be required.\n3. The employee's contract with Company X may or may not allow for such reassignments without explicit consent.\n4. While continuing to work might imply acceptance, it doesn't necessarily make the renewal legal if it contradicts existing contractual terms.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the specific terms of the agreements involved, it's not possible to definitively state whether the renewal is legal or not.

The service processes these numbers to prevent calls from reaching the user. Under GDPR, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the lawful basis for processing and the company's obligations?\n\nA) The company can rely solely on Article 6(1)(d) as its lawful basis for processing, as blocking unwanted calls is always considered a \"vital interest\" of the data subject.\n\nB) The company must obtain explicit consent from the individuals whose phone numbers are being blocked before processing their data.\n\nC) The company can likely rely on Article 6(1)(f) as its lawful basis for processing, but must also comply with Article 14 requirements for informing data subjects about the processing of their data.\n\nD) The company is exempt from GDPR requirements entirely because it is acting on behalf of its users who provide the phone numbers to be blocked.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. The company can likely rely on Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR, which allows processing necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party. In this case, the legitimate interest would be providing the call-blocking service to its users.\n\nHowever, the company must also comply with Article 14 of GDPR, which requires certain information to be provided to data subjects when their personal data is obtained from a third party (in this case, the service's users). This includes informing the individuals whose numbers are being blocked about the processing of their data, the purpose of processing, and their rights under GDPR.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Article 6(1)(d) typically applies to more urgent situations, and blocking calls is not always considered a \"vital interest.\" Option B is incorrect because explicit consent is not necessarily required if another lawful basis (like legitimate interests) applies.

It is a DMCA violation. There are technical measures in place that check that the OS is running on an Apple branded computer. These measures are easily circumvented, but they need to be circumvented, which makes it a DMCA violation. A company selling computers with MacOS installed (Psystar) was ordered to pay $2,500 per computer for the DMCA violation (they never paid Apple, they didn't even have money to pay their lawyers). \n\nIn practice, Apple will ignore you *as long as you don't make claims that what you do is legal*. Buying a Mac with legally owned version of MacOS and not using is makes absolutely no difference. \n\nAnd it would *never* be fair use. It is either copyright infringement or it is not, bue it is *never* fair use. \"Fair use\" is not about \"being fair\". It is about a very specific set of excuses that you can have why your copyright infringement shouldn't be punished. You are not using MacOS for parody, or just tiny extracts.\n\nFor example, if you copied ten lines of source code from MacOS, Linux and Windows to demonstrate in a computer science course how different operating systems handle the same task in different ways, that would quite likely be \"fair use\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer wants to create a hackintosh (non-Apple hardware running macOS) for personal use.

Purchasing Apple hardware but not using it does not grant permission to install macOS on non-Apple hardware. The EULA prohibits this, and it would still involve circumventing technical measures, violating the DMCA.\n\nB) Incorrect. Buying other Apple products does not entitle a user to install macOS on non-Apple hardware. This does not change the legal status of creating a hackintosh.\n\nC) Correct. Using small portions of macOS code for educational purposes in a computer science course could potentially fall under fair use. The documentation specifically mentions this as an example that \"would quite likely be 'fair use'.\"\n\nD) Incorrect. While Apple may ignore individual users who don't publicly claim their hackintosh is legal, circumventing technical measures is still a DMCA violation, regardless of whether claims about legality are made.\n\nThe key point is that running macOS on non-Apple hardware is generally not legal due to EULA restrictions and DMCA violations.

I.e. the court may force impose ABA therapy.\nWhat legal regime gives courts the power to impose this controversial therapy on kids and disabled?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, it stems from some statute, such as [RCW Ch. 71\\.05](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=71.05&full=true) in Washington state, which starts by stating the rationale for the law, and which are to protect the health and safety of persons suffering from behavioral health disorders and to protect public safety, and prevent inappropriate commitment of persons living with behavioral disorders and to eliminate legal disabilities that arise from involuntary commitment etc. The various laws in this chapter make it possible to commit a person to a mental institute or to undergo involuntary therapy. There is a separate chapter, [RCW 71\\.34](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.34&full=true), applicable to minors.\n\nIn general, this law calls for professional evaluation and treatment, without legislating science. The trigger is generally evidence of a tendency towards serious harm or grave disability, with a requirement that the action be requested by a certain kind of behavioral professional. There are not many hard\\-coded limits on what can be ordered: while [RCW 71\\.05\\.215](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.215) \"has a right to refuse antipsychotic medication\", that right is overridden when \"it is determined that the failure to medicate may result in a likelihood of serious harm or substantial deterioration or substantially prolong the length of involuntary commitment and there is no less intrusive course of treatment than medication in the best interest of that person\".\n\nAlong with the legislation cited, there are also [regulations](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/Wac/default.aspx?cite=246-341) which don't require legislative action (they are \"empowered\" by the statutes), which could specifically forbid a treatment, but again choice of treatments are left to the professional. In some other jurisdiction, it's possible that a certain treatment would be explicitly outlawed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of court-ordered therapy for individuals with behavioral health disorders, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal framework in the United States?\n\nA) Courts have unlimited power to impose any form of therapy they deem necessary, without consideration of professional medical opinions.\n\nB) Federal law explicitly prohibits the use of controversial therapies like ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) for autistic individuals.\n\nC) State laws, such as those in Washington, provide a general framework for involuntary treatment, but typically leave specific treatment decisions to qualified professionals.\n\nD) Court-ordered therapy is only permissible for adults and cannot be applied to minors under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. State laws, like those in Washington (RCW Ch. 71.05 and 71.34), provide a general legal framework for involuntary treatment of individuals with behavioral health disorders, including minors. These laws typically require professional evaluation and evidence of potential harm or grave disability. However, they do not usually specify or prohibit particular therapies. Instead, they leave the choice of treatment to qualified professionals, while providing some safeguards and rights to patients. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because courts do not have unlimited power and must operate within the legal framework, which includes consideration of professional opinions. \n\nAnswer B is false because there is no federal law explicitly prohibiting controversial therapies like ABA. Regulation of such therapies is generally left to state laws and professional standards.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, as mentioned in the passage, there are laws (like RCW 71.34 in Washington) that specifically address involuntary treatment for minors."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18100/is-this-nda-terminated-after-the-date-shown", "docs_id": 18100, "title": "Is this NDA terminated after the date shown?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have signed an NDA between my company and another company.

So the company can just tell you that you don't have to come back the next day. They may give the person some severance, but they don't have to, not to mention that they don't have to give the person a \"big package\" that they find hard to refuse.\n\nSo what is the reason companies give them a big package to leave?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are really about three tiers of employees for these purposes. Also, the reasons are a mix of legal and business considerations.\n\nAt the bottom, severance payments can be made in lieu of unemployment insurance claims being made by the laid off employees. Severance payments for workers at the very bottom are often modest.\n\nAt the top, \"golden parachutes\" are often written into the individually negotiated employment contracts of senior executives. Someone like a Steve Jobs will have negotiated a contract very favorable to him in the event of his termination with the board of directors when he is hired with attorneys on both sides heavily involved in its drafting.\n\nIn between, one of the reasons is to get a waiver of claims, for example, due to allegations of employment discrimination, harassment, and past work place related injuries that weren't properly processed through the worker's compensation system, and to reaffirm the existence of non\\-competition, non\\-solicitation, non\\-disclosure, non\\-disparagement, and assignment of intellectual property rights of the terminated employees.\n\nBeing able to \"dot i's and cross t's\" and definitively foreclose litigation from laid off employees also looks good to stockholders and prospective investors. If severance agreements cutting off liability and ruling out the possibility that sloppy paperwork could compromise the firm's intellectual property to be compromised by disgruntled former employees who no longer have a stake in the firm's well being were entered into, a larger layoff would often be followed by a stock price lag reflecting unknown contingent liabilities and intellectual property risks from former employees.\n\nClosing off residual liability is particularly important in firms with stock or stock option compensation for a large group of employees and for firms with defined benefit pension plans.\n\nBut, it goes beyond that. There is also just a sense of moral obligation on the part of senior managers establishing the severance terms to good, loyal employees who are losing their jobs of often many years through no fault of their own. Most of those senior managers were once in the same position, worked with the employees who were laid off personally, and can related to their plight. In a publicly held firm, even for insider members of the board of directors, the shareholders are an impersonal abstraction, while the laid off employees are genuine people whom the executives implementing the plan know a sample of personally.\n\nOf course, institutionally, this economy wide practice of big businesses also helps to fend off pressures from governments to impose bigger severance payment requirements as a matter of law. Substantial severance payments also discourage unionization by the employees who aren't laid off since it makes the employer look trustworthy despite not having its feet held to the fire by the law or a union.\n\nFinally, it is a given that many of the laid off employees will land on their feet finding mid\\- to senior level jobs in the same industry or a related industry, or starting their own firms that may do business with the firm that laid them off, either as consultants providing institutional knowledge that was lost in the layoff to due carelessness, or as vendors or joint venture partners. A stingy severance package could sow ill will towards the former employer that could come back to bite that firm later, while a generous package will rarely leave significant ill will from the former employees who find new positions whom the firm will end up dealing with later on.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company is planning to lay off a significant number of employees.

By law a person or a family needs to pay this monthly fee regardless of actual usage of this service.

Countries can prosecute their citizens for actions committed abroad, but typically only do so for certain types of crimes. For instance, many countries prosecute crimes against humanity or child sex offenses committed by their citizens anywhere in the world. However, for minor offenses, countries generally do not assert extraterritorial jurisdiction. The question of prosecution is not universally determined by international law (eliminating option D), nor is it automatically based on citizenship (eliminating option B) or the legality of the action in the country where it was performed (eliminating option A).

How do the advertisers have the right to broadcast something that I would definitely bring up to HR if I heard a coworker say?\n\nThe contexts are too different. One cannot expect much similarity on how the unsolicited explicit communications are addressed.\n\nOn platforms such as Youtube the unsolicited explicit material is not sent specifically to you, but to a set of users who at best have some characteristics in common. By contrast, akin communications in a work environment are much likelier to constitute harassment insofar as they usually are intended for a *specific* person. Your own use of the term \"*broadcast*\" reflects your acknowledgment of that difference.\n\nAnother difference relates to the recipient's dependency on the environment where the unpleasant communications occur.

In the past, I have declined services by a provider because the provider's contract contains a clause mentioning arbitration as the method for dispute resolution.\n\nIf you disagree with the outcome from arbitration, you would be reasonably tempted to appeal anyway. The problem is that courts give high deference to decisions reached in arbitration. [*Lackawanna Cty v. Employees Association*, 177 A.3d 1058, 1062 (2018\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inpaco20180110603) is a recent case from Pennsylvania that illustrates this point (I'm adding the emphasis in the excerpt) :\n\n> a reviewing court does not inquire into whether the arbitration\n>  decision is reasonable or even **manifestly unreasonable**, but rather the\n>  question is whether the award may in any way be rationally derived\n>  from the agreement between the parties, \"viewed in light of its\n>  language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties'\n>  intention\\[s.]\" Id. at 862\\-63\\. Thus, review of an arbitration award\n>  under the essence test is \"circumscribed\" and entitled to \"great\n>  deference.\"\n\nGiven that those attorneys were already upfront with you in that it is not worth to hire them, it would be much harder for you to find a competent \\& honest attorney to represent you toward reversal of an arbitration award which could be *manifestly unreasonable*.\n\nYour best alternative is to \n\n1. search for Pennsylvania statutes, [court opinions](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch) addressing\ntorts such as fraud or breach of contract, and the Pennsylvania\ncourt rules; you will learn how statutes and doctrines are interpreted or applied, respectively;\n2. visit the applicable courthouse and ask for records of cases; by\ntaking notes, you will get acquainted with the style, format, and\nstructure of pleadings/motions; and\n3. sue *in pro per* the party at fault.\n\nPro se litigation is daunting and not a decision made lightly, but (1\\) it will save thousands of dollars, and (2\\) you will retain much more control about the pace (and other important aspects) of your own case.\n\nIf you'd like to see an almost complete file of a case litigated by a pro se plaintiff from state trial court all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, see [here](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html).

The most advised course of action is to pursue pro se litigation after thoroughly researching relevant laws, court opinions, and procedures.

Let's assume the country is the United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're looking for is a convention, in international law, that governs international aviation, the [Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation](https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_9ed.pdf). Article 3 says\n\n> (a) This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and\n> shall not be applicable to state aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (b) Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be\n> deemed to be state aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (c) No state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the\n> territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by a\n> special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms\n> thereof.\n\nArticle 1 also says that\n\n> The contracting States recognize that every State has complete\n> and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory\n\nThere is no separate international law governing the treatment of state aircraft entering the airspace of a nation without permission: the convention is entirely about protecting civil aircraft. From the recognition of sovereignty of the nation over its airspace and the absence of provisions protecting state aircraft, you may conclude that a nation has the \"right\" to shoot down state aircraft over\\-flying without permission. There are rules to the effect that a civil aircraft may be required to land, as opposed to shooting it down.\n\nAn aircraft operated by a private company (e.g. Delta airlines) might sue the government of a nation that shot its plane out of the sky, in contravention of the convention. However, the convention does not create a right to sue a government, so if a civil aircraft were shot down for incursion into a nation's airspace, there may or may not be a right to sue depending on the law of the relevant nations. In the case of the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, [a lawsuit *has* been filed](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e2c96399357e236fda551a5/t/5e2cb3696db1421c54669dab/1579987817799/SOC2020.pdf/) against Iran, in Ontario Superior Court.

According to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, every state has \"complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory\" (Article 1). Furthermore, the convention specifically states that it does not apply to state aircraft, which includes military aircraft (Article 3). The convention also requires that state aircraft not fly over another state's territory without authorization.\n\nGiven these provisions, the US has the legal right to defend its airspace against unauthorized military aircraft. While shooting down an aircraft is an extreme measure, it falls within a nation's sovereign rights when dealing with unauthorized state aircraft in its airspace.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Chicago Convention does not provide a basis for suing in this situation, especially for state aircraft. \n\nOption B is wrong because the Chicago Convention does not prohibit shooting down unauthorized state aircraft; it mainly protects civil aircraft.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Chicago Convention does not grant jurisdiction to the International Court of Justice for such matters, and disputes between states over military actions typically don't fall under its purview unless both parties agree to its jurisdiction."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72422/under-what-circumstances-can-you-be-convicted-of-indecent-exposure-for-being-nak", "docs_id": 72422, "title": "Under what circumstances can you be convicted of indecent exposure for being naked in a California changing room?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recent events have seen a person (with a history of sexual offending) charged for indecent exposure in the changing room of a nude spa in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, I am confused because surely a changing room necessarily involves the nude exposure of body parts not ordinarily exposed.

It seems to me to be one of the following:\n\n1. To grant powers to the monarch\n\nDue to the language in the act, this was my initial interpretation. My understanding is, however, that the monarch would automatically have the named power unless there was some specific pre\\-existing law restricting such. Was this the case?\n\n2. To grant powers to the Privy Council\n\nThis was my second interpretation. The use of the text \"by and with the advice of the Privy Council\" suggests to me that this act may be a way of formalising the use of this power by the monarch under the request of the Privy Council.\n\n3. To restrict the powers of the monarch\n\nThe act states \"His Majesty may issue his Proclamation for the meeting of Parliament in not less than 14 Days from the Date\", perhaps meaning that the act only intends to take the monarch's existing power and prevent it from being used under certain circumstances?\n\nWhich interpretation(s) are correct (if any)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As originally enacted, this Act was named:\n\n> An Act to shorten the Time now required for giving Notice of the Royal Intention of his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, that the Parliament shall meet and be holden for the Dispatch of Business, and more effectually to provide for the Meeting of Parliament in the case of a Demise of the Crown.\n\nand the relevant provision was:\n\n> That whenever his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, shall be pleased, by and with the Advice of the Privy Council of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, to issue his or their Royal Proclamation, giving Notice of his or their Royal Intention that Parliament shall meet and be holden for the Dispatch of Business on any Day being not less than fourteen Days from the Date of such Proclamation, the same shall be a full and sufficient Notice to all Persons whatever of such the Royal Intention of his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and the Parliament shall thereby stand prorogued to the Day and Place therein declared, notwithstanding any previous Prorogation of the Parliament to any longer Day, and notwithstanding any former Law, Usage, or Practice to the contrary.\n\nThe Act is about \"prorogation\", which is a formal end to the Parliamentary session. Between general elections, there can be several sessions, each beginning with a King's Speech announcing the planned business.\n\nIt was within the power of the Crown to declare a prorogation to a named date. Parliament could not meet, and therefore could not pass laws and so on, until that date came around. The 1797 Act is saying that during that interval, the Crown can decide that Parliament can come back early. The new date must be fourteen or more days in the future, but can be before the originally named date.\n\nBefore this Act, there was a limited power to shorten the prorogation in case of certain emergencies. The Militia Act 1786 was an example (consolidating several earlier statutes), saying that in cases of \"actual Invasion or upon imminent Danger thereof, and in all Cases of Rebellion or Insurrection\", the King could call out the militia and also summon Parliament back if they were adjourned or prorogued. There does not seem to have been a general prerogative power to shorten a prorogation. See Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" (1800 ed.), vol. 1, footnote on [p. 187](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England/uEcOAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA187-IA2).\n\nThe Act therefore *does* give a new general power, because it is not limited to extreme emergencies. But it also *does* restrict royal authority, because the formula \"by and with the Advice\" means that the King is not the decision\\-maker: it's an action controlled by the government of the day.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: The Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 was primarily designed to:\n\nA) Grant the monarch unrestricted power to summon Parliament at will\nB) Allow Parliament to reconvene earlier than originally prorogued, with certain limitations\nC) Restrict the monarch's ability to prorogue Parliament indefinitely\nD) Empower the Privy Council to override the monarch's decisions on parliamentary sessions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 was primarily designed to allow Parliament to reconvene earlier than originally prorogued, with certain limitations. This is evidenced by several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The Act's original title mentions shortening \"the Time now required for giving Notice of the Royal Intention... that the Parliament shall meet.\"\n\n2. It allows the monarch, with advice from the Privy Council, to issue a proclamation for Parliament to meet in not less than 14 days, even if it was previously prorogued to a later date.\n\n3. This new power was not restricted to emergencies, unlike previous acts such as the Militia Act 1786, which only allowed early reconvening in cases of invasion or rebellion.\n\n4. It does grant a new power, but it's not unrestricted (option A is incorrect) as it requires Privy Council advice and a 14-day notice.\n\n5. While it does place some restrictions on the monarch's power by requiring Privy Council advice, its primary purpose is not to restrict prorogation (option C is incorrect).\n\n6.

The rental is a high value one (around \u00a34000/month) and the property is large, and fully detached. The initial tenancy is for 12 months. The property is rented basically unfurnished, with only a couple of items on the inventory, and our tenancy agreement grants us full use of it and its grounds.\n\nThe landlord lives abroad and operates through a local estate agent.\n\nWhen we viewed the property, we noted that the two garages and an adjacent storage room (which they call \"the basement\") were largely filled with the landlord's personal items \\- old exercise equipment, construction materials left over from building renovation, crates of old toys etc. We were assured by the agent that anything we didn't want to use would be removed. We subsequently made an offer, signed the tenancy agreement and begun our tenancy.\n\nWe collected all of the landlord's leftover personal items into one of the two garages, and requested our agent to collect them as agreed. However, we were then told that the landlord did not wish for some of their items to be removed. The agent copied us in, very unprofessionally, on an email from the landlord, where she said she was very upset that the tenant had gone through their basement and moved their personal items \\- and that they were to be moved back into the basement.\n\nWe replied and made it very clear that we did not agree to store the landlord's personal items in any part of our property, and that this was not part of our tenancy agreement. We also stated that if the landlord wished to store their personal items in the basement or other parts of the property, then that would have to be through a separate arrangement with us. We gave a date by which we would like these items removed, and finally pointed out that we are very concerned that we do not have full use of the property that we are paying for.\n\nThe agent acknowledged this, but have nevertheless now removed only a selection of the landlord's items, telling us that the landlord has instructed them to return the rest to the basement. At this point one of our garages is half filled with crates of the landlord's personal rubbish and unable to be used as a garage. None of this stuff is mentioned on the inventory.\n\nWe would really prefer not to burn bridges with our landlord and the agent by resorting to legal threats at this stage if we can avoid it, as we really like the house and would like to continue living there \\- but we would also really not give up some of our limited space to store the landlord's crap for free!\n\nWhat are our options in this situation, and what's our legal position?

According to the information provided, taking a picture in a medical office is not inherently a HIPAA violation, even if the subject were a patient. However, in a healthcare setting, it's prudent to treat such images with caution. While the photo doesn't constitute protected health information in this case (as the person isn't a patient and their face isn't shown), handling it as if it were sensitive medical information is the most appropriate approach. This means sharing it only with those who have a legitimate need to see it, such as facility management or legal representatives dealing with the unsafe condition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because HIPAA does not universally prohibit photography in medical settings.

The name is an invented word (e.g. something to the effect of Bubbaloobaloobaloo), which is obviously neither descriptive of the product's character, depending on what you consider to constitute its character, nor its function.

In light of all this, I am led to believe that \"ordinary commercial terms\" should be at least loosely interpreted for the most part as 'terms provided by the Nice Classification system', but I cannot be absolutely sure...\n\nNow on to the real issue.\n\nUnder the section 'What You Can't Register' of the Trademarks Guide, the examples it provides for 'Words in Other Languages' with respect to section [12(1\\)(c)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-13/page-7.html#h-450601) of the Trademark Act entitled 'Registrable Trademarks' are as follows, \"You would not be able to register the word 'gelato' (Italian for 'ice cream') in association with frozen confections; 'anorak' (Inuktitut for 'parka') in association with outerwear; or 'wurst' (German for 'sausage') in association with meat.\" The legislation merely states, \"A trademark is registrable if it is not the name in any language of any of the goods or services in connection with which it is used or proposed to be used.\"\n\nThe big question presents itself: Does the product name or the corresponding \"ordinary commercial terms\" provided by the Nice Classification constitute the \"name of the goods\"?\n\nI would really appreciate another perspective.

The justification for it is that dealing with a criminal case would be severely distracting to the President, and thus harmful to the nation. Besides, the opinion goes on, any serious issue can be dealt with by impeachment. That reasoning obviously does not apply to a former President.\n\nArticle I, section 3, paragraph 7 of the [US constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) says:\n\n> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: **but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law**. (*emphasis added*)\n\nThis clearly contemplates the criminal prosecution of a former office holder, after such a person was removed by an impeachment. There is no exception for a President. Therefor a President can be criminally charged and prosecuted for actions during the presidency, provided that the evidence to establish probable cause is there, and that a Grand Jury indicts said former President.\n\nSo far as I know there has never been a case where such a thing was done. President Ford's pardon of President Nixon stopped any Federal prosecution of him. I think there have been cases were former US Judges, after impeachment, were criminally prosecuted. But that is not quite the same thing \\-\\- no one claims that sitting judges are immune to criminal charges.\n\nTo be clear this would not apply just to issues that a President had been impeached for.

According to the information provided, a former President does not have immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office. The Constitution explicitly states that a party convicted in an impeachment case is still \"liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\" This applies to any criminal actions, not just those addressed in impeachment proceedings.

The [MA Dept. of Education maintains](http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=7585) that public schools must purchase at public expense textbooks and other instructional materials and supplies intended for use and re\\-use over a period of years, and computers fall in the category of materials intended for schools to purchase and use and re\\-use.

THis means that in order to get a letter from Italy, to the pope, it must be handed over from Poste Italiane to Vatican Post. Assuming that the arrangement you described is still in place, this would raise the question how those letters would be billed on the wholesale level.

In this case, it would be free for the sender but the pope has to pay.  \n\n\u2022 Poste italiane eats the fees and hands the items over to Vatican Post as postage paid. For this to work, Poste Italiane would have to slam a \u201cPort Pay\u00e9 / Italie\u201d rubber stamp on each pope letter. (Without the rubber stamp, Vatican Post would treat the letter as postage due)  \n\n\u2022 Poste Italiane and Vatican Post have a special bilateral agreement to exchange pope letters on a cost\\-neutral basis similar to cecogram and POW items.\n\nIf it's the first option, there may be no legislation on the italian side at all governing free pope letters because international postage due is a regular service.  \n\nIn the third case, we would have to look for a bilateral arrangement betwenn Poste Italiane and Vatican Post.   \nIf it's the second option, the legislation we look for could be either an Italian law or a bilateral treaty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the context of sending letters to the Pope from Italy without postage, which of the following scenarios is most likely to be true if the arrangement still exists today?\n\nA) The Vatican Post charges the Pope for receiving these letters, treating them as international postage due.\n\nB) Poste Italiane covers all costs and marks the letters as \"Port Pay\u00e9 / Italie\" before handing them to Vatican Post.\n\nC) Italian citizens must purchase special \"Pope stamps\" to send letters to the Vatican without regular postage.\n\nD) The Italian government directly subsidizes Vatican Post for all letters addressed to the Pope from Italy.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most likely scenario based on the information provided. If the arrangement still exists, Poste Italiane would likely absorb the costs and mark the letters as \"Port Pay\u00e9 / Italie\" before transferring them to Vatican Post.

If this software includes and allows users to choose what god/deity they believe in (or their favorite god/deity), is this legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under the First Amendment, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\". Consequently, there can be no government action requiring the expression of beliefs of a particular religion, nor prohibiting such expressions \u2013 or, requiring or prohibiting expression of a general belief or disbelief in religions as a whole. This neutrality requirement holds only of governments, therefor a person can in his dealings with others require or prohibit expression of a religious viewpoint to the extent that they can make such a (non)expression a pre\\-condition for such dealings. Such dealings can be purely social, or they can be financial.\n\nHowever, there are currently some limitations arising from commercial dealings and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which allows Congress to regulate business.\nFor example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against employees based on religion. This limits an employer's right to religious expression, for example if they announce that Pastafarians need not apply. Title VII only addresses employment. Title II has an analogous prohibition against consideration of religion in \"public accommodations\" (theaters, hotels, restaurants...). The Fair Housing Act similarly prohibits religious discrimination in housing.\n\nWe need not get into the question of whether prohibitions against religious discrimination contravene the First Amendment. Until SCOTUS or Congress says otherwise, there are specific narrow limits on one's First Amendment rights w.r.t. religion. There is no software anti\\-discrimination law, so no basis for thinking about the question in terms of anti\\-discrimination laws. In lieu of a law that addresses religion and software, you may express your religious or non\\-religious views in software as you please.\n\nInsofar as all anti\\-discrimination law are based on the premise \"You may not consider X in making decisions\", and setting X to be \"religion\", an anti\\-discrimination law applied to software would at most prohibit the *prohibition* of a religious expression, that is, would make it illegal to prevent a customer from making a religious expression within the scope of the software. A law which required software to *suppress* religious expression would be a maximal contravention of the First Amendment.

While there are some limitations in specific areas like employment (Title VII) and housing (Fair Housing Act), there are no specific laws regulating religious expression in software. Therefore, a private software company has the freedom to include religious options in user profiles without restriction. They can allow users to specify any religious belief, deity, or lack thereof, as this falls under protected free speech and religious expression.

However, a website for AIDS patients sharing experiences would likely need stronger security measures, including encryption, due to the sensitive nature of the information and the potential harm from exposure.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the need for a context-specific risk assessment, which aligns with the GDPR's risk-based approach to data protection.

Its Section 4 also provides an elaborate mechanism whereby \"the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\" can precipitate a process that would allow Congress, within 21 days, to transfer the office to the Vice President.\n\nOtherwise, there is no contemplation in the law of a \"backsies\" mechanism for removing a person from the office because \"it should have gone to someone else.\"\n\n(The idea that a person who *was* in the designated line of succession, but in the wrong order, was sworn into office does not seem nearly as problematic as other events that have happened in real history.

Cavaroc](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/96/467/)*, 96 U.S. 467, 473\u201374 (1877\\).\n\nIndeed, this subtle rule of law governing the creditors of a trustee was actually the earliest form of limited liability in common law jurisdiction and was used as a model for subsequently devised limited liability entities such a corporations, as [explained by John Morley in the Columbia Law Review](https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-common-law-corporation-the-power-of-the-trust-in-anglo-american-business-history/) (open access). He explains:\n\n> If a trustee went bankrupt, his creditors could seize the property he\n>  owned personally for his own benefit but not the property he held as\n>  trustee in trust for others.43 The creditors could take the trustee\u2019s\n>  personal farm, for instance, but not the farm he held in trust for the\n>  beneficiaries. As Professors Henry Hansmann and Ugo Mattei have shown,\n>  this was an extraordinary innovation because it limited the rights of\n>  a trustee\u2019s creditors even if the creditors had not personally agreed\n>  to the limitations.44 This rule emerged gradually over time, but its\n>  essential contours were in place by the mid\\-1400s.45\n> \n> \n> 43 Henry Hansmann \\& Ugo Mattei, The Functions of Trust Law: A\n>  Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis, 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 434, 454\u201356\n>  (1998\\).\n> \n> \n> 44 *See id.*\n> \n> \n> 45 At first, the rule probably operated indirectly. Today, an\n>  unsecured creditor can seize any property\u2014real or personal\u2014of a debtor\n>  as long as the property is not already committed to a security\n>  interest. *Cf.* Edward M. Iacobucci \\& George G. Triantis, Economic and\n>  Legal Boundaries of Firms, 93 Va. L. Rev. 515 (2007\\) (noting the legal\n>  implications of how a firm is structured and arguing that a creditor\n>  of an entity has a formal right to any of that entity\u2019s property). In\n>  late medieval and early modern times, however, a creditor generally\n>  could not take land (as distinct from personal property) unless the\n>  owner had specifically given the creditor a security interest in it.\n>  *See* Claire Priest, Creating an American Property Law: Alienability and\n>  Its Limits in American History, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 385, 401\u201307 (2006\\)\n>  (describing limits on the alienability of land in late\\-medieval\n>  English law). Thus, there was no need for a rule in early trust law\n>  that protected real property from a trustee\u2019s unsecured creditors.\n>  Since no one could take real property from a trustee unless the\n>  trustee specifically pledged it, there was no point in cutting off the\n>  claims of creditors who had no pledge. It was enough simply to have a\n>  rule that protected property from the secured creditors who had\n>  received the pledges. This rule was already implicit in the remedies\n>  against a trustee\u2019s transferees and pledgees that the Chancery began\n>  enforcing in the mid\\-1400s. *See supra* notes 40\u201341 and accompanying\n>  text (discussing the use of specific performance and property recovery\n>  as remedies). In any case, Lord Chancellor Nottingham began fully\n>  protecting all forms of trust property from a trustee\u2019s unsecured\n>  creditors in the late seventeenth century. *See, e.g., Bennet v.\n>  Davis* (1725\\) 24 Eng. Rep. 746 (Ch) 746\u201347; 2 P. Wms. 316, 316\u201319;\n>  *Finch v. Earl of Winchelsea* (1715\\) 24 Eng. Rep. 387 (Ch) 387\u201390; 1 P. Wms. 277, 277\u201383; *Burgh v. Francis* (1673\\) 36 Eng.

The trust holds valuable real estate assets. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the treatment of the trust's assets in the trustee's bankruptcy proceedings?\n\nA) The trust's assets will be fully protected from the trustee's creditors due to the charitable nature of the trust.\n\nB) The trust's assets will become part of the bankruptcy estate and be available to satisfy the trustee's personal debts.\n\nC) Only the trustee's legal title to the trust's assets will be part of the bankruptcy estate, but the equitable interest will remain protected for the beneficiaries.\n\nD) The trust's assets will be divided equally between the bankruptcy estate and the trust beneficiaries as a compromise.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(d) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, when a debtor (in this case, the trustee) holds only legal title to property and not an equitable interest, only the legal title becomes part of the bankruptcy estate. The equitable interest, which belongs to the beneficiaries of the trust, remains protected.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the charitable nature of the trust is relevant, it's not the primary reason for protection. The separation of legal and equitable title is key.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it fails to recognize the distinction between the trustee's personal assets and the trust assets, as well as the protection afforded by trust law and bankruptcy code.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there is no legal basis for such a compromise. The law clearly separates the legal and equitable interests in trust property.\n\nThis question tests understanding of trust law principles, bankruptcy code provisions, and the historical development of asset protection in trusts."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61919/quiet-title-action-is-this-normal", "docs_id": 61919, "title": "Quiet Title Action. Is this normal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the process of purchasing a home for the first time. The title has a cloud because the house was sold at a tax sale in 2018 (the owner was deceased). The guy who bought it sold it to another person, who remodeled it and is now selling it to me.\n\nThe title search company is escrowing money from the seller to clear the title via a Quiet Title action. They want to continue with closing on schedule, and said there will be an exception on my title insurance which will be removed after the title action is completed. It all sounds like standard procedure to me, but I'm not a lawyer.\n\nThe one thing that concerns me is, what if the title action were to fail? Can this happen? So, for example, what if an heir of that deceased decides they want to fight me over the house? Could I lose it? What about the mortgage I took out to buy the house? Or am I getting overly concerned about nothing?\n\nIs this standard procedure?\n\nI am in Pennsylvania.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is unusual, but not unheard of, to do a quiet title action in connection with an arms length, non\\-related party sale of real estate.\n\nThe far more customary practice is for the seller to do the quiet title action (at the seller's expense) if it is necessary for the seller to have what is called \"marketable title\" to the property, before it is even listed for sale.\n\nIt would also be more customary for the closing to be extended to a date after which the quiet title action can be completed, and for you to lease rather than buy the property prior to closing.\n\nThis way, if the quiet title action fails to quiet title to the seller, the closing with you doesn't have to be undone, and you can just move your stuff out with reasonable notice from the landlord\\-seller, and you can look for somewhere else to live or can try to cut a deal with whoever is determined to be the true owner of the property.\n\nAlso, as a practical reality, it would be quite unusual for a mortgage lender to agree to provide you with a mortgage without title insurance in place. I very much doubt that the deal can go forward as planned, even if the you and the seller agree, if you need mortgage financing to buy the house.\n\nThis said, there is nothing particularly unusual about a title insurance company's requirement that a quiet title action be completed in a case where the current owner took title via a tax sale from a deceased owner's probate estate. Any irregularity in the tax sale process could vest the property back into the estate of the deceased owner, the tax sale buyer likely paid less than fair market value, and there are probably special notice requirements involved in a tax sale from a deceased owner's estate that don't apply (and extend the statute of limitations for contests of the tax sale) that wouldn't apply in the case of a tax sale from someone who is alive. Some of the potential irregularities wouldn't appear in the public record or in any other documentation that you could demand (e.g. a forged signature or an error in crediting payments of taxes to the wrong account).\n\nThe likelihood that a quiet title action will vest title in the name of the seller is high, but the fact that the title company is not willing to insure title in its current state is strong circumstantial evidence that the risk that the seller does not have good title to the property is real.\n\nYour concerns are not unreasonable, and the safer course of action would be to restructure the deal so that you do not take title unless and until the title is quieted in the seller in a lawsuit conducted at his sole expense and risk, even if you move in pursuant to a lease pending that process. The existence of an (amended) real estate contract between you and the seller should be sufficient to protect your interest in the deal that you have struck between now and closing. It is possible that your financing could fall apart between now and closing, but often the circumstances that would make that happen are circumstances that would cause you to wish you never did the deal in the first place anyway.\n\nWhen I represented some heirs of a decedent in a similar case (involving a fraudulent sale to avoid a tax sale, rather than a tax sale itself, from a probate estate), the deal ultimately struck was to have the heirs sell the house to the buyer who was under contract, with proceeds split between the nominal owner of record and the heirs who might have had a claim to undo a prior sale. Such a resolution if there is a contested quiet title litigation, in lieu of taking the quiet title dispute to trial, is another resolution that would be fine with you if the closing is postponed until after the title dispute is resolved.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a real estate transaction involving a property with a clouded title due to a previous tax sale, which of the following is the MOST advisable course of action for the potential buyer?\n\nA) Proceed with the purchase as planned, relying on the title insurance company's promise to remove the exception after the Quiet Title action is completed.\n\nB) Insist on closing the deal only after the Quiet Title action is successfully completed, and consider leasing the property in the interim.\n\nC) Walk away from the deal entirely due to the potential risks involved with the clouded title.\n\nD) Agree to purchase the property immediately, but demand a significant price reduction to offset the potential risks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most advisable course of action because:\n\n1. It minimizes the buyer's risk by ensuring the title is clear before taking ownership.\n2. It follows the more customary and safer practice in real estate transactions involving clouded titles.\n3.

The law is framed in terms of an \"access device\", which includes debit cards, PINs, telephones and so on (there are other laws about credit cards). It does not include checks and the bank account information that might be used for a one\\-time ACH debit. Rule 1005\\.2(k)(1\\) defines preauthorized electronic fund transfer\n\n> A preauthorized electronic fund transfer under Regulation E is one\n>  authorized by the consumer in advance of a transfer that will take\n>  place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and\n>  will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the\n>  transfer. In a bill\\-payment system, for example, if the consumer\n>  authorizes a financial institution to make monthly payments to a payee\n>  by means of EFTs, and the payments take place without further action\n>  by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized EFTs. In contrast, if\n>  the consumer must take action each month to initiate a payment (such\n>  as by entering instructions on a touch\\-tone telephone or home\n>  computer), the payments are not preauthorized EFTs.\n\nSo the answer is yes or no, depending. 2(m)(2\\) says\n\n> If a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make\n>  transfers to a person (such as a family member or co\\-worker) who\n>  exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the\n>  transfers unless the consumer has notified the financial institution\n>  that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.\n\nThe literal words here say one thing, and surrounding circumstances suggest something else. A landlord is a obviously a person, but a landlord has a different relation to one than a family member or co\\-worker does \u2013 the parenthetical suggests that this clause refers to trusted individuals. The importance of that is that if a landlord is a \"person\" in this sense, then you are liable unless you have told the institution that he is no longer authorized.\n\nThe same section on unauthorized use indicates ties that concept on forced access (robbery at gunpoint) or cards that are stolen or obtained by fraud, also a class of reversals of direct deposits. None of these concepts covers the described use, assuming that the initial acquisition of the device was not by force or fraud. The fact of using a device without explicit permission in some instance does not constitute fraud (which involves making a material knowingly false statement that the consumer relies on to agree to an arrangement).\n\nThe use in question is covered in 3(b)(1\\), under the rubric \"Funds Transferred Covered\" (i.e. whether the use is an 'electronic funds transfer', which is regulated):\n\n> A transfer from the consumer's account resulting from a debit\\-card\n>  transaction at a merchant location, even if no electronic terminal is\n>  involved at the time of the transaction, if the consumer's asset\n>  account is subsequently debited for the amount of the transfer.\n\nThese regulations are about your relationship to the bank, the question being whether you have a legal basis for making the bank absorb the loss. There is little chance that this law would make you not liable to the bank (i.e. they would be required to return the money taken from your account). There could be some recourse in case your agreement with the bank specifically prohibits recurring charges with a debit card, but it is unlikely that there is any such restriction. Assuming you did not previously put the bank on notice that the landlord is no longer authorized to charge your card, then you have no recourse against the bank.\n\nAny recourse would then be against the landlord, where the specific issue is whether the charge is or is not within the scope of an agreement. If you use a debit card to pay rent and in some month you indeed owe rent, then the landlord has not torted you by charging the next month's rent. If, however, the landlord gets the idea that your bank account is a source of free beer money thus the use is not covered by an existing agreement, then the charge would be wrongful, and you can sue the landlord. I will assume (since you don't specify the purpose of the charge) that the charge is in connection with an amount owed by you.\n\nThere is no statute that requires specific \"for each use\" authorization of debit card charges: any such limitations would arise from explicit agreements between you and the bank, or you and the landlord. If you have such an agreement, say with the landlord, which says that the use of the card is a one\\-time use, then only a one\\-time use is authorized. Otherwise, there is no implicit requirement that each and every transfer must be specifically authorized. Informing the institution that the particular person is no longer authorized is your only recourse.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Tennessee uses their debit card to pay rent to their landlord for the first time.

According to the provided information, if a consumer furnishes an access device (in this case, a debit card) to a person and grants authority to make transfers, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless they have notified the financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized. This applies even if the person exceeds the initially granted authority. While a landlord might not be considered a \"trusted individual\" like a family member, the regulation doesn't explicitly exclude other types of relationships. Therefore, unless the tenant had notified their bank that the landlord was no longer authorized to make charges, they would likely be liable for the charge.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality depends on various factors, and the bank isn't obligated to reverse the charge in all circumstances. \n\nOption B is incorrect because specific \"for each use\" authorization isn't required by law for debit card charges unless explicitly agreed upon.\n\nOption D is incorrect because if the charge is for legitimate rent owed, it wouldn't constitute fraud, even if the method of charging wasn't explicitly authorized for that specific instance."}}
