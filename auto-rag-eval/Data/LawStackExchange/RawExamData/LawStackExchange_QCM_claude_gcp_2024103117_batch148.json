I soon caught on that the company doesn't intend to cancel my membership before I am automatically billed for another year of service; every phone call typically devolves into a high\\-pressure sales pitch for me to stay, or they hang up on me after I get put on hold.\n\nFurthermore, I signed up accidentally for the membership \\-\\- having not read the fine print of the installation contract for my new HVAC \\-\\- so I am now worried that a verbal confirmation of cancellation over the phone will not be honored.\n\nIn the contract I signed, the following text appears:\n\n> I hereby authorize FooBar herein after called Company, to initiate debit entries to my account. This authorization is to remain in full force until Company received written notification from me of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford Company a reason able opportunity to act on it (30 days).\n\nI want to be safe and send a written notification from me requesting termination of my membership. However, I am afraid of the company claiming to have never received my written notification. I could send the written notification through certified mail, but that would only prove that the company received a letter from me and prove nothing of the contents within.\n\n**How do I prove the contents of the letter I sent is actually the contents of the letter a party received?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's true that you can't prove what was in the envelope. But assuming this ends in small claims court or some sort of collections action lets play out how it works.\n\nThe company is going to claim that they never got notice of cancellation. They will plead ignorance so they won't have any evidence of what you didn't send. That's obvious, but more on this later.\n\nYou are going to have a trove of evidence. The emails you sent, the webforms you filled out, the voicemails you left. And finally, the letters that you sent.\n\nLet's think about the weight of evidence! At the very least you can ask them, if they claim they didn't get a cancellation from you, what **did** they get in that certified envelope from you? They'll need to produce whatever was in the envelope. Unless they claim that it was empty.\n\nAt this point the judge will see exactly what is going on and **you won't need to prove what was in the envelope**.\n\nLegally, the way this works is covered by [Rule 901](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901).\n\n> **(a) In General**.

As stated in Rule 901, evidence can be authenticated by \"Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge\" that an item is what it is claimed to be. The customer can take the stand and testify that the letter presented in court is a true copy of what was sent.

[15 USC 1692c(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692c) states that without the consumer's direct consent (or other probably irrelevant conditions)\n\n> a debt collector may not communicate, in connection with the\n>  collection of any debt, with any person other than the consumer, his\n>  attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law,\n>  the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, or the attorney of the\n>  debt collector.\n\nexcept that there are legals ways to ask where the consumer is. Then one must determine if the company is a \"debt collector\", which is defined in [15 USC 1692a(6\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692a).

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) primarily applies to \"debt collectors,\" which are defined as entities collecting debts on behalf of others or using a different name to collect their own debts. If XYZ Company is considered a debt collector under this definition, they would be restricted from communicating about debts with third parties without the consumer's consent.\n\nHowever, if XYZ Company is not considered a debt collector (e.g., if they're collecting their own debts under their own name), federal FDCPA restrictions may not apply. That said, some states (like California) have laws that extend similar protections to original creditors.\n\nSharing customer experiences (like ratings) is generally protected as freedom of expression, as long as the information shared is factual or opinion-based and not defamatory. The key is to distinguish between debt collection practices and sharing of general customer information.\n\nTherefore, XYZ Company's ability to share this information legally depends on their classification under the FDCPA, applicable state laws, and the nature of the information being shared.

But on what grounds could the federal government legalize abortions in all 50 states? Would they be forced to open federal \"abortion clinics\" to prevent state jurisdiction? Are there similar precedents of the Federal government legalizing something against the wishes of the states?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the current definition is incredibly broad \\-\\- certainly broad enough to include the provision of abortions.\n\nIf it were challenged, the government would likely rely on [*Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005\\)](https://casetext.com/case/gonzales-v-raich). In *Gonzales*, two patients who used medical marijuana as authorized by state law challenged the federal government's laws prohibiting the use of medical marijuana. They argued that because they were growing their own marijuana, because it never left the state, and because it was for personal, noncommercial use, it was outside Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce. But the Supreme Court rejected their arguments, holding that Congress could use its Commerce Clause authority to enact health\\-care laws regulating access to marijuana and pre\\-empt contradictory state health\\-care laws.\n\nThe federal government's case for regulating abortions would be event stronger than its case in *Gonzales*: First, because obtaining an abortion is typically a commercial enterprise; it is likely covered by insurance, and even if it patient isn't charged, someone is likely paying the doctor money to perform it. Also, abortions more obviously implicate interstate commerce because patients frequently travel from state to another to obtain one, because clinics order supplies and services from outside the state, and because they rely on instrumentalities of interstate commerce (highways, telephone lines, the Internet) to do their job.\n\nIndeed, as far as I know, every court to consider the issue has concluded that regulating access to abortion is a straightforward application of the Commerce Clause. *See, e.g.*, [*Terry v. Reno*, 101 F.3d 1412, 1418 (D.C. Cir. 1996\\)](https://casetext.com/case/terry-v-reno) (\u201cViolent and obstructive activity outside abortion clinics adversely affects interstate commerce in reproductive health services. In enacting the Access Act, Congress did not exceed its Commerce Clause power.\u201d); [*Cheffer v. Reno*, 55 F.3d 1517, 1520\\-21 (11th Cir. 1995\\)](https://casetext.com/case/cheffer-v-reno) (\u201cCongress found that doctors and patients often travel across state lines to provide and receive services, id.; in other words, there is an interstate market both with respect to patients and doctors. In addition, the clinics receive supplies through interstate commerce. ... Congress' findings are plausible and provide a rational basis for concluding that the Access Act regulates activity which \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce. Thus, the Access Act is a constitutional exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.\u201d); [*U.S. v.

Connecticut\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Commerce Clause would be the most likely constitutional authority for Congress to pass federal legislation protecting abortion rights nationwide. This is strongly supported by the precedent set in Gonzales v. Raich (2005). In this case, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to regulate intrastate activities (medical marijuana use) under the Commerce Clause, even when those activities were permitted by state law.\n\nThe reasoning in Gonzales v. Raich would apply even more strongly to abortion regulations because:\n\n1. Abortion is typically a commercial enterprise involving payment for services.\n2. Patients often travel across state lines to obtain abortions.\n3. Abortion clinics order supplies and services from out of state.\n4. Clinics rely on interstate commerce infrastructure (highways, telecommunications, etc.).\n\nAdditionally, several lower courts have already upheld federal regulations related to abortion access under the Commerce Clause, such as in Terry v. Reno and Cheffer v. Reno. These cases further strengthen the argument that Congress could use its Commerce Clause power to protect abortion rights at the federal level.\n\nThe other options, while related to aspects of abortion rights, do not provide as strong or direct a basis for federal legislation as the Commerce Clause does in this context."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15100/can-i-legally-sleep-in-the-street-in-france", "docs_id": 15100, "title": "Can I legally sleep in the street in France?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I legally sleep in the street in France? \n\nAssume my location does not perturb traffic circulation, i.e. I am on the pavement, or the road is only used by pedestrians.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you sleep on the streets, you are considered a \"SDF\" (*Sans Domicile Fixe*), a tramp.\nLegality depends on where you sleep, and in which city.\n\nIt's not illegal to be a SDF (under some conditions), but until the early 1990s it was illegal to be a beggar (*mendiant/mendicit\u00e9* \\-\\- this reference, [Mendicit\u00e9](http://www.affaires-publiques.com/point/gp/mend.htm), is about begging)\n\nFor instance, sleeping in a car can be legal, except if you are located in a prohibited place where you could have a fine.\n\nSome cities have voted anti\\-SDF acts.\n\nSee for instance (in French):\n[Dormir dans sa voiture, est\\-ce l\u00e9gal?](http://dormirenvoiture.jimdo.com/que-dit-la-loi)\nand [Les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents dispositifs anti\\-SDF qui ont fait pol\u00e9mique en France](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/12/26/les-precedents-dispositifs-anti-sdf-qui-ont-fait-polemique-en-fr)\n\nSDF in law acts: [PERSONNE SANS DOMICILE FIXE (SDF)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichSarde.do?reprise=true&page=1&idSarde=SARDOBJT000007115620)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In France, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of sleeping on the streets?\n\nA) Sleeping on the streets is universally illegal throughout France.\nB) It is legal to sleep on the streets as long as you are not obstructing traffic.\nC) The legality of sleeping on the streets depends on the specific location and local regulations.\nD) Sleeping in a car is always legal, regardless of where it's parked.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of sleeping on the streets in France is complex and varies depending on several factors.

Water and Sewage costs are separated because the county provides well water for free, but not sewage.\n\nA few days ago I received a bill from a sewage company \"[NWP](https://one.nwpresident.com/)\". The bill is a single charge with no details. Just \"Sewage Fee \".\n\nThe number seemed shockingly high for what I have paid for water plus sewage in the past, so I called the company and discovered that I am being billed for the usage of the entire \"community\" split based on the number of residents in the Townhouse (just my wife and I). The company also told me that it was impossible for them to even tell me how much my unit is using because there are no meters installed.\n\nSo my first question is whether or not this is even legal. I'm not sure if sewage is considered a utility like water and is subject to the legal protections, and I also don't know where I would find those protections (I just recently moved here from a different state). My gut tells me this shouldn't be allowed because it discourages conservation. I can't conserve usage because when the bill comes, I'll have no idea what I actually used. But this is just a gut feeling and I'd like to know section and paragraph if I'm going to do anything serious with this.\n\nMy second concern is that this isn't mentioned anywhere in my lease. The only time the lease ever mentions sewage at all is one time at the top with the line: \n\n> Tenant Pays For: TENANT PAYS FOR GAS AND ELECTRIC, AND SEWAGE\n\nThe \"Utilities\" section does not mention Sewage in any way and it is absent from the rest of the document.\n\nI was told during the tour and today at the office that I only pay for my own usage. Unfortunately this was verbal and is not in the lease. After I escalated at the office to the manager, the manager admitted that this is a lie, but since it's not in writing, I think they know they're safe.\n\nIf I had known that I was on the hook for my neighbor's heavy water usage, I would not have signed, and the lease completely hid this information from me. Do I have any case for breach of lease terms or something like that? I feel like socializing sewage costs is important enough to have been noted in the lease, and it would have affected my decision.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Is it legal to socialize sewage where I am not provided with my own usage? If not, how should I proceed?\n2. Is there anything I can do with the fact that this was not mentioned in the lease terms?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your sewage provider is a \u201cPublic service company\u201d under [Maryland law](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?pid=&tab=subject5&stab=&ys=2017RS&article=gpu&section=1-101&ext=html&session=2017RS): \n\n> (x) (1\\) \u201cPublic service company\u201d means a common carrier company,\n>  electric company, gas company, sewage disposal company, telegraph\n>  company, telephone company, water company, or any combination of\n>  public service companies.\n> \n> \n> (ee) \u201cSewage disposal company\u201d means a privately owned public service\n>  company that owns or maintains facilities for the disposal of sewage.\n\nThe Public Services Commission [sets the rates](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2017/public-utilities/division-i/title-4/subtitle-1/section-4-102/):\n\n> The Commission shall have the power to set a just and reasonable rate\n>  of a public service company, as a maximum rate, minimum rate, or both.\n\nThe utilities code paraphrases this [in other provisions](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2017/public-utilities/division-i/title-4/subtitle-2/section-4-201/):\n\n> In accordance with the provisions of this article, a public service\n>  company shall charge just and reasonable rates for the regulated\n>  services that it renders.\n\nThere is no legal process involved in your situation, since it is a political matter what constitutes a just and reasonable rate. You can write letters of protest, but the commission has the power to set the rates. You can, however, [investigate whether the charges were actually approved](http://www.psc.state.md.us/). You do, however, have to contact the utility before filing a complaint with the commission.\n\nThe landlord has zero control over rates set by the government, so they cannot reasonably be expected to contractually commit to any particular rates. However, if they overtly lied to you about the terms of the lease, you might sue to get out of the lease, but the chances that you would prevail in such a suit are negligible.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Maryland is disputing their sewage bill, which is based on community usage rather than individual metering.

The proper course of action is to first contact the utility company with any disputes.

There are all sorts of constitutionally\\-derived safeguards to ensure that the seizure and search are \"proper.\" But I can't find *any* law or custom pertaining to *how long the police can keep* a computer, phone, or data storage device. And I *have* heard that they will routinely keep such items for weeks or months. When the computer(s) seized are someone's work machines then that person not only loses time and money to replace them, but may also incur damages due to the inability to access data that wasn't backed up offsite.\n\n(*Why* the police do this with information systems is bewildering to a techie with some IS security background like me.

At that point a duplicate could certainly be returned to the owner without imperiling the search of the data, or its use as evidence.)\n\nThe indefinite detention of movable property seems incongruous with the treatment afforded to dwellings. E.g., I have never heard of a *residence* being seized for search and cordoned off *for the duration of an investigation and prosecution*.

Even further, if this person has\n> no family or work colleagues who will vouch for them, is it possible\n> that their identity is lost forever?\n\nGenerally, these can be replaced.\n\nFor example, I was robbed at gunpoint a couple of years ago and the robbers took (among other things) my driver's license and Social Security card, which were never recovered (I did recover one prescription slip from a dumpster about a mile away that was wrapped around a syringe, because the robbers were also injection drug users.)\n\nI went by myself without any ID to the DMV which had an online record of my driver's license containing my age, height, weight, sex, race, noted that I needed vision correction and also had my most recent driver's license photo and a fingerprint. I explained what happened without any corroboration, and they promptly issued me a new driver's license.\n\nThe same process would have applied had I had a state ID in lieu of a driver's license because I wasn't licensed to drive for some reason (e.g. if I was blind). The process in Texas would be very similar (I don't know if they have finger prints though).\n\nMy daughter had to do the same when she lost her driver's license while camping.\n\nWith the driver's license, I was able to go to the Social Security office and have them reissue a Social Security card.\n\nOne of my children's birth certificates was lost, and I could simply go to the Vital Statistics department with a name and date of birth and get a new one.\n\nThe replacement birth certificate and driver's license involved a modest fee (which would be pretty daunting for a homeless person), but the replacement Social Security card was free.\n\nIt's a pain in the neck to do this, and it took several hours to sort out (the time lost would not be a problem for a homeless person), but loss of my identity was not a serious possibility.\n\nIf you have (or had before you lost it) a photo ID such as a driver's license, or state ID, or student ID, or passport in a system, reconstructing your identity isn't that hard.\n\nIf you don't know who you are either.\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you have amnesia, so you don't know the information needed to recover your records, it can be much harder to work out a lack of any ID. This happens something on the order of several times a year. Sometimes it is resolved promptly when the person regains their memory or is tied to a recent outstanding missing persons report, or is identified after a local TV broadcast seeking input from the public. But, if the person is not local, no one filed a missing persons report, and the memory loss turns out to be permanent, it can take months or years to get it sorted out.\n\nBut, you will generally be assumed to be legally present in the U.S. until proven otherwise if you speak fluent English. Also, you can't easily be deported if no one can determine your nationality (including you), even if you don't speak fluent English.\n\nFor example, if the only language you spoke fluently was an Amazonian tribal language and no one could figure out this fact, it would be hard to deport you without evidence of your country of origin, which by assumption, does not exist in this scenario. Officials sometimes try to crowdsource recordings of someone speaking or writing in these situations to determine their place of origins, which can take many months and isn't always successful.\n\nBut, if your first language was Klingon, you would be quickly identified and not deported, because that language is widely recognized and a Google search would reveal that it has only two native speakers, both of whom are children who were born in the United States (I know their father as a casual acquaintance).\n\nCitizenship, arrest and deportation\n-----------------------------------\n\n> Can a person lose their citizenship in this manner? Could they be\n> arrested or even deported?\n\nYou cannot lose your citizenship in this manner, although it can be harder to prove your citizenship, if you need to do so.\n\nYou shouldn't be arrested for simply not having ID (although it does happen) if you aren't driving a car without a license. Also, lots of people without ID are arrested all of the time for other charges, and then refuse to provide anything but a false alias to the police. But, they are usually not deported unless there is some reason to suspect that they are not U.S. citizens.\n\nA modest but significant number of people every year (on the order of dozens to a couple hundred) are arrested and deported in circumstances like these and the system can put someone in that situation in a very Catch\\-22 situation for which there a few if any legal remedies after the fact by way of compensation.\n\n*Deportations Of U.S. citizens with strong foreign ties*\n\nThe hard cases are usually those when you have someone who is a child who has never had a photo ID, or is an adult who never had a photo ID in the U.S., especially if that person is someone who has lived much of their life abroad despite being born in the U.S., or is most fluent in a non\\-English language because their parents spoke that language when they were growing up, or was born abroad and naturalized as a citizen later (often as a relative of the primary person who earned the right to citizenship by taking citizenship tests).\n\nEstablishing that you are the same person as the one in a birth certificate or naturalization certificate is not always easy. Naturalizations often aren't accurately cross\\-referenced with immigration records. And, the track record of ICE agents meaningfully following up on claims of citizenship is very poor.\n\n*Identity assumption cases*\n\nAnother much less common hard case that still happens sometimes, involves a situation where you are born in the U.S. or to a U.S. citizen, giving you U.S. citizenship, and you have a birth certificate, but you live abroad for a long time, and in the meantime, someone similar in age, sex and race to you has assumed your identity to claim citizenship status.\n\nThen, there is someone else with a long paper trail that supports your identity actually belonging to them including photo IDs and maybe even a passport, and you have only your birth certificate that someone else claims is theirs with doesn't have a lot of provable biometric features other than your parent's names, which may be hard to use to establish that you are the true person corresponding to the birth certificate if they are deceased, and may require DNA testing or testimony from them even if they are not deceased.\n\n*Persons declared dead*\n\nA third class of people who have a thorny time re\\-establishing their identities are people who went missing, were declared dead legally by a court as a result, and then resurface. This can pose a problem even after they undeniably establish their identity due to rules relating to the finality of court orders.\n\nA fictional example of this is the title character in the live action TV series the *Iron Fist* in the Marvel Comics Universe. But, there are also real life examples, such as a man in Ohio a number of years ago who was in a similar situation (except for the fact that he didn't have superpowers, was middle aged, and wasn't an heir to a billion dollar fortune).\n\nThese cases are very rare.

The customers filed the lawsuit and won, and legislation was introduced that made it illegal.\n\nFor more detail, I would refer to this excerpt from that wikipedia article:\n\n> Inspired by the Palmers' experience with KlearGear, the California legislature passed a bill in 2014 to ban the use of non\\-disparagement clauses in consumer contracts, and Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law on September 9, 2014\\.\n> \n> \n> In September 2015, the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015 (S. 2044\\) was introduced in the U.S. Congress, to make such clauses void and unenforceable at the federal level.

The cancelled status on the merchant's website is indeed relevant evidence and could be seen as an admission of liability by the merchant.

The fact that someone else knows more about the thing they're passing laws about is utterly irrelevant \\-\\- the power to make laws is given to the legislature, not to experts.

Congress has established a system of paper money, and states can't interfere with that. It's not that the Fed thinks paper money is good, it's that Congress said paper money shall be a thing.

At the same time, the USA is still practicing the death penalty. For example, [28 people were executed in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_offenders_executed_in_the_United_States_in_2015). For each execution a lot of evidence can be potentially gathered (official documents, video footage, declarations of individuals, etc).\n\nSo could the people who have taken part in an execution be considered guilty of \"collective murder\"? Is it possible that they could be arrested as soon as they arrive in France?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I said this in a comment, but I'll put it in an answer. When France forcibly confines an American, the United States is entitled to ask France, \"what the *hell* do you think you're doing, trying to confine our citizen in your country?\" There are really just six basic answers that the United States will accept, and nothing in this scenario is specific to France or the US (it applies any time a foreign national is arrested by any country), and the six responses are the six basic principles of jurisdiction:\n\n1. Active nationality: \"He's our citizen too! What the hell do you think *you're* doing, questioning how we treat our own citizens?\" The US doesn't generally get to question how France treats French citizens, even if they're also American citizens. And France gets to require its citizens to obey French law anywhere in the world.\n2. Subjective territoriality: \"He broke our laws on our soil. We don't care that he's your citizen, he has to obey our laws while he's here.\" This and nationality are by far the most well\\-accepted answers.\n3. Protective: \"He threatened our state. We have the right to protect ourselves.\" This applies to things like attacking French government personnel or forging a French passport or similar: France isn't protecting its citizens, it's protecting France itself.\n4. Objective territoriality: \"He may have committed this crime outside France, but its effects happened inside France. We can punish him for causing those effects.\" For instance, if you're in the US but hack a computer in France, France has an argument that they get to punish you for that.\n5. Passive nationality: \"He may be American and have done this outside France, but he hurt our citizens. We have the right to protect our citizens.\" Again, a plausible argument. This is not necessarily a *strong* argument, but it can be made.\n6. Universality: \"This thing is a crime against all of humanity. It's something that needs to be stamped out by all countries working together, without worrying too much about whether or not the defendant actually affected the country prosecuting him in any way.\" This is *very* rare.\n\nMurder is not a crime of universal jurisdiction. It's limited to more severe crimes, as well as crimes of a fundamentally international nature. So piracy is on the list, as is plane hijacking, as is genocide. Killing an ambassador is on the list: you're a threat to international order. But normal murder? Not even close. It's not a crime with international implications, and it's not a crime which is so fundamentally horrific that it needs to be ended by any means necessary. The death penalty has never been considered to be that fundamentally horrific, and likely never will be, particularly when (as in the US) it is limited to people who have committed something that is an extremely serious crime in any country (i.e. murder). \n\nThe only way France could make a remotely plausible argument that it gets to punish American executioners is if they're dual citizens or if they executed a French citizen. Then France can't arrest the executioner because US is a sovereign state and gets to impose its own penal laws. But normally? France couldn't arrest them even if it wasn't for the fact that they're executing US government policy, because Americans in America don't generally have to obey French laws.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the principles of jurisdiction in international law, under which circumstance could France potentially claim jurisdiction over an American executioner who has never set foot in France?\n\nA) If the executioner carried out an execution on French soil\nB) If the executed person was a French citizen\nC) If the execution was broadcast live on French television\nD) If the executioner used a method of execution invented in France\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the principles of jurisdiction in international law. Option A is incorrect because it relates to subjective territoriality, which doesn't apply here as the executioner has never been to France. Option C is not a valid basis for jurisdiction. Option D is not relevant to any principle of jurisdiction.\n\nOption B is correct because it relates to the principle of passive nationality. As explained in the passage, under this principle, a country may claim jurisdiction if its citizens are harmed, even if the act occurred outside its territory. While this is described as \"not necessarily a strong argument,\" it is the only potentially applicable principle in this scenario. The passage states: \"He may be American and have done this outside France, but he hurt our citizens. We have the right to protect our citizens.\"\n\nIt's important to note that while France might claim jurisdiction under this principle, enforcing it would be highly problematic due to issues of state sovereignty, as the executioner was carrying out US government policy."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50814/uk-tenancy-renewal-lockdown-and-the-law", "docs_id": 50814, "title": "UK Tenancy Renewal, Lockdown and the Law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our fixed term tenancy will finish on 31st July; with a two month notice period.

Are there any statistics on how often this happens in Federal and State courts in the US for criminal law trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are not comprehensive statistics that are maintained on this at either the federal level, or in any U.S. state.\n\nIt would not be possible to determine this from PACER records in federal court, or from state court online filing system records in many state courts, because both of those systems are geared towards tracking document filings in the court system. But a motion for mistrial in a criminal case, while it can be filed in document form, would frequently be made orally, in open court, instead. Sometimes an oral motion and its resolution would be reflected in written court minutes or a minute order, but often it would not.\n\nIn criminal cases, more generally, the proportion of motion practice that is conducted orally in open court, rather than through filed written documents is great. Also, even in civil cases, during trials, motions are frequently made orally, rather than in writing.\n\nOral motions are part of the court record on appeal, and can be found in a transcript, but even if you had lots of transcripts for cases (something that no trial court system in the U.S. routinely makes available to non\\-parties), you would have to pour over the entire undifferentiated transcript to find instances in which motions are made, which in a multi\\-day trial is a daunting task. And, it typically takes weeks after a trial from which there is an appeal, for an official transcript to be prepared. Written transcripts are frequently never prepared at all in cases that are not appealed. Instead, there are an audio recording and the court reporter's shorthand notes that are stored until a transcript is ordered or the time during which a transcript could be needed has expired.\n\nThere are probably law review or social science academic journal articles in which this issue has been studied in a small number of courts and statistics were gathered from a modest sized sample to look at the issue. But there probably aren't many, and many of the articles are probably fairly old.\n\nIt would be easier to study the number of appellate opinions in which a denial of a motion for mistrial with prejudice was appealed. But, if it is granted, no appeal is possible, so this would be a biased sample (and would not include cases where no appeal was filed from a conviction after such a motion was made and denied). Another difficulty is that only a small share of all criminal appeal decisions are published, and even if you could get all of the unpublished decisions, many unpublished decisions assume a familiarity with the case that non\\-parties would not have and are skimpy on factual recitations as a result, making them difficult to analyze.\n\nThere are good statistics on the number of acquittals and mistrials granted in criminal cases. Even though there are probably not official statistics, it may even be probably possible to find decent research articles on the share of acquittals and mistrials that are due to motion practice, rather than a jury verdict of acquittal or a sua sponte ruling of a judge. A significant subset of these cases would involve mistrial with prejudice motions (although there are other grounds upon which someone can be acquitted in motion practice in criminal trials, and there are other grounds upon which a mistrial could be granted in a criminal trial).\n\nSo, in short, there is some data out there from which one could cobble together some educated guesses and estimates, but the kind of data your question is looking for does not exist and would be very difficult to compile comprehensively or even for a large sample.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is a percentage which even if you knew it in one state or in the federal court system, is likely to be quite different in a different court system.\n\nIn the same vein, for example, there are almost no grand jury \"no bills\" in which a grand jury refuses to indict a defendant in the federal court system, but the percentages are in the mid\\-double digit percentages in some Southern U.S. counties. Local practice norms and customs and differences in the relevant criminal court rules, influence these numbers a great deal.\n\nAnother key difference would involve the character and length of the trials involved. There are going to be more mistrial motions in murder cases that last many days, than there are in half day long traffic offense jury trials. If you can't break down the numbers by case type, data from numerous but trivial trials will drown out the data on what is typical in the kind of cases you are really interested in knowing about.\n\nAs a practical matter, asking an experienced practitioner in criminal cases for a general impression of how common something is and a vague guess of its order of magnitude frequency would probably be a more reliable way to get good information.

Then, by tendering 3 pennies on that day, you satisfied your obligation in full and they are not living up to their obligation.\n\nIf the late fee is stated as a sum certain in the lease, however, and not as a percentage, you might be obligated to pay $71\\.23 by the terms of the lease, even though charge a late fee of $71\\.20 for paying 3 cents one day late probably violated usury and consumer protection laws in Kentucky, as well as the common law related to liquidated damages which requires penalties in contractual agreements to be proportionate to the breach of the contract. The maximum legal interest rate in Kentucky is set forth at \u00a7 360\\.010 of its statutes is is the greater of the commercial discount rate on 90 day paper plus 4%, or 19%, which is smaller. There is a civil penalty of double the amount of the usurious interest paid. \u00a7 310\\.020\\.

But that is a matter of policy or choice by the authorities, who may choose to prosecute any instance of fraud if they see fit.\n\nSuch a situation may involve other crimes as well.

However, most online stores' terms are very clear there is no contract when you place your order or when you get their automated reply; the contract comes into existence later when they do something. For [example](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM#GUID-32F0D8DC-150F-4394-921F-77B2DB58A4F8__SECTION_5F2219ED7FA0401E868369AC40D9CE8B):\n\n> With respect to products sold by Amazon AU, your order is an offer to us for you to buy the product(s) in your order. ... **The Order Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm our acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered.** **We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product(s) to you and send e\\-mail or post a message on the Message Centre of the website confirming that we've dispatched the product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation\").** ...\n\nNow, even without these terms, it's unlikely that your offer and the company's automated response created a binding contract because the company (as in, an actual person acting for the company) did not consent to the formation of the contract. Consent is fundamental: see [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid).\n\nWhat you received was an \"order confirmation\" \\- a reiteration of your offer to the company, not an acceptance of your order.\n\nConsumer protection\n-------------------\n\nMost jurisdictions have consumer protection laws that make it illegal to display an incorrect price.

The \"order confirmation\" is usually just an acknowledgment of receiving the order, not an acceptance. The charging of the credit card alone does not constitute acceptance of the contract. Most online stores reserve the right to cancel orders due to pricing errors up until the point of dispatch.

So I guess you are asking us to first devise a plausible injury to the candidate coming from the IRS action, and then see if that really gives them standing. At the outset, it is also important to fix on a reason why tax exempt status was not revoked (there is a separate law, the Church Audit Procedures Act about enforcing the Johnson provisions,\nsee [Branch Ministries v. Rossotti](https://casetext.com/case/branch-ministries-v-rossotti)), i.e. was there a complaint, was it investigated... did the IRS say \"Yep, a violation, but we don't care\"?\n\nThe case [Allen v. Wright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/468/737/), 468 U.S. 737 is relevant to this attempt. Racially\\-discriminatory private schools are not eligible for tax exemptions granted by the IRS: plaintiffs alleged that IRS procedures for vetting applicants on this ground were insufficient. The Supreme Court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring this lawsuit. The harms alleged in the suit are summarized as follows\n\n> First, they say that they are harmed directly by the mere fact of\n> Government financial aid to discriminatory private schools. Second,\n> they say that the federal tax exemptions to racially discriminatory\n> private schools in their communities impair their ability to have\n> their public schools desegregated.\n\nThese harms are analogous to ones that might be raised in your scenario. The alleged harms in the case were not well\\-enough explained that the court had to do a lot of conjecturing to decide *whether* there was cognizable harm. It was observed that\n\n> This Court has repeatedly held that an asserted right to have the\n> Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing\n> alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court\n\nwith various citations (\"Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937\\). Respondents here have no standing to complain simply that their Government is violating the law\"). You can't just sue the government because it isn't enforcing the law.\n\nThe problem is that the candidate is not obviously harmed by the Government giving tax relief to a third party. A suggestion is made in the opinion as to how such an argument might be sustainable:\n\n> The diminished ability of respondents' children to receive a\n> desegregated education would be fairly traceable to unlawful IRS\n> grants of tax exemptions only if there were enough racially\n> discriminatory private schools receiving tax exemptions in\n> respondents' communities for withdrawal of those exemptions to make an\n> appreciable difference in public school integration.\n\nPlaintiffs did not make any such argument.\n\nWe would need to identify a right of the plaintiff\\-candidate which was trod upon by the government, in not withdrawing tax\\-exempt status of a third party, one who exercised their First Amendment right to express support for or against a political candidate. Whereas in the education case there is a clear right (the right to receive an education irrespective of race), there is no \"right to be elected\", there is at best a \"right to run for office\" and not a \"right to win\".

The documentation emphasizes that one cannot simply sue the government for not enforcing a law. Smith would need to demonstrate a legally cognizable injury resulting from the IRS's inaction, which would be difficult in this case. The harm to Smith's election chances due to a third party's tax status is not a clear legal injury, similar to how the plaintiffs in Allen v.

The license terms of an electronic book could be subject to various controls, and the license might be non\\-transferable.

They state that they are an Equal Opportunity Employer and list about 20 protected classes on the basis of which they ban discrimination. In our state, Michigan, only race, sex, and religion are protected classes under the law. But my company lists many more protected classes, including marital status, family size, sexual orientation, gender identity, political affiliation, and others. This is an internal policy, not law, but I'm wondering if this internal policy might conflict with the law.\n\nI know from personal experience that many religions require adherents to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Thus, nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is against those religions.\n\nAccording to the law, though, employers cannot discriminate on the basis of religion/religious affiliation. So when my company forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, as it does, it appears to violate the right of employees from certain religious backgrounds to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n**In other words, my employer \\- via their nondiscrimination policy \\- seems to be discriminating against employees whose religion requires them to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.**\n\n**So, is it the case that my company's nondiscrimination policy conflicts with the law?**\n\n(This situation doesn't impact me directly; I'm religious, but I'm emphatically *not* from a religion that requires discrimination.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The theory would be that because of federal law prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of religion, an employer would have to make a reasonable accommodation to the religious employee's requirements. Thus if your religion prohibits working on Friday, if it is reasonable to do so, the employer must allow you to work some other day. However, if store is only open on Friday, then it's not reasonable to employ a person who will never show up at work.\n\nNow suppose that a company prohibits employees from discriminating on the basis of family size. That would mean that a manager is not allowed to demote, fail to promote, *or* favorably promote an employee on the grounds that his family has fewer than members. (\"Discriminate\" means both favor and disfavor). It would be legal under current law to discriminate this way, and it is also legal for a company to prohibit such discrimination.\n\nEnter the employee with a putative religious obligation to actively discriminate against people with \"small\" families. The employee discovers that his cubicle\\-partner Bill has only 8 family members, and he starts loudly denouncing Bill \u2013 which disrupts the work environment. A reasonable accommodation might be to stick employee in a cubicle with a different co\\-worker (one who is religiously acceptable). But the specific circumstances matter, so if employee and Bill are the entire accounting department, this is not a reasonable accommodation. Nor is it reasonable to fire Bill. In that case, employee has to conduct himself politely while on the job. He is free to internally hate Bill, he just is not allowed to act on that hatred based on a claim that his religion requires him to act out.\n\nAt some point, the question could end up at the Supreme Court: can a policy against outrageous behavior be overruled (owing to anti\\-discrimination laws that require religious accommodation) because a person's religion is argued to require the outrageous behavior?

According to the documentation, employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for employees' religious beliefs under anti-discrimination laws. However, these accommodations must be \"reasonable\" and not cause undue hardship to the company or violate the rights of other employees. The company wouldn't be required to allow open discrimination that disrupts the work environment or infringes on other employees' rights. The company's policy itself isn't illegal (ruling out A), but the employee isn't completely exempt from following it either (ruling out B).

This is one you pointed out in your question and is pretty common.\n2. **Common Fund Doctrine.** This is legal principle that courts have applied where it would be unfair for a plaintiff to pay their legal fees because it would be ultimately coming out of their pocket. Some classic examples are: A beneficiary suing a trustee for violating his fiduciary duties; shareholders suing the management of a company; and some types of class\\-action and antitrust cases where the efforts of the attorneys benefited the \"common good\".\n3. **Contempt** proceedings. *See [Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/261/399/)*, 261 U.S. 399 (1923\\). This would only apply where one party is asking the Court to hold an opposing party in contempt, not where a judge initiates a contempt proceeding. Today, most states and the federal system have court rules that would likely apply here as well.\n4. **Bad Faith** litigation. As you noted in your question. This would be bad\\-faith/frivolous lawsuits and action in litigation that needlessly delay or increase the expenses of the opposing party.\n5. **Statutes**. This is by far the largest category. There are too many statutes to list but here is a sample of some broad categories:\n\n\t* Civil Rights Cases (Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, housing discrimination, Americans with Disabilities Act, Etc.)\n\t* Consumer Protection cases (Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, etc.)\n\t* Landlord\\-Tenant cases\n\t* Environmental Protection Cases\n\t* Open Records Law cases (Freedom of Information Act and similar state statutes)\n\nThe statutes that contain fee\\-shifting provisions are generally ones where litigation is thought to be in the \"public interest.\" The idea is that the legislature wants to encourage the private enforcement of certain laws. Allowing the recovery of attorney's fees provides financial incentives for lawyer to take cases where the ultimate damages award is small and might be less than their legal fees.\n\nThere is a good law review article in the American University Law Review called [The American Rule on Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person's Access to Justice](http://www.aulawreview.org/pdfs/42/42-4/vargo.pdf) on this topic.

Even in cases where the biological father was a minor or a victim of statutory rape, courts have ruled that they are still liable for child support. The reasoning often cited is that while the sexual act may not have been legally consensual, the biological father's perceived personal consent or participation makes them responsible for the consequences. This approach suggests that courts are likely to hold biological fathers financially responsible in most cases, even when conception occurs under questionable circumstances, to ensure the child's needs are met. While there's limited information on cases of complete non-consent, the trend indicates that biological paternity often leads to financial responsibility, regardless of how conception occurred."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83584/is-accepting-a-deferred-prosecution-agreement-an-admission-of-guilt", "docs_id": 83584, "title": "Is accepting a deferred prosecution agreement an admission of guilt?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a January 7, 2021 press release, [\"Boeing Charged with 737 Max Fraud Conspiracy and Agrees to Pay over $2\\.5 Billion,\"](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion) the U.S. Department of Justice says,\n\n> The Boeing Company (Boeing) has entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve a criminal charge related to a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) in connection with the FAA AEG\u2019s evaluation of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX airplane.\n> \n> \n> Boeing, a U.S.\\-based multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells commercial airplanes to airlines worldwide, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information filed today in the Northern District of Texas.

Other provisions regulate evacuation, ventilation, heating, disabled access, etc.\n\nThere is no provision regarding when employees are permitted to use the restrooms. There can't be a single rule that works for every profession: some jobs don't let you leave your post whenever you like (e.g. machine operator, driver, guard, teacher, etc.).\n\nThe most common dispute regarding restroom use is whether employees should be paid during that time. Some employers want to count restroom use as unpaid pause time. Strictly speaking, that's legal: an employee who is in a restroom is not at the employer's disposal, therefore this doesn't count as work time. However enforcing this is often logistically difficult and wildly unpopular, so in practice it's only done in places where employees must clock out to reach a restroom.\n\nI could only find one case with actual jurisprudence. In 1995, an industrial butchering company (Bigard) decided to [limit restroom breaks to three fixed times a day](http://www.liberation.fr/economie/1995/08/09/greve-contre-le-pipi-a-heures-fixespause-pipi-a-8h05-11h20-et-14h05-c-est-le-reglement-chez-bigard_141877).

Your case is also slightly different in that the restrooms would only be inaccessible for an hour, which is shorter than in the Bigard case. So legally speaking, it isn't clear who will win. You'll have a better chance of success by banking on the unpopularity of the measure. Talk with your colleagues and your representatives and shop stewards.

While French labor law doesn't explicitly state when employees can use restrooms, there is a precedent from a 1995 case where a company's attempt to limit restroom breaks to fixed times was struck down by a labor court. Although the case didn't reach an appellate court, it suggests that completely restricting bathroom access, even for a short period, could be successfully challenged. The law requires employers to provide sufficient restrooms, but doesn't specify usage times. However, the precedent indicates that overly restrictive policies may not be upheld if challenged.

However, if that user did not create the image but got it from somewhere else, it was quite probably protected by copyright and used without permission. If \"Ongky Denny Wijaya\" did not have the rights to the image, then s/he could not license them, and all uses on SE and deriving from SE are copyright infringements, and the copyright holder, whoever that is, could sue for damages.\n\nThe first two answers to [your SE question](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/570484/how-to-draw-a-rose-in-latex)  give LaTeX code for rose images only slightly resembling the original rose image.

Patent restrictions apply to both commercial and open-source/free software.\n2. Consulting a patent lawyer is crucial to understand how to implement similar features without infringing on existing patents.\n3. Simply changing the implementation slightly may not be enough to avoid patent infringement, as demonstrated by the compression example in the text.\n4.

Indeed academic ethics generally require doing so, although there is (in most cases) no legal requirement to do so. Listing the title, author, and publication information of a source is not an infringement of copyright. That J. Jones published an article on \"How to Find the Purple Moth\" \\[*imaginary example*] in volume 28 of the *Journal of Moth Science* is a fact.Facts are never protected by copyright. Indeed in US law [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) provides that:\n\n> b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nThe laws of other countries are similar on this point. Indeed I do not know of any country in which facts are protected by copyright.\n\nSo, including such references is fully legal, and no permission from the sources being cited is required. This is true whatever form the reference takes. In particular, if an online address for the content is included, this is still true.\n\nI do not know whether Medium, or any other specific publishing platform, will pat fees to authors based on clik\\-thru from such citations.

According to copyright law, including references and citations to show where facts or data were derived from is legal and does not infringe on copyright. Facts themselves are not protected by copyright, as stated in 17 USC 102(b). Proper attribution through referencing is not only legal but often ethically required in academic writing. This remains true regardless of whether the author potentially earns money from the article. The author can include references in any form, including links to online sources, as long as they acknowledge the origin of the information.

Can we procure the seeds, plant the seeds, how mature can they be grown, can they be harvested but not sold, etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under federal law, it is illegal the minute you have any marijuana or marijuana seeds. Likewise under NJ law, except if authorized by state law, for medical marijuana production.\n\nUnder NJ's medical [marijuana law](ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/PL09/307_.HTM), \"alternative treatment centers\" grow and dispense medical marijuana, and there is no provision for mass\\-production growers (who don't distribute). Such a center is \"an organization approved by the department \\[of Health and Senior Services] to perform activities necessary to provide registered qualifying patients with usable marijuana and related paraphernalia in accordance with the provisions of this act\". The department accepts applications to operate such a center, and \"shall seek to ensure the availability of a sufficient number of alternative treatment centers throughout the State, pursuant to need, including at least two each in the northern, central, and southern regions of the State\" (they have to find a need for another center in a location, in order for one to get authorized; this is evaluated every 2 years). There are criminal background checks for those involved with a treatment center. According to [this article](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/njs_5th_medical_marijuana_dispensary_to_open_thurs.html), there are a maximum of 6 centers to be opened, in Montclair, Egg Harbor Township, Woodbridge, Bellmawr, and Cranbury (existing), and Secaucus (under review). The article implies that 6 is the statutory maximum, but that is the statutory *minimum*, though probably the regulatory maximum (i.e. the state will not authorize any further centers). It also says that the centers must be non\\-profit, though the law only requires the first two to be non\\-profit (though it could be a de facto requirement via the regulatory power of the Dept. of Health). Since they don't seem to be eager to expand availability, there isn't any information on what other requirements there are for operating such a center, though the application form is [here](http://www.nj.gov/health/medicalmarijuana/documents/atc_permitting_request.pdf).\n\nThe [2016 annual report](http://www.nj.gov/health/medicalmarijuana/documents/annual_report_2016.pdf) gives information on production at the 5 existing centers, which is in the range of 400\\-800 lbs annually.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under New Jersey law, which of the following statements is true regarding the establishment and operation of medical marijuana facilities?\n\nA) Any individual can start growing marijuana plants as long as they intend to sell for medical purposes once it becomes fully legal.\n\nB) The state allows an unlimited number of alternative treatment centers to be opened, provided they meet all regulatory requirements.\n\nC) Alternative treatment centers must be approved by the Department of Health and Senior Services, and the state seeks to ensure availability based on need in different regions.\n\nD) Federally, it is legal to procure and plant marijuana seeds as long as the plants are not harvested for sale.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, alternative treatment centers in New Jersey must be approved by the Department of Health and Senior Services. The state aims to ensure the availability of these centers based on need, with at least two centers in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the state.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because individuals cannot start growing marijuana without proper authorization, even if they intend to sell for medical purposes in the future.\n\nAnswer B is false because the state does not allow an unlimited number of centers.

This largely overlaps with the answer given by @DavidSiegel, but I believe that an example is useful because of the recursive nature of subsequent divisions of property.\n\nSuppose:\n\n* Dead person A has five children: B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5\\.\n* B4 and B5 died a few years ago.\n* B4's children are C1, C2, and C3\\.\n* B5 has no children and no descendants.\n* C3 is dead.\n* C3's children are dead, but his grandchildren are D1 and D2, and both of them alive.\n\nPerson A is called the Designated Ancestor. His property is divided into four equal shares (it would be five equal shares if B5 were alive or had any surviving descendants).\n\nThe first division consists of giving B1, B2, and B3 their share. That is, each one of them gets 1/4 of A' property. That accounts for 3/4 of A's property.\n\nThe remaining 1/4 of A's property cannot be given to B4 because B4 is dead. But it will be distributed among his children, which constitutes the second division, now B4 being called the Designated Ancestor.\n\nThe second division consists of dividing B4's share (which we may call \"B4's property\") into three equal shares because all B4's children are alive (C1 and C2\\) or have descendants (C3\\). Thus, C1 gets 1/3 of B4's property, and so does C2\\. C3's share (\"C3's property\") will be distributed among C3's descendants, which constitutes the third division with C3 as the Designated Ancestor.\n\nIn this third division, C3's share is divided into two (equal) halves.

B1, B2, and B3 each receive 1/4. B4's 1/4 share is then divided among their descendants. C1 and C2 each receive 1/3 of B4's share (which is 1/12 of the total). C3's 1/3 of B4's share (also 1/12 of the total) is divided equally between D1 and D2, so they each receive 1/24 of the total.
