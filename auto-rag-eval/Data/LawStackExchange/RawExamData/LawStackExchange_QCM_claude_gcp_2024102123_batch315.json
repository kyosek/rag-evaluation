            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm far from ready to start a business at the moment, but I'm definitely considering it and working towards being more ready. That being said, I'm mostly considering starting my own restaurant, and I'm thinking of naming it \"Jughead's Malt Shop\", \"Jughead's Diner\", just \"Jughead's\" or something very similar (I can format it in a different fashion, such as Jug Head's, if that helps the legality of this). I'm worried about the Jughead part of the name mostly \\- the name would be inspired by a very iconic comic book character that's copyrighted by Archie Comics. They would most likely never become aware of the business and seeing that they don't publish comics in my country and haven't done so since 1997 they might not even care...but I don't want to take my chances.\n\n(I'm based in Finland \\- I feel as if this might be very useful information)\n\n(Jughead's Diner might be the worst name out of those three to choose because it's both the most boring one as well as the title of a comic book that has been published)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not, without permission.\n\nImages of the character are usually copyrighted. The characters themselves are usually protected by trademark. Using the name of a fictional character without permission would imply endorsement by the firm that published works with that character. I've taken day long seminars focused mostly on all of the things that comic book companies do to protect their intellectual property rights in their characters.\n\nOf course, if you live in Finland, it is likely that no one in the U.S. would decide to take up the case for a U.S. media property, either because they aren't aware of it, or because it isn't economically worthwhile to pursue.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Finnish entrepreneur is considering opening a restaurant named \"Jughead's Malt Shop,\" inspired by the Archie Comics character. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of using this name without permission?\n\nA) It's legally safe to use the name since Archie Comics hasn't published in Finland since 1997.\nB) Using the name is permissible as long as it's slightly modified, such as \"Jug Head's.\"\nC) The entrepreneur can use the name freely as long as they don't use any images of the character.\nD) Using the name without permission could potentially infringe on trademark and imply unauthorized endorsement.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Using the name \"Jughead's\" for a commercial enterprise without permission from Archie Comics could potentially infringe on trademark rights and imply an unauthorized endorsement by the comic book company. Even though Archie Comics hasn't published in Finland since 1997, intellectual property rights are often international in scope. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the lack of recent publication in Finland doesn't negate the company's intellectual property rights. \n\nOption B is incorrect because slightly modifying the name doesn't necessarily avoid trademark infringement. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while avoiding the use of images might sidestep copyright issues, it doesn't address the trademark concerns associated with using the character's name.\n\nWhile it's true that Archie Comics might not become aware of the business or choose to pursue legal action in Finland, using the name without permission still carries legal risks."

In these cases, the promisee's action is exchanged for a promise to benefit a third party, which is still considered valid consideration.\n\nOption D, however, does not involve a third-party beneficiary or any conditional element. Greg is simply offering to pay Harry directly for completing an action, which is a straightforward exchange of money for service. While this is a valid contract, it doesn't test the concept of third-party beneficiary consideration like the other options.\n\nThe key point from the original text is that consideration can be valid even when the promisee doesn't directly benefit, as long as there's an intended beneficiary of the promised performance. Options A, B, and C all demonstrate this principle, while D does not."

What happens if, say the Supreme Court, made well reasoned and detailed (but unduly far\\-reaching) conclusions about a legal question deciding which was not at all necessary for the case at hand ?\n\nDo these circumstances alone suffice to argue that these conclusions (insofar as they relate to the question which was not before the court) do not form binding precedents when the legal question arises before a High Court in a future case?\nI am attaching a pic from the book *Constitutional Law of India* Vol\\-II by H.M. Seervai.\n\nThis question is in context of India, but I would appreciate answers from other jurisdictions as well.\n\n[![from page 1675 of the referred book](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NKRpK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NKRpK.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: India [does not have a constitutional court](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-017-5278?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true), which is a term usually reserved for a court which has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional questions and is usually limited to deciding constitutional questions.\n\nIndia has a (mostly) unitary court system capped by the Supreme Court of India, but its jurisdiction is not limited to constitutional questions, and it is not the only court in India that can interpret and apply the Constitution of India.\n\nWhen a component of a decision decided by the Supreme Court of India is not necessary for resolution of the case before it, that portion of the decision is called *dicta* and is not binding precedent although it is still persuasive authority before lower courts as it is a good indication of how the Supreme Court of India would resolve a case in future litigation. The same distinction between portions of a ruling that are binding precedents and those that are mere dicta also applies in all other appellate courts in a common law legal system such as India's.\n\nAlso, a portion of a court decision is not *dicta* merely because it is far reaching. A binding precedent can be broad or narrow in the deciding court's discretion. What makes \"dicta\" distinct is that it is literally \"off topic\" and not literally controlled by the potentially broad principles used to decide the case before the Court. What determines whether a part of the ruling is \"off topic\" is the exact scope of the issue that the court states that it is resolving.\n\nFor example, if the Court states that it is resolving the question of \"due process in an admiralty case\" and remarks on due process in an ordinary non\\-admiralty case, the later remarks are dicta. But if the court states that it is resolving the question of \"due process in a legal proceeding\" then the same statement is not dicta.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Supreme Court of India issues a ruling in a case involving maritime law. In its decision, the court extensively discusses the application of due process in criminal proceedings, even though this was not directly relevant to the maritime dispute at hand. How should lower courts in India treat this discussion of due process in criminal proceedings?\n\nA) As binding precedent that must be followed in all future criminal cases\nB) As persuasive authority that can be considered but is not binding\nC) As completely irrelevant and to be disregarded entirely\nD) As binding precedent only in maritime cases involving criminal elements\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The discussion of due process in criminal proceedings, when not directly relevant to the maritime case at hand, would be considered dicta. In Indian law, as in other common law systems, dicta are not binding precedent. However, because they come from the Supreme Court, they would be considered persuasive authority. Lower courts can consider this discussion and may find it influential, but they are not bound to follow it as they would be with the parts of the decision directly relevant to resolving the maritime dispute. The dicta provides insight into the Supreme Court's thinking on the matter, which makes it persuasive, but not binding. Option A is incorrect because dicta are not binding precedent. Option C is too extreme; while not binding, the discussion is not completely irrelevant. Option D is incorrect because the discussion's status as dicta is not limited to or determined by the type of case in which it appears."

The burden of proof lies entirely with the prosecution, and the defense is not required to assist them in building their case. Furthermore, the defense can and likely would use such contradictory statements to discredit the witness during cross-examination, as this can be an effective strategy to undermine the credibility of the prosecution's case.

In that case, you are not eligible to return on the basis of your green card. See [8 CFR 211\\.1(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/211.1), which provides that the green card may be used by someone who is arriving \"as a lawful permanent resident returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence in the United States.\"\n\nInstead, you should relinquish your permanent residence (using [form I\\-407](https://www.uscis.gov/i-407)) and apply for a B\\-2 visa (although this may not be possible these days because of COVID\\-19\\).\n\nYou should also be aware that retaining your green card means that you are liable to report your worldwide income to the IRS, and potentially pay income tax on it, even if you are not physically present in the US.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you intend to return to the United States eventually and resume your residence there, you can indeed use your green card to enter the US, provided you have not been absent for more than a year.

However, consulting an immigration lawyer is crucial because the US government might still determine that he abandoned his permanent residence.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A month ago I went into my apartment complexes office and handed a typed 60 day notice to the person at the front desk. They lost the notice or misplaced it. When the my new landlord called my current landlord for a reference, I got a rather unhappy surprise when my new landlord was told I hadn't given notice. Now I did take a digital photo of the dated notice with my phone prior to giving it to the person at the desk of my apartment complex. The photo which is dated, has location data on it showing I took a photo in the apartments business center which is in the room next to the office. If they don't let me out of my agreement are there better avenues than court for what they have to do?\nAre there requirements that they have to prove they received the notice? Do they have to honor the notice or can they just continue to say we didn't get it. As this would seem unfair to tenants.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no law requiring a person to say nice things about you, or specifically for a landlord to give a positive recommendation. However, you can sue a person for defamation, if they have said untrue things that harmed you. You would then need to show that he said things, that they were untrue, and that you were harmed. The main issue on the first point would what exactly he said. A subjective stars rating is neither true nor false, nor is a comment \"I would give negative 5 stars if it were possible\". The statement \"Smith abandoned his apartment without giving the required 60 day notice, thus breaching his lease\" could be true or false. You would then need to provide believable evidence that the statement is false. You would need to hire an attorney versed in local defamation law and practices to know whether your evidence would be deemed sufficiently credible, but on the face of it, you have fairly good evidence (assuming that they don't have iron\\-clad proof that you never entered the office). Then you would have to prove that you were harmed, requiring some legal remedy. One out\\-there option would be to sue them for a million dollars: it is unlikely that you actually suffered a million dollars damage. On the minimal side, you reputation has been besmirched, and a letter retracting the accusation would certainly be appropriate. Your attorney would advise you of the best remedy.\n\nIt is not always necessary to file a lawsuit and pursue the matter through the courts. One might get a satisfactory result by having an attorney write a letter outlining the wrong that the other party has committed, and what you want by way of remedy. Even before that, you can (for free) inform them of what actually happened and mention that you'd prefer not to have the courts resolve the matter.\n\nIt is not clear whether you mean that the former landlord is suing you for breach. If so, your concern would be showing that you complied with the terms of the lease, especially that you did deliver the notice to the correct location in the correct manner in a timely fashion. Leases do not typically include onerous notice requirements (whereas legal notices may require delivery by certified mail). Again, the main factual question would be whether you did comply (and thus did not break the leash).",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant, Tom, gave a 60-day notice to vacate to his apartment complex's front desk, but the complex claims they never received it. Tom has a dated digital photo with location data showing he was in the complex's business center next to the office on the day he claims to have given notice. The complex is now suing Tom for breach of lease. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Tom's legal position?\n\nA) Tom's digital photo is inadmissible as evidence in court and he has no legal recourse against the complex.\n\nB) Tom can easily win the case by presenting the digital photo, as it provides irrefutable proof of notice delivery.\n\nC) Tom has a strong defense against the breach claim, but may need additional evidence or testimony to corroborate his story.\n\nD) Tom should immediately file a defamation lawsuit against the complex for denying receipt of his notice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement regarding Tom's legal position. While Tom's digital photo provides good evidence that he was at the apartment complex on the day he claims to have given notice, it doesn't definitively prove that he actually handed over the notice. However, it does significantly strengthen his case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the digital photo would likely be admissible as evidence, especially given its metadata.\n\nOption B overstates the strength of Tom's evidence. While the photo is helpful, it's not \"irrefutable proof\" of notice delivery.\n\nOption D is premature and potentially excessive. Before considering a defamation lawsuit, Tom should focus on defending against the breach claim and possibly seek a less confrontational resolution, such as having an attorney write a letter to the complex outlining the facts.\n\nThe correct approach (C) recognizes that Tom has a strong defense but may need to gather additional evidence or testimony, such as from the front desk person who received the notice, to fully corroborate his story in court."

The officer will need to see it to know if you have insurance or not. To him, it doesn't matter what the reason is that you don't provide it to him. Left it at home, misplaced it, lost it, destroyed it, or just refuse to provide it because you feel you have the right to refuse. He can't \"force\" you to provide it (unless he is able to search your car and happens to find it there). He can only issue you a ticket for not providing it.\n\nBut your attitude could play a part in what happens next. Being upfront and letting the officer know you have left your documents at home could help your situation.\n\nIn my experience... one time that this sort of thing happened to me, the officer agreed to hold my drivers license and allowed me to bring the documents to the police station and retrieve my license.\n\nAnother time, in a parking related matter, I was issued a ticket, but I was allowed to bring the required documents to the police station where they then \"invalidated\" (cancelled) the ticket.\n\nOf course this won't always work, and is not at all likely to work if you are far from home.\n\nKeep in mind, (as far as I know, in most states) the real infraction is that you \"don't have insurance\"... that you failed to provide proof when asked, is secondary. In many cases (likely nearly all cases), if you show up in court and provide documents that your insurance is current, and was current at the time the ticket was issued, the judge (or the prosecutor) will likely dismiss the case with no penalties. But, what the officer has written down on the ticket about your attitude and what you told him at the time, may have an effect on how this all plays out.",

The driver does not have their proof of insurance with them. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The officer cannot issue a ticket if the driver explains they left the insurance documents at home.\nB) The officer can forcibly search the vehicle to find proof of insurance without a warrant.\nC) The officer can issue a ticket for failure to provide proof of insurance, regardless of whether the driver actually has insurance.\nD) If the driver refuses to provide proof of insurance, they cannot be penalized as long as they actually have valid insurance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the police officer can issue a ticket if the driver fails to provide proof of insurance, regardless of the reason. The officer cannot force the driver to produce the document or search the car without cause, but can issue a ticket for failure to provide proof. The driver's actual insurance status is secondary to the requirement of providing proof when asked. While being cooperative might help the situation, it doesn't prevent the officer from issuing a ticket. Options A and D are incorrect because explaining the absence of documents or actually having insurance doesn't exempt the driver from the requirement to provide proof. Option B is incorrect as it violates Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches."

Currently we can employ experts to detect whether such images are genuine or not. However as technology progresses, this will become less\\-and\\-less feasible. (Note, my background is in technology)\n\nFor example, one established method of making such fakes more realistic is to pit another AI against them. The second AI attempts to distinguish between real and fabricated images. The first AI then learns from this and tries to fool the second AI more effectively, and so on.\n\nThis purely machine\\-based co\\-evolution can happen very quickly and produces better and better fakes and better and better detectors. At some point, fakes will become so good that even other machines will not be able to detect the difference.\n\nI see two problems with respect to presenting digital evidence in court:\n\n1. The guilty can claim that any digital evidence is fake.\n2. The innocent will be unable to produce any convincing digital alibi and could be portrayed doing something that they did not (perhaps by digitally\\-altered CCTV footage).\n\n*Assuming* that there comes a time where digital fakes are completely indistinguishable from reality, how could this affect the working of current court proceedings? (Any justice system may be discussed)\n\n---\n\n**Note**\nIn case anyone thinks his cannot be answered objectively, I would counter that I am seeking specific information.

If a paramedic removed it to attempt first aid, the paramedic would testify. So would the officer who bagged it, and the forensic analyst who took the fingerprints. A pathologist would testify if the knife was consistent with the stab wound (a careful pathologist could never swear that the knife was the cause of death, just that it matches). The pathologist would also testify how DNA was collected under the fingernails, and how it was sent to the lab. The defense may claim that the suspect also tried first aid, or that a corrupt cop forced the suspect to hold the knife. The court or jury then draw their conclusions from this and other testimony.\n\nSame here. A lifelike picture found on the web proves nothing. A witness who takes the stand to testify that he or she took a certain picture would be more credible. So would a forensic officer who testifies how she or he removed the data from a surveillance camera, checked for common signs of tampering, and then signed a copy of the data with a private key. (The signing shows no third\\-party tampering after collection, it is not evidence of integrity before that.)\n\nYears ago, in [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\"), there was the case of a bank robber who claimed that a fleeing suspect had handed him a bag of money in the forest and then vanished. \"Prove it wasn't so,\" he demanded. \"You can't.

Page 16\\. All boldings and italics are mine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A security interest is an interest that only extends as a security, i.e. \"Property that is given or pledged to guarantee the performance of an obligation\".\n\nSo for example, a bank mortgaging a house has a security interest in the property, allowing them to do things such as force a foreclosure sale in certain circumstances, as well as claim their money immediately if the property is sold; likewise, a car title loan issuer has a security interest in the car their loan is based off of. This doesn't have to be a loan debt; it can be a performance bond, such as a bail bond to appear in court.\n\nA security interest does not extend to the property itself, merely the obligation. So, for example, if you default on a home loan, the mortgage company can foreclose and force a sale, but they cannot claim all of the money of the sale, only the portion corresponding to the debt (e.g. if you default on a debt that is currently 100k, secured by one's house, and the house sells in foreclose for 200k, the bank can only keep 100k (plus allowed fees); the remainder must be paid to the former owner).\n\nA property interest that is not a security interest is an interest in the property itself. So for example, owning a portion of a house, via an inheritance, is a property interest; because it is not a guarantee for anything, it is not a security interest. Or in other words, a property that is not a security interest is the \"default\" state, with said property interest only becoming a security interest if it is pledged in some manner.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding Sarah's interest in the house?\n\nA) Sarah has a security interest in the house for $100,000\nB) Sarah has a property interest in 50% of the house and a security interest in the other 50%\nC) Sarah has a property interest in 50% of the house, while John has a security interest in Sarah's 50% share\nD) Sarah has no property interest in the house, only a security interest of $100,000\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because Sarah is the borrower, not the lender. The security interest would be held by John, who is lending the money.\n\nB) is incorrect because Sarah's property interest and the security interest are not split in this way. She retains her full property interest, which is used as collateral.\n\nC) is correct. Sarah inherited 50% of the house, giving her a property interest in half of its value. By using her share as collateral for the loan from John, she has allowed John to hold a security interest in her 50% share. This security interest does not change Sarah's underlying property interest, but gives John certain rights if Sarah defaults on the loan.\n\nD) is incorrect because Sarah still retains her property interest in 50% of the house. The loan and associated security interest do not erase her ownership stake; they merely encumber it.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the difference between property interests and security interests, as well as how these concepts apply in real-world scenarios involving shared property and loans."

One may not, under UK copyright law (or indeed under any copyright law) simply copy the words and phrases used by someone else, even with trivial changes, to avoid the effort of composing one's own words to express an idea or describe and event. a [close paraphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrasing_of_copyrighted_material) will generally be considered an infringement of copyright.\n\nHowever, copyright does not protect ideas. A journalist may describe an event, basing the account on the3 accounts of other journalists. As long as the new account does not directly copy or closely imitate the source accounts, it will probably not be treated as an infringement of copyright.\n\nThe \"fair dealing\" in UK law is a narrower exception to copyright than the US concept of \"fair use\". According to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing#United_Kingdom):\n\n> Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), fair dealing is limited to the following purposes: research and private study (both must be non\\-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news reporting (sections 29, 30, 178\\); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching.\n\nSo unless the use by the second journalist fits one of those categories, fair dealing will not apply. If the copied content is incorporated into a commercially published article, it fairly obviously is not for the purpose of \"research and private study\" or \"illustration for teaching\". It might well, however, be for \"news reporting\" or one of the other fair dealing purposes, and the detailed facts of the matter would be used to determine if this was a case of fair dealing or not.\n\nArticle 2 paragraph (8\\) of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) says that:\n\n> The protection of this Convention shall not apply to news of the day or to miscellaneous facts having the character of mere items of press information.\n\nSection 30 paragraph (2\\) the [UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III) says:\n\n> Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events does not infringe any copyright in the work provided that (subject to subsection (3\\)) it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement.\n\nTaken literally these provisions would seem to mean that there is no copyright at all on news reports in the UK. I do not believe that that is a correct interpretation. I think that those refer to not attempting to prevent the use of copyright from precluding the reporting of actual events, where a previous report is a matter of \"bare facts\". I don't have any case law on how Section 39 (2\\) has been applied.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A journalist, working for a major newspaper, writes an article about a recent political scandal. The article includes several paragraphs that closely paraphrase content from another journalist's published report on the same scandal, without attribution. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential copyright implications in the UK?\n\nA) The journalist's use of the other report's content is protected under fair dealing for news reporting, regardless of the extent of paraphrasing.\n\nB) There is no copyright protection for news reports in the UK, so the journalist cannot be accused of copyright infringement.\n\nC) The journalist's actions likely constitute copyright infringement, as close paraphrasing without attribution is generally not considered fair dealing.\n\nD) The journalist's employer, not the journalist, would be solely responsible for any copyright infringement claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, close paraphrasing of another's work, even with trivial changes, is generally considered copyright infringement in the UK. While fair dealing does exist for news reporting, it requires sufficient acknowledgement of the source, which is not present in this scenario. The extent of paraphrasing described (\"several paragraphs\") suggests substantial copying rather than mere reporting of facts. Option A is incorrect because fair dealing for news reporting is not a blanket protection and requires proper attribution. Option B is a misinterpretation of the Berne Convention and UK law; while bare facts are not copyrightable, the expression of those facts in a news article can be. Option D is incorrect because both the journalist and the employer could potentially be held responsible for copyright infringement."

Which of the following statements is most accurate and appropriate given the legal and ethical considerations involved?\n\nA) You can simply call a general meeting with 28 days notice and pass an ordinary resolution using your majority shares to remove the other director, as this is fully compliant with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nB) You should immediately consult the company's lawyer to proceed with removing the other director, as they will have the necessary expertise to handle any conflict of interest concerns.\n\nC) You must first clearly distinguish between the individual's performance as an employee versus their performance as a director, and take appropriate action based on the specific role where performance is lacking.\n\nD) As the majority shareholder, you have the right to make decisions in your own best interest, so removing the other director is justified if you believe it will benefit you personally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate response because it recognizes the importance of separating the individual's roles and responsibilities. As stated in the documentation, \"You must also separate the other guy's performance as an employee from his performance as a director.\" This approach ensures that any action taken is based on specific performance issues related to the relevant role.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while it may be technically possible to remove a director through a shareholders' vote, it doesn't address the legal and ethical considerations, particularly the fiduciary duty to act in the company's best interests.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company's lawyer would have a conflict of interest in this situation. The documentation specifically states, \"You need to consult a lawyer before you do anything - it can't be the company's lawyer because he does have a conflict of interest.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because it misunderstands the responsibilities of a director.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes John's potential liability in this situation?\n\nA) John is definitely liable for the damages because he sold the product directly to Sarah.\nB) John is not liable because he sold the laptop as a private individual, not as a business.\nC) John's liability depends on whether he regularly sells electronics or if this was an isolated sale.\nD) John is only liable if he knew about a defect in the laptop and failed to disclose it to Sarah.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because John's liability in this situation depends on whether his selling activity constitutes a business undertaking or if it's considered a private, non-business sale. If John regularly sells electronics on eBay as a business venture, he could be held liable for damages caused by products he sells. However, if this was an isolated or occasional sale of personal property, he would generally not be liable for damages unless he knowingly sold a defective product. The frequency and nature of John's selling activity on eBay would need to be examined to determine his potential liability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because selling a product directly doesn't automatically create liability in all cases. Option B is too absolute, as liability can still exist in some cases of private sales.

The leading case is [R v Rondo](https://www.gotocourt.com.au/criminal-law/nsw/unlawful-searches-reasonable-suspicion/) where the court said:\n\n> reasonable suspicion involves\u00a0less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility. There must be\u00a0something which would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension or fear \u2026A reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence.\n\nHowever, under s9(2\\) they may only stay on the premises \"as long as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.\"\n\nFurther, while Part 9 of the act gives protections to people who are under arrest, these do not apply generally. That is, a question that would be off\\-limits to someone who has been detained is perfectly legitimate to someone who hasn't been. That person can choose to answer or not (they must give their name, address and contact details if asked) and they can choose to stay and be questioned or not because they are not under arrest.\n\nAs for the use of force, [s230](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/leara2002451/s230.html) is very generous:\n\n> It is lawful for a police officer exercising a function under this Act or any other Act or law in relation to an individual or a thing, and anyone helping the police officer, to use such force as is reasonably necessary to exercise the function.\n\nWhat if it isn't?\n-----------------\n\nThe biggest consequence of an illegal search or questioning is that the court may (but is not required to) exclude any evidence obtained at trial.

Some people (or companies) may prefer a simple payout if an earthquake of magnitude Q within R geodesic miles of point S is published on USGS by date T.\n\nPrediction markets are legal in some jurisdictions.

Especially in the early funding rounds.\n\nDeposits could be held at a bank that already meets custodial requirements.

There could be a standard 5\\-day period between expiration and settlement to allow disputes to be resolved before it's too late (wrong party paid). Are there any other potential liabilities to consider?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, whether or not something constitutes gambling as opposed to a legitimate futures market or consulting arrangement, is whether the matter to be predicted is a \"game of chance\" or a matter of skill and science.\n\nEarthquake prediction is in a gray area. There is skill and science involved, and both actuaries for earthquake insurers and government officials do and can make predictions and be paid for making predictions (*ex ante*), and a \"success bonus\" would not be improper.\n\nAt the current levels of scientific knowledge, sufficiently detailed individual predictions are effectively random, but this is also true, for example, for futures markets in agricultural commodities which depend to some extent on weather prediction beyond the scope of current scientific knowledge.\n\nUltimately, I would be surprised if a court held that a prediction market was a form of illegal gambling. Gambling law enforcement in the U.S. is not vigorous, and judges and prosecutors and regulatory agencies have taken note of the fact that true gambling in a variety of forms has been legalized in various contexts, so the public policy against gambling and the will of the key legal actors to enforce edge cases of a prohibition that has increasingly more exceptions to it, seems unlikely. This is particularly true given that economists would be available to testify as to the public policy benefits of prediction markets that set them apart from idle gambling with no positive externalities.\n\nSo, while this isn't a clear cut case, I would expect that a prediction market would not be held to be illegal as a form of gambling. But, it still might be subject to regulation either as a form of commodity market, or as a public contest, or perhaps under principles applicable to trusts and to contracts that are open to being accepted by multiple parties. The administrator would, at a minimum, be a fiduciary with respect to the funds held pending payouts.\n\nThe safer course of action would be to obtain an opinion letter from an attorney, or better yet, an advanced ruling from relevant government agencies such as the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the relevant insurance regulator.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is considering setting up a prediction market for earthquake occurrences, where participants can trade positions on specific earthquake parameters. Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of such a market in the United States?\n\nA) It would definitely be considered illegal gambling and prohibited in all states.\nB) It would be completely unregulated and free from any legal oversight.\nC) It would likely not be considered illegal gambling, but may be subject to regulation as a commodity market or public contest.\nD) It would only be legal if operated by licensed insurance companies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation suggests that while earthquake prediction markets exist in a legal gray area, they are unlikely to be classified as illegal gambling. The key factors supporting this are:\n\n1. Earthquake prediction involves skill and science, unlike pure games of chance.\n2. Similar markets exist for other unpredictable events, like agricultural futures.\n3. There's a trend towards more lenient gambling laws and recognition of the economic benefits of prediction markets.\n4. Economists could testify to the public policy benefits of such markets.\n\nHowever, the market would not be completely unregulated. It might be subject to oversight as a commodity market, public contest, or under trust and contract principles. The operator would likely be considered a fiduciary for the funds held.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the document suggests courts would be unlikely to classify it as illegal gambling. Option B is incorrect because some form of regulation would likely apply. Option D is too restrictive, as the document does not suggest that only insurance companies could legally operate such markets."

I'm concerned that since an interrogatory can be supplemented, that her answers could shift as the litigation progresses. While depositions bring the risk of an \"I don't recall\" answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> should I ask the publisher of the statement what facts she relied on in deposition or via interrogatory?\n\nShort answer: Yes, and you do it through deposition, not through written interrogatories.\n\nLong answer: That is one of the most elementary and obvious questions a defamation plaintiff should formulate. But follow\\-up questions are significantly more important because there is where a defamer is likelier to incur contradictions. Keep in mind that a defamer will hardly ever admit guilt, whence a plaintiff needs skill to evidence the defamer's liability.\n\nAlthough you can expect the defendant to be coached by her lawyer toward deposition, there is only so much that either crook can foresee or predict as to what direction your questioning will take. No lawyer can spoon\\-feed his client on every imaginable question that is relevant to the case. In this regard, the limit is your abilities to plan your questions as well as to \"think quick on your feet\".\n\nA defamer is allowed to answer evasively (saying \"I don't know\", \"I don't recall\", or the like) on written interrogatory, a deposition, or a trial. The difference is that in a written interrogatory the defamer's lawyer has (and will use) the perfect opportunity to fabricate any and all answers, thereby defeating the purpose of follow\\-up questions.\n\nWhether the defendant's answers shift over the course of litigation, that should be the least of your concerns. In fact, the defendant's significant shift might result in the defendant's loss of credibility before the jury.\n\nYou did not specify your jurisdiction. If this is anywhere in the US, you might be interested in my briefs in upper courts ([here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1560.html), [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYWXk2VGdkWjdNS1E), and [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1576.html)). These will acquaint you (as well as any other victims of defamation) with case law on defamation and discovery from various jurisdictions in the US. You are welcome to all other records of the case I have uploaded [here](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html), but the briefs in the MI Supreme Court as well as the SCOTUS (and to a great extent in the MI Court Of Appeals) are most concise, and they reflect more proficiency than what can be expected in a pro se litigant's initial motions.\n\nThis [transcript of defendant's deposition](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYcGI1cFN6TGJqTWs) might also be of your interest. You will notice the defamer answered \"*I don't know*\" and \"*I don't recall*\" to the point of sounding demented. Some inconsistencies of his malingered amnesia are highlighted in the aforementioned briefs. In that transcript, you will also notice his lawyer's [misconduct](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFP9-tZFBtZUMUvo3cGGVdJjgMvLgckK) during the defamer's deposition. This shows the importance for you to be prepared to withstand similar acts of heckling by these people who like to call themselves \"*attorneys in **good** standing*\".\n\nLastly, even if you manage to evidence the defamer's liability and yet the court denies justice, having (and publishing) that evidence is invaluable. Not only this will state the record straight regarding your reputation, but others will be grateful for having verifiable information that will alert them about a defamer who might target them in the future.\n\nSome \"contributors\" here will predictably downvote this answer (just like your question) under the [false excuse](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/770/what-to-do-with-answers-that-offer-legal-advice/775#775) of being \"legal advice\".

        "answer": "Question: In a libel case, which method is generally considered more effective for obtaining information about the facts the publisher relied on when making the allegedly defamatory statement?\n\nA) Written interrogatories\nB) Deposition\nC) Affidavit\nD) Request for admission\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nDeposition is generally considered more effective than written interrogatories for obtaining information about the facts a publisher relied on in a libel case. The answer explains that while both methods can be used, depositions offer several advantages:\n\n1. In a deposition, the plaintiff can ask follow-up questions immediately, which is crucial for exposing contradictions or inconsistencies in the defendant's testimony.\n\n2. Written interrogatories allow the defendant's lawyer to carefully craft responses, potentially avoiding revealing information.\n\n3. While a deponent can still claim \"I don't recall\" in a deposition, the immediate nature of the questioning makes it more challenging to maintain evasive answers consistently.\n\n4. Depositions allow the questioner to observe the deponent's demeanor and body language, which can be valuable for assessing credibility.\n\n5. The spontaneity of a deposition makes it more difficult for the defendant to be fully prepared for all possible questions, potentially leading to more honest or revealing answers.\n\nWhile written interrogatories can be supplemented later, potentially allowing answers to shift, this is described as less of a concern compared to the benefits of deposition. Affidavits and requests for admission, while useful in some contexts, are not typically used for this specific purpose in a libel case."

The GDPR is concerned with information that can be used to identify a person. A simple counter that is not linked to any personal data does not offer this possibility. As long as the developer ensures that no database entries are linked to this local storage key, and it truly functions as a naive counter without any personalization, a GDPR cookie banner is not required. This aligns with the principle of \"reverse personification\" mentioned in the question. However, it's important to note that if the system were to evolve to link this counter to any form of personal data or use it for user profiling, GDPR compliance would need to be reassessed."

If a defense witness is taken out of order, something that a defense witness says could inadvertently tip the balance by establishing some minor but mandatory element of some offense that the prosecution failed to include it its \"case in chief\".\n\nFor example, maybe the relevant statute requires that the defendant be over the age of eighteen to be guilty of a crime (e.g. statutory rape), and the prosecution forgets to ask a question about the defendant's age in their case in chief, so the prosecution fails to prove that element of the crime. If a defense witness taken out of order says that \"I've known the defendant since I went to his fifth birthday party in 1980\\.\", that could be the difference between having the case reversed on appeal and affirming a conviction on that count. So the defense is reluctant to allow its witnesses to be taken out of order.\n\nAfter the prosecution has presented its \"case in chief\", and the defense has presented its \"case in chief\", the prosecution may then present rebuttal witnesses to the testimony of the defense witnesses, and often, the defense may then present rebuttal witnesses to the prosecution's rebuttal witnesses. After the prosecution completes its case in chief, the defense has the right, if it wishes to do so, to present no additional evidence whatsoever.\n\nIn a criminal trial, the prosecution often presents many witnesses and the defense often presents far fewer witnesses, but that is not a hard and fast rule.\n\nOften the defense presents very little evidence for reasons similar to its reasons for not wanting to take a defense witness out of order.\n\nFor example, suppose a prosecution witness on a key point is not very credible. Offering a defense witness on that point who is also not very credible could bolster the jury's opinion of the prosecution witness's credibility, or could simply help to corroborate that \"something\" definitely happened that was memorable when the crime was allegedly committed, even if their accounts are not identical.",

The prosecution presents its case-in-chief first, calling all its witnesses before the defense presents its case. After both sides have presented their cases, there may be rebuttal witnesses.

In short, there was a piece of land that had been gradually migrating due to Earth movements over a few decades. It ended up in a section claimed by the city. Joannou had bought the land after it had migrated into City territory, and the City claimed Joannou could not own the land. Joannou and other homeowners sued on the basis of the Cullen Earthquake Act, which said that in the event of a disaster moving the land, the boundaries would be withdrawn. The Court ruled that the Cullen's Act did not apply, and part of their reasoning was that the appellants could have done things to make the houses immovable, like anchoring them to the bedrock. They had other reasoning like citing the dictionary definition of disaster was that is was sudden, not gradual, and that there had been an earlier case similar to this.\n\nBut let's say that one of the appellants could not afford to take those measures like anchoring. I have two questions:\n\n1. There was one appellant, and this appellant could not afford to take those measures. Would the court have ruled in the appellants favor, assuming the other reasoning held true?\n2. If the answer to (1\\) is Yes, then what if there were multiple appellants, and one of those appellants could not afford. Would an exception be made for that appellant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Failure to engage in preventative measures, be it by negligence, ignorance, or financial inability, is not a defense. If they couldn't afford it, then they couldn't afford that property's risks, and they can either choose to suffer those risks or do something like sell it off to someone else (who might have been able to do something) or not buy it at all and consider some other property (housing markets providing you few to no options is also not a defense). Your hypothetical is similar to saying \"I didn't have (enough) accident insurance, and was ordered to pay $1m in damages for an accident I caused. I couldn't afford the (additional) insurance, though, but if I could have I would have gotten it and I wouldn't have to pay these damages personally. Therefore I shouldn't have to pay these damages.\" Which is clearly nonsense. Granted, in most US jurisdictions you are required to have some minimum amount of accident insurance to drive legally, but probably there are no laws regarding your home being anchored to bedrock. The key here is that those minimums can be quite low, and paying extra can get you substantially more coverage (both in breadth and value). But nobody gets a pass for not being able to afford the more extensive coverage they may have otherwise desired. Similarly, a home being anchored to bedrock may go above and beyond the minimum necessary, but is required to fully protect yourself against certain things. If you don't do it, you aren't protected, regardless of your reasons and circumstances.\n\nThe only circumstance I could image being an exception, unless explicitly encoded by the local law, is government malfeasance or gross negligence: e.g. you took all of the steps to get the proper permits and anchoring done, but the government *intentionally* (or through gross negligence) failed to grant them until such time as the property drift converted your property into government property. Possibly then a court would rule against the government, but off hand I'm not aware of any such cases (and the ruling may just be to pay the homeowner a fair price, rather than to redraw property lines). And in any case, *proving* the intentionality or gross negligence may be difficult, depending on how much deference the court gives the government and their likely claims of everything having been within normal and acceptable bureaucratic timeframes and delays.",

If a similar case arose where one appellant couldn't afford preventative measures, which of the following outcomes is most likely based on legal principles?\n\nA) The court would rule in favor of the appellant who couldn't afford preventative measures, but against the others.\nB) The court would rule in favor of all appellants out of fairness to the one who couldn't afford preventative measures.\nC) The court would still rule against all appellants, including the one who couldn't afford preventative measures.\nD) The court would require the government to subsidize preventative measures for those who can't afford them.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the legal principles discussed, financial inability to take preventative measures is not a valid defense in such cases. The court would likely maintain its stance that property owners assume the risks associated with their property, regardless of their financial situation. This is similar to how inability to afford comprehensive insurance doesn't exempt someone from liability. The court's decision would likely focus on the legal aspects of property boundaries and land movement, rather than individual financial circumstances. Options A and B introduce inconsistencies in applying the law, while option D introduces a new obligation for the government that isn't supported by the existing legal framework."

If a person pretending to be a store employee gives a patron advice as if from an employee, say on whether a product has a specific feature, that is IMO unethical, but probably not illegal. If a person pretending to be an employee runs down the store and advises a patron to go elsewhere to shop, that might be \"interference with a commercial relationship\" which is a cause for a civil action in some places, I understand. Certainly the management would object.\n\nIf the management notices such a fake employee, I think they would tell that person to leave the store. Failing to do so, or returning later, would then be trespass.\n\nCopying the store logo might well be a technical infringement of copyright, but as long as there is no economic damage, a copyright suit is IMO quite unlikely.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read a fictional story about this assault/lawsuit, and I'm really stuck on some of the details. I'm trying to figure out if it was actually written correctly or not...\n\nSo this guy assaulted another guy, pretty much. It was a pretty messy assault, though, and they both wound up with injuries although the victim didn't get the chance to fight back before the attacker stopped. Nobody witnessed the assault, but the police showed up after the fact and arrested the attacker, but not the victim.\n\nA while later, the victim is subpoenaed to court. The attacker has a lawyer. He didn't hire the lawyer, though, one was provided for him. The attacker is being charged with attempted murder. When the victim is called to the stand, he says it wasn't attempted murder. The thing is that the attacker and the victim were actually friends, they just got into a heated argument, and the one guy just took it too far and attacked the other guy. On the stand, the victim says that the attacker wasn't trying to kill him, he was just trying to beat him up a little to scare him off, pretty much.\n\nThe judge concludes that it wasn't attempted murder, but aggravated assault, and the attacker is sentenced to six months in prison. The attacker is sent to a holding cell, requests to speak with the victim, and the victim shows up. The attacker is then sent to prison, gets out six months later, and life returns to normal.\n\nDid any of that make even the slightest bit of sense? Some questions in specific...\n\nWhy did they only arrest the attacker and not the victim?\n\nCan the victim be subpoenaed to court? Could they have actually done anything without the victim present?\n\nIs the victim's testimony enough to actually reduce the sentence down to aggravated assault? Is six months too short of a time?\n\nWould the attacker have been put in a holding cell? Could he have requested to see the victim? This seems like the \"one phone call\" thing to me, but is that possible here?\n\nWould the attacker just go back to normal after his release? Would there be any further punishments or restrictions?\n\nCould the victim change his testimony afterward and reopen the case? Or would that be unreliable?\n\nHow many years would the attacker have been facing for the original attempted murder? Why did it take so long for the case to start?\n\nI think there are some details I'm forgetting, so I'll edit this if I remember more. Thanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some of this will vary by Jurisdiction, that is by country, and by state in the US, or by province in some other countries. This answer will be focused on the US. Other answers may address other countries.\n\n> Why did they only arrest the attacker and not the victim?\n\nThere is not enough information here to say, but stories from participants or witnesses could have made it clear who the attacker was. If the police believed that one party was only defending himself, they might well arrest only the attacker.\n\n> Can the victim be subpoenaed to court?\n\nYes, the victim can be subpoenaed just as any witness can be. In some areas a victim is routinely subpoenaed even if s/he si expected to attend voluntarily. \n\n> Could they have actually done anything without the victim present?\n\nYes, if there is enough evidence. The victim rarely takes the stand in murder cases, after all. However, in some cases there is simply not enough evidence aside from the testimony of the victim, so that becomes vital to the case. But if there were many other credible witnesses, the prosecutor might choose not to call the victim. The prosecutor has wide latitude on what witnesses to call and what evidence to presnent, and what charges to bring.\n\n> Would the attacker have been put in a holding cell?\n\nS/he might have, that would depend on the policy of the local police, and the facilities the police had available.\n\n> Could he have requested to see the victim? This seems like the \"one phone call\" thing to me, but is that possible here?\n\nS/he could **ask**, but the police would not be required to grant any such request. Indeed permitting this would be a bit unusual, but not unheard of. Usually a visitor would not see a person in a cell, but in some sort of room for the purpose. Details vary. (**Edit** Comment suggest this is even less plausible than I had thought, unless this is set several decades or more ago. It probably dosen't change the plot much if the attacker was brought to some sort of conference room or visitor's room instead.)\n\n> Is the victim's testimony enough to actually reduce the sentence down to aggravated assault? Is six months too short of a time?\n\nIf the judge or jury believed the testimony that there was no intent to kill, then a conviction of aggravated assault would be possible, as a *lesser included offense*. But this would depend on the totality of the evidence, and the way in which the finder of fact (judge or jury) interpreted it, and whether all the elements of aggravated assault had been proved, and whether any elements of attempted murder had **not** been proved. In those jurisdictions that I know about, intent to kill is an element of attempted murder.\n\nAs for the sentence, 6 months is not, I think, outside the range of plausibility for aggravated assault, depending on the facts and the view taken by the judge. The Judge has wide discretion to choose a sentence up to the maximum allowed by law, or much lower. The \"usual sentence\" varies by jurisdiction, and does not bind the judge anyway. \n\n> Would the attacker just go back to normal after his release? Would there be any further punishments or restrictions?\n\nThe court could impose an additional term of probation, with various restrictions, depending on the local law, and the choice of the Judge. These might include staying employed, not getting into other fights, not owning a firearm, taking anger management courses, or other possibilities. Failure to comply with such conditions might lead to a person being sent back to jail/prison. The Judge does not have to impose any such restrictions however. \n\n> Could the victim change his testimony afterward and reopen the case? Or would that be unreliable?\n\nIt can happen, but reopening the case is far from automatic. Generally a court has to order the case reopened, and courts generally are reluctant to do so.\n\n> How many years would the attacker have been facing for the original attempted murder?\n\nProbably quite a few, but this varies a good deal by jurisdiction. And the Judge would have considerable discretion up to the maximum sentence permitted by the law in that jurisdiction.\n\n> Why did it take so long for the case to start?\n\nThe question does not say how long it took, but it is not uncommon for major cases to take several years before the start of the trial, partly because of the time taken to investigate, and partly because of backlogs in the court system. There are cases on record where the trial took place decades after the crime. That is unusual.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case involving assault, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the victim's role and testimony?\n\nA) The victim's testimony is always required for the case to proceed, and their account alone can determine the final verdict.\n\nB) The victim cannot be subpoenaed to court and must voluntarily choose to testify.\n\nC) The victim's testimony can influence the judge's decision, but other evidence and legal factors also play a significant role in determining the verdict and sentence.\n\nD) If the victim changes their testimony after the trial, the case will automatically be reopened and a new trial will be held.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the victim's testimony can be influential, it is not the sole determining factor in a criminal case. The judge or jury considers all available evidence and legal elements when reaching a verdict. The prosecutor has discretion in presenting evidence and calling witnesses, and the case can proceed even without the victim's testimony if there is sufficient other evidence. Additionally, the victim can be subpoenaed to court like any other witness. Changing testimony after a trial does not guarantee that a case will be reopened, as courts are generally reluctant to do so without compelling reasons. The final verdict and sentencing depend on various factors, including the totality of evidence, legal standards, and the judge's discretion within the bounds of the law."

Why ? This is to prevent data collection front from children above 13 .\nExample :\nThere is an youtuber in India corporation . Say India makes a data protection law banning data collection of children below some age x between 13 and 18 . Would all Indian youtubers in general assuming no special provisions in that law be forced to age restrict even children videos for some age between 13 and x like videos targeted for high school ? This is to block them out and thus prevent data collection through comments or personalized ads .\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whatever the hypothetical new law is, the lowest\\-hanging fruit is Youtube, where India could take action against Youtube. The Federal Trade Commission did so w.r.t. COPPA violations in the US, and Youtube settled. Since Youtube is a US company and the FTC is a US federal agency, had this gone to court and had the FTC prevailed, the courts would have ordered Youtube to do something, and YT could not just say \"nuts to you\". Indian courts might enter a similar judgment against YT, and in principle it could be enforced by blocking YT in India, which is not a trivial thing.\n\nThe other prong of legal attack would be against the channel owner. In the case of COPPA, the channel owner is also liable \u2013 for the Indian case, it would depends on what the act says. So the FTC can take action against a channel owner, although enforcement would be challenging in certain countries, but pursuant to [the court order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/172_3083_youtube_coppa_consent_order_signed.pdf), YT could land in legal hot water if it *tolerates* violations by channel owners. The same would hold for the Indian hypothetical. The government of India may have no direct leverage against a violator, but it does have some leverage against YT, which has complete leverage against the channel owner.\n\nOne would have to look at the wording of the relevant act, to determine what leverage exists, for who, in India.",

The documentation suggests that the Indian government could take action against YouTube itself, similar to how the FTC did in the US regarding COPPA violations. The threat of blocking YouTube in India could be a powerful enforcement tool, leading YouTube to enforce compliance among its content creators to avoid legal issues. This approach leverages the platform's influence over individual channel owners while also holding the platform accountable. Options A and D are incorrect because they ignore the potential liability and role of YouTube as a platform. Option B is too extreme and doesn't accurately reflect the nuanced approach that would likely be taken in enforcing such a law."

According to the documentation, the company typically only owns \"work product\" - which includes work developed during company time or directly related to the company's business. In this case, the company would have a claim only on the portion of the game developed after the employee joined, assuming it doesn't compete with the company's business. The work done before joining would still belong to the employee. Option A is too broad, as the company can't claim work done before employment. Option B oversimplifies the situation and doesn't account for work done during employment. Option D is not a viable legal strategy and could be seen as attempting to circumvent the contract."

In a nutshell, I did a complaint to a company of sharing my data without consent and I explicitly instructed them not to share my data, which was on a recorded phone conversation. I have made an access request to listen to those phone calls but that was denied due to third\\-party information. In essence, any third\\-party information that was discussed was about insurance policies, i.e. anything that we did discuss could be found on the internet as well in policy documents but I don't recall discussing sensitive information about any third\\-party. Is the company within their rights to deny my DSAR for any potential third\\-party policy documents that were discussed or under what circumstances can they deny a DSAR (i.e. what level of third\\-party information must be shared in a conversation so that they can withhold such a request)? If it makes a difference, this is under UK law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR allows the right to access to be limited if this access would \u201cadversely affect the rights and freedoms of others\u201d (Art 15(4\\) GDPR). However, **access to the recording would not give you more information than you've already received during the phone call**, so this exemption is quite unlikely to apply in any case.\n\nUK data protection law also has a large list of additional exceptions, as [summarized here by ICO guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/right-of-access/what-other-exemptions-are-there/). These exemptions also cover some aspects of trade secrets, and even mention insurance examples. However, not such exemption is likely to apply in your case: the recording would not give you more information than you already have.\n\nIf the data controller is concerned about some parts of the conversation, they should provide a redacted copy and explain why the redactions were performed. They should not reject the request outright.\n\nIf the data controller wants to reject the request entirely, they must do so within the time frame for the DSAR (one month), must explain their reasons, and must inform you that you're allowed to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority or to sue them. However, [ICO guidance is flexible on how detailed the reason for refusal can be](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/right-of-access/when-can-we-refuse-to-comply-with-a-request/#refuse6):\n\n> Where an exemption applies, the reasons you give to an individual for not complying with a request may depend upon the particular case. For example, if telling an individual that you have applied a particular exemption would prejudice the purpose of that exemption, your response may be more general. However, where possible, you should be transparent about your reasons for withholding information.\n\nHere, I don't see any reason why full transparency would be a problem, so I would expect that the data controller can point to a specific exemption in UK data protection law.\n\nIf you are unsatisfied with the data controller's response, please consider lodging a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the UK, this is the ICO. On the [ICO complaints page](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/), you can fill out the online form about \u201cyour personal information concerns\u201d.",

Does Mexico have similar law? \n\nIf so, does anyone know of English translations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\n> Is unlawful entry into Mexico a crime?\n> \n> \n> In the U.S. there is a federal law making unauthorized entry into the\n> country illegal. Does Mexico have similar law?\n\nYes. Illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but, it is not a crime.\n\nThe form of the question suggest that the person asking it may not be familiar with the distinction between something being \"[illegal](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/illegal)\" and something being a \"[crime](https://www.lectlaw.com/def/c330.htm)\". The notion that they are the same is a common misconception.\n\n> If so, does anyone know of English translations?\n\nAn English translation of Mexico's immigration law can be found [here](https://www.albany.edu/%7Erk289758/documents/Ley_de_Migracion_en_Ingles.pdf).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nIllegal entry into Mexico is illegal and has legally authorized consequences, although it is not a crime.\n\n### Civil Consequences For Immigration Law Violations In Mexico\n\nCivil detention of unlawful entrants into Mexico is authorized by Articles 99\\-105 of Mexico's [Migration Act of 2011](https://www.albany.edu/%7Erk289758/documents/Ley_de_Migracion_en_Ingles.pdf).\n\nDeportation is authorized by Articles 114\\-125\\.\n\nThere are civil fines for violating immigration laws in Mexico based on a multiple of the minimum wage, ranging from 20 days of minimum wage to 10,000 days of minimum wage, depending upon the offense and its severity (one day's minimum wage is [88\\.36 pesos](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/minimum-wages)). Articles 143\\-158\\. So fines range from 1767\\.2 pesos to 883,600 pesos for immigration violations. [Today's exchange rate](https://www.currency-calc.com/USD_MXN) is 19\\.4 pesos to $1\\. So, these fines range from $91 USD to $45,546 USD.\n\n### Immigration Related Crimes In Mexico\n\nImmigration crimes are found at Articles 159\\-162\\. According to the linked translation, these crimes are as follows:\n\n> Article 159\\. A term of eight to 16 years in prison and a fine ranging\n> from 5,000 to 15,000 days of the general minimum wage in effect in the\n> Federal District will be imposed upon an individual who:\n> \n> \n> I. Traffics one or more individuals in order to enter another country\n> without the corresponding documentation and for the purpose of\n> directly or indirectly obtaining a profit;\n> \n> \n> II. Introduces one or more foreigners into Mexico without the\n> corresponding documentation and for the purpose of directly or\n> indirectly obtaining a profit; or\n> \n> \n> III. Lodges or transports one or more foreigners in or through Mexico\n> for the purpose of avoiding migratory inspection and in order to\n> directly or indirectly obtain a profit.\n> \n> \n> In order to actualize the crime provided for in this article, it will\n> be necessary to\n> \n> \n> demonstrate that the offender's intent is to obtain an indisputable,\n> current, or impending economic benefit in cash or in kind.\n> \n> \n> Penalties will not be imposed upon individuals of renowned moral\n> rectitude who, for strictly humanitarian reasons and without seeking\n> any benefit, assist an individual who has entered the country in an\n> unlawful manner, even when such individuals \\[of renowned moral\n> rectitude] receive donations or resources for continuing their\n> humanitarian work.\n> \n> \n> Article 160\\. The penalties indicated in the foregoing article will be\n> doubled when the aforementioned conducts are carried out:\n> \n> \n> I. With respect to children and adolescents, or when a child or\n> adolescent who is not able to comprehend the significance of the\n> action is induced to, motivated to, assisted in, or obligated to\n> conduct any of the behaviors described in the previous article;\n> \n> \n> II. Under conditions or using means that place or could place health,\n> integrity, safety, or life at risk or that allow for inhumane or\n> degrading treatment of the individuals affected by such conduct; or\n> \n> \n> III. When the perpetrator or orchestrator is a public servant.\n> \n> \n> Article 161\\. A public servant who assists, conceals, or prompts any\n> person to violate the provisions of this Law in order to obtain a\n> direct or indirect profit in cash or in kind will be sentenced to a\n> term of four to eight years in prison and a fine ranging from 500 to\n> 1,000 days of the general minimum wage in effect in the Federal\n> District.\n> \n> \n> Article 162\\. In regard to the crimes indicated in this Law, the\n> Federal Office of the Public Prosecutor will exercise the criminal\n> action on its own initiative. The Institute is obligated to provide\n> the Federal Office of the Public Prosecutor with all elements\n> necessary for prosecuting these crimes.\n\nSo basically, the only immigration crimes in Mexico are human trafficking and immigration related bribery. Illegal entry into Mexico, *per se*, even if it is intentional, while it is illegal and may justify civil immigration detention, deportation and/or a civil fine, is not a crime.\n\nOf course, one could conceivably commit other crimes in connection with the immigration process (e.g. assaulting a government official, forging official documents), but illegal entry into Mexico, *per se* is never a crime, unlike the situation in U.S. immigration law, where illegal entry is both illegal and also a crime in many (but not all) circumstances.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Mexico's immigration laws, which of the following statements is correct regarding illegal entry into the country?\n\nA) Illegal entry into Mexico is always considered a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment.\nB) Illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but not criminalized, and may result in civil penalties such as detention, deportation, or fines.\nC) Mexico has no laws regarding illegal entry, and individuals can freely enter the country without documentation.\nD) Illegal entry into Mexico is only considered a crime if the individual intends to stay longer than 90 days.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because illegal entry into Mexico, while illegal, is not criminalized and does not result in imprisonment solely for the act of entering illegally.\n\nOption B is correct. According to the information provided, illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but not a crime. It can result in civil consequences such as detention (authorized by Articles 99-105 of Mexico's Migration Act), deportation (Articles 114-125), and civil fines ranging from 20 to 10,000 days of minimum wage (Articles 143-158).\n\nOption C is false. Mexico does have laws regarding illegal entry, even though it's not criminalized.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The duration of stay is not mentioned as a factor in determining whether illegal entry is a crime or not. Illegal entry itself is not criminalized regardless of the intended length of stay.\n\nThe key point is that Mexico distinguishes between \"illegal\" actions and \"criminal\" offenses in its immigration law, treating illegal entry as a civil violation rather than a criminal act."

The Communications Decency Act only in the US. So basically they have no relation. However, the EU has the [Electronic Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Commerce_Directive_2000) which serves the same purpose as Section 230 of the CDA. The GDPR does not change that, it mentions this explicitly in [Art. 2(4\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-2-gdpr/):\n\n> 4. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of [Directive 2000/31/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.\n\nThis means that an ISP is not responsible for user generated content, but if they receive a notification of obvious unlawful content, they must remove it.\n\nSo it is not a problem for an ISP or other service provider to host private data submitted by an anonymous user.

A work in the public domain can still be copyrighted in terms of cover artwork and design, annotations, etc. Read [Welcome to the Public Domain \\- Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/)\n\nYou can say someone \"owns\" a book in the sense that they might have paid for it or it is personal property and one could justifiably call it theft if someone took it from them, but \"owning\" the physical or electronic copy in any sense doesn't mean you own the copyright. Read the copyright notice on a book or ebook; you get a license to read it, not ownership of it. Read [What's the difference between Copyright and Licensing? \\- Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/297/whats-the-difference-between-copyright-and-licensing).\n\nSure, the TOS of a network can specify the ownership/licensing status of the files shared on such network.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that the President of the United States has some immunity against the law. This makes sense to protect the president from interference and allows for flexibility.\n\nTo a European cursory observer, it seems that the immunity includes the Constitution. This is irritating.\n\nTechnically, the Constitution may be just another law, with just the same immunity. But I just can't get my head around it.\n\nIs the Constitution as a law special in any way?  \n\nIs the Constitution obligatory for the President of the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US President is indeed bound by the Constitution, and indeed by the ordinary laws. Current Justice Department policy is that a **sitting** president may not be indicted. No court has ever held this, the US Constitution does not give explicit presidential immunity the way it gives limited immunity to members of congress (in the \"speech and debate\" clause). No sitting US President has ever been charged with a crime, much less indicted, so the matter has never come before a court.\n\nAn old news story indicated that President Grant was stopped for a traffic offense (speeding, in a horse\\-drawn carriage), accompanied the officer to a police station, paid an appearance bond for the traffic court, and then failed to appear, forfeiting the bond. Even if this is accurate, no claim of presidential immunity was made, and no court decision was rendered. So no precedent was established by that event, one way or the other.\n\nAny President may be impeached and convicted, if Congress sees fit to do so. There is no enforceable standard on just what is and is not an impeachable offense. That is left to the sound judgement of Congress. Nor is Congress required to act if it chooses not to, no matter how strong the evidence may be.\n\nNixon's Vice President , [Spiro Agnew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew#Criminal_investigation_and_resignation), was investigated for alleged corrupt practices. It appeared that Maryland (where he had been Governor) was ready to indict him on several charges. He was persuaded to plead \"no contest\" in a plea bargain to a single count, and was sentenced to probation with no jail time. At the same time, he resigned as VP. No one knows what would have happened had he continued to insist on his innocence, and claimed before the court that a sitting VP could not lawfully be indicted (a claim he had made earlier in the process).\n\nEven assuming that a sitting President cannot be indicted or tried, nothing prevents such a person from being charged and perhaps convicted after his or her term has ended. The constitution explicitly says that if an official is impeached and removed from office, there may be a subsequent trial on any relevant charges.\n\n> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. (Art I; section 3; clauses 6\\&7\\)\n\nWhether any statute of limitations would be tolled (paused) while the president was in office cannot be determined until and unless the matters comes before a court for a decision.\n\nNote that the US Constitution imposes few duties or obligations on individuals. it is mostly concerned with specifying he structure of the federal government, and the powers of and limitations on its various parts. It also specifies the relations between the Federal and State Governments. It also declares a number of rights held by individuals, most of which can be regarded as limitations on the power of the government. If the President were to be accused of a crime, it would almost surely be one established by statute, not by the constitution directly, because treason is the only crime defined directly by the constitution.\n\nHowever, the official acts of the president are clearly limited by the Constitution, and in a number of cases have been held void as being unconstitutional. One of the more famous cases is [*Youngstown Sheet and Tube vs Sawyer* 343 U.S. 579 (1952\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer), also known and the \"steel mills seizure case\". During the Korean War, President Truman attempted to take control of a number of steel mills to stop a labor dispute, on the ground that this was hindering the national defense. The US Supreme Court ruled that he lacked the power to do this, and that his action was void.",

I have Asperger's and comorbidities of a bipolar and anxiety disorders.\n\nI had job several interviews in a US company (I'm not a citizen nor resident of US, but they knew that and the job was supposed to come with H1B visa), and they repeatedly rejected me for no apparent reason (for at least 3 times). \n\nQ: Is it possible to file a lawsuit against them for job discrimination?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can file a lawsuit of course. The question is whether you have any evidence whatsoever that they didn't hire you because of illegal discrimination. As you say yourself, they didn't hire you \"for no apparent reason\". It is entirely legal not to hire you \"for no apparent reason\". Without evidence of illegal discrimination that court case will go nowhere. \n\nConsider that there are jobs where 100 people apply, and a dozen people are interviewed. Getting not hired three times, when 12 people got interviewed, is just normal. If the same 12 people were interviewed at each job, then you and eight others were rejected each time, because there were 12 good enough to be interviewed, but only one job. Not being hired three times is nothing. Maybe instead of thinking of lawsuits, you might think of some training to do better in interviews. \n\nSo not only do you not have any *evidence* of illegal discrimination, it's not even reasonably likely that there was illegal discrimination. Are you really claiming that all the three times where you didn't get the job you were **the best possible applicant** that was there? Did you check who got the job? Maybe it was a gay black jewish woman in a wheelchair who was just exceedingly good at her job? \n\nThe point is really: Belonging to some protected class doesn't give you a right to get the job. It gives you a right not to be rejected *because you belong to that protected class*. It doesn't give you a right not to be rejected for any other reason. And being rejected without being given a reason is no proof, **not even an indication**, of some illegal discrimination going on. The most obvious and common reason for rejection is that out of all the applicants, you were not the best.",

After being rejected three times without explanation, the candidate considers filing a discrimination lawsuit. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential lawsuit?\n\nA) The candidate has a strong case for discrimination since they were rejected multiple times despite their qualifications.\n\nB) The lawsuit is likely to succeed because the company failed to provide reasons for the rejections.\n\nC) The candidate should file the lawsuit immediately to protect their rights as a member of multiple protected classes.\n\nD) The lawsuit is unlikely to succeed without clear evidence that the rejections were based on illegal discrimination rather than other factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the documentation emphasizes that belonging to a protected class doesn't guarantee a job offer or create automatic grounds for a discrimination lawsuit. Without specific evidence that the rejections were based on the candidate's disabilities or other protected characteristics, rather than factors like interview performance or competition from other qualified candidates, a lawsuit is unlikely to succeed. The lack of explanation for the rejections is not itself proof of discrimination, and the company has the right to choose the best candidate from their applicant pool for reasons unrelated to protected classes."

People send a lot of personal information in messages including their address, phone number, schools, work, etc.\n\nIs this a violation of the CCPA (obviously if you live in California)? WhatsApp doesn't store messages on the server so obviously they can't delete messages from their server. And Instagram does delete your messages from both sides when you delete your account, which is what makes this choice even more odd, given that the Facebook product is in much hotter water regarding privacy.\n\nI know this has been asked before in relation to GDPR, but I wonder if the same holds for CCPA. Here is the other question: [Facebook vs GDPR \\- Private Messages I sent to others will never be deleted/erased from Facebook servers](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30951/facebook-vs-gdpr-private-messages-i-sent-to-others-will-never-be-deleted-erase)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Relevant CCPA provisions (with links)\n-------------------------------------\n\nUnder the [CCPA](https://ccpa-info.com/california-consumer-privacy-act-full-text/) section 1798\\.105\\):\n\n> 1. A consumer shall have the right to request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer. ...\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> 3. A business that receives a verifiable consumer request from a consumer to delete the consumer\u2019s personal information pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section shall delete the consumer\u2019s personal information from its records and direct any service providers to delete the consumer\u2019s personal information from their records.\n> 4. A business or a service provider shall not be required to comply with a consumer\u2019s request to delete the consumer\u2019s personal information if it is necessary for the business or service provider to maintain the consumer\u2019s personal information in order to:\n> \n> \n> .  \n> \n> 4\\. 1\\. Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated within the context of a business\u2019 ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer  \n> \n> .  \n> \n> 4\\. 4\\. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.  \n> \n> .  \n> \n> 4\\. 8\\.Comply with a legal obligation.  \n> \n> .  \n> \n> 4\\. 9\\. Otherwise use the consumer\u2019s personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.\n\n[Section 1798\\.140](https://ccpa-info.com/home/1798-140-definitions/) (o) defines Pi as:\n\n> (1\\) \u201cPersonal information\u201d means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, the following if it identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household:  \n> \n> (1\\) (A) Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (1\\) (K) Inferences drawn from any of the information identified in this subdivision to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\n\nLater in 1798\\.140 subsection (t) (2\\) (A) provides that:\n\n> For purposes of this title, a business does not sell personal information when:\n> \n> \n> A consumer uses or directs the business to intentionally disclose personal information or uses the business to intentionally interact with a third party, provided the third party does not also sell the personal information, unless that disclosure would be consistent with the provisions of this title. An intentional interaction occurs when the consumer intends to interact with the third party, via one or more deliberate interactions. Hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does not constitute a consumer\u2019s intent to interact with a third party.\n\nRegulations\n-----------\n\nUnder the [CA AG's regulations implementing the CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf) A business must respond to a request to delete withing 45 days, which may be extend once for up to an additional 45 days. The business must indicate if it will comply, and if not, indicate the legal provision which permits or requires it to decline.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nCommunications sent from one user to another identifying the source user certainly fit the general definition of PI, as they are clearly associated with an identifiable person. However, under 1798\\.105 (4\\.1\\) a request may be declined to delete information which is needed to \"provide a good or service requested by the consumer\", or which is \"reasonably anticipated within the context of a business\u2019 ongoing business relationship with the consumer\" may be declined.\n\nIt seems to me that in sending a message to another user of the service, a user clearly \"requests\" the service to provide this info to the other user. Moreover, this seems to be an action that is \"reasonably anticipated. What is more, an argument could be made that the rights of the other user are impacted by any such deletion, although the CCPA, unlike the GDPR, does not require any balancing of the rights of others.\n\nThus I think a case can be made that a service provider such as Facebook need not delete messages sent by one user to another on a request by the sending user.\n\nBeyond this, the CCPA does not grant any private right of action for requests to delete. That is the user is nor permitted to directly sue the business for such violations. Only the California Attorney General has the authority to bring such suits under the CCPA as it now stands.\n\nI can find no reported litigation or enforcement action on the right to delete, much less on the right to delete in a fact pattern such as the question supposes. In the absence of any court decision or opinion by the CA AG, there is no way to be sure how the law should be interpreted.",

Which of the following best describes the company's obligations?\n\nA) The company must immediately delete all messages sent by the consumer, including those in other users' inboxes.\n\nB) The company has no obligation to delete any messages, as they are considered necessary for providing the service.\n\nC) The company may decline to delete messages sent to other users, citing the need to provide requested services and maintain ongoing business relationships.\n\nD) The company must delete all messages within 45 days, with no exceptions allowed under CCPA.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the CCPA section 1798.105(4.1), a business may decline a deletion request if the information is necessary to \"provide a good or service requested by the consumer\" or is \"reasonably anticipated within the context of a business' ongoing business relationship with the consumer.\" Sending messages to other users falls under this exemption. Additionally, the company has 45 days to respond to the request, which can be extended once for an additional 45 days. While the company may decline to delete messages sent to other users, it's not accurate to say they have no obligation whatsoever (ruling out option B). Options A and D are incorrect as they don't account for the exemptions and timeframes provided in the CCPA."

I've been using this name and branding since August of 2020\\.\n\nI was alerted by some of my users of a webpage that is attempting to bait users into using their own product by repeatedly using my creation (EditVideoBot's) name in the title and contents of the article.\n\nThis webpage can be found [here](https://botghost.com/tutorials/how-to-make-your-own-editvideobot-discord-bot).\n\nAs the webpage says, this article was created on 7 July this year and is clearly using my product's name in order to gain search engine ranking and confuse users who are attempting to reach my website/social media profiles.\n\nI want to send a cease \\& desist letter to them, before taking any other actions, but they provide no method of contact on their website ([botghost.com](https://botghost.com)). What should I do? How can I contact them?\n\nI could send the email to something like `webmaster@botghost.com` or `root@botghost.com` as I know they're running an email service on that domain, but there's no guarantee that they'll actually ever see it, especially since it's not provided on their site.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Short preface: You might want to consult with a lawyer if what that website does really constitutes trademark infringement. But the question did not ask for that. It asked what to do if you want to send a C\\&D to a website without contact information. That's the question I will answer here. Whether or not the C\\&D letter itself has merit in this particular situation is another question, and probably one which would violate our \"[specific legal advise](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221/policy-for-questions-that-clearly-ask-for-specific-legal-advice)\" rule.*\n\n---\n\nYou can use a whois\\-database to find the public information on who operates a domain. Doing so for [the domain in question](https://www.whois.com/whois/botghost.com) yields that the contact information of the actual domain owner was \"Withheld for Privacy Purposes\". That means the domain was registered through a domain\\-by\\-proxy service. The postal address in Iceland you see in the record is the address of that service, not of the domain owner.\n\nBut you can see the registrar which hosts the domain: [\"Name Cheap Inc.\"](https://www.namecheap.com/). So that's somewhere you can address complaints to.\n\nIf you cause them enough problems, then you might be able to get them to take the website down. Those discount webhosters don't make nearly enough money per customer to fight their legal battles for them. Just reading a C\\&D letter already costs them more than hosting a website for a year. So they might just fire the customer to avoid the trouble of dealing with you. But then the website might just reappear hosted by some other company a day later and you are back at square one.\n\nThe registrar should also be able to tell you the real identity of the person who operates the website. However, they will likely not tell you without putting up a fight, as revealing private information without being legally obligated to might make them liable for violating a bunch of privacy laws. Ask your lawyer if there is any hope to get a subpoena forcing them to give you the identity.",

Even though the lease has converted to a month-to-month arrangement, the original terms of the lease, including the 60-day notice requirement, still apply. The lease explicitly states that 60 days' written notice is required for termination, regardless of whether it's during the initial term or the month-to-month period.

That is the owner of the property can legally transfer ownership to someone else (by contract, deed, or gift).\n\nThis may require various degrees of formality: transfers of land must be in writing, transfers of motor vehicles usually require a change to a government register, transfers of a can of soft drink require no formality. Bills of landing serve to formalize the ownership of goods in transit and are so ubiquitous that the transfer of one is the transfer of the other. But that doesn\u2019t make them negotiable.\n\nFor normal goods, a person cannot pass on better title then they themselves possess. So, if I steal something or acquire it by fraud or otherwise dishonesty, I don\u2019t own it. If I sell it to you, you don\u2019t own it either even though you are a possessor in good faith (I, as the thief am a possessor in bad faith). The actual owner can recover the goods from whoever possesses them even if that person legitimately acquired them.\n\nNegotiable instruments are a special kind of transferable property where the mere possession of them (in good faith) makes you the owner of them. The most familiar type of negotiable property is cash. If I rob a bank and use that cash to legitimately buy something from you (and you don\u2019t know the cash is stolen) then you own the cash. The original owner can go after me but they can\u2019t come after you.",

With negotiable instruments, a good faith purchaser becomes the owner even if the instrument was originally stolen. However, with bills of lading, the transfer of ownership is more akin to regular property, where one cannot pass better title than they possess.\n\nOption A is incorrect because bills of lading are indeed transferable. Option B is not precise enough, as the issue isn't about flexibility. Option D is incorrect because bills of lading can be transferred beyond the original parties. Option C correctly captures the nuanced difference between transferability and true negotiability, explaining why the term is \"a little misleadingly\" used in this context."

This image caused significant psychological harm leading Mustapha to develop a major depressive disorder that made it difficult for him to carry out everyday activities. However, his claim failed because although this extreme reaction was imaginable, it was not reasonably foreseeable.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision takes into account that if the defendant knew of these conditions, their plaintiff\u2019s injury may have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant but because there was no such evidence the damage was not reasonably foreseeable.

In the Mustapha v Culligan case, the court found that a person of normal fortitude would not likely suffer psychiatric harm from seeing dead flies in bottled water. Therefore, the initial threshold for applying the eggshell skull rule was not met. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the eggshell skull rule does not always apply; it is contingent on the foreseeability of some harm to a normal person. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the court's decision does not contradict the eggshell skull rule.

The exact levels specified for our zone, which is \"Commercial/Mixed Use\" are:\n\n* 70 dBA or 10 dB above the background noise level, whichever is lower, from 7 AM to 10 PM\n* 60 dBA or 5 dB above the background noise level, which ever is lower, from 10 PM to 7 AM.\n* 5 dB shall be subtracted from the maximum Noise Level where the Noise Level includes \"impulsive noise\"\n* The most restrictive maximum Noise Level shall apply at the property where the noise level is audible.\n\nUsing different Android applications, I believe that a bar near our apartment is routinely skirting this ordinance by playing music that is audible beyond their property. I have called the police at various times, but they either can't verify that the business is, in fact, violating the ordinance, or (more frequently) choose not to take any action, or sometimes just don't arrive to investigate in time.\n\nI understand that Android apps are not a professional instrument, but neither does the ordinance specify the accuracy of whatever is measuring the noise level.

The evidence you have will help prove the nuisance but failing to comply with an ordinance does not ipso facto mean that the bar breached any duty of care it has to you.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Often times a case is decided by more than one instance. For example, a defendant may lodge an appeal against the judgment given by a trial judge. Where the court of appeal found in favour of the claimant, the defendant may ask another court to dismiss the case.\n\nIsn't one instance not enough? What is the rationale behind this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Overview**\n\nTrials and hearings before a judge aren't random, but they aren't terribly predictable either. The best empirical studies of high stakes felony jury trials suggest that the accuracy of a jury in a case that doesn't plea bargain is about 90%. They are right 90% of the time and wrong 10% of the time. The appeal process involving multiple instances exists primarily to correct these errors. If the first trial is 90% accurate and larger, more experienced panels are more likely to get it right, the likelihood of a correct result in 2\\-3 tries becomes more acceptable. (Easy cases settle.)\n\nBench trials (i.e. trials to a single trial court judge in common law systems) are just as final and probably not more or less accurate on average, but trade a more experienced fact finder who understands the process for the disadvantages of having only a single perspective on the facts from someone who doesn't have to persuade anyone else that he or she is right.\n\nThe appellate process in civil law systems is quite different and more likely to change the result than it is in common law systems, largely due to two factors: the need to preserve the jury trial right in common law systems and a much smaller number of judges in common law systems. Common law systems strive towards a get it right the first time or bust in one big event model, civil law systems creep towards a correct result bit by bit. Until the 1890s in the U.S., in federal criminal jury trials (and many state criminal trials), there were no direct appeals at all, only the equivalent of modern habeas corpus petitions.\n\n**Civil Law System Instances**\n\nIn civil law systems, a first instance judges will take testimony and documentary evidence and argument in a series of hearings (not necessarily in one continuous compact trial), recording the testimony with personal notes rather than a verbatim transcript, and applying law to fact on a piecemeal basis that narrows the scope of the proceeding as evidence and argument trickles in. This results in a court order which will become a final order unless appealed. In \"small\" case the first instance court may be one judge, in a more serious one it might be three judges. The first instance court looks primarily to statutes and legal treatises for legal guidance with case law precedents taking only a secondary role that is not strictly binding. Because testimony is delivered to a judge, there are few if any rules of evidence.\n\nThere is not a great analogy to this phase in most civil procedure systems today, but it is a lot like a preliminary hearing in a criminal case or a preliminary injunction hearing in a case where injunctive relief is the main remedy sought at trial, or a traverse of an attachment in a common law court system.\n\nIf either party thinks that there were serious errors of law or fact in the first instance judge's ruling that change the outcome, they can appeal the case to second instance court where hears any issues upon which there is an alleged error of law or fact de novo before a new, more senior and more numerous panel of judges (typically two more judges than in the first instance court). \n\nThe availability of de novo review in a second instance court makes trial preparation in the first instance court much less expensive than trial preparation in the U.S. or U.K. where any factual error in the first instance court is almost impossible to overturn on appeal and where there is no time to regroup if you are surprised in the first instance trial. So does the fact that in a civil law system you may be preparing for only a few witnesses at a time, rather than all of the witnesses and evidence back to back at once.\n\nSince most of the time the court correctly understands the evidence and there are no big surprises, and since the court narrows the issues over the course of the proceeding by applying law to each new set of facts, the amount of effort going into trial preparation and presenting evidence overall in a civil law system is often considerably less than in a common law system and these savings can often make up for more common and more time consuming appeals in civil law systems at the second instance.\n\nIn a civil law system, if the first instance court rules against you, but gets the case 90% right the first time around and no surprises come up in the trial, then you can proceed to a much narrower case in the second instance to get the 10% that the court got wrong the first time corrected without so many distractions and you have already seen your opponent's entire case, rather than having suffered an impossible to remedy fail.\n\nA second instance trial in a civil law system is somewhat analogous to a first trial following some motion practice that resolved many of the pending issues on dispositive motions in a common law system.\n\nLike the first instance court, the second instance court looks primarily to statutes and legal treatises for legal guidance with case law precedents taking only a secondary role that is not strictly binding except some rulings from the highest court.\n\nA third instance appeal in a civil law system is more or less comparable to a direct appeal in a common law system, where appellate issues are largely confined to disputes of law and the facts found by the second instance court (as well as the first instance court findings that were not disturbed on appeal to the second instance court) are taken as established (again, usually without a verbatim transcript based upon a written order of the second instance panel). This court often called a court of cassation (i.e. of ending a dispute) resolves disputed issues of law. Typically, a court of cassation or supreme court will have dozens or scores of judges who have subject matter specialties and hear cases only in smaller panels.\n\nNone of these courts has a power of judicial review, which is typically reserved for a constitutional court that is a separate small panel court not made up only of career judges.\n\nIn a civil law system, if the judge is found to have abused his or her discretion in the original trial in a manner that requires a retrial, another judge rehears the case.\n\n**Common Law System Appeals**\n\nIn the common law civil litigation process very few issues can be resolved prior to trial unless the relevant facts are undisputed and often not even then if substantial discretion is involved in a final decision.\n\nIn contrast, in a common law system, a single judge (often sitting with a jury of six to twelve jurors) decide facts in a trial from which a verbatim transcript is taken and reaches a verdict that can only be appealed if there is no evidence in the transcript and submitted exhibits that support a conclusion, or if there was a mistake of law or procedure (especially admission of evidence) in the proceedings that could have materially changed the outcome if decided correctly. There is no means by which factual errors or failure to respond to surprises can be remedied so preparation must consider every possibility no matter how remote. The trial is conducted all at once, typically in one to ten consecutive business days and all witnesses in the case must testify one after the other at this time. At trial, the judge carefully regulates what evidence is and is not permitted to be presented and instructs the jury regarding the law to apply to the facts and the issues for the jury to decide in its verdict. The trial verdict is final once the jury renders its verdict and appellate type issues raised with the original trial judge are rejected (or a retrial is granted on grounds similar to those upon which an appeal could be granted if a judge acknowledges making a serious mistake).\n\nIf either side thinks that there was an error, there is a right to a direct appeal to a panel of three judges that considers only the verbatim transcript of the trial, the exhibits admitted into evidence at trial, and legal arguments (typically no more than about three or four per party bringing an appeal). If the court of appeals panel on direct appeal finds an error of law or an abuse of discretion or a factual finding not supported by any evidence in the transcript and admitted exhibits, it will reverse the trial court, otherwise it will affirm. Jury verdicts are quite hard to overturn on appeal because they are upheld if any non\\-crazy jury could have reached that result even if they probably just screwed up.\n\nIn common law countries there are usually one or two more appeal available after a direct appeal (to a state supreme court and the U.S. Supreme Court in some cases), which strictly in the discretion of the state or U.S. Supreme Court with only a small percentage of cases even considered on this further appeal, and usually with just one or two novel or controversial issues of law raised at this point. Again, no new facts can be introduced or corrected on appeal.\n\nIn common law countries, if a trial court decision is overturned, the new trial will almost always be remanded to the same judge, even if the original trial verdict is overturned because the original judge abused his or her discretion in the original trial.",

But section 19\\.6 states:\n\n> (6\\) No power of seizure conferred on a constable under any enactment (including an enactment contained in an Act passed after this Act) is to be taken to authorise the seizure of an item which the constable exercising the power has reasonable grounds for believing to be subject to legal privilege.\n\nSo my question is: what stops someone about to have their mobile seized from telling the police officer that there is legally privileged information on their phone? They could even keep an email from a solicitor on it, which would fulfil the requirement.\n\nWould this legally prevent them from seizing the phone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not going to comment on the specifics of this law; rather, I think this question shows a misconception of the way the legal system works in general.\n\nHere's the question: do you actually have \"legally privileged\" material on your phone? If not, what's keeping you from claiming that is that it's not true, and lying to a police officer is a bad idea.\n\nAnd just putting a letter from your lawyer on the phone doesn't mean you've established a legal privilege\\-\\-attorney\\-client privilege is not a magic spell, it's a reasonable system of protection that only covers certain communications.\n\nThe bottom line is: the statute in general, and that clause in particular, were included in the law to protect real, important, and substantial legal right. The courts interpret the law in light of that purpose. If the police officer finds a solution that protects your rights while still carrying out the purpose of the statute, the court will be unlikely to fault him or her. In this case, if you tell the officer that there is a letter from your attorney in a particular folder, the obvious solution is for the officer not to open that folder. Problem solved.\n\nIn practice, in the United States at least, these cases are dealt with routinely; computers are seized, and attorneys and judges work together to ensure that privilege is protected while still allowing reasonable access to seized materials. I would imagine the same is true in the U.K.\n\nThe bottom line is: the law is not a game, and technical \"gotchas\" are rarely effective. Common law systems allow judges enough leeway to avoid this sort of pointless technicality.",

Which of the following best describes the likely outcome of this situation?\n\nA) The officer must immediately cease any attempt to seize the phone, as the mere claim of legally privileged information prevents seizure.\n\nB) The officer can seize the phone but must not access any information on it until a court determines what is legally privileged.\n\nC) The officer can seize the phone but should work with the owner to identify and avoid accessing specific legally privileged content while still investigating potential evidence.\n\nD) The officer can ignore the claim of legally privileged information and seize the phone without any restrictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The law is not intended to be exploited as a technicality to prevent legitimate police work. Instead, it aims to protect genuine legal rights while allowing law enforcement to carry out their duties. In practice, officers and legal professionals often work together to ensure that legally privileged information is protected while still allowing access to potential evidence. The officer can seize the phone but should take reasonable steps to avoid accessing specific content identified as privileged, such as not opening particular folders or files. This approach balances the need to preserve evidence with the protection of legal privilege. Options A and D are too extreme, either completely preventing seizure or ignoring legal rights. Option B is impractical and would significantly hinder investigations. The courts interpret the law in light of its purpose and are likely to support solutions that protect rights while allowing reasonable law enforcement actions."

This is a Guaranteed Replacement Cost policy, but there are exceptions.\n\n> we will not pay more than the actual cash value at the time of the loss \\[...] for fine art, antiques, rare objects and other items which by their\n> nature cannot be replaced with a comparable article;\n\nWhile I guess that makes sense, what would \"actual cash value\" be? They give a definition at the beginning of the document:\n\n> actual cash value means the cost of replacement with materials of similar kind and quality less depreciation. In determining depreciation we will consider the condition immediately before the damage, the resale value (if personal property), obsolescence and normal life expectancy.\n\nOk, that's vague. Depreciation is normally not applicable to fine art. Appreciation is usually more of a concept that would apply. Resale value can be extremely arbitrary and difficult to determine, much less agree upon. \"Obsolescence and normal life expectancy\" wouldn't apply. Worried that \"actual cash value\" means the material cost of the canvas and paint, I noted they have a specific Fine Art Endorsement further down the document, which I could purchase for a modest premium. It reads:\n\n> We insure fine art but only:\n> \n> \n> \u2022 items valued up to $5,000, for which you have provided us with a complete description, including the year and value of the items; and\n> \n> \n> \u2022 items valued over $5,000, for which you have provided us with an appraisal of market value within 30 days of the effective date of this Endorsement. The appraisal must have been completed within the past 3 years.\n\nWhich I originally figured meant that so long as I have paid for this endorsement, I could value the art however I wish (with or without an appraisal as outlined above) given the premium varies based on the value. But then the next paragraph adds this in:\n\n> ***If you have a claim:***\n> \n> \n> In the event of a claim insured by this endorsement we will pay the full cost of repair with materials of similar kind and quality, or replacement with a comparable article, whichever is less, without deduction for depreciation, up to the coverage limit for this endorsement on your Declaration. No deductible shall apply to this endorsement. However, we will not pay more than the actual cash value at the time of the loss:\n> \n> \n> \u2022 if repair or replacement is not complete as soon as reasonably possible and within one year following the date of loss; and\n> \n> \n> \u2022 for fine art which cannot be replaced with a comparable article.\n\nWait, what? That last bit brings us back to the situation we were at without the endorsement. The whole \"fine art, antiques, rare objects and other items which by their nature cannot be replaced with a comparable article\" bit.\n\nAm I correct that paying the premium for that endorsement would be useless?\n\n**Why all this concerns me**: I have several important (to me) pieces painted by relatively unknown artists. The cost of any given one was well under $5000, so appraisals don't apply but if I lost them I'd be out significantly. These artists are alive and, as far as I know, still actively painting... so if a piece were stolen, I'm sure I could commission a replacement. Is that cost the value with the endorsement? Without?\n\nPerhaps the answer is to insure them separately with a company that specializes in Fine Art Collections. But of course I'd rather not pay extra if my normal house insurance does cover it (at least with the endoresement).\n\nI called the company to ask. I thought the first person was just a trainee or something because all she did was regurgitate the policy wording verbatim. I asked to speak with someone \"higher up\" and that person didn't do much better. She was really vague and asked if I wanted the full policy sent to me. I assumed that would go into great detail, but it doesn't.\n\nI'm shocked, really, how loosy\\-goosy they are while they're collecting premiums. The whole point of having insurance is in case of an event that requires it... and that's when the details matters.\n\nThoughts and opinions on how things would go down if a piece gets stolen?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The practical answer is that the insurance is somewhat dependent on the reputation of the insurer. Legally, the verbiage of the contract applies: If you pay for the Fine Art endorsement, and you suffer a covered loss to a covered item under $5,000, they have three options to settle the claim within one year:\n\n1. Recover and repair the damaged item.\n2. Replace the item \"with a comparable article.\" If they are a reputable insurer, they *probably* won't offer you a replacement with which you aren't satisfied. But it's *possible* they would hand you a \"replacement\" that you don't think is comparable, and they think is comparable. At that point you get to start a negotiation, which can end up in court if neither side settles sooner.\n3. Pay you the \"actual cash value,\" **without deductible or depreciation**, which is determined by a claims adjuster based on whatever evidence you present and he can gather. Typically this would be the appraised value at time of loss (or the best approximation that can be made). Again, reputable companies don't stay in business by nickle\\-and\\-diming on claims. But it's *possible* you won't agree with their claim settlement, at which point you can appeal following whatever process is provided for in the insurance contract, and then to the courts if both sides want to fight.\n\nIs this endorsement worth it? If I read your excerpts correctly: Loss to irreplaceable objects under the base contract is \"actual cash value at the time of the loss....\" With the endorsement, if they can't recover, restore, or replace \"fine art, antiques, rare objects\" then they will pay you the actual cash value *without deductible*.\n\nI suspect you're missing some other relevant contract details: E.g., there are usually limits per loss event on all sorts of particular items. E.g., every standard HO policy I've looked at will, without an endorsement or individual scheduled coverage, limit to a defined amount (usually a few thousand dollars) payments for losses to categories like:\n\n* Bullion, cash, and negotiables\n* Firearms\n* Jewelry\n* Fine art\n\nThe endorsement probably also serves to lift that limit substantially.",

Am I still expected to pay rent if he is living there?\n\nGenerally speaking, no. But you need to verify that your lease contains no language that overrides certain basic assumption about leases. My understanding is that (1\\) you delivered the property, and (2\\) the landlord was not entitled to live there during your tenancy.\n\nUsually one basic assumption in a lease is that *only the tenants and their beneficiaries/guests* (\"*tenants*\", for brevity) are entitled to use the property. It appears that the landlord is neither.\n\nYour delivery of the property enabled the landlord to reassign the tenant's exclusive right whenever the landlord deems it fit. The scenario of you finding someone to replace you in the lease is merely one alternative from which the landlord can make the *informed decision* to reassign that right.\n\nThe event of reassignment automatically releases you from subsequent payments related to your early move\\-out. Accordingly, the landlord's informed and willful reassignment (in this case, to himself) of the aforementioned exclusive right forfeits his entitlement to subsequent payments from you. This renders the \\[rest of the] lease voidable by you. In this regard, see [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) at \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 153(a).\n\nThere is also an issue of *fraud* and *quantum meruit* (see also *unjust enrichment*) insofar as the landlord benefited at your expense (in the form of your father's work on behalf of you) without informing you that reassignment had taken place already. The landlord knowingly and intentionally deprived you of the opportunity to decide whether to keep taking care of property about which you no longer had any obligation.\n\nI presume you already are mindful of this but I should still mention it: Make sure you can prove the landlord was actually *using* the property rather than inspecting/enhancing/managing it.",

When the landlord moves into the property, it constitutes a reassignment of the exclusive right to use the property, which was originally granted to the tenant under the lease. This action by the landlord automatically releases the tenant from future rent payments and obligations (such as lawn maintenance) related to their early move-out. However, the tenant cannot reclaim past rent payments, as those were for the period when they still had the right to occupy the property. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the landlord's occupation of the property terminates the tenant's ongoing obligations. Option B is too broad, as it suggests the tenant can reclaim past rent payments, which is not supported by the given information. Option D is incorrect because the tenant is released from both rent payments and maintenance obligations once the landlord takes occupancy."

They act in their official capacity on behalf of the United States.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even if a specific federal agency (like the FBI or DEA) conducted the investigation, the case is still brought in the name of the United States as a whole, not the individual agency.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the role of U.S. Attorneys in the federal criminal justice system and how cases are formally presented in court."

A cancellation email was sent but the membership was never cancelled and has been withdrawing dues for up to two years from a checking account. The ownership has transferred to a new franchise owner from the original, from when the email was sent.\n\nWith full proof of a sent email stating all information to cancel the membership who would be liable for reimbursement of membership dues? Does liability fall under the initial owner who should have cancelled the membership, the new owner who continued to withdraw dues, or the franchise as a whole? When filing in small claims I am wondering who the defendant would be?\n\nThe new owner states they have a waiver of all liability from the previous owner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think these are the people involved:\n\n1. There is you: the first\\-party,\n2. there is the original franchisee (A) with whom you had a contract;\n3. there is the current franchisee (B) who took over the management of your contract from party A under a different contract between A \\& B, and\n4. there is franchiser (C) who had a contract with A and now has one with B but has never had a contract with you.\n\nFirst, was your contract with A was properly terminated? This is **not** a given since there are no doubt specific ways in the terms by which this must be done. You need to read the terms of the contract; unless it allows for cancellation by email then you have **not** cancelled the contract. Also, proof of sending the email is **not** proof of receipt; unlike a letter, receipt of an email cannot be *deemed*.\n\nAssuming that the contract was terminatedthen A has taken some money to which it was not entitled and B has taken some money to which it was not entitled. Between you and them you must pursue each of them for the money they took \\- you are not interested in the contractual arrangements between A \\& B or either of them and C; that is for them to sort out.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a gym membership cancellation dispute involving multiple parties, who would be the most appropriate defendant(s) in a small claims court filing for reimbursement of membership dues?\n\nA) Only the original franchisee (A) who failed to process the cancellation\nB) Only the current franchisee (B) who continued to withdraw dues\nC) The franchiser (C) who oversees all franchisees\nD) Both the original franchisee (A) and the current franchisee (B)\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because both the original franchisee (A) and the current franchisee (B) may be liable for the unauthorized withdrawals. The original franchisee (A) failed to properly process the cancellation request, while the current franchisee (B) continued to withdraw dues without a valid contract. The franchiser (C) is not directly involved in the contract with the customer and thus is less likely to be held liable. It's important to pursue both A and B for the money they took, regardless of any liability waiver between them. The contractual arrangements between franchisees and the franchiser are separate issues that do not directly impact the customer's claim for reimbursement."

A project we contribute to does infringe some patent of my company\n2. My contribution does not contain or touch those code parts\n\nIf I read this correctly\n\n> \\[...] that are necessarily infringed by Your\n>  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with\n>  the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted \\[...]\n\nmy contribution has to infringe that patent and if it does I grant the license. So the question is \\- when is a patent considered to be infringed?\nIf I just change a typo?\n\nOur lawyers take is:\n\n* if we sign the CLA\n* and contribute to a project that infringes one of our patents in *any way*\n* we will grant the license\n\nConsequently, we have to check each project we contribute to for potential patent violations. (which is pretty much impossible) \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The goal of these patent clauses is two\\-fold:\n\n* that contributors cannot create patent traps. For example: contributor A makes contributions. Using the contributions causes A's patents to be infringed. Without these clauses, A could later sue the project's users.\n* that someone who works against the project by claiming patent infringement doesn't simultaneously enjoy other contributor's patent licenses: you can't sue *and* use the project. This is intended to discourage legal action against the project and its users.\n\nNormally, a patent\\-relevant contribution would work like this:\n\n* the project is not infringing your patents\n* you make a contribution\n* with this contribution, the project would infringe your patents\n* by making the contribution, you issue a license to these patents\n\nYou are suggesting a more interesting scenario:\n\n* the project is infringing your patents\n* you make a contribution that does not relate to the infringed patents\n\nWill this contribution then cause a patent license to be issued?\n\n* Whether or not you grant a license, you can't sue for infringement or any patent licenses you received through the project will terminate.\n* \u201cCombination\u201d can denote an act or a state/result.\n* The act of combining of your contribution with the project doesn't cause your patents to be infringed. However, the result of the combination does infringe the patents.\n* I could see this being argued either way.\n* As a patent holder, the safe assumption would be that you would be issuing a license for any patents that would be infringed by the result of the combination of your contributions with the project.\n* Your lawyer's advice seems sensible.\n\nYou are not required to check the project for possible violations first: you do not need to explicitly license individual patents, you effectively just lose the right to claim infringement.\n\nIf you are a patent holder and do not want to freely license these patents, then you should stay away from such CLAs and open source projects in general.\n\n* Do not contribute to such projects. Do not copy or share such projects.\n* If you need to modify the project, keep the modifications private.\n* If you want to use such software, prepare a migration plan to a different software in case you want to claim that the project is infringing your patents.\n* Note that there's a legal theory that open source licenses without an explicit patent license (like MIT, BSD) may still have an *implied* patent license, either through the rights that you grant or through estoppel.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company, TechCorp, is considering contributing to an open-source project that uses a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) with a patent license clause similar to the Apache License 2.0. TechCorp holds several patents related to software technologies. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the implications for TechCorp if they decide to contribute to this project?\n\nA) TechCorp can safely contribute without any risk, as long as their specific contribution doesn't directly infringe on their own patents.\n\nB) TechCorp should avoid contributing altogether to prevent any risk of inadvertently licensing their patents.\n\nC) TechCorp needs to thoroughly check the entire project for potential patent infringements before making any contributions.\n\nD) TechCorp can contribute, but should be aware that they may be granting a license to patents infringed by the combination of their contribution and the existing project, even if their contribution alone doesn't infringe.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate representation of the situation described in the documentation. While TechCorp's specific contribution may not directly infringe on their patents, the combination of their contribution with the existing project could result in patent infringement. By contributing under such a CLA, TechCorp may be granting a license to patents that are infringed by this combination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the potential infringement caused by the combination of the contribution and the existing project.\n\nOption B is overly cautious. While there are risks involved, contributing to open-source projects isn't inherently forbidden for patent holders, though they should be aware of the implications.\n\nOption C suggests an impractical approach. While it's advisable to be aware of potential infringements, thoroughly checking the entire project for all possible patent violations before each contribution is likely impossible and not explicitly required by the CLA."
