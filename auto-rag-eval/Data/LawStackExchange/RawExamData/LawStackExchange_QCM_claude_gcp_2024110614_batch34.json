But that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be legal consequences.\n\nIt would be powerful evidence in a perjury prosecution (surely enough for a conviction even standing alone long after the trial is over but within the statute of limitations for perjury in the jurisdiction from the date of the sworn statement, if any), and would be a waiver of 5th Amendment rights against self\\-incrimination, generally, in the perjury case.\n\nIt might also be strong evidence (enough to convict standing alone) in a timely obstruction of justice prosecution. This statute of limitations could also run from the date of the sworn statement, or from the date of a false unsworn statement that caused a conviction to be reopened.\n\nIf the statement made in court was favorable to the prosecution, it might bring these charges after the conviction in the underlying case is final. But, the out of court statement would probably be grounds for the party benefitting from the original statement to seek a mistrial or to have a judgment set aside if the verdict or judgment is consistent with the sworn statement.\n\nIf the out of court statement was made before the trial was over, the witness could be recalled and the out of court statement could be used to impeach the in court statement.\n\nIt might constitute a probation or parole violation.\n\nIf the witness were testifying pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the out of court statement would probably breach the deal and deny the witness the benefit of the cooperation deal.\n\nThe out of court statement might constitute contempt of court if made while the proceeding in which the statement was made was still pending.\n\nDepending on the nature of the statement, the out of court statement might constitute defamation for which some one whose reputation was tarnished might sue for money damages. (There is immunity from civil liability for in court statements.)\n\nIt would violate the ethical rules of many professions. For example, an attorney would probably be disbarred for doing that. Arguably, in this situation, the statute of limitations could run from the later unsworn statement date rather than the date of the sworn statement.\n\nIf the witness is a state or federal government employee, this could lead to impeachment proceedings, in the state legislature, or Congress, respectively.\n\nThe aftermath of the Lewinsky Scandal (link below) involving Bill Clinton touches on many of these possibilities:\n\n> Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment\n>  of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He\n>  was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and\n>  obstruction of justice in a 21\\-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in\n>  civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving\n>  misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and\n>  was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was\n>  suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was\n>  disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme\n>  Court.\n\n**Easier and Harder Cases**\n\nThe easier cases are those where it is undeniably clear from other evidence that the witness lied under oath, and the out of court statement merely puts the cherry on top of an already solid perjury case.\n\nThe hard cases aren't the cases where \"the actual truth cannot be found out\". Instead, the hard cases are the cases where there is strong evidence that the statement made in court, under oath was true. \n\nFor example, suppose Ted Cruz is asked in court: \"[Were you the Zodiac killer?](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/8/11179492/ted-cruz-zodiac-killer)\" (A crime ridiculously attributed to him despite the fact that it is something that happened when he was a small child who live many hundreds of miles away.) And he says, \"No\" in court, but then leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"I am the Zodiac killer, I lied about that under oath in court today.\"\n\nSimilarly, suppose that a DNA test on [a certain blue dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal) shows a perfect match to President Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton says under oath in court, that the substance tested came from him on a certain day, in a certain place, when a certain person was wearing it, in a certain way (also confirmed by a witness and surveillance video). Then, he leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"Someone else was the source of that genetic material. I never met that person, and I was in Kenya on the day alleged and I've never set foot in the White House. I lied about all of this under oath in court today.\"\n\nIn these cases, there is no plausible way to make an obstruction of justice or perjury charge stick, or to upset a verdict or judgment consistent with the truthful sworn statement.\n\nContempt of court is still possible, as would professional ethics violations, but other consequences would be less obvious, because the act would come across more as absurd instead of something that genuinely confounds the truth. \n\nThe legal consequences associated with the conduct in the original post are mostly aimed at sanctioning genuinely fraudulent conduct. Our legal system is more confused about how to respond to lies so blatant that they only amount to feeble and ineffectual gaslighting that no reasonable person familiar with the circumstances would believe (but that might incite crazy conspiracy theory thinking supporters). The harder case would lie in the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) between a bad joke and a pathetically weak attempt to mislead people, even though the law is clear about how to deal with clear sarcasm and convincing attempts to lie that can't be clearly proven or disproven with other evidence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the given documentation about witness testimony and perjury:\n\nQuestion: A key witness in a high-profile criminal trial testifies under oath, providing crucial evidence that leads to the defendant's conviction. Two years after the trial, the witness publicly recants their testimony on social media, claiming they lied under oath due to pressure from the prosecution. Which of the following is the most likely legal consequence for the witness?\n\nA) Immediate arrest for perjury based solely on the social media post\nB) No legal consequences, as the statement was made outside of court\nC) Potential obstruction of justice charges, with the social media post as evidence\nD) Automatic reversal of the original conviction without further investigation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal implications that require analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"The statement made outside the courtroom is not itself perjury, since it is not made under oath.\" This eliminates option A, which suggests immediate arrest for perjury based solely on the social media post.\n\n2. Option B is incorrect because the documentation clearly outlines several potential legal consequences for such actions, even when made outside of court.\n\n3. Option C is the most accurate. The documentation states that such a statement \"would be powerful evidence in a perjury prosecution\" and \"might also be strong evidence (enough to convict standing alone) in a timely obstruction of justice prosecution.\" The social media post could serve as evidence in an obstruction of justice case, as it potentially interferes with the administration of justice by calling into question the validity of the original trial outcome.\n\n4. Option D is incorrect because an automatic reversal without investigation is not a standard procedure. The documentation mentions that such a statement \"would probably be grounds for the party benefitting from the original statement to seek a mistrial or to have a judgment set aside,\" but this requires a legal process, not an automatic reversal.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between in-court and out-of-court statements, the potential for obstruction of justice charges, and the impact on the original trial outcome. It also introduces a real-world scenario involving social media, which adds complexity to the legal considerations."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/what-is-a-transition-bond-company", "docs_id": 1092, "title": "What is a Transition Bond Company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've come across the term `Transition Bond Company`, and I'm trying to figure out what it is \u2013 in relatively plain English, since I lack any legal background whatsoever.\n\nThe context in which I've seen the term used is in connection to regulated utility companies in the US (e.g., electric companies).\n\nAny explanation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Transition bonds\" are debt for which the collateral is \"transition property.\"\n\nPeriodically U.S. states authorize utilities to levy a charge on individual consumer bills.

The correct answer is A because the key aspect of Transition Bond Companies is that they are typically authorized by state law. The documentation mentions that \"Periodically U.S. states authorize utilities to levy a charge on individual consumer bills\" and provides examples of state laws enabling this process. Creating a subsidiary to handle bond issuance without state authorization would likely lead to legal challenges, as it bypasses the regulatory framework that legitimizes these financial instruments.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it accurately describes the nature of transition property, which is defined as \"the right to levy this charge now and in the future\" that can serve as collateral.\n\nOption C is a valid use of transition bonds, as the documentation states that one reason for these bonds is \"to compensate a former monopolist during the transition to a competitive utilities market.\"\n\nOption D is likely a common structure for Transition Bond Companies and wouldn't inherently lead to legal challenges, as long as it's done within the state's regulatory framework.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (state authorization, transition property, purpose of transition bonds) and apply them to a real-world scenario involving potential legal issues.

And the argument that a [dog is a *fur\\-bearing animal*](http://www.pawculture.com/pet-wellness/pet-grooming/dog-hair-or-dog-fur-is-there-a-difference/) can be established by an expert witness if the burglar's lawyer resorts to vexatious \"defenses\".\n\nThe statutory language \"*any fur\\-bearing animal*\" obviously encompasses domestic fur\\-bearing animals, notwithstanding that [MCL 324\\.40102(1\\)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ngh4veyz0hmmxgkl45323zzu))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-324-40102) defines *animals* as \"*wild birds and wild mammals*\".

To be clear, I'm not asking whether it was socially acceptable in England of the 1790's to publicly pass gas on someone's picture (nor whether it is acceptable to do so today), but whether it fit the legal definition of Treason under any statutory or common law offense that would have been in effect in 1798\\.\n\nMore specifically, either of the following scenarios seems plausible:\n\n* This was literally treason in 1798, and the cartoon's purpose is to point out the absurdity of treating toilet humor shenanigans as legally equivalent to murdering the king or waging grim war against him.\n* This was not actually treason, but the point of the cartoon was a warning against contemporary trends in expanding the scope of criminal offenses to cover unusual or non\\-obvious scenarios. In other words, this was an exaggeration to emphasize that criminal law was getting so ridiculously broad that farting on a picture might soon be prosecutable as a major offense if the cartoon's readers didn't start advocating for more narrow and sensible laws.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cartoon may call back to events of 1795, where George III had stones thrown at him while he was on his way to the State Opening of Parliament. In response, the government \\- headed by Pitt the Younger, who is the man in the picture saying \"That is treason, Johnny\" \\- passed [\"An Act for the Safety and Preservation of His Majesty\u2019s Person and Government against Treasonable and Seditious Practices and Attempts\"](https://statutes.org.uk/site/the-statutes/eighteenth-century/1795-36-geo-3-c-7-treasonable-and-seditious-practices-act/), 36 Geo. 3 c.7\\. We now call it the Treason Act 1795\\. It was one of a series of Acts that suspended habeas corpus, banned political meetings, and so on, in the wake of the French Revolution.\n\nSection 1 deals with treason, at some length, but a fart probably doesn't count. The conditions are that somebody would:\n\n> within the Realm or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend Death or Destruction, or any bodily Harm tending to Death or Destruction, Maim or Wounding, Imprisonment or Restraint, of the Person of our same Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors, or to deprive or depose him or them from the Style, Honour, or Kingly Name of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, or of any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries; or to levy War against his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, within his Realm, in order, by Force or Constraint, to compel him or them to change his or their Measures or Counsels, or in order to put any Force or Constraint upon, or to intimidate, or overawe, both Houses, or either House of Parliament; or to move or stir any Foreigner or Stranger with Force to invade this Realm, or any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries, under the Obeisance of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors; and such Compassings, Imaginations, Inventions, Devices, or Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any Printing or Writing, or by any overt Act or Deed\n\nThe text is substantially preserved in the [Treason Felony Act 1848](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/11-12/12/contents), section 3\\. The 1795 Act also created a \"High Misdemeanour\" for anyone who\n\n> shall maliciously and advisedly, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, or other Speaking, express, publish, utter, or declare, any Words or Sentences to excite or stir up the People to hatred or Contempt of the Person of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or the Government and Constitution of this Realm, as by Law established\n\nThis is closer to the fart; it is a l\u00e8se\\-majest\u00e9 provision aimed at general disrespect for the King. The provision was due to expire in 1798\\. I do not know the detailed timeline of its expiry and proposed renewal in relation to when the cartoon was published, but this is a plausible connection to why it was a live issue again.\n\nIn Scotland, but not England, there were common\\-law offences of sedition and \"leasing\\-making\" covering the same sort of idea. They were abolished [in 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/13/part/2/crossheading/abolition-of-offences-of-sedition-and-leasingmaking) but were long obsolete. Hume (*Commentaries on the Law of Scotland*, 1797\\) distinguishes between them by saying that leasing\\-making is solely verbal, a species of slander, whereas sedition is words or deeds \"for the purpose of producing public trouble or commotion, and moving His Majesty's subjects to the dislike, resistance, or subversion of the established government and laws, or settled frame and order of things.\"\n\nIn any event, the political cartoon is *satire* and does not necessarily represent a legal reality. It is mocking Pitt's heavy\\-handedness in the Act of 1795, and perhaps challenging the authorities to define this very cartoon as criminal. Newton's mentor, William Holland, had been imprisoned for seditious libel for publishing Thomas Paine's *Letter Addressed to the Addressers, on the Late Proclamation*. The proclamation in question was [the one of 1792 against seditious writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_Against_Seditious_Writings_and_Publications), also the work of Pitt, and aimed at Paine's *Rights of Man*, a work advocating for (among other things) freedom of the press and abolition of the monarchy.

Several key points support this interpretation:\n\n1. The Treason Act 1795, passed in response to attacks on George III, expanded the definition of treasonable offenses. However, even this broader definition did not explicitly include acts like farting on a picture as treason.\n\n2. The Act created a \"High Misdemeanour\" for expressing contempt for the monarchy, which is closer to the act depicted in the cartoon but still an exaggeration.\n\n3. The cartoon was created in a context of increasing government repression of political dissent, including suspension of habeas corpus and bans on political meetings.\n\n4. The cartoonist, Richard Newton, was associated with William Holland, who had been imprisoned for seditious libel. This suggests a personal motivation to criticize government overreach.\n\n5. Satire often uses exaggeration to make political points. By depicting an absurd act as \"treason,\" the cartoon challenges viewers to consider how far the government might go in criminalizing dissent.\n\n6. The cartoon likely references the ongoing debate about renewing provisions of the 1795 Act, which were set to expire in 1798.\n\nThis question requires the integration of historical context, legal knowledge, and an understanding of political satire, testing the ability to analyze the cartoon's message within its complex socio-political environment."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28548/gdpr-if-am-am-allowing-user-to-post-on-twitter-and-facebook-from-my-ios-app", "docs_id": 28548, "title": "GDPR - If am am allowing user to post on twitter and Facebook from my IOS app?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If am allowing user to post on twitter and Facebook from my IOS app, Do I have to get user consent ?

September 2015 \u2013 28 O 2/14 und 28 O 7/14\\) zu befassen und dem Kl\u00e4ger ein Schmerzensgeld in H\u00f6he von insgesamt 635\\.000 \u20ac zuerkannt; diese Urteile sind jedoch noch nicht rechtskr\u00e4ftig, \u2013 mit einer Entscheidung des OLG K\u00f6ln ist 2016 zu rechnen.\n\ntranslation:\n\n> The highest damages ever awarded by a German court were: 700\\.000 \u20ac to an infant that suffered most severe brain damage, ... and in a completely different matter, a most severe violation of personal rights of the well known author and weather presenter J\u00f6rg Kachelmann, 635\\.000 \u20ac, though that has been appealed.\n\nWhat difference in law causes US and european courts to award such vastly different damages?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One reason is that in a German civil suit, the cost for lawyers and for the court (court isn't free) is set according to the value that the parties are arguing about, which would be the value that one party demands, minus the value that the other party is offering to pay. Then the cost is divided between winner and loser according to the percentage of the value the claimant was awarded. \n\nSo if I ask for \u20ac1,000,000 and I am rewarded \u20ac10,000 then the cost is calculated based on my \u20ac1,000,000 claim, and since I was rewarded only 1% of the claim, I'll pay 99% of the cost. The defendant will pay my \u20ac10,000 and 1% of the cost, that is my lawyers, their lawyers, and the court. With these rules, asking for the sky and then not getting much is a very, very bad strategy. \n\nOn the other hand, if a huge company sues me for \u20ac10,000 then they can't snow me under with an army of lawyers: The court will get only a small amount of money for the case, so at some rather early point the judge would tell the huge company: Stop right now; I'm not paid enough money to listen to your army of lawyers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular social media influencer in the United States is suing a news website for publishing private information without consent. The influencer is seeking $10 million in damages. If this case were to occur in Germany instead, how would the legal approach and potential outcome likely differ?\n\nA) The German court would award similar damages, but require the influencer to pay legal costs if the award is less than the amount sought\nB) The German court would cap damages at \u20ac700,000 and divide legal costs based on the percentage of the claim awarded\nC) The German court would dismiss the case entirely, as privacy laws are less strict in Germany\nD) The German court would award higher damages than in the US, but limit the influencer's ability to use multiple lawyers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the differences between US and German legal systems regarding damages and court costs. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. German courts typically award much lower damages than US courts, as evidenced by the examples given (highest damages around \u20ac700,000).\n2. The German legal system discourages inflated claims by tying court costs to the claimed amount and dividing these costs based on the percentage of the claim awarded.\n3. If the influencer claimed \u20ac10 million but was only awarded a fraction of that (e.g., \u20ac500,000), they would be responsible for a large portion of the legal costs.\n4. This system incentivizes more realistic damage claims and discourages excessive litigation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because German courts wouldn't award similar damages to US courts. Option C is false as Germany does have strong privacy laws. Option D is incorrect because German courts don't award higher damages than US courts in such cases, and the limitation on lawyers is based on court costs, not a direct restriction on the number of lawyers.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the differences between legal systems, apply the concepts to a hypothetical scenario, and understand the implications of different legal approaches on both the process and outcome of a case."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7103/consensus-criminal-justice", "docs_id": 7103, "title": "Consensus-Criminal Justice", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How is it possible to have a consensus about what should or should not be legal in a country with several hundred million people from all races, religions, and walks of life?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't necessarily consensus.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the complexities of double jeopardy protection in the United States. While the question states that murder is a \"greater offense\" compared to manslaughter, the Double Jeopardy Clause generally prohibits re-charging a defendant after an acquittal, even for a greater offense arising from the same incident. \n\nHowever, the key here is the Blockburger test, which allows new charges for the same conduct if they pass this test. The prosecutor would need to prove that the murder charge contains at least one element that is not present in the manslaughter charge to potentially overcome double jeopardy protection. This nuanced application of the Blockburger test is what makes C the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the concept of greater offenses and ignores double jeopardy protections. Option B is too absolute, not accounting for the potential application of the Blockburger test. Option D is also incorrect as it overstates the scope of double jeopardy protection, ignoring the possibility of distinct charges passing the Blockburger test.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking and the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of information about double jeopardy, greater offenses, and the Blockburger test."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60983/are-businesses-required-to-try-every-possible-combination-of-methods-for-verific", "docs_id": 60983, "title": "Are businesses required to try every possible combination of methods for verification under GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A site maintains accounts containing:\n\n1. email\n2. password\n3. display name\n4. account preferences\n\nTwo accounts containing the same password, display name, and account preferences may or may not exist but they will have different email addresses.

A controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.\n\nThe GDPR does not specify exactly what methods of verification are \"reasonable\".\n\n[GDPR Article 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/) paragraph 2 provides:\n\n> Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\n\nThis is amplified by [Recital 57](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-57/) which says:\n\n> If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log\\-in to the on\\-line service offered by the data controller.\n\n[GDPR Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) paragraph 6 provides:\n\n> Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n\nAll of the above seems to indicate that the Data Controller must follow reasonable practices, but is not required to guarantee a positive response to a Data Subject who cannot supply reasonable evidence of identity. Moreover the Controller is required to reliably ascertain the identity of the Subject before providing information or acting on a request.\n\nIncidentally, good security practice is that the site does **not** retain the actual password. instead it hashes the password with a good cryptographically secure hash function, and stores the hash. This means that the site cannot reliably determine if a password is unique among all passwords saved by the site, and searches among passwords are not normally done, and would not be reasonable.\n\nA site using an email address as the User Identifier would normally enforce at the time an account is created that the email is unique among all emails registered on the site. A user who cannot provide the email would typically be rejected as not able to be identified, unless the site retains additional ID info not listed in the question. I think such a practice would be considered to be reasonable in the current state of technology.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company receives a GDPR data access request from an individual who provides a password, display name, and account preferences, but not an email address. The company finds two accounts matching this information. According to GDPR guidelines, what is the most appropriate course of action for the company?\n\nA) Deny the request outright due to insufficient identification information\nB) Provide the data for both accounts to the requester\nC) Ask the requester to provide additional information to uniquely identify their account\nD) Respond with data from the account that was created most recently\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of GDPR requirements and application to a specific scenario, testing critical thinking about data protection and identity verification. The correct answer is based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. GDPR Recital 64 states that controllers should \"use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access.\"\n\n2. Article 11 and Recital 57 indicate that if a controller cannot identify a data subject, they should inform the subject and may request additional information to enable identification.\n\n3. Article 12, paragraph 6 allows controllers to request additional information if they have reasonable doubts about the identity of the person making the request.\n\nIn this scenario, the company has found two accounts matching the provided information, creating ambiguity about which account the requester is seeking access to. Simply denying the request (A) would be too restrictive, as the GDPR encourages facilitating data subject rights. Providing data for both accounts (B) could violate the privacy of another individual if one account doesn't belong to the requester. Defaulting to the most recent account (D) is arbitrary and could lead to incorrect data disclosure.\n\nThe most appropriate action, aligned with GDPR principles, is to ask the requester for additional information (C) to uniquely identify their account, likely by providing their email address. This approach balances the requester's right to access with the company's obligation to protect personal data and verify identity before disclosure."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46585/cross-examination-ethics", "docs_id": 46585, "title": "Cross examination ethics", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Due to an ongoing case, I was wondering the following.\n\nCan any complaint be made if a barrister suggests something plainly absurd (e.g. the witness made it up when there is CCTV evidence) and also how can anyone claiming to have any ethics lead with that sort of abusive question when he knows there isn't a cat in hell's chance for it to be true.\n\nI am aware of the belief that everyone deserves a fair trial which many lawyers put forward as the reason why they take such cases, bit distressing questioning based on what the lawyer knows to be a lie seems to be more a case of attempting to subvert a fair trial than give the defendant one.\n\nNote the second part is of course being asked within the bounds of 'professional\\-ethics; I have no doubt that the person indulging in this *especially when he knows for sure that it is not true* is acting in an evil manner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no \"truth\" in court\n----------------------------\n\nThere are only facts that are either contested or uncontested.\n\nUncontested facts are those agreed to by the parties, usually well before the hearing. They might be used in cross\\-examination to point out testimony that is inconsistent with what the parties have agreed and so cast doubt on the credibility of the witness.\n\nContested facts are, by definition, not agreed upon. Assuming the CCTV footage is admitted as evidence, it may be contested who the people in the images actually are or when the footage was actually shot or that the footage has been subsequently edited \\- such contested facts are perfectly legitimate matters to seek evidence on. \n\nThe lawyer doesn't know the facts \\- they only know what they have been told. It's likely that they have been told many conflicting things. Ask any group of 6 people what was decided in a meeting that concluded 20 minutes ago and you are likely to get 7 different answers. It's not that people are liars (although they sometimes are) is just that memory is not a hard drive, immutable and unchanging. Every time you access your memory you change it, overlaying the circumstances of each recollection onto it. Now imagine that there is some strong incentive on you for your memory of an event 18 months ago to be a certain way \\- say not going to jail or a lawsuit worth millions of dollars \\- this colors your memory. People remember things the way they wish they were rather than the way they actually were \\- this is not intentional (mostly).\n\nThe purpose of testimony is for these conflicting things to be tested \\- to be presented to the trier of fact so that they can decide which witnesses they believe and which they don't and draw their own conclusions as to what the facts (legally) are which may and often does differ materially from what each witness believes the facts are or even what the facts objectively are (presuming there is such a thing as an objective fact \\- law is not science; its a lot closer to history as an academic discipline).\n\nLegal Limitations\n-----------------\n\nIn addition, there are strict limits on what is and is not allowed in cross\\-examination and the opposition council is very aware of what they are and will be very pro\\-active in requesting the judge enforce them by making an objection. A cross\\-examiner cannot lead (\"At 8 pm that day, you were at the deli, correct?\"), ask compound questions (\u201cDid you determine the time of death by interviewing witnesses and by requesting the autopsy report written by the coroner?\u201d), ask for a narrative, be argumentative (\u201cDid you stop at the stop sign on 5th and Main?\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cSo, to be clear, you ran the stop sign?\u201d) or be vague (\u201cWhen did you see it happen?\u201d). However, if opposing counsel doesn't object the witness must answer.\n\nTactical Limitations\n--------------------\n\nNobody likes a bully. Overly aggressive cross\\-examination can be counterproductive and endear the witness to the fact\\-finder and make you look like a d^\\&k.\n\nEthics\n------\n\nA lawers ethical duty is not to the facts or, heaven forbid some notion of \"truth\", it is to present their evidence and to test their opponent's evidence so that their client's narrative (a non\\-fiction narrative) prevails.\n\nIn a civil case, that means showing that your version of the events is more likely than your opponents (balance of probabilities). In a criminal case, it means that the prosecutor must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that *all* elements of the charge were perpetrated for a defendant \\- for a criminal defense lawyer, it means demonstrating that there is reasonable doubt in at least one of those elements.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that only contested matters go to trial \\- settlement, mediation, arbitration and plea bargains are far more common \\- and only the contested facts are the subject of cross\\-examination. Particularly in a civil trial, an agreed statement of facts is prepared to identify what's agreed and what's contested and evidence is only sought about the contested matters.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A defense attorney is cross-examining a witness in a criminal trial where CCTV footage is a key piece of evidence.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The principle of res judicata, as explained in Henderson v Henderson, requires parties to bring forward their whole case in a single litigation. Splitting the claim into multiple parts (as suggested in options A and D) would likely be considered an abuse of process and a violation of this principle.\n\n2. Option B, while avoiding the issue of splitting the claim, fails to address the full scope of Adam's losses and would leave significant damages unrecovered.\n\n3. Option C is the most appropriate because it adheres to the legal principle of bringing the whole case forward in a single litigation. This approach allows Adam to address both aspects of his claim (the undervalued sale and the overcharged fee) within a single comprehensive case.\n\n4.

To simplify matters, Fletcher came to possess a painting, (purportedly) believed that it was painted by Doig, and sought to sell it for a large amount of money. Doig stated that he did not paint the work. Doig acted to prevent the sale of the painting \u2013 that is against the law.

The most appropriate action is to seek a declaratory judgment and an injunction (option B). Here's why:\n\n1. Declaratory judgment: This legal action would establish that Alex is not the author of the painting, similar to how the court declared Doig was not the painter in the referenced case.

One is \"are sidewalks on (state) universities public property\", and the other is \"when do I have to provide identification in a state with no stop and identify law\". I will focus on the second question. As it happens, property ownership is not relevant to that determination. The universal fact is that only a peace officer (variously identified) can force you to identify yourself, no matter where you are. In [Ohio](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29), which has such a law, the law requires you to give name, DOB and address if they suspect you and you are in a public place. Being in Kroger is being in a public place, even though Kroger is private property. [Alabama](http://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2006/14214/15-5-30.html) likewise allows officers to stop and question a suspect in a public place. [Arizona](http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/02412.htm&Title=13&DocType=ARS) doesn't even limit the requirement to \"public places\". In [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf), you will not be convicted of obstructing. That is because 725 ILCS 5/107\\-14 a peace officer \"may stop any person in a public place\" and \"may demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions\". However, they forgot to include a part where the suspect has to answer in the statute. As far as I know, Washington state has no law allowing such questioning and again as far as I know you can refuse to respond. So: if you are a suspect, and the state has no stop and identify law, they cannot require you to identify yourself, and then in some states, you would even need to be in a public place.\n\nAnd then there is [Arkansas](http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-5/subtitle-6/chapter-71/subchapter-2/5-71-213), where it looks like failure to identify can be taken as evidence of loitering (one would have to read the Arkansas case law to see if it's really that bad).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A student activist is organizing a peaceful protest on a state university campus in Washington state.

They are concerned about potential misuse or lack of credit. Given this scenario, which of the following approaches best balances the developer's desire for recognition with the principles of open-source software?\n\nA) Use a proprietary license and only distribute compiled binaries\nB) Implement the MIT License with a modified clause requiring prominent attribution\nC) Apply the standard MIT License and rely on its built-in attribution requirements\nD) Keep the project closed-source and only share it under strict non-disclosure agreements\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the developer's needs, understanding of open-source principles, and application of licensing concepts. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. The MIT License aligns with the developer's stated goal of allowing others to use the project while ensuring credit is given. It requires that the original copyright notice and permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\n2. Option A contradicts the idea of open-sourcing the project and doesn't allow for sharing or modification, which seems to go beyond the developer's stated concerns.\n\n3. Option B, while tempting, modifying standard open-source licenses can lead to compatibility issues and is generally discouraged in the open-source community. It may also deter potential users or contributors.\n\n4. Option D completely contradicts the concept of open-sourcing and would severely limit the project's reach and potential impact.\n\nThe MIT License strikes the right balance by providing a simple, permissive license that ensures attribution without imposing overly restrictive terms. It allows for wide adoption and modification while still requiring users to give credit to the original author.

There are torts that are similar like deceit and negligent misstatement.\n\nThe link provided is talking about fraud \\- the criminal equivalent of deceit (and the word fraud is often used when technically it\u2019s talking about the tort of deceit). The out\\-of\\-pocket rule applies to torts so Bob can recover his losses.

He can recover his fuel costs and depreciation on the excavator as those are \u201creal\u201d out of pocket expenses. If Bob had been an employee of a plaintiff company, they could recover his wages but not what they might have sold his time for.

However, this is only available if the misrepresentation was fraudulent (Alice knew the money wasn\u2019t there), Alice had no reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true, or at the court\u2019s discretion.

The reports, compiled by a third-party contractor, incorrectly state that the bedrock is suitable for the proposed design. StructureCo completes the design, but during construction, it's discovered that the bedrock is unstable, requiring significant redesign and additional costs. The city claims it acted in good faith, believing the reports to be accurate.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. Tort claim for negligent misrepresentation (A) is unlikely to succeed because it would be limited to out-of-pocket losses. StructureCo's main losses are likely opportunity costs and additional work, which are not typically recoverable under the out-of-pocket rule in tort law.\n\n2. Fraudulent misrepresentation (C) is not applicable here because the city acted in good faith, believing the reports to be accurate. Fraud requires intent to deceive, which is not present in this scenario.\n\n3. A negligent misstatement claim against the third-party contractor (D) might be possible, but it could be challenging to establish a duty of care owed directly to StructureCo, as the contractor's client was the city, not StructureCo.\n\n4. A claim for breach of contract based on misrepresentation (B) is the most promising approach. This is a contractual claim, allowing for \"benefit of the bargain\" damages, which could include the additional costs incurred due to the redesign. Even though the misrepresentation was not fraudulent, the court has discretion to award damages if the city had no reasonable grounds for believing the statement to be true (which might be argued given the importance of accurate soil reports for such a project).\n\nThis approach aligns with the documentation's explanation that pre-contractual false statements of fact that induce another party to enter a contract give rise to a cause of action in contract law, potentially allowing for more comprehensive damages than a tort claim would provide."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35535/buying-a-house-in-a-partnership", "docs_id": 35535, "title": "Buying a house in a partnership", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am buying a house with a colleague in California. \n\nI am paying 80% and he is paying 20%.\n\nHe is going to live in the house, and pay rent for my 80% stakes in the house. \n\n1.

Yes such an arrangement can be made legally.\n2. Owners cannot be **evicted**. But a contract could provide for regular payments (rent) and that the right to use/occupy the property is contingent on those payments being made. It could even provide that if the payments are sufficiently behind, that a portion of that party's share would be forfeit to cover the amount due. It should probably not reduce the minor partner's equity by more than the amount of payments due. All this would need to be spelled out in detail in your contract.\n3. Property tax is a joint obligation of the owners. Your contract could specify who pays it or from what source it would be paid. One option would be for each party to pay into a fund (similar to an escrow account for a mortgage) from which the tax would be paid. Your contract should specify such an arrangement if it is wanted, and what happens if one party does not pay or is late. The government will not care about your agreement, they will want their tax money in full and on time, or they will charge penalties and/or seize the property, in accord with local law. Either owner could be liable for the full amount.\n4. Much the same applies to insurance, and to any utilities. All are joint obligations of the owners, and a contract may specify who is to pay and how, or how payment is to be divided, and what happens if someone does not pay as agreed.\n5. If you want the right to sell off parts of your share, your contract should cover this, and what notification , if any, is required. It may be that the law will require you to get your partner's consent, I am not sure. Will any new owner become a party to the contract? If so that probably needs the consent of existing parties but it may be possible to specify that such consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\".\n\nI strongly suggest that you discuss with your partner in detail what options you both want, or are willing to agree to.

While the developer created the website, several factors complicate the legal landscape:\n\n1. Intellectual Property: The developer may have some claim to the intellectual property of the website design and code. However, this doesn't automatically grant the right to remove files from someone else's computer.\n\n2. Authorization: Despite having permission to remotely access the computer, the purpose of that access is crucial. Permission for general access doesn't necessarily extend to removing files, especially if it's not in line with the original intent of the authorization.\n\n3. Computer Crime Laws: Many jurisdictions have laws against unauthorized access or exceeding authorized access to computer systems. Even with initial permission, using that access to remove files after a disagreement could be seen as exceeding the scope of authorization.\n\n4. Contract Law: The terms of any agreement (verbal or written) between the developer and the friend regarding the website creation and ownership would be relevant.\n\n5. Intent and Context: The circumstances of the disagreement and the developer's intent in removing the files could influence how the action is legally interpreted.\n\nOption B is the most accurate because it highlights the potential legal risk of the developer's actions.

There is no contemplation that their presence will prevent the opponents from attacking in order to show mercy on their compatriots. Instead, the POWs are being used to deceive the enemy's automated systems that the attacking force is friendly despite the implausibility of that given their actions.\n\nIt is really more analogous to forcing a prisoner to write a misleading letter or make a misleading phone call, while under duress.\n\nWhile the use of fraud and deception in warfare may be dishonorable, usually actual war crimes involving POWs entail mistreatment of a POW or putting a POW in harm's way (even if presenting only a risk of death or injury).\n\nAlso, of course, much of the Geneva Convention's requirements regarding the treatment of POWs is a treaty imposed obligation, binding morally because both combatants at one point consented to it, rather than necessarily being a universal and mandatorily applicable component of customary international law. The fact that the Geneva Convention might be violated in some detail, if true, doesn't automatically make it a war crime in this context.\n\nIn the same vein, the Geneva Conventions make a distinction between the treatment of uniformed and non\\-uniformed combatants, but this distinction, established by a treaty agreed to by many nations, is not necessarily inherently relevant to determining if something is a war crime in a war with a non\\-signatory. It is a provision that relies of cultural meaning that is shared by the treaty signatories, but may not make sense vis\\-a\\-vis non\\-human sentient aliens.\n\nIn the same vein, one wouldn't think that in a war with intelligent dragons, the fact that the dragons were or were not wearing uniforms, when dragons customarily fight naked, was significant, unless the dragon nation agreed to the Geneva Conventions in a duly ratified treaty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the alien conflict described, which of the following best analyzes the ethical and legal implications of the humans' tactics with the captured alien POWs?\n\nA) The humans clearly committed a war crime by using the POWs as human shields, violating established Geneva Convention principles.\n\nB) The humans' actions fall into a grey area of warfare ethics, as they used POWs for deception rather than as physical shields against attack.\n\nC) The humans' tactics are fully justified under the laws of war, as the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to conflicts with non-human entities.\n\nD) The use of POWs to bypass biometric security is equivalent to forced labor and constitutes a definite war crime regardless of the adversary's species.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a complex ethical scenario.

The humans are not using the POWs as traditional \"human shields\" to prevent attacks, but rather to deceive automated systems. This distinguishes it from clear-cut war crime scenarios.\n\n2.

The program, Amped FIVE, was used for the drone footage. To do this, Amped FIVE employs interpolation algorithms. Because of this, a dispute broke out between the prosecution and defense. These debates ranged from what is an interpolation, to whether the program added colors. James Armstrong, the senior forensic imaging specialist responsible for producing these enhanced videos, was brought in the courtroom to explain the process. What followed was truly interesting.\n\nMy main concern was with how the defense went about justifying why the drone footage should not have been used. I admit I do not understand court procedures and several things had me scratching my head. I would like to preface this by saying I understand it is the job of the defense to protect Kyle Rittenhouse. However, I felt did not make the best case.\n\nWhen questioned about the algorithm, on multiple occasions the defense would ask Mr. Armstrong how the interpolation worked. However, every time he was asked, he could only provide them with what kind of interpolation was used. He admitted that he did not understand how it was programmed. And why would he? Interpolation is an incredibly complex process that requires advanced mathematics and computer science. Not only that but, companies purposely do not disclose this information to prevent people from reverse\\-engineering their products. These questions could only be answered by a computer scientist or mathematician who worked on the program. So why wasn't one brought in? Also, because of his ignorance, wasn't a majority of the questioning a waste of time?\n\nAnother problem arose when the defense was trying to explain interpolation, they used an example that oversimplified the concept so much that it seemed to no longer make sense. The red, purple, and blue pixel example was very flawed in how it was presented. I believe the example wouldn't even work for the nearest neighbor because it would not have turned the pixels in the middle purple. Although this was a poor example, the judge used this as a basis for his understanding of interpolation which worked in the favor of the defense. Also, the defense kept trying to make Mr. Armstrong admit things he did not feel comfortable with because of his lack of knowledge. They asked the same question about adding colors repeatedly and he could never answer. And the language they use like \"add\" and \"manipulate\" implies that the enhanced footage was deceptively altered to give the prosecution an advantage. Because of this, they tried to argue that the video was unreliable. Ironically, the defense submitted evidence that was altered similarly.\n\nLastly, why was a peer\\-reviewed process using an industry\\-standard program not allowed to be used? I am aware that the judge said the burden of proof is on the prosecution but didn't they already prove that the footage was perfectly suitable for use in the trial? The prosecution asked Mr. Armstrong whether the procedures were acceptable for forensic imaging.\n\nI guess to sum everything up, why wasn't this handled better by both the defense and prosecution. I felt like the discussion went nowhere and all parties were incredibly ignorant.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/20xYv.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The defense has an opportunity to question the witness the prosecution had called to provide foundation for the evidence, and in this case the defense's perspective is that the prosecution was trying to introduce evidence that they had improperly digitally manipulated. Part of their questioning was trying to figure out how the witness had manipulated the image prior to offering it as evidence. It's the prosecution's burden to prove that the evidence they are offering is accurate, the defense's purpose in asking the witness questions he could not answer is to try to prove to the judge that the prosecution has not laid proper foundation for the evidence because it has been manipulated from its original form in a way the prosecution cannot explain or justify as remaining fair and accurate to the events captured by the original footage.\n\nThis case in particular had a lot of video evidence, and most of these issues were handled in *motions in limine* before the trial started.

Chief Justice Roy Moore spends 100 pages explaining why gay marriage is evil and unnatural, why Obergefell was an unconstitutional opinion, why unconstitutional opinions do not creating binding precedent, what our oaths of loyalty to the constitution mean, what the difference between a ruling and an opinion is, why he needn't recuse himself, and why Obergefell only applies to the parties to the case, and not to the probate judges of the state of Alabama.\n\nThen he concludes by saying on page 100:\n\n> As stated at the beginning of this special concurrence, the\n>  certificate of judgment in this case does not disturb the March 2015\n>  orders of this Court that uphold the constitutionality of the Sanctity\n>  of Marriage Amendment and the Alabama Marriage Protection Act.

His discussion make it seem like AFA has reported correctly that the Alabama judiciary is taking a principled stand against the SCOTUS's decision in Obergefell.

If he thinks the probate judges are bound to deny marriage certificates to same sex couples, why is he concurring to dismiss, instead of dissenting? Justice Bolin also writes a concurrence, where he states that despite disagreeing with Obergefell, he recognizes the authority the SCOTUS has over Alabama. That makes sense.

The correct answer, D, best explains the apparent contradiction by recognizing that the court's dismissal was primarily a procedural matter, separate from the merits of the same-sex marriage debate.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by several key points from the documentation:\n\n1.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA)?\n\nA) The homeowner uses Alexa to control smart home devices while guests are present\nB) A guest asks Alexa for weather information during their visit\nC) The homeowner and a guest have a private conversation near the device without mentioning Alexa\nD) Alexa mishears a word and activates, recording a few seconds of ambient noise\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because it presents the most likely violation of CIPA. \n\nAccording to the documentation, CIPA prohibits recording conversations without the knowledge or consent of all parties involved. The key points are:\n\n1. Under CIPA, there must be an \"objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded.\"\n2. Consent is crucial, and the documentation states that \"inviting someone into your home unaware of Alexa ear-dropping is a CIPA violation.\"\n3. The homeowner has a responsibility to inform guests about the presence of Alexa and its recording capabilities.\n\nIn scenario C, the guest has no knowledge of Alexa's presence and would have a reasonable expectation of privacy during a private conversation. This lack of informed consent makes it the most likely CIPA violation.\n\nOptions A and B are less likely to violate CIPA because the guest is actively engaging with Alexa, implying awareness of its presence and functionality. \n\nOption D is a tricky distractor because it involves unintentional recording. However, it's less likely to violate CIPA than option C because it's a brief, accidental recording rather than a full private conversation.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about privacy laws, consent, and the responsibilities of smart device owners, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45616/is-there-a-database-containing-all-court-cases-publically-available-in-the-uk-an", "docs_id": 45616, "title": "Is there a database containing all court cases publically available in the UK and or US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a Cyber Security student just starting on a course the depends heavily on the use of court cases that used electronically stored information to determine the verdict of a case. \n\nAre there a few database\\-like resources that would allow me to easily search for such cases? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **U.S. answer only.**\n\n> Are there a few database\\-like resources that would allow me to easily\n>  search for such cases?\n\nIt is balkanized.

In both cases, access to these filings is not free except to parties, and has lots of data with access restricted to parties and the court. Published appellate court decisions are also available at an Internet based source. None of these covers administrative law decisions in Colorado, however.\n\nAdministrative law decisions are usually kept by the agency and also often by a commercial firm that compiles them. Some of them do not give the public access to the decisions in the absence of a FOIA or open records act request.\n\nCommercial firms like Westlaw and LexisNexis and several less well known firms (including a free one run by Cornell University), keep databases of published decisions of appellate courts plus a somewhat random assortment of unpublished decisions, with federal court trial court decisions getting much more heavy coverage than state court trial decisions and unpublished state appellate court decisions.

The correct answer, A, acknowledges that both parties have valid points from different perspectives. The solicitor's position is legally prudent, as proceeding without a clear title for all parts of the property could potentially lead to complications or disputes in the future. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of property law and the importance of clear title.\n\nHowever, the builder's claim of having sold \"hundreds of houses like that\" suggests that this practice, while not ideal from a legal standpoint, is often accepted in the real estate market without causing issues.

I wouldn't even know what an answer to that question would look like.\n\nThere are many guiding principles of interpretation, the starting place of which is to attempt to implement the intent of the legislature (something known as the \"[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule_(law))\" of statutory interpretation in English common law) as expressed in the language of the statute to the extent that no other stronger interpretive principles apply.\n\nBut, basically, it is a problem to be worked out on a case by case basis in cases addressing alleged ambiguities in the meaning of a particular part of a particular statue. Most of the time, there is no ambiguity and so it isn't even recognized as an issue. What is ambiguous is frequently impossible to tell on the face of a statute until you are presented with facts in a case that create a context in which the meaning of a particular phrase or word or grammatical construction is unclear.\n\nStatutory interpretation is a bottom up process in a legal system like India's, not a top down process. Questions arise one case at a time and bubble to the top, the issues aren't foreseen and resolved in advance.\n\nSome of the other canons of interpretation which are buried in case law are to construe statutes in a way that makes them constitutional, to assume that there is not an intent to displace common law rules unless the text or comprehensive nature of a statute suggests otherwise, to give meaning of every part of the statute, to avoid absurd interpretations, and to consider legislative history when the proper interpretation is unclear.\n\nUltimately, statutory interpretation is not a mechanical problem like the order of operations in a mathematics equation.

The Golden Rule of statutory interpretation, which aims to implement the intent of the legislature as expressed in the language of the statute.\n2. The consideration of legislative intent, which is mentioned as a starting point for interpretation.\n3. The use of case law precedents, which the documentation states form a significant part of interpretive guidance in India.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the importance of legislative intent and contextual factors, which are emphasized in the documentation.

But is it legal?\n\nThe [1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness) and the [1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_relating_to_the_Status_of_Stateless_Persons) before it, at least one of which was signed by most major western countries, lay out a framework for reducing statelessness and improving the lives of those who find themselves stateless. One of the core tenets of these treaties, as stated in Article 15 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), is that \"Everyone has the right to a nationality\".\n\nIt is worth noting that the United States is not a party to either of these treaties, and further claims that Hoda Muthana was never a citizen as her father was a diplomat. Further research indicates she was born a month after his diplomatic status ended and there seems to be documentation of her possession of citizenship documents, but that's politics.

Hoda Muthana is, under Yemeni law, a Yemeni citizen (it is immaterial whether she has ever \"accepted\" or exploited it), and as such stripping her of US citizenship would not leave her stateless.\n\nIn the case of Hoda Muthana, the action is based on the legal argument that she was not ever a citizen, based on the premise that her father was a foreign diplomat. Under US law, children born to foreign diplomats in the US are not birthright citizens, following [US v. Wong Kim Ark](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/169/649). Birthright citizenship cannot be revoked.

The 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons aim to reduce statelessness and uphold the right to nationality.\n\n2.

In a scenario where Company A's executives want to implement a major strategic shift in Company B's operations that the CEO of Company B believes is detrimental to the subsidiary's long-term success, what is the most likely mechanism for resolving this conflict?\n\nA) The CEO of Company B can unilaterally reject the strategy, citing operational independence.\nB) Company A's board of directors would directly vote to overrule Company B's CEO.\nC) Company A would exercise its shareholder rights to replace Company B's CEO if necessary.\nD) The regional manager at Company A can directly order Company B's CEO to comply.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex relationship between a parent company and its subsidiary, integrating concepts of corporate governance, shareholder rights, and management hierarchy. The correct answer is C because ultimately, Company A's control over Company B stems from its ownership of all shares. While day-to-day operations might be delegated, major strategic decisions can be enforced through shareholder rights, including the power to replace leadership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Company B has some operational autonomy, it cannot unilaterally reject major strategic decisions from its parent company. Option B is a distractor that confuses the roles of the parent company's board with direct operational control.

Why haven't these people been sued out of existence?\n\n(this does not affect me personally; I have been vaccinated and I am not sick)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Merely encouraging people not to vaccinate via educational and political communication without purporting to provide individualized medical advice is probably not the practice of medicine and protected by the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech, rather than constituting medical malpractice.\n\nAlso, many anti\\-vax individuals (I couldn't quote a percentage) do so out of religious conviction and are protected not just by the freedom of speech in the First Amendment, but also by the free exercise component of the freedom of religion under the First Amendment. Generally speaking, it is harder to find a legal grounds for disregarding the free exercise of religion than it is to find a legal basis to regulate otherwise free speech.\n\nFor example, commercial speech is subject to more rigorous regulation than private political and educational speech, which is why there are no private businesses taking anti\\-vax positions in their advertising.\n\nThe theory is that courts are not in a good position to make general determinations of the truth of policy positions or statements about general truths as opposed to what happened in a particular transaction or occurrence. This is in part because a ruling by the right court at the right time can preclude the correctness of its determination from being revisited indefinitely and from time to time, accepted conventional wisdom and scientific consensus at one time are revealed later on to have been wrong with more discussion and investigation. I think that this is unlikely to be the case in the vaccination area, but the whole point of the First Amendment's protection of these kinds of issues is that we can't know in advance what will continue to be widely accepted and what will turn out to be mistaken. \n\nBut, if someone in a medical diagnosis and treatment profession (e.g. M.D., D.O., physician's assistant, or nurse), were to advise a patient in a capacity as a medical care provider not to vaccinate, and as a result that person's child got sick from a disease that vaccination could have prevented, there probably would be medical malpractice liability.\n\nA somewhat similar issue arises when health insurance companies or government agencies set rules on providing care. In those cases, it isn't uncommon to have a physician or other medical professional placed on a committee or in an office such as medical director, with that person making the call and exposed to liability although not in the same way as a treating medical professional. A [case about a month ago](https://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2019/03/these-practices-by-former-health.html) found malpractice by an insurance company's medical director (the company was United Health) to be a huge liability for both the medical director and the insurance company.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular social media influencer with millions of followers posts content strongly advocating against vaccinations, citing personal beliefs and cherry-picked studies.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the explanation that \"Merely encouraging people not to vaccinate via educational and political communication without purporting to provide individualized medical advice is probably not the practice of medicine and protected by the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the influencer's actions, while potentially harmful, do not constitute medical malpractice as they are not providing individualized medical advice in a professional capacity. Option B is a distractor that combines two separate concepts incorrectly; while practicing medicine without a license is illegal, general anti-vaccination advocacy doesn't typically fall under this category. Option D introduces a plausible-sounding condition that might make the influencer liable, but it oversimplifies the complex legal considerations involved in such cases.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario involving social media, public health, and freedom of speech.

If they are not, how could a poorly\\-defended case be prevented from setting a terrible jurisprudence precedent ? Final question, is there a difference between how these rules bind judges and justices (i.e in Courts of Appeals vs in the Supreme Court) ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: David Siegel's answer correctly explains how appellate courts consider laws and arguments not addressed in the courts below. To clarify on the comparison to the Court of Cassation, though:\n\nA trial court is generally limited to considering the facts that are properly introduced by the parties, though a court may also take \"judicial notice\" of certain facts that are highly unlikely to be disputed.\n\nOn review, courts of appeal are generally limited to facts supported by the evidence in the trial\\-court record, though they may also take judicial notice of other facts. A party is generally unable to introduce new evidence during an appeal.\n\nIt is not correct that an appellate court will not review factual determinations, as those reviews probably happen in more cases than not. But \\-\\- just as with legal determinations \\-\\- those reviews can happen with varying levels of deference.\n\nFor instance, if a case is tried to a jury, an appellate court will be exceedingly deferential to the jury's factual determinations, on the theory that the jury is best positioned to evaluate the evidence, gauge credibility, make reasonable inferences, etc. A judge who makes a factual determination based on in\\-court testimony will enjoy a similar measure of deference.\n\nBut if a court makes a factual determination based only on documents submitted in support of a motion, or otherwise lacks an opportunity to evaluate a witness in person, the appellate court will be more open to different interpretations of the evidence.\n\nLegal determinations are likewise subject to varying levels of deference.\n\nAt one end is the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard. If a trial court determines that evidence is admissible or inadmissible, for instance, an appellate court will apply the abuse\\-of\\-discretion standard, which (to oversimplify) asks not whether the ruling was incorrect under the controlling law, but whether the ruling was reached without regard to the controlling law.\n\nOn the other end is *de novo* review, in which the appellate court gives virtually no deference to the trial court and undertakes its own independent legal analysis.\n\nPerhaps even more deferential is plain\\-error review, which asks (to oversimplify) whether the trial court's error is so apparent that it barely needs to be debated.

The correct answer (C) acknowledges that appellate courts, especially the Supreme Court, have broader latitude in considering legal sources not explicitly raised by the parties. As stated in the documentation, \"a US court of appeals and the Supreme Court work like the french Court of Cassation, in that it only (re)judges questions of law, and not questions of facts.\" This allows justices to introduce relevant legal precedents or historical context, even if not raised in lower courts.\n\nHowever, the answer also recognizes the potential controversy of this approach, as it touches on the question of \"what is the limit on how judges can do the parties' job, inventing their legal arguments for them?\" This reflects the real-world tension between judicial discretion and the adversarial nature of the legal system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the limitations on appellate courts.

Softklone Distributing Corp.*, 659 F.Supp. 449 (N.D. Ga. 1987\\). In this case, the Defendant \"oftklone intentionally set out to \"clone\" or copy the functionality and interface of the popular program *Crosstalk XVI* (I was a user of thwt program many years ago).

The defendants have never contended that they could not have arranged the parameters/commands in a wide variety of patterns without hampering the operation of their program.\n\nand found copyright infringement on that basis.\n\nSection 310 of [*Copyrightable Authorship:\nWhat Can Be Registered*](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf) by the US Copyright office, says:\n\n> The U.S. Copyright Office will not consider the so\\-called \u201clook and feel\u201d of a work.

The more one copies interface elements and choices from a specific source, the stronger the case for infringement is. Using elements and choices that have become common industry practice in multiple works froim multiple developers and companies is probably safe. Clearly and extensively imitating the visual appearance and interface of a single specific work of software might well be infringement.\n\nOne would be wise to consult a lawyer with experience in copyright law, and specifically \"look and feel\" issues, beforign publishing such a work of software.\n\nThis issue is discussed extensively in [*Look And Feel In Computer Software*](https://www.computerlaw.com/articles/look-and-feel-in-computer-software) (1993\\) by Jack Russo \\& Jamie Nafziger, published by Computerlaw Group LLP, which seems to be a law firm specializing in computer law.\n\n[*The Law of Look and Feel*](https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/90_529.pdf) by Peter Lee (Professor of Law and Chancellor\u2019s Fellow, University of California, Davis.) \\& Madhavi Sunder (Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of Law, University of California, Davis.) is a 60\\-page law review article dealing with this topic.

Therefore, I am going to speculate.\n\nIf there is a single choice between overall \"themes\" or \"shells\" and one of them imitates the interface from a protected program without permission, that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped with that interface. It might or might not be infringement, depending on the details, as discussed above.\n\nIf there are many settings, but the program is shipped with instructions advising a combination of settings that imitate another interface (or the developer or distributor provides such advice to users), that would probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration. If the developer provides a few preset configuration files which control these interface settings, and one such file results in settings that imitate another interface, that would also probably be legally the same as if the program shipped in that configuration.\n\nIf there are many settings and there is no particular guidance or advice to a user on what combination to use, nor any predefined settings file, but users must discover (if they choose) a group of settings which imitate another interface, that is probably not infringement.\n\nI repeat that this section of the answer is based on general principals, but not on specific case law, nor on specific legal scholarship, and a court faced with this issue might rule otherwise.

Each witness is direct examined, then cross\\-examined (there is also a period of re\\-direct and re\\-cross). Each level can only ask questions related to those brought up in the prior questioning line (Cross can only ask questions about direct. Re\\-Direct can only ask about Cross.

It sounds like you've already asked them to remove the posts and they refused, so at this point you do not seem to have any procedural recourse with Facebook.

This is not what's at question here. At question here is the arrangement in which public IPs are masked by presenting traffic to site operators as appearing to originate from the veneer IPs of the VPN operators.\n\nThis allows (for example) users in a country A to route their traffic through a commercial VPN operator in a country B and access services in country B which are restricted to users from country A. This can be used to subvert both intellectual property restrictions on traffic and legal restrictions that site operators attempt to enforce by geography\\-based restrictions.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem that it would not be impossible to track all veneer IPs and identify them as such publicly. So a knee\\-jerk response to this question might be \"there is no need for such a law.\" However, while it may be possible to track all IPs used by a commercial operator of a VPN which engages *exclusively* in VPN business, it is not possible to track all IPs dedicated to VPN business by an operator which has many other forms of business.\n\nSo, for example, NordVPN's IPs can be identified as belonging to NordVPN, but IBM's or Google's IPs cannot be identified as used exclusively in their VPN business.\n\nSince there is a public policy interest (mentioned in the 3rd paragraph of this question) in knowing which IPs are VPN veneer IPs, Congress may decide to require commercial VPN operators to register those veneer IPs in a way which would make them clearly distinguishable from non\\-veneer IPs used by the same entities.\n\nWould that be constitutional?

The correct answer is B, as it presents the strongest potential constitutional challenge to the proposed legislation.\n\nWhile the law would likely be constitutional overall, the First Amendment protection of anonymous speech provides the most viable argument against it.

The car wasn't going too fast (est. 40mph) but essentially turned the corner without indicating and was not looking at the road. After shouting at my wife (who was alone at the time) the man got back in his car and drove away. My wife called a friend from work (she was only 2 minutes outside) and they helped her to the A\\&E (probably another 2 minutes away luckily). My wife was seen by the doctors, notes were made, tests were done but she was released later that day. We called the police to report it and were told a police officer would come to our house to take a statement, but we were later called back and told we would have to come to a station and give a statement (at the time I mentioned it might be a while since my wife was in need of recovery). When we eventually got to the station to give our statement we were told we were too late, (it was about 10 weeks after). Before going to the station I had believed the 'case' had been opened but they were just waiting for my wife's statement to continue with it; the officer at the station told us that there was nothing they could do since any cameras near the scene of the hit and run wouldn't have their footage any more.\n\nThis was a let down, but the primary concern at the time was my wife's health \\- aside from being wheelchair bound by the incident she was also experiencing unexplained losses of consciousness. The long and short of this is a diagnostic process thay took years to identify a neurological condition that causes her to have 'episodes' of paralysis or loss of consciousness, among other conditions caused by the incident. Needless to say both my wife and I haven't been able to work since the incident \\- although I am officially her career and we recieve state benefits (PIP, carers allowance).\n\nA little over a year ago one of my wife's doctors said there was a government scheme that handles things like hit and run compensation even if the driver was not caught, but unfortunately this has a 2 year timescale on it and we're outside of that.\n\nIt has just occured to me that I never found out when the 2 year counter starts from \\- is it the date of the accident?

These bases now lie there, waiting for someone to discover them.\n\nMy question is: who becomes the owner of the ancient alien bases once they're are discovered? Is it the person or country that discovered them, the Antarctic Treaty signatories, or the aliens themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Antarctic Treaty doesn't establish ownership or sovereignty\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle IV of the [Antarctic Treaty](https://documents.ats.aq/ats/treaty_original.pdf) makes clear that the Treaty is *not* a renunciation by any contracting party of any basis of claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. And \"\\[n]o acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica or create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica.\"\n\nSo, while the Antarctic Treaty establishes an arrangement for cooperative shared use of the areas, it is not about sovereignty or ownership.\n\nTerritorial claims\n------------------\n\nThere are (were) however [territorial claims to various areas of Antarctica](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/law-and-treaty/history/antarctic-territorial-claims/). These have not been resolved at international law.\n\nWho owns the centre of the earth?\n---------------------------------\n\nA traditional common\\-law property rule is that ownership extends to the center of the earth (see generally, John G. Sprankling, \"[Owning the Center of the Earth](https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/facultyarticles/131/)\"). Sprankling notes that this was never taken literally until after it was introduced by Blackstone and argues that its time is near an end. But in any case, I think the correct starting point is that the owner of the surface owns what's underneath, at least to an extent.\n\nWho owns the alien bases, and what would that mean?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying Earth law, ownership of the alien bases would be disputed among those nations who are willing to assert territorial claims to the surface under which the alien bases are found. However, if these bases are cultural heritage property (which their age suggests they might be), the 1970 [UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property](https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural) could prevent the import, export, or transfer of any of the material from the bases. The \"owning\" country (if that is ever resolved) might have obligations under international law to preserve the bases. Further, if the dispute over the property results in armed conflict, the competing states could have obligations under the [1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict](https://en.unesco.org/protecting-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-convention) to avoid damaging the cultural property.\n\nIs Earth law the applicable law?\n--------------------------------\n\nIf we take this hypothetical at face value, it implies we are not alone and in relationship with other extra\\-terrestrial culture(s).

United States 470 U.S. 598 (1985\\)\n\n> In our criminal justice system, the Government retains \"broad discretion\" as to whom to prosecute. \\[...] This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill\\-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.\n\nDoes this mean that the courts can/will *never* challenge \"decision to prosecute\"?\n\n(Again, I am interested in **theory** and **logic** more than practicality).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A sufficient explanation would be that the ticketed driver was caught and the unticketed driver was not because the officer was already responding to a situation. Had the officer caught the unticketed driver, he would have ticketed him for the same offense. Courts would accept that it would be impossible for the officer to deal with both offenses at the same time.\n\nSelective enforcement is done properly when the prosecutor evaluates the risk verses reward of perusing a criminal prosecution against an individual based on the evidence, the nature of the crime, and the likely\\-hood of a conviction if it goes to trial. For example, while using illict substances is a crime, the government will usually only prosecute on that charge if they find your use while in possession with intent to sell (or in connection to another crime). In this instant, the high school stoner is not going to be as instrumental in the case as the dealer, who can lead to suppliers if he cooperates OR is removed from distributing in his territory if he does not.\n\nIf the stoner is picked up on a minor offense and carrying a small amount on his person, the police might arrest him for the crime but agree to not press charges if he gives them information to who the dealer who sold him the substance is. Again, the risk here is putting a small time criminal into jail at cost of society, when society would benefit more if that cell was housing the bigger fish (a criminal record can prevent getting certain jobs, which will more likely turn stoner high schooler into jobless loser, which would be a drain on public welfare in and of itself, and that's not including the possibility that joining in drug trafficking as a seller would fix his lack of income).\n\nConversely, in cases such as espionage, the death penalty is on the books but is rarely pursued in favor of lesser sentences. Here, the pay off is that they dangle the death penalty over the spies head unless he tells them about all his spying activities, which benefits the spy agency in filling in security gaps and potentially finding more spies.\n\nThe use of lighter charges in exchange for a guilty plea is also favored as trials are costly. If a criminal pleads guilty to a crime that the government has them dead to rights for, the prosecution will reward them with lighter offenses for saving their office the price tag of a full blown trial.\n\nAll this is on condition that selective enforcement is not used as a basis of discrimination, which is illegal for the prosecutors to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about selective enforcement and equal protection, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A city implements a new policy to combat jaywalking, but a defense attorney argues it violates the Equal Protection Clause.

While all options show some form of selective enforcement, option B is most likely to succeed in challenging the policy's constitutionality.\n\nThe key here is that racial discrimination is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause, requiring strict scrutiny. If the attorney can demonstrate a pattern of enforcement correlated with racial demographics, it suggests potential racial discrimination, which would be very difficult for the government to justify.\n\nOption A, while concerning, would likely face intermediate scrutiny (wealth not being a suspect class), making it harder to challenge successfully.

Sometimes laws are enforced less harshly as a matter of law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial discretion against the rich, famous and powerful, than the poor, but they are **subject to the same laws** and the authorities have the same power to enforce those laws against a celebrity or other rich or powerful person, as they do against anyone else.\n\nMost criminal laws provide that factors such as whether someone is gainfully employed, whether they pay restitution for an offense, and whether someone has otherwise good character and be considered as grounds for leniency in sentencing someone for a crime of which that person is convicted, so that can systemically benefit such people at sentencing. \n\nAlso, the famous, rich and powerful may be seen as particularly credible in a trial by jurors.\n\nThey may be able to afford and support highly competent and exhaustively thorough legal representation, while the poor often get an overworked public defender with very little time or resources to devote to their case, or only a very inexpensive private criminal defense lawyer who similarly has limited resources and is rarely the most highly competent person in the field. \n\nSimilarly, the rich and famous can typically more easily be released on bail or on a personal recognizance bond pending trial, and being at large, rather than in jail, prior to being convicted, greatly reduces the pressure to plead guilty, the harm caused by the charge if there is an acquittal, and the ability of the defendant to mount a defense to a charge.\n\nBut, that doesn't change the fact that the same law applies to everyone, although this too has some bias inherent in it, as this famous aphorism illustrates:\n\n> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the\n>  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal\n>  bread.\n\n\\-\\- Anatole France (16 April 1844 \u2013 12 October 1924\\), born Jacques Anatole Fran\u00e7ois Thibault, a French poet, journalist, and novelist, in *Le Lys Rouge* \\[The Red Lily] (1894\\), ch. 7 (In the original French, the quote is \"*La majestueuse \u00e9galit\u00e9 des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain.*\").\n\nAnatole France's point is true for somewhat deeper than the somewhat flip expression of the idea in this famous quotation suggests. \n\nAs a general rule, economic harms to others that people who cause them can usually remedy by actually being able to pay money as a result of a judgment in a civil lawsuit, are usually not defined as crimes.

Basically, the concept here is that doing nothing will possibly result in the total destruction of the body/evidence.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In this specific scenario, not only is it not a crime, failure to do so is a breach of proper maritime protocols and could be illegal.\n\nA person manning a boat and sees a human in water in distress should immediately go to the rescue or recovery of the victim. This is commonly started by the crewman of the vessel who spots the body shouting \"Man overboard\" once... which triggers every crewman on the deck to also shout the same thing exactly once regardless of if they can see the man who is overboard (The idea is that the call is so all crew on the deck are not announcing the sighting but responding that they know there's an emergency situation in progress... and to muster to the appropriate situations). The boat's helmsman or pilot will then proceed to maneuver to recover the body in the water and bring it onboard the boat, (if traveling by sail, to then as soon as possible transfer to a motor powered vessel or to land which ever is quicker).\n\nAdditionally, should the boat have radio communication, the situation should trigger a mayday communication which will alert other vessels, regardless of purpose and local emergency services to the situation, with GPS tracking aiding all responders. Typically while underway at sea or in large bodies of water, all operators of watercraft are required to respond, regardless of actual purpose on the water (recall the famous \"Miracle on the Hudson\" incident where New York Ferry Operators were the actual first responders to get ALL passengers and crew off the crashed plane to land, where EMS and police services were waiting to deal with the survivors). Most boating licenses these days require a basic understanding of duties with maritime safety and if you come upon a situation while underway, you are a first responder automatically.\n\nRemove the question of water and say that there is person who you are unsure of if they are alive or dead on dry land. Under law, you cannot be held liable for anything you do in the course of saving a life so long as you are acting within your competency to do so, and do not take actions you are not licensed to do as part of training, oversight, and regulations dictate, you cannot be sued for medical injuries inflicted on someone in the course of saving their life (called \"Life over Limb\"... that if the only way to save an unconscious person from death is to amputate a limb, you're not liable for cutting off the limb in question, so long as you are trained to do this. To a lesser extreme example, if CPR is performed right, you will break the victims ribs... since it's a question of keeping the person alive, the temporary pain and handicap of broken ribs is seen as acceptable).\n\nAs a lifeguard (for pools, I wasn't certified for \"wilderness lifeguarding\" but the differences in this respect were minimum) your first thing to do when getting in the water to fish out a swimmer in distress was to get them back to the pool deck before life efforts could occur (there are a few times where you had to start the life saving efforts in water, but I can count them on one hand, and one of those incidents was only after confirming your victim was conscious and even then you still were moving to get them out of the water asap... it's just asap would be a little bit longer. We also weren't trained to pronounce death. If it was so serious that CPR starts, you do not stop unless another guard or EMS relieve you.).\n\nIn these situations, there is proper evidence gathering procedures that will be used to establish what happened. For example, the first responders will be fingerprinted and prints in the areas touched for life saving efforts will be noted as part of the evidence. Additionally, paramedics, EMS and first responders will often alert police to any items of note they saw around the victim that were disturbed in the process of life saving efforts. The police may collect evidence from you to rule you out as a suspect (by showing the evidence on the body was consistent with applied life saving techniques) and to identify evidence not related to you at all (a pink fiber on the body that doesn't match any of your clothes means the body came into contact with the fibers from another source).\n\nThis also establishes \"Chain of Custody\" when you call the body in and stay with it and allow minimum contact with it (many larger ships will store the body in a locked room to keep crew and passenger contact to a minimum). Either way, so long as you tell the police everything you did in rescue and recovery, this isn't tampering with evidence on the face of it. If something that is inconsistent with your story comes up, it's not necessarily incriminating either... in the heat of the moment in a rescue and recovery effort, tunnel vision can form and you aren't expect to recall everything you did.

If you signed a contract with bank A with a certain interest rate, bank A can sell that contract to bank B, but neither A nor B can change the terms (e.g. increase the interest charge). There might be some sketchy clause in the contract that you did sign which they think allows that to change the terms unilaterally under some condition (e.g. \"we reserve the right to sell thig contract to a third parts who may increase the interest by X amount\"), but such a clause would most likely violate law recarding unlawful acts in car sales (example from [Washington state](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180)).

A neighbor kid, who lives about 3/4 of a mile from me, and I are training a team of oxen. We walk them on their leads along the road a couple of time a week. There are no houses between my house and the neighbor's. Since only one or two vehicles go by during our walk, often none, we can hear any vehicles from about half a mile away. When we hear a vehicle approaching, we get the team as close to the side of the road as possible, and hold them still. There is no shoulder, one side of the road goes up a hill and the other side down a steep bank to a creek, about 50 feet below road level.

He drives a big, double cab diesel pick\\-up. We can hear him coming, and can tell that he changes how he drives as soon as he sees us, speeding up and heading straight for us. The speed limit is not posted, but is technically 50 mph, although no part of the road is appropriate for that speed. Most drivers go about 30\\-35 mph. I don't know the driver, since he's never stopped to talk.\nMy question is what can be done about this rude, dangerous, intimidating driving, short of not using the road for walking.

Excluding the question of geographic location, the hereditary nature of citizenship seems to be in glaring contrast to other U.S. founding ideals. In Ancient Rome, for instance, being a citizen was more akin to being a nobleman. Similar to our current system, Romans could earn citizenship through service \\- usually militarily. Given that citizenship carries so much weight and is clearly hereditary in the U.S., why is it not considered as a title of nobility? While it does not indicate a British rank, it certainly indicates social rank. If all men are created equal, then why should this distinction exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The granting of citizenship is expressly recognized in multiple places in the US Constitution. It would be incoherent if the prohibition on titles of nobility meant that the US could not confer citizenship on people. It would also be totally out of sync with any public understanding of \"titles of nobility\" at the time of the framing or today.\n\nThe US has conferred citizenship by parentage to children born abroad since 1790, which is further indication that the nobility clause was not understood to preclude citizenship by parentage.\n\nThe concern behind the nobility clauses was the creation of \"super\\-citizens.\" As [Joseph Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Story) wrote in his [*Commentaries on the Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States) at [Vol. 3, p. 215](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the/Am152G8mqiUC?hl=fr&gbpv=1&pg=PA215&printsec=frontcover):\n\n> \\[the nobility clause] seems scarcely to require even a passing notice. As a perfect equality is the basis of all our institutions, state and national, the prohibition against the creation of any titles of nobility seems proper, if not indespensible, to keep perpetually alive a just sense of this important truth. *Distinctions between citizens*, in regard to rank, would soon lay the foundation of odious claims and privileges, and silently subvert the spirit of independence and personal dignity, which are so often proclaimed to be the best security of a republican government.\n\nHe cited [Federalist No. 84](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493491), in which Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n> Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner\\-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\n\nThe worry was that titles of nobility would undermine the republican system of government.\n\nI also question your premise that citizenship is \"clearly hereditary in the U.S.\" As you say, the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those merely born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction.

The correct answer, D, best captures the core distinction between citizenship and titles of nobility as understood in U.S. constitutional law.\n\nThe key point is that the prohibition on titles of nobility was aimed at preventing the creation of \"super-citizens\" that would undermine the republican system of government.

All citizens, whether by birth or naturalization, have equal status under the law, which aligns with the republican ideals of the Constitution.\n\nOption A, while partially true, doesn't fully explain why citizenship is fundamentally different from nobility.

Which of the following best describes the legal and ethical considerations in this scenario?\n\nA) The sitter is legally entitled to the full payment but ethically obligated to refund a portion\nB) The owner is legally entitled to a partial refund based on services not rendered\nC) The sitter can keep the full payment both legally and ethically due to contract frustration\nD) The security company is liable for the difference in payment due to their interference\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal and ethical considerations. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Legal aspect: The sitter can likely keep the full payment legally. This is because she was ready and willing to perform the agreed-upon services, but was prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond her control (contract frustration). The sitter may have turned down other opportunities, which strengthens her claim to the full payment.\n\n2. Ethical aspect: While it might seem unfair for the sitter to keep the full payment for partial service, she was prepared to fulfill the entire contract and likely incurred opportunity costs. The frustration of the contract was not her fault, which ethically justifies retaining the payment.\n\n3. Contract principles: In contract law, when performance becomes impossible due to external factors, the doctrine of frustration often applies. This can release both parties from their obligations, but doesn't necessarily require a refund of prepayments.\n\n4. Lack of damages: The pet owner didn't suffer actual damages, as the dog was cared for by her mother. This weakens any potential legal claim for a refund.\n\n5. Security company liability: While the security company's actions led to the situation, they likely have liability waivers in place, making it difficult to pursue them for the difference.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they misstate the legal position. Option D is incorrect because, while the security company's actions caused the issue, they are unlikely to be held liable due to probable liability waivers.

The correct answer, B, reflects the nuanced distinction between gag orders on trial participants and those on the press. Gag orders on parties to a trial (like in the Michael Jackson case) are generally considered constitutional as they serve the compelling interest of ensuring a fair trial by preventing potential juror bias.

At least not fully and not via a corporate structure.\n\nIt is fundamental that entities cannot change their liability to third parties without the consent of the third parties (subject to specific statutory exceptions like the priority afforded secured creditors vis\\-a\\-vis unsecured creditors, and the limited liability concept itself).\n\nSo, if a \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is negligent, nothing in your corporate structure can relieve that worker from liability. This is true without regard to whether the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is an employee or an independent contractor, although, in practice, it is less common to sue an employee than to sue an independent contractor. You can pay for construction defect liability insurance and comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance for them, but they can still be sued and will still have primarily liability.\n\nIn general, absent a direct contractual arrangement to the contrary, a \"mason\" will not have negligence liability for work done by a \"carpenter\" and vis\\-a\\-versa. \n\nOf course, it is often impossible to prevent both from being made parties to a lawsuit for defective work, because the question of whose work caused the problem is often a factual one that isn't clear until an exhaustive investigation by experts has been done. Often both will be sued at the outset and some who are determined to be not at fault or only minimally at fault will be dismissed voluntarily, or with token settlements, as investigations during the course of the litigation reveal who was really at fault.\n\nNow, if you have a contractual relationship with a third party, say the person who is hiring the general contractor, the contract between the person hiring the general contractor and the general contractor can contractually waive the liability of the general contractor and/or the liability of the subcontractor, for ordinary negligence (but not for intentional conduct of a subcontractor since such waivers are contrary to public policy), and can relieve the subcontractors of contractual liability to the person hiring the general contractor.\n\nThis is all a consequence of the contract between the general contractor and the person hiring the general contractor, however, and really has nothing to do with the corporate structure of the general contractor vis\\-a\\-vis the subcontractor.\n\nYou cannot limit the liability of the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" for harm to persons with whom there is no contractual relationship. For example, suppose that the mason negligently nicks a natural gas line causing an explosion that kills a dozen people who just work in the building and destroys the building. The individual mason and the individual mason's firm, will have liability to the people killed which could not have been limited contractually, although it could be insured against. This is true even if the mason's firm is incorporated, although, if the mason's firm is incorporated, only the person who actually did the work and the firm will have liability, not the co\\-workers of the person who did the work or passive investors in the firm.\n\nHowever, if the mason intentionally engaged in sabotage directed at the natural gas line, with an intent to harm the person who hired the general contractor or anyone else, any contractual waiver of liability in favor of the mason would be void and the mason's insurance policy would not cover the loss (and would not be allowed to cover the loss as a matter of public policy). On the other hand, if the victims of the sabotage had insurance to cover this kind of event, their insurance policies could cover their losses.\n\nIn the other direction, a pre\\-dispute waiver of a subcontractor's right to file a mechanic's lien against the person hiring the general contractor, is usually not permitted for any reason other than payments of the amounts owed to the subcontractor, as a matter of public policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A general contractor is planning to restructure their business to include specialized divisions for masonry and carpentry.

While this doesn't eliminate all potential liability, it offers the best protection within legal constraints.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on misconceptions about corporate structures. Such an arrangement would likely be seen as an attempt to evade liability and could be disregarded by courts.\n\nThe explanation in the documentation that \"you can pay for construction defect liability insurance and comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance for them\" supports the viability of option C, while also acknowledging that workers can still be sued and have primary liability for their actions."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79778/does-throwing-eggs-at-a-vehicle-violate-any-laws", "docs_id": 79778, "title": "Does throwing eggs at a vehicle violate any law(s)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The People's Convoy egged in Oakland, CA as they protest by Buffy Wicks neighborhood\n\n[https://youtu.be/P5Wmh2Hu\\_24?t\\=238](https://youtu.be/P5Wmh2Hu_24?t=238)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [California Vehicle Code 23100](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=23110) asserts\n\n> (a) Any person who throws any substance at a vehicle or any occupant thereof on a highway is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n> (b) Any person who with intent to do great bodily injury maliciously and willfully throws or projects any rock, brick, bottle, metal or other missile, or projects any other substance capable of doing serious bodily harm at such vehicle or occupant thereof is guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.\n\nSo at the minimum this is a misdemeanor offense. It could be a felony if the accused is found to have intended to do great bodily injury, and that an egg (or whatever else they threw) was capable of it.

And the Sixth Amendment entitles a federal criminal defendant to a trial by jurors living in the state and district where the crime was committed. But if someone committed a crime in the uninhabited Idaho portion of Yellowstone, Kalt surmised, it would be impossible to form a jury. And being federal land, the state would have no jurisdiction.\n\nThe part about the state having no jurisdiction is something I wouldn't have guessed. It is, after all, within a state, and murder trials are usually not held in federal courts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article III, Section 2 of The Constitution requires that\n\n> The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\n>  jury; and such **trial shall be held in the state** where the said crimes\n>  shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state,\n>  the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law\n>  have directed\n\nSince the Idaho portion of Yellowstone is part of the state of Idaho and is not part of a non\\-state, ergo the trial shall be held in Idaho, according to The Constitution.\n\nOne jurisdictional statute, [16 USC 24](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/24), says \n\n> The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined, or\n>  as they may be hereafter defined or extended, shall be under the sole\n>  and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. All the laws\n>  applicable to places under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the\n>  United States, shall have force and effect in said park. *Nothing in\n>  this Act shall be construed to forbid the service in the park of any\n>  civil or criminal process of any court having jurisdiction in the\n>  States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming*. All fugitives from justice\n>  taking refuge in said park shall be subject to the same laws as\n>  refugees from justice found in the State of Wyoming.\n\nSo the crime would be a federal matter. I put emphasis on a sentence that doesn't have a straightforward interpretation. There is another jurisdictional statute [28 USC 131](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/131), the problematic one, which states:\n\n> Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in\n>  Montana and Idaho constitute one judicial district.\n> \n> \n> Court shall be held at Casper, Cheyenne, Evanston, Lander, Jackson,\n>  and Sheridan.\n\nTherefore, the crime must be tried in Wyoming. Moreover, the judicial district of Wyoming also includes that unoccupied portion of the park in Idaho. This statute conflicts with Article III, Section 2, which requires court to be held in Idaho. Since The Constitution has precedence over federal statutes, the instruction to hold court in Wyoming is unconstitutional. \n\nThe 6th Amendment does not pose a particular problem, with its requirement that\n\n> the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an\n>  impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have\n>  been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained\n>  by law\n\nsince the jury could be of Idahoans, and transported to Wyoming \u2013 the 6th addresses the nature of the jury, not the location of the trial.\n\nIt is an open question what the 6th Amendment refers to in talking of \"state and district\", since district is not defined at a constitutional level. The only district with constitutional stature is the District of Columbia, which is not a state, and therefore there could be no \"state and district\" if we mean \"district, as specifically mentioned in The Constitution\". The [Judiciciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) first created federal judiciary districts, signed by Washington on September 24, 1789, and the 6th Amendment was passed by Congress the next day. It is reasonable to assume that this is what they meant by \"district\".\n\n28 USC 131 does say that all of Wyoming plus a sliver of Idaho are a judicial district, so one could have a jury composed of citizens of Wyoming which satisfies the \"jury of the district\" requirement, but that would not satisfy the \"jury of the state\" requirement. If anyone lived in that area, those people could constitute a \"jury of the state and district\", but you would still have a clash between the statutory and constitutional requirements for venue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A crime is committed in the uninhabited Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park. Given the complex jurisdictional issues at play, what is the most likely legal scenario that would unfold?\n\nA) The case would be tried in a federal court in Wyoming with a jury from Wyoming, as per 28 USC 131.\n\nB) The case would be tried in an Idaho state court, as the crime occurred within Idaho's geographical boundaries.\n\nC) The case would face a constitutional challenge, likely resulting in a trial in a federal court in Idaho with an Idaho jury.\n\nD) The perpetrator would effectively escape prosecution due to the impossibility of forming a constitutionally valid jury.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex interplay between constitutional requirements and federal statutes. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution requires that the trial be held in the state where the crime was committed (Idaho in this case).\n\n2. The 6th Amendment requires a jury from the state and district where the crime was committed.\n\n3. 28 USC 131 places all of Yellowstone (including portions in Idaho and Montana) in Wyoming's judicial district, conflicting with the constitutional requirements.\n\n4. Given this conflict, the constitutional provisions would take precedence over the federal statute.\n\n5. A constitutional challenge would likely arise, arguing that 28 USC 131 is unconstitutional as applied to this specific scenario.\n\n6. The most probable resolution would be to hold the trial in a federal court in Idaho (as it's federal land) with an Idaho jury, satisfying both constitutional requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it follows 28 USC 131, it violates constitutional requirements. Option B is wrong because the crime occurred on federal land, outside state jurisdiction. Option D, while provocative, is unlikely given that courts would likely find a constitutional solution rather than allow a \"zone of lawlessness.\"\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, analysis of conflicting laws, and application to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "96": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14266/is-direct-voting-of-bills-laws-by-the-people-allowed-in-the-consitutionus", "docs_id": 14266, "title": "Is direct voting of bills/laws by the people allowed in the consitution(US)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm talking big issues like the recent vote by the British vote to exist EU.

The cost of litigation and public relations risk associated with suing an ex\\-employee are major reasons not to sue for these losses.

The first question is what (or who) is actually being sanctioned, second who is impacted by the sanction, third what is the specific sanction? There are a variety of different types of sanctions, sanctions against the state, businesses, people, etc. Most sanctions for example are against specific people, or conduct like investment or movement of capital, not necessarily the purchase of goods. I go into further discussion below, but for the **quicker answer to your specific question**, unless the person you are buying from is directly sanctioned or the subject of sanctions, or the entities specifically involved in the sale of goods (export company, vessel, etc) are directly sanctioned (or Russian companies operated in Crimea), yes it would be legal to purchase. So yes, unless the specific item you are buying/ entity you are buying it from is specifically sanctioned it would be legal, it is not particularly common for sanctions to prohibit the purchase of goods by consumers, unless there is a unique circumstance.\n\nHere is the 2\\-3 page overview of U.S. sanctions on Russia: [https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779\\.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779.pdf)\n\nAs to the further discussion.
