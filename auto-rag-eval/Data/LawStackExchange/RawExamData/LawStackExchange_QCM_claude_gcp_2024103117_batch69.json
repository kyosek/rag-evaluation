If this is truly the case, then there is no sexual assault.\n\nBut I don't think you meant to say this. As I explain below, in order to consent, A must not have been mistaken about the identity of B: A could not have thought that B was C. If she was mistaken, as you assert in the title and in the second paragraph, then she was not consenting at law in Canada.\n\nThus, I will assume you have used \"consent\" more colloquially, and move on to assess the scenario in which A merely \"consented\" in the sense that she was not physically or otherwise coerced into the physical acts.\n\n### Can mistaken identity result in sexual assault? Yes\n\nIn your scenario, where A thought B was C, the *actus reus* of sexual assault has occured: sexual touching without A's subjective consent. This is because consent is linked to the identity of the partner (see *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17800/index.do) at para. 88\\).\n\nSee also *R. v. Hutchinson*, [2014 SCC 19 at para. 57\\-58, 63](https://canlii.ca/t/g62cv#par57):\n\n> **a complainant\u2019s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner** or the sexual nature of the act \u2014 whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception \u2014 **will result in no consent** under s. 273\\.1(1\\) of the Criminal Code.\"\n\n> ... if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with B\n\n> ... the Ontario Court of Appeal in *R. v. G.C.*, [2010 ONCA 451](https://canlii.ca/t/2b6nr), 266 O.A.C. 299, leave to appeal refused, \\[2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach and held that the complainant\u2019s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the \u201csexual activity in question\u201d under s. 273\\.1 of the Criminal Code. (See also *R. v. O.A.*, [2013 ONCA 581](https://canlii.ca/t/g0qcv), 310 O.A.C. 305\\.)\n\nSince A was mistaken about the identity of the partner, there was no consent.\n\nB may very well have a defence available: mistaken belief in communicated consent (*R. v. Barton*). This defence asserts that the accused did not possess the *mens rea* of sexual assault (which is knowing of the lack of consent, or being reckless as to the lack of consent). This defence asserts that, despite A not consenting, B believed that A did consent. This was the attempted defence in *G.C.* and *O.A.*, cited above.\n\nFor this defence to be successful, B's belief in A's communicated consent must be based on reasonable steps taken by B to ascertain consent. Whether the steps taken by B were reasonable depends on what was known to B at the time.\n\n> the accused must take steps that are objectively reasonable, and the reasonableness of those steps must be assessed in light of the circumstances known to the accused at the time\n\nIn your scenario, you have not asserted that there is anything *known to B* about \"similar facial characteristics \\[he shares] with A's boyfriend.\" However\n\n* if it is well\\-known to B that he looks like C, and\n* depending on how similar the features are, and\n* depending on what B knew about A's ability to discern the difference between B and C\n\nthis might put an obligation on B to affirmatively confirm with crystal clear language that A knows that B is not C, failing which, he would not have the defence of mistaken belief in communicated consent. For example, in *G.C.* (the identical\\-twin case), \"\\[t]he trial judge recited the relevant facts of that night known to the appellant and concluded that without doing more than he did to make his identity perfectly clear to the complainant, the appellant could not be said to have taken reasonable steps necessary to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.\"\n\n---\n\nAnticipating comments that will always come up about evidence: this answer intentionally skips over questions like \"how would you prove X in court.\" This answer only says what the law is and what would have to be proven.

However, B may have a defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent. This defense depends on whether B took reasonable steps to ascertain consent, considering what B knew about the similarity in appearance to C and A's ability to distinguish between them. The correct answer acknowledges both the presence of the actus reus and the potential for a defense, depending on B's actions and knowledge of the circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because consent in law requires correct identification of the partner. Option B overstates the strength of B's defense without considering the specific circumstances. Option C is too absolute, ignoring the possibility of a valid defense.

The change being discussed is actually a change in how economists and corporate law theorists think about corporations. \n\nThe basics of corporate law did not change significantly in the 1970s. There were some minor changes starting to take place then in law and practice, however. \n\nThe most notable of these were the rise of insider trading laws with real bite, the innovation in financial practice of the leveraged buy\\-out which precipitated \"poison pill\" defense from board of directors, and the surge in CEO pay often in the form of stock options. \n\nThere has been a shift in perspective and framing of the issues, but these changes are not huge changes in corporate law *per se*. Legal decisions allowing \"poison pills\" were minor anti\\-shareholder rights innovations. Tax laws encouraging stock option compensation were minor shareholder value oriented innovations. The theoretical basis of insider trading laws is a doctrinal muddle. No one conception of the corporation is completely dominant today and drives all legal theory and policy decisions.\n\nSecondly, Lynn Stout is engaged in a misleading bit of ret\\-con in her article and is presenting a misleading history of the evolution of corporate law scholarship. \n\nThis history, by the way, isn't terribly old. The right to form a corporation without a specific piece of authorizing legislation of the kind that creates a government agency, for example, is only about 150 years old or so, and both internationally and until quite recently, was much harder to form (e.g. many countries, such as South Korea, require proof that a corporation has insurance in place and sufficient capital to pay its debts before it is allowed to incorporate \\- corporate law firms still face some of these restrictions in the U.S.) Before then, each corporation was an individual legislative concept to some extent.\n\nThe notion that corporations should maximize shareholder well being, because they own the corporation, is the older and traditional view. Milton Friedman and the authors of \"The Theory of The Firm\" were simply restating the consensus view in a more focused and economically defined manner, not innovating. These pieces were published as apologies for that traditional view once it started to be challenged.\n\nThe view of a corporation as a web of contractual relationship with bondholders, suppliers, employees, customers and shareholders is the more modern view that started to gain currency sometime around the 1960s and 1970s, which is why people like Milton Friedman felt the need to articulate a defense of the traditional view that had previously merely been assumed and gone unchallenged. \n\nThe web of contracts theory was articulated initially to a great extent by corporate law theorists seeking to provide a theoretical justification for corporations to act in a responsible manner that treats its employees well, behaves honestly, goes above and beyond its legal obligations to honor the spirit as well as the letter of the law, etc.\n\nSome of the most notable corporate law responses to that theory are the law of publicly held companies in Germany, which requires that employees have a minority number of seats on the board of directors of a company, and the laws in some Scandinavian countries that call for rough gender parity on corporate boards of directors. There have also been a smattering of laws passed at least authorizing corporations to consider factors other than profit maximization.\n\nAnother related version of corporate theory to the web of contract theory is the \"director primacy\" conception of the corporation that sees a corporate board of directors as the hub of that web of contracts and the body which corporate law should protect the power of. [Professor Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/about.html) at UCLA Law is one of the leading proponents of this minority view of corporate law which was starting to emerge in the 1980s to justify efforts by corporate boards to defend themselves from the emerging threats of leveraged buyouts and proxy fights.\n\nBainbridge's view is nonetheless significant because it is an overarching theory that explains a variety of major corporate law doctrines, particularly in Delaware, whose law is dominant in the governance of publicly held corporations, that seem to be at odds with a shareholder primacy view of corporate law. It can explain the legitimacy of both \"poison pills\" and large CEO pay packages, the Delaware court's hostility to derivative suits, and its hostility to shareholder activism. To some extent, the \"director primacy\" view of corporate law is the web of contracts theory twisted and seen through a conservative lens that uses the theory to urge the law to crush the kind of shareholder activism for social good and employee rights that the original web of contracts sought to advance.\n\nThe rights of everyone other than a shareholder in a corporation are simply contract law rights \\- bond contracts, purchase and sale contracts, employment contracts, etc. \n\nThe web of contracts theory argues that the legal rights of shareholders vis\\-a\\-vis a corporation really aren't that different and that this relationship is really more like any other contract right rather than really being a genuine ownership relationship like the kind of ownership someone has over their other property that should be entitled to special consideration. \n\nThis view has a lot to do with the fact that in publicly held companies, in reality, shareholders have no meaningful role in the governance of the corporation or selection of members of the board of directors via the occasional Soviet style ballots for directors that they complete. Instead, in this context, shareholders apply the \"Wall Street Rule\" and sell stocks of companies that they feel are ill governed and don't worry too much about their practical inability to compel dividend distributions since they can take profits from retained earns by selling their stocks. This makes them look more like people with any other commodity to trade with purely contract and not political/ownership rights. This view doesn't translate well to closely held corporations where shareholder governance rights, in practice, are much more meaningful.\n\nAlso, for completeness, it is worth noting yet another emerging view of corporate law theory, developed mostly by liberals who favor campaign finance restrictions for corporations and want to restrain what they see as abuses of power by big business. This is the anti\\-corporate personhood movement that questions the assumption of all previous theorists that corporations should be treated in most respects as a \"person\" under the law. \n\nFor what it is worth, in my opinion, this movement improperly conflates abuses and power divisions that arise from businesses being very large and those attributable to the corporate form of business organization itself which actually can be very helpful in regulating businesses and redressing the harms that individuals suffer from corporate activities, by making it unnecessary to identify who within the corporation in particular causes a harm attributable to the corporation in litigation and regulatory contexts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the evolution of corporate law theory and practice since the 1970s?\n\nA) There was a dramatic shift in corporate law in the 1970s, giving shareholders significantly more rights than other stakeholders.\n\nB) The web of contracts theory emerged in the 1970s as a challenge to the traditional shareholder primacy view, leading to major legal changes.\n\nC) Milton Friedman introduced a revolutionary new concept of shareholder primacy in the 1970s, fundamentally altering corporate governance.\n\nD) The period saw a gradual shift in theoretical perspectives and minor legal changes, but no fundamental transformation of corporate law.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

To give just one example, in Denmark I have been told that it is illegal to grow and possess cannabis but not to buy or sell cannabis seeds. One could imagine that the intention in general is to make cannabis a forbidden substance, particularly consumption of it as a drug. But for various reasons, perhaps unrelated to cannabis specifically, they decided it may be excessive, or unjust, or undesirable, to ban.. some associated plant structure or something that is not itself psychoactive.\n\nBut this slightly forced, arbitrary division between allowed and not allowed only invites weird ways of toying with or working around the law. You cannot hold a marijuana leaf in your hand, or something, but you may legally be able to unload a dump truck of cannabis seeds on a farm or in a forest, provided you did not tend to them, so as to not be guilty of having \u201cgrown\u201d them.\n\nThe key point is that the intention of the law is not actually present in the law; it may be that lack of clarity, in which the law is not so straightforward, does not really say what it wants to, says it in an indirect, and hence slightly inaccurate way, which makes it less that optimally effective.\n\nI was just thinking about functional programming vs declarative.

This can have dire business consequences and completely wreck a project's timeline, or budget, or sink it altogether. I understand that this is known as \"judicial insecurity\", and it's tangibly damaging.\n\nIt would be nice if lawgivers were kind enough to decree airtight laws that, though one might argue they are more or less just or good, at least are formally consistent with each other, telling citizens and legal persons clearly what we can and cannot do. However, it's often up to lay citizens to notice these discrepancies and take them to court for appeal. Even when the cases are very clear\\-cut, it can take months or years, and by the time it's done, a whole new set of quick\\-and\\-dirty executive regulations may have come out.\n\nI'd like to know if, given the at least attempted \"formal algorithm\" method of the law, there wouldn't be an automated method of parsing the laws for contradictions, formal inconsistencies, endless loops, or undesirable end\\-states. I'd likewise appreciate an automated system for parsing out the control flows in the laws and turning them into easily\\-readable, standardized diagrams and charts.\n\nNow, However, I don't know enough about programming, particularly as applied to linguistics, to figure out what the best approach would be. If y'all got any insights, I'd strongly appreciate them.\n\nThe DEFINITIONS part is particularly tricky for me, as we've got, off the top of my head:\n\n1. Agents\n\t* Public ones: Courts, Legislative Assemblies, Administrations, Department, Position (distinct to the person of the civil servant in it), \"Organ\", etc. (it's quite a tangled web of affiliations and dependencies, and liable to change quickly, too).\n\t* Private citizens, with the attributes thereof that are deemed relevant (nationals/EU citizens/foreign, major/minor, etc.)\n\t* Private associations: Privately or Publicly owned, For Profit or Non Profit, different types of corporation...\n2. Actions: For example, for a person to be \\[appointed to an Positon],\n\\-Organ A \\[nominates],\n\\-Organ B \\[introduces in the agenda],\n\\-Organ C \\[votes],\n\\-Organ D \\[vetoes or not],\n\\-Organ E \\[signs the appointment],\n\\-Organ F \\[publishes] in the official bulletin, etc.\n3. Documents: just in the example above, each action or lack thereof is recorded (actively or by default) in a document (Nomination, Minutes, Appointment, the Bulletin, etc.). Then you have stuff like Registries and Records, which are compilations of documents, and need to be distinguished from the Organs named after them that are in charge of running them. You have Contracts, which are a whole Thing themselves. You have your specific Administrative Acts and your General Decrees. And, well, I can't help but think of the myriad types of documents, both formal and not, that are introduced in \\- discovery, was it? \\- as Evidence.\n4. Dates and timestamps are very important, as are the specific windows and deadlines to perform this or that action.\n5. Principles: they're very annoying because they're unevenly applied and usually not self explanatory, but they're supposed to inform all legislation and, when they're in the Consitution, they're meant to be very binding indeed. Legality, Rule of Law, State of Law, Non\\-Arbitrariness, Objectivity, Impartiality, Transparency, Non\\-Retroactiveness, General Interest, Cooperation, Coordination...\n\t* It's possible to go to the Doctrine (i.e., the opinions of Respected Legal Scholars) or to Case Law (which tend to rule on ambiguities of this type) to construct something resembling a useful formal definition, but it's usually very difficult to avoid a degree of \"fuzziness\" and \"gradient\" in the concept.\n\t* As such, my impression is that any formal tests that one could devise to make sure the laws apply those principles would fall under the header of operationalization, i.e. answering a difficult question with a similar, much simpler one.\n\t\t+ The example I was given in Philosophy of Science class at Uni was: \"How much do you love your wife?\" vs. \"How high a voltage are you willing to be shocked with in order to guarantee that she herself does not get shocked?\"\n\t\t+ Likewise, \"is this law impartial\" could be turned into \"in practice, what demographics are disproportionately favored by it and what aren't\", although that requires going outside of the formal confines of the law. There's likely a way to formally test if, in theory, the law is impartial, but I can't think of one right now.\n\t\t+ Similarly, the concept of \"General Interest\" is quite problematic\n\t\t\\- a huge collection of subjective interests that seems incredibly hard to even *know* objectively, let alone turn into a set of quantitative criteria, or legislate for without biases or hidden assumptions,\n\t\t\\- and yet \"the Administration serves the General Interest Objectively and Impartially\" is an actual article of Law that is in effect and which you could refer to in court when appealing an administrative regulation or act that you have evidence serves Special Interests, is Subjective, or favors certain parties over others.\n\nI've been circling the problem, reading some law, attempting a chart and a pseudo\\-code, going to practical cases, reading some theory on the background thereof, learning about different coding languages and practicing simple exercises just to get the hang of them, etc. I'm slowly growing familiar with declarative, imperative, object\\-oriented, etc languages, as well as Controlled Natural Languages and attempts to make programming easy to parse for people and human language easy to parse for machine. I'm finding out about programs and AIs that are designed to parse language, and about statistical methods to hermeneutics and data analysis.\n\nIt's been quite haphazard and unstructured, and I feel like I may be wasting my time blindly touching an elephant's trunk and trying to figure out what sort of snake it is. But I'm afraid to raise my voice, explaining what I'm doing and ask, \"am I doing this right\" and of either being ignored or being told to ask a more specific and well\\-researched question. I'd really appreciate some guidance, though.\n\nI guess, for now, I'd be content with tips on how to approach the following problems, in order of priority:\n\n* automating the representation of laws as control flow charts\n* automating the discovery of\n\t+ undesirable loops and end\\-states in said flow charts\n\t+ fringe cases that are pedagogically optimal for explaining the nuts and bolts of the law to people learning it\n\t+ ambiguous language: when a word means different things depending on which \"semantic field\" of law we're in \\- for example, \"convention\" can mean very different kinds of agreements in Civil Law, Administrative Law dealing with private entities, Administrative law dealing with different tiers of the Administration, and International Law, just to name a few.\n\t+ formal contradictions between laws of equal and different tiers\n\nThat would be a good start \\- just a formal comprehension and testing of the law.\n\nOther than that, I'm aware that LawTech firms [are developing some truly interesting applications](https://www.legalgeek.co/startup-map/) on a number of subjects, with particular attention paid to contract drafting and enforcement, and the automation thereof, as well as to the prediction of outcomes in lawsuits based on case analytics. I'm not, however, aware of the theoretical and skillset edifice upon which this kind of work is build \\- but it interests me a great deal. In fact, I'm finding Law so fascinating and vitally important that I'm actually considering getting a Law degree myself \\- I understand that STEM\\-trained folks are actually rather welcome in Law Schools? I'd strongly appreciate any guidance on how to build my knowledge and skills base to begin to be able to grapple with such problems \\- and, eventually, if I'm any good at it, offer useful billable expertise that clients would purchase, of course.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can\u2019t have complete mathematics; you have no chance of a complete legal system\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) tell us that mathematics has no complete, consistent and finite set of axioms that can prove every correct statement.

Trademark law (specifically mentioned in the German MarkenG) prohibits the use of identical signs for goods or services that are similar to those protected by the trademark, even if they're in different industries.\n3. Using the same name for a different type of software application could still cause confusion and potentially infringe on the existing trademark.\n4. The answer suggests avoiding legal risks by not using the trademarked name, which is the safest approach given the information provided.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they underestimate the scope of trademark protection, which can extend beyond specific industries.

As many online resources ([including StackExchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe)) suggest, it is next to impossible to have a website and not fall under GDPR rules. Furthermore, there seems to be some confusion and back\\-and\\-forth on what is deemed compliant, and what's not.\n\nIf you want to clarify how GDPR rules apply in your case, the usual advice is to \"get a lawyer\". However, this is not practical for many small starting online businesses that have no resources to pay for a full time legal advisor. So I am hoping to gather some practical tips about doing this without employing a lawyer.\n\nFirst, let me lay out some assumptions on the nature of the business:\n\n* It is new and small in every sense of the word: a few dozen customers, $1k\\-2k monthly turnover\n* It is based in UK\n* It is not dealing with extra\\-sensitive data like bank account numbers or identity documents\n\nAnd now some specific questions:\n\n1. What would be the best strategy in terms of \"cost vs reliability\" to ensure GDPR compliance? Would it be practical to follow one of the many GDPR tutorials online to choose a proper hosting, security measures, etc?\n2. If I unintentionally use a non\\-compliant hosting configuration or a 3rd\\-party service like Google Analytics that transfers customers' data to a \"unsafe\" jurisdiction, what consequences is it likely to bring about? Are there any examples of this happening?\n3. How severe should data processing faults be for the business to be facing serious fines and lawsuits (vs. just fixing the fault and issuing an official apology)?\n4. What would be a sensible time to actually employ a GDPR advisor? Is this based on the kind of data that the company handles? On the number of customers? On the turnover?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is entirely possible to reach a reasonable level of compliance in a DIY approach, provided that you familiarize yourself with the relevant legal framework. The UK ICO has produced in\\-depth guidance to help here, which is significantly more digestible than the laws themselves:\n\n[ICO Guide to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)\n\nFor a first reading, it is probably appropriate to focus on the summaries and checklists at the top of each section.\n\nYou will however notice that GDPR is a lot about *principles*, and requirements like selecting *appropriate* compliance measures yourself. On one hand, this means that you have some flexibility in your compliance approach, but it also means also that you can never be sure whether you're actually compliant. But this is also precisely why professional help can be valuable, since compliance professionals probably have a better overview of best practices, state of the art measures, and also potential pitfalls.\n\nIn some [other](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83897) [answers](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83565), I have written basic overviews/checklists to get started with a GDPR compliance effort.\n\nOn to your concrete questions:\n\n1. What is the best strategy to get started with GDPR compliance?\n\nThis is ultimately a business decision that you have to make. You have to consider how much compliance is worth to you, both in terms of time and money. Maybe you can DIY it, maybe you'll want to get professional help, maybe you'll just hope that no one ever sues you or lodges a complaint. There is no objective optimum, and only you know your particular situation.\n2. What are the consequences for unintentional infringement?\n\nNot being aware of the rules is not a valid defense (*ignorantia juris non excusat*).\n3. How are fines calculated?\n\nThe GDPR has two separate enforcement mechanisms: data subjects can sue you for compliance and damages, and the ICO can fine you.\n\nDamages are typically small compared to the cost of a lawsuit.\n\nWhen issuing fines, the ICO must consider a variety of factor per [Article 83](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/83), for example whether the infringement was willful or negligent. The ICO is not required to impose damages, and anecdotally many small problems can be resolved informally before it comes to a full investigation.\n\nIn particular, the [ICO's Regulatory Action Policy 2018](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf) explains that \u201cwe will reserve our powers \\[to issue fines] for the most serious cases, representing the most severe breaches of information rights obligations. These will typically involve wilful, deliberate or negligent acts, or repeated breaches of information rights obligations, causing harm or damage to individuals.\u201d The policy also provides a 5\\-step process for arriving at fines: removing financial gain, accounting for scale and severity of the breach, considering aggravating factors, ensuring a deterrent for others, and considering mitigating factors.\n\nThis suggests that a good\\-faith effort to ensure compliance already goes a long way.\n4. When to get professional help?\n\nUnder some circumstances, the GDPR *requires* that you appoint a data protection officer, who doesn't have to be an employee. You mention that you do not process sensitive data, so that it is currently unlikely you'd be required to appoint a DPO (compare Art 37, but note that the list of sensitive categories of data in Art 9(1\\) does not match your examples). The requirement to appoint a DPO depends entirely on the kind and scale of your data processing activities, not on number of employees or revenue thresholds. However, some GDPR compliance obligations like Art 30 Records of Processing Activities can also trigger when you reach 250 employees.\n\nAside from that, it is a business decision whether and when to invest in compliance.\n\nNote that if your business offers goods or services to people in the EU/EEA, you may be required to appoint an EU representative. Some law firms offer package deals for DPOs \\+ EU/UK representatives.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small UK-based online business with a few dozen customers and \u00a31k-2k monthly turnover is concerned about GDPR compliance.

The documentation suggests that it's possible to achieve a reasonable level of compliance through a DIY approach, especially by using resources like the ICO's guidance. This allows the business to balance cost and reliability without immediately incurring the expense of a full-time legal advisor.\n\nOption A is excessive for a small business at this stage, given the limited resources. \n\nOption B is incorrect and risky, as ignorance of the law is not a valid defense against GDPR violations. \n\nOption D is also incorrect, as GDPR compliance is required regardless of company size, and waiting until 250 employees would leave the company non-compliant for a long time. The 250-employee threshold only affects certain specific obligations like detailed record-keeping, not overall GDPR compliance.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows the business to start with basic compliance measures, using available resources, and then reassess and potentially seek professional help as the business grows and its data processing activities become more complex."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48233/is-it-possible-to-request-the-court-to-appoint-a-public-defender-in-a-civil-infr", "docs_id": 48233, "title": "Is it possible to request the court to appoint a public defender in a civil infraction case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Related: [In a civil infraction case, does the defendant have to turn over evidence to the prosecution beforehand?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48175/in-a-civil-infraction-case-does-the-defendant-have-to-turn-over-evidence-to-the)\n\nSimple parking ticket dispute.

In a civil infraction case, the defendant does not have an automatic right to a public defender (eliminating option A).

In other words, the law is a set of propositions which must *all* be true, and unlike actual execution of instructions in a sequence, law is to be interpreted simultaneously but hierarchically (that is: the order in which clauses are written is not significant). The appearance that the law is self\\-contradictory is largely illusory, though the resolution of the conflict may require a careful reading of the law and knowledge of jurisdictional hierarchy (federal law is superior to state law, which entails a particular resolution of the apparent conflict). Sometimes there are real conflicts, which usually result from using words in conflicting ways (note the practice of re\\-defining words \"in this chapter/section/title\").\n\nThe reason why law is not a science is that law is normative, not descriptive: it dictates what is allowed (a determination made through the political process), and does not attempt to discover what independently is. The reason why the legal process cannot be implemented in software is that software does not yet correctly interpret natural language, and law is written in natural language following interpretations based on judgments of what choices a reasonable would make.\n\nPerhaps if you propose a piece of law that you think is contradictory, it would be possible to show how the contradiction is illusory.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the general principle taught in law schools, which of the following statements best describes the approach to determining whether an action is legally permissible?\n\nA) Actions are assumed to be forbidden unless explicitly permitted by law.\nB) Actions are assumed to be permitted unless explicitly forbidden by law.\nC) The legality of actions is determined by the order in which laws are written.\nD) Actions are only legal if they are expressly stated as permitted in legislation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The general rule taught in law schools is that anything is allowed unless it is forbidden.

I have always thought you need some sort of medical information attached with the 18 identifiers to make it PHI, otherwise without the health information, it's PII. So a first and last name with the diagnosis of diabetes is PHI, but my first and last name is not PHI, only PII.\n2. Does it matter where the information originated from?

PHI relates to physical records, while ePHI is any PHI that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically.\nPHI only relates to information on patients or health plan members. It does not include information contained in educational and employment records, that includes health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in its capacity as an employer.\nPHI is only considered PHI when an individual could be identified from the information.

E.g. if there is a web page with details like First Name, Last Name, Mobile No and health report attached, then the system is considered and PHI/ePHI. Secondly, all the health records have PII for traceability purposes.\n2. Secondly, First and Last Name also does not qualify to be PII, as it\u2019s generic information.

You can take this and **do not need to sign anything**.\n\nHowever, sometimes companies make slightly more generous offers in exchange for you agreeing not to take them to tribunal/court or discuss/disclose certain matters. This would often involve more money and an agreed reference. **These agreements only have legal standing if you have taken legal advice from a person qualified to give it**. The UK's national conciliation and arbitration service ACAS has information on settlement agreements at [http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid\\=4395](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4395)\n\nTherefore the employer is offering to pay legal fees because they need you to get advice before you sign a document which protects them.

The executor ... **is not bound by specific directions left in the will**.\n> * If there isn\u2019t a will or an executor hasn\u2019t been appointed, the next of kin is responsible for the body. If the next of kin doesn\u2019t want to be involved, the funeral may be arranged through the government contractor.\n> * Where a person who dies in hospital has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, and had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, the hospital where they died must accept responsibility for arranging and paying for the funeral through the government contractor.\n> * If a person died at home, and has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, when a doctor has issued a medical certificate of cause of death, the police will complete a burial/cremation of a \u2018Deceased Destitute Person\u2019 form P372, which is sent to the Director of Public Health Unit (PHU) of the relevant Health Service. The government contractor will be contacted by the PHU to organise a funeral. If a medical certificate of cause of death was not issued, the body is taken to the coroner\u2019s morgue.\n> * The coroner issues an \u2018Order for Disposal of a Destitute Person\u2019 and forwards it to the Director of the relevant Health Service\u2019s Public Health Unit (PHU). The PHU, in turn, contacts the government contractor who forwards the invoice to the PHU for payment by the Area Health Service. See the section on destitute funerals. If a Coroner\u2019s case involves a destitute person, and there are next of kin, the counsellors at the Department of Forensic Medicine can be approached by the family to assist with funeral arrangements.\n> * If the deceased has no next of kin, but did have money or assets, the case is referred to the NSW Trustee and Guardian who arranges and pays for a funeral from the estate.\n\n> **If someone dies with a will, but does not mention their body or how to dispose of it who decides what happens?**\n\nAs stated above, your requests in your will as to the disposal of your body are **not** binding on your executor. They must decide how to dispose of the body with consideration of their duties to the estate and beneficiaries. For example, if your will requests a funeral costing tens of thousands of dollars but your estate is worth only a few thousand then the executor is duty bound to ignore that request.\n\n> **a parent has two children and dies leaving no will, which of the siblings decides?**\n\nThey decide together. If they cannot agree then they will have to go to court. In general, in Australia, courts take a very pragmatic view of what should happen: quickest and lowest cost option on the table will generally win.\n\n> **Who pays for the result of that decision?**\n\nThe estate is responsible for funeral costs (and court costs in arguing about them). As a practical matter, funeral service providers (and lawyers) will require the person engaging their services to pay the bill; that person can then claim reimbursement as a creditor of the estate. In the event that the estate is insolvent (i.e. has more debts than assets) then their reimbursement will be less than their costs.\n\n> **If one sibling wants to have a huge funeral and the other wants to just toss the body in a dumpster does the cost for the funeral come out of the estate before it is split?**\n\nObserving that to \"just toss the body in a dumpster\" would be illegal; the costs of the funeral come from the estate as a creditor of the estate. The residual equity of the estate would then be divided in accordance with the will or the law if there is no will.\n\nIt is worth noting that joint assets (e.g. real property owned as joint tenants, joint bank accounts) pass directly to the surviving owner and never become assets of the estate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a resident of NSW, Australia, dies without a will.

In NSW, Australia, when someone dies without a will (intestate), the next of kin is responsible for arranging the funeral. In this case, both Sarah and Michael, as John's children, are equally responsible. If they cannot agree on the funeral arrangements, they will need to go to court to resolve the dispute.

In cases of intestacy, the next of kin (in this case, the children) are responsible for funeral arrangements.\n\nThe costs of the funeral will indeed come out of the estate before it is divided, but the court would likely favor a more modest arrangement to preserve the estate's value for the beneficiaries."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37375/is-this-considered-kidnapping-under-law", "docs_id": 37375, "title": "Is this considered Kidnapping under law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Okay so the title is questionable but hopefully intriguing.

However, under the concept of provisional rights (35 USC 154(d)), TechInnovate could potentially claim damages for the period between the publication of the patent application (July 1, 2020) and the grant date (March 1, 2022) if:\n\n1. The claims in the published application are \"substantially identical\" to the claims in the granted patent.\n2. MobilePower had actual notice of the published application.\n3. The damages would be limited to at least a reasonable royalty.\n\nIt's important to note that this is rarely invoked and can only be enforced after the patent is actually granted.

Very few states allow anyone other than a prosecutor (or sometimes in minor cases, a law enforcement officer) to bring criminal or quasi\\-criminal charges.\n\nOf course, if compelling evidence of a violation is found and shared with the media, there may be powerful political pressure to bring a prosecution, but how that is developed would entirely depend upon the circumstances. \n\nStill, the relationship between prosecutors and law enforcement is so symbiotic, that prosecutors are loathe to press charges against law enforcement officers in all but the clearest of cases, especially for offenses occuring while a law enforcement officer is on duty in his home jurisdiction.\n\n> Legally speaking, do civilians have any right to apprehend an officer\n>  for a traffic violation?\n\nWhile this would depend upon state law, most states treat traffic violations as a class of offense different from other misdemeanors and infractions and never authorize a citizens arrest for a traffic violation.

But between different eras of Supreme courts I guess the present takes precedence over the past? What is the rationale for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The House of Lords declared themselves able to depart from their own precedents in 1966, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_Statement) (emphasis added):\n\n> Their Lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs, as well as a basis for orderly development of legal rules.\n> \n> \n> Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that **too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law**. They propose therefore, to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this house as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\n> In this connection they will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlement of property, and fiscal arrangements have been entered into and also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law.\n> This announcement is not intended to affect the use of precedent elsewhere than in this House.\n\nThis applies equally to the Supreme Court, which has replaced the judicial functions of the Lords. The Practice Statement of 1966 itself overturned *London Street Tramways v London County Council* \\[1898] AC 375, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, had said:\n\n> A decision of this House once given on a point of law is conclusive on this House afterwards.\n\nIn the modern understanding, it is in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to always be able to say what the law is, even if that conflicts with the understanding of the past. As it is the final court of appeal, there is no other court which could review or overturn its decisions. Parliament *could*, and sometimes has, done so, but it is not always easy to express the desired effect in statutory language; and Parliament has many other demands on its time. It was felt that the court itself should be in a position to say that a past judgement was wrongly decided, or should no longer be considered binding for another reason.\n\nIn the Scottish tradition, this power has long been held to be inherent in that country's highest courts, the Court of Session / High Court of Justiciary. It is allied to the *nobile officium*, or equitable jurisdiction of those courts to provide a just remedy in the absence of any explicit law. Judicial precedent is not a barrier to justice either. As Lord Kames said (*Historical law\\-tracts*, 1758; tract 8\\),\n\n> No defect in the constitution of a state deserves greater reproach, than the giving license to wrong without affording redress. Upon this account, it is the province, one should imagine, of the sovereign, and supreme court, to redress wrongs of every kind, where a peculiar remedy is not provided.\n\nThose courts have not held themselves to a strict idea of *stare decisis* with respect to their own decisions, feeling instead that in the interests of justice they should be able to decide what a particular case demands. John Erskine explained (*An institute of the law of Scotland*, 1773; book 1, title 1, section 47\\):\n\n> Decisions therefore though they bind the parties litigating create no obligation on the judges to follow in the same tract if it shall appear to them contrary to law.\n\nEnglish courts, at least once in their roughly modern shape following the reforms of the late 19th century, have taken a stricter view of precedent, in the interests of predictability. The reform of 1966 was influenced by differences between English and Scottish practice, and represents something of a course\\-correction away from the strict position of the prior era.\n\nIn terms of the present and the past, \"precedent\" doesn't precisely mean that the past wins out. It would be better to say that a past decision is *presumed to be right*, up until proved otherwise, or made obsolete by events such as the passage of new statutes. The presumption is binding on lower courts, and merely \"very strong\" for the highest court. The post\\-1966 position recognises that it is sometimes appropriate for the Supreme Court itself, seized of a particular case, to point out when a past decision is no longer right.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In 1966, the House of Lords made a significant change regarding their approach to precedent.

In 1966, the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court) issued the Practice Statement, which modified their approach to precedent. The key rationale was to avoid \"too rigid adherence to precedent\" which might \"lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law.\" This change allowed the highest court to depart from its own previous decisions when it \"appears right to do so,\" balancing the need for legal certainty with the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and correct past errors. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the change was specifically designed to avoid rigid adherence to past decisions.

If a nominee cannot comment on past decisions by others, says to \"read the opinion\" on their own previous decisions, cannot comment on current cases, and cannot comment on hypotheticals of future cases, then what is the point of a hearing in the first place?

A judge's mere answer that he would follow *stare decisis* is as useless as if a candidate for investment management simply answered that he would \"*buy low, sell high*\".\n\nNot all of that evasion is improper, though. For instance, the [Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct](http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/rules/documents/michigan%20code%20of%20judicial%20conduct.pdf) in its Canon 3\\.A(6\\) reads:\n\n> A judge should abstain from public comment about a pending or\n>  impending proceeding in any court, and should require a similar\n>  abstention on the part of court personnel subject to the judge's\n>  direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from\n>  making public statements in the course of official duties or from\n>  explaining for public information the procedures of the court or the\n>  judge's holdings or actions.\n\n(Note: I doubt the the federal equivalent of these rules would significantly differ. In this regard, the U.S. consists of many jurisdictions copying each other this type of rules. I would call it *jurisdictional rip\\-offs*. The term *rip\\-off* applies also from the standpoint that many judges flagrantly violate these rules, but I am digressing from the topic.)\n\nIn theory, the rationale for that \"Canon\" is that a judge's (or judicial candidate's/nominee's) public comments about pending or impending cases are very likely to disrupt litigation, exacerbate court\\-shopping, and is perceived as catering to certain lobbyists or groups of power, thereby heating the undeniable trafficking of influences in court. Moreover, that kind of comments would prejudice the party who is not favored by the comments and who has no equal access to the forum or media in order to refute those comments.\n\nHowever, you can see that the same item of that Canon allows a judge to explain \"*for public information \\[...] the judge's holdings or actions*\". Thus, principles of transparency should compel a judicial nominee to openly answer questions about his or her own decisions. Of course, for an examination to be effective, it is necessary that the legislators come prepared to the hearing by having read various opinions (decisions) released by that judge.\n\nFurthermore, the Canon does not prohibit to answer inquiries about hypothetical scenarios. As long as the hypotheticals do not resemble a pending or impending case, a judicial nominee (or candidate, where elected by public vote) should promptly give others a \\[non\\-conclusory] walk\\-through of his or her judicial rationale.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding what a judge or judicial nominee can discuss publicly?\n\nA) A judge may freely comment on any pending or impending case in any court.\nB) A judge is prohibited from making any public statements about court procedures or their own actions.\nC) A judge should abstain from public comment about pending cases, but may explain their own holdings or actions for public information.\nD) A judge is only allowed to comment on hypothetical scenarios that closely resemble pending cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3.A(6), states that a judge should abstain from public comment about pending or impending proceedings in any court. However, it also specifies that this does not prohibit a judge from \"making public statements in the course of official duties or from explaining for public information the procedures of the court or the judge's holdings or actions.\" Therefore, while judges should avoid commenting on pending cases, they are allowed to explain their own decisions and actions for the purpose of public information. Option A is incorrect as it contradicts the main rule. Option B is too restrictive and ignores the allowance for explaining one's own actions.
