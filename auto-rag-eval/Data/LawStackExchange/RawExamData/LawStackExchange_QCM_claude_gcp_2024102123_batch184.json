All questions can be boiled down into questions of law and questions of fact. This is opposed to an inquisitorial system, where the prosecutor, defense, and judge are working to answer these questions in a fact finding forum.\n\nBecause of this, in Common law, the judge takes the role of \"Trier of Law\", i.e. he is the arbiter of what the law says. The Jury will talk the role of \"Trier of Fact\". Essentially, if the prosecutor and defense attorneys are in a competition against each other, the judge will serve as the referee and decide whether something is allowed to be discussed in trial and whether the jury should count it. Because of this, the judge cannot call out objectional behavior by one side or the other as it would call into question his/her ability to be neutral in his assessment of the law. Thus it is the burden of the opposing party to object to something that is objectional.\n\nFailure to object means that the the side that should object is okay with this activity by opposing counsel, so the judge must allow it. Sometimes, objections are raised at trial for the sole reason that they will be part of the appeal of the case. Appeals can only call raise Questions of Law, which again, is the judge's domain. Thus the judge can't object, since we operate on the fact that the judge is neutral. If the judge is not neutral, than the case can be overturned easily by an appellant court.\n\nEssentially, the \"Objection\" is similar to a coach playing sportsball asking a ref to review a play on the sportsball field. Under this game rule, however, the judge is there to make the call if and only if he/she is asked to make it. Otherwise the objectionable action is permitted to stand.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a common law court system, why can't a judge object to questionable evidence or testimony during a trial?\n\nA) The judge lacks the legal authority to intervene in the proceedings.\nB) The judge is not expected to understand all aspects of the case being tried.\nC) Objecting would compromise the judge's role as a neutral arbiter of the law.\nD) The judge is only responsible for sentencing, not for managing the trial process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In a common law system, courts operate on an adversarial model where the prosecution and defense are pitted against each other. The judge serves as the \"Trier of Law,\" responsible for interpreting and applying the law neutrally. If the judge were to object to evidence or testimony, it could be seen as favoring one side over the other, thus compromising their neutrality. This is why the burden of objecting falls on the opposing counsel. The judge's role is to rule on objections raised by the parties, not to raise objections themselves. This system ensures that the judge maintains their position as an impartial referee in the legal proceedings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge does have the authority to intervene in certain situations, but chooses not to object to maintain neutrality.\nOption B is false because judges are expected to have a comprehensive understanding of the case.\nOption D is incorrect as judges have responsibilities throughout the trial, not just in sentencing."

Terms apply.\n\n(This example technically only says \"up to,\" but there are others that do not include such a qualifier).\n\nOf course, these miles do not correspond to any common usage of the term miles, but rather represent a certain number of loyalty program points, one that would be insufficient to buy any combination of flights that would travel a distance greater than twice the circumference of the earth.\n\nOn the surface, would seem like a clear example of misleading or false advertising under a number of legal regimes (including the USA): a company redefines a term related to their product (the distance travelled) in such a way as to produce a misleading impression that can result in financial benefit, without noting the redefinition in its advertisement.\n\nHowever, this does not appear to have caused any legal problems for airlines, so that would suggest that such advertising is legal.

The legality of using \"miles\" in airline loyalty program advertising is primarily based on the fact that these programs typically award miles at a 1:1 ratio with nautical miles flown, at least for full-fare economy tickets. This direct correlation between actual distance traveled and miles earned provides a factual basis for using the term \"miles,\" even if the redemption value doesn't correspond directly to physical distance.\n\nAnswer A is partially true, as the term has become widely used, but this alone doesn't fully explain its legal acceptability.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because airlines don't always include such disclaimers in their advertising.\n\nAnswer D is plausible but not supported by the given information.

In my country is always being used a jury trial. Now in some cities/provinces, it's being optional to have a bench trial. This could become mandatory someday. In my personal opinion, this type of system which is used in countries like United States I believe, it's flawed and unfair. In my opinion, common people dont have the knowledge to make a fair judgement and most of them judge according to prejudices and beliefs.

The developer is unsure about privacy policy requirements. Which of the following statements is most accurate and comprehensive regarding the need for a privacy policy in this scenario?\n\nA) A privacy policy is only required if personal information beyond username and password is collected.\n\nB) No privacy policy is needed since users can choose anonymous usernames.\n\nC) A privacy policy is necessary to explain password security measures and data storage practices, even if only usernames and passwords are collected.\n\nD) A privacy policy is only required for the mobile app version due to app store guidelines, but not for the website.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because even with minimal data collection (just usernames and passwords), a privacy policy is still necessary and beneficial. This is because:\n\n1. Passwords need to be stored securely (salted and hashed), and users should be informed about these security measures.\n2. Many users reuse passwords across multiple sites, making password protection particularly important.\n3. The fact that an account exists implies some data is being stored about the user, even if it's just the username and password.\n4. App stores typically require privacy policies for any app that collects user data, including login information.\n5. It's a good practice to be transparent about data handling, even when collection is minimal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a privacy policy is valuable even with minimal data collection. Option B is wrong because anonymity doesn't negate the need for a privacy policy. Option D is incorrect because both the website and app should have a privacy policy, not just the app."

The law specifically prohibits \"maliciously\" damaging or destroying such plants, which would not be the case in a focused search for evidence.

I ***happened*** to know what it was, as I had experienced this once before.\n\nThe wheel was not attached properly, and the nuts were loose. Another 10 minutes of driving, it would've popped off and rolled down the road. (Again, this has happened to me before and narrowly missed going into someone's windshield \\- Thankfully that incident resulted only in damage to my wheel and lower arm joint.)\n\nI pulled over, tightened the nuts, and drove it the last mile home. I contacted the dealer and told them I would be exercising the 7\\-day guarantee \\- I would not be purchasing the vehicle.\n\nWhen it was picked up, I told them on no uncertain terms that the vehicle was not fit to drive until the wheels were inspected by a professional.\n\nIn addition to this, the company that sold me the car has a \"150 point checklist\" that specifically claims to have addressed these exact deficient items on the car.\n\n[![Auto Dealer Checklist Item 28, Wheels & Lugnuts](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZjFZ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZjFZ.png)\n\nMy question is, *had the wheel come off and caused horrible damage to life and property, who would have been held responsible*? The car was not yet registered in my name as it was in a \"Test drive period\", I did have insurance, and the problem would not have been my fault (as far as I am concerned, at least. . But what does the law think?)\n\nEven though this is a hypothetical, it came very close to happening. If it's relevant, this would've taken place in Texas, United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nUnder Texas law (and pretty much everywhere else) the driver of the vehicle is responsible for ensuring that it is roadworthy. This does not mean that someone else cannot also be liable \\- the mechanic who fixed the wheel and their employer would also be liable.\n\nThe claim for damages from a motor vehicle accident lies in the tort of negligence and the standards that the driver has to attain to avoid liability is that of a reasonable person. A reasonable person is not an average person who (probably) just gets in a car and drives but a prudent person who considers the risks to themselves and others and takes reasonable steps to mitigate them.\n\nLike looking at the wheels of an unfamiliar car. If the defect were obvious to a layperson from a visual inspection, they would be liable if they had not conducted such an inspection.\n\nSimilarly, continuing to drive when a car is making a \"Knocking\" noise even if you didn't know what it was is not something a reasonable person would do. If you knew what the noise was and kept driving we are now moving from negligence into recklessness and the realms of criminal liability like manslaughter.",

While the dealer may also face liability for their negligence in inspecting the vehicle, the driver has a duty to exercise reasonable care and not operate a vehicle that is making unusual noises or showing signs of malfunction. Continuing to drive despite hearing a \"knocking\" noise could be considered negligent behavior. The insurance status and registration of the vehicle do not absolve the driver of this responsibility. Therefore, the driver would likely be held primarily responsible in this scenario."

The recognition of these relationships is ad hoc and comes at the local government level or in particular benefit plan arrangements. Montana [does not have a state level statute recognizing domestic partnerships](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/domestic-partnership-rights-by-state.html), in general and for all purposes.\n\nAt least some government agencies in Montana [allows employees to designate a domestic partner](https://benefits.mt.gov/Portals/59/Documents/declaration.domestic.partner.pdf) for employee benefits purposes.\n\nAt least [some health insurance companies in Montana](https://www.bcbsmt.com/static/mt/pdf/forms/affidavit-of-domestic-partnership.pdf) also allow coverage of domestic partners.\n\nAt least one municipal government in Montana, [the City of Missoula](https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/city-of-missoula-domestic-partnership-registry-opens/article_31ceb082-2af9-11e3-aa0e-0019bb2963f4.html), has a domestic partnership registry, which can be used to show proof of the existence of a domestic partnership for other purposes.\n\nMontana, like most states, allows people who are not married to enter into enforceable contracts related to economic matters in shared household, often called [cohabitation agreements](https://www.uslegalforms.com/cohabitation/montana/). So long as none of the consideration for the agreement is sex and sex in not required by the agreement or purports to be bindingly consented to in the agreement. (Cohabitation agreements that do so are called meretricious and are void as a matter of public policy because they constitute agreements to engage in illegal conduct, i.e. prostitution.)\n\nPeople who are not married can also name each other as death beneficiaries of assets, in a will or trust, or as agents in powers of attorney for each other. Some employee benefit plans require that a power of attorney be in place between the parties to recognize them as domestic parters for employee benefit purposes.\n\nMontana does recognize [common law marriage](https://courts.mt.gov/forms/marriage), but you are correct that the legal status of a common law marriage once established, is no different than any other kind of marriage and may only be terminated by divorce. Montana does not have the equivalent of a *de facto relationship* statute like the ones found in Australia and Texas.\n\nAlso, Montana, like all U.S. states, is required as a matter of constitutional law to allow same sex couples to legally marry.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: ### Background\n\nAccording to my textbook:\n\n> In *Cruikshank* ... the \\[Supreme] Court ruled that voting rights remained a state prerogative unless the state *itself* violated those rights. **So long as the civil rights of former slaves were being violated by individuals or private groups** (including the Klan), **that was a state responsibility and beyond federal jurisdiction**. **Therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment did not protect citizens from armed vigilantes, even if those vigilantes seized political power.** The Court thus gutted the Fourteenth Amendment. ([America, A Concise History](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0312643276))\n\n*Emphasis mine.*\n\nThis does not make much sense to me. \n\nThis decision is in the context of the (very violent) intimidation of blacks especially by ex\\-Confederates followed by a Democratic political coup. From what I understand, the Democrats disenfranchised African Americans. The Supreme Court then ruled that it was the state's responsibility to ensure that its citizen's rights were not infringed upon. \n\n### First contention\n\nFirstly, why would it be the state's responsibility to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which is part of the Constitution? The Fourteenth Amendment states,\n\n> The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ([Section 5 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution))\n\nDoes this, not to mention that it is a Constitutional amendment, not imply that issues pertaining to the Fourteenth Amendment, such as equal access to voting ([Section 2 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)), are under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Second contention\n\nIf \"private groups\" like the KKK took *political* power, would the governments that they became part of not be violating former slaves' civil rights (as opposed to just private individuals)? Therefore, it would be that state's duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to address the illegal actions of actors within its jurisdiction. However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders? \n\nWould the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Closing\n\nI am not very fluent in law things, so please excuse me for any misused vocabulary (like \"jurisdiction\"), nor do I have a thorough understanding of federal vs. state jurisdiction or Constitutional law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the \"state action\" requirement is the norm for most civil rights violations. The U.S. Constitution is structured in such a way that it is designed solely to protect people from government overreach. Statutes engaged by legislative bodies at the state and federal level protect people from misconduct by private parties.\n\nFor example, ordinary state criminal laws would ordinarily forbid private parties from acting as armed vigilantes to prevent people from doing pretty much anything. And, if armed vigilantes were doing something that government officials and politically powerful people in the state didn't approve of, they would have been arrested, charged and convicted of crimes by the police.\n\nThe trouble is that in the U.S. legal system, if the government decides not to enforce its criminal laws, you are limited to bringing civil lawsuits against the offenders for damages or injunctive relief (e.g. a court order ordering the vigilantes to stop misbehaving). But, as a practical matter, private lawsuits are not very effective when the courts and government officials are determined to thwart you and so are a significant share of the members of any jury pool. (This is one of the reasons, as a matter of logic, for the Second Amendment, because you need some way to protect yourself from crimes if the government exercises its right to do nothing to protect you from criminals even when it is capable of doing so.)\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional and legal system requires the good faith of the elected officials in state and federal government to work properly. But, if majorities of voters under whatever flawed electoral system is currently in place are bound and determined to suppress a political minority, the democratic features of our political system make it very hard to intervene to protect that political minority.\n\nAs you note, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (collectively, the Civil Rights Amendments) all empower Congress to enact legislation enforcing those provisions in addition to any self\\-executing effect that they have, although the exact scope of that enforcement power was at the time a matter of some legal debate and in any event often wasn't exercised by Congress (which by then had white, anti\\-civil rights members in many House and Senate seats). But, in *U.S. v. Cruikshank* a very racist U.S. Supreme Court held that the state action requirement applied not just to self\\-executing aspects of the Civil Rights Amendments, but also to the 1870 Enforcement Act adopted by Congress during Reconstruction with an intent to stop precisely the kind of armed private action that occurred. It held that the 1870 Enforcement Act as applied to private parties was unconstitutional.\n\n(Around the same time the *Slaughterhouse* cases gutted the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution, and *Plessy v. Ferguson* gutted the 14th Amendment with the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.)\n\n> However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not\n> then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state\n> failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders?\n\nNo. The U.S. Constitution doesn't provide much protection at all against state inaction. (The human rights tribunal for the Americas has faulted the U.S. for violating human rights by not having protections against this kind of conduct which all Latin American countries do have.)\n\n> Would the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to\n> enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal\n> jurisdiction?\n\nNo. The plaintiff would have no remedy, which was basically the intended and expected effect of *U.S. v. Cruikshank*. The justice of the U.S. Supreme Court weren't any more stupid then than they are now. They just had different values and part of those values was the belief that it wasn't the place of the federal government to curb the acts of groups like the KKK and Jim Crow laws (in part to prevent a re\\-ignition of the Civil War in a post\\-Reconstruction period when white supremacists were more powerful than ever in the states that had previously fought a war with overwhelming support from majorities of people entitled to vote to preserve slavery). The Civil Rights Amendments were shoved down the throats of the Southern states as a condition for readmission to equal standing in the Union free of military law and civil disabilities during Reconstruction. So, they ratified those amendments under duress and then did everything they could to reinstate the pre\\-civil war system as completely as possible which they had still believed in despite losing the Civil War (and indeed, [modern political figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore) like [Roy Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore), a previous Alabama Supreme Court Justice, still want to return their states and the nation to the ante\\-bellum South, and argue that slavery was as much good as it was bad for the slaves and for the South).\n\nIt took a century and two World Wars and the Korean War, in which African\\-Americans served in the military for the U.S., and a thriving post\\-war economy, for those attitudes to change.\n\nUltimately, in light of this ruling, in the 1960s, the Civil Rights Acts were adopted by Congress to regulate discriminatory conduct by private parties, not with the justification and authority of enforcement powers of the Civil Rights Amendments, but instead based upon the interstate commerce clause whose scope had been dramatically expanded during the Great Depression in cases like *Wickard v. Filburn*, a choice which a pro\\-civil rights U.S. Supreme Court gave its stamp of approval in the *Heart of Atlanta Motel* case.",

The Court ruled that addressing civil rights violations by private parties was a state responsibility, beyond federal jurisdiction. This effectively meant the federal government could not directly intervene to protect citizens from armed vigilantes or groups like the KKK unless the state itself was violating civil rights. This interpretation \"gutted\" the Fourteenth Amendment's protections against private actors, even when they seized political power, leaving enforcement primarily to potentially unsympathetic state governments."

When the body makes a formal decision to adopt the written document (by a vote, for example), it is deciding to do the thing described in the document; that is, it is deciding to act. Typically, for a legislature, the thing it's doing is to create, modify, or repeal a law.\n\nIt's not very difficult to see how a document that describes a legislature's desire *to* act came to be called *an* act. In some contexts, however, it can also be called a law.\n\nSo the word *law* can refer to the entire system (as in *law school*), to a particular act (as in *the legislature passed a law today called the XYZ Act*), or indeed to a particular rule or section of an act (as in *the law in question is subparagraph 2(B)(ii)(b) of the XYZ Act*).\n\n*Law* can also refer to *case law,* of course, or *regulatory law,* so we tend to use *statutory law* or *statute* to denote the laws created through the legislative process.\n\nIn conclusion, the word \"law\" has several related meanings, so its use can be imprecise. When speaking about specific paragraphs, precision may be in order. In a case like this, where a paragraph create exceptions to rules laid out in a preceding paragraph, it doesn't make a lot of sense to describe each paragraph as a \"law.\" The numbered items in statutory text can be called many things, and usually have different names depending on the level at which they are found. So I would not know whether these are sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, or something else. If I were unable to find the correct terminology for (in this case) India, would probably use a generic term like \"items.\"",

The term \"law\" can indeed refer to the entire legal system (as in \"law school\"), a specific piece of legislation passed by a governing body (such as \"the XYZ Act\"), or particular rules or sections within an Act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the relationship between \"Act\" and \"law,\" ignoring that an Act can contain multiple laws or rules.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's too restrictive. The numbered items in an Act are not always referred to as \"laws\" and can have various names depending on their level and the specific legal tradition (e.g., sections, subsections, paragraphs).\n\nOption C is incorrect because while these terms are related, they are not always interchangeable. \"Act\" specifically refers to a piece of legislation, while \"law\" has a broader meaning, and \"statute\" specifically refers to written law enacted by a legislative body.\n\nOption D provides the most comprehensive and accurate description of how the term \"law\" can be used in different contexts related to legislation and legal systems."

Tibia used to feature [beholders](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Bonelord), a flying brain\\-like blob with multiple eyestalks and one large center eye that shoots destructive beams.\nChanged to [bonelord](https://www.tibiaqa.com/10125/why-cipsoft-changed-beholder-name-to-bonelord#:%7E:text=With%20a%20small%20patch%20on,full%20of%20dungeons%20and%20dragons) after a copyright claim by Wizards of the Coast.\n3. D\\&D universe features [beholders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beholder) \\- a flying brain like blob with multiple eyestalks and one large center eye that shoots destructive beams.\n\nI did not find any reference to D\\&D, Wizards of the Coast or anything related in the credits and other resources for HOMM3\\.\n\nHow can 3DO use beholders while Cipsoft (Tibia creator) cannot, and isn't the fact that WOTC didn't pursue the same with 3DO (afaik) grounds for the copyright being unenforceable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Beholder\" was originally invented as part of AD\\&D (2nd edition IIRC) and copyrighted by TSR (Gary Gygax and associates, essentially). WotC bought TSR and all its assets, including copyrights. There were at least two other RPGs that tried to use Beholders and other original creatures from the *Monster Manual* of D\\&D and dropped them after a cease and desist order from the copyright holders. I believe one was from TSR, and one from WotC after they purchased TSR. To the best of my knowledge there was no actual copyright suit, so the validity of the copyright was never tested in court, but it is probably valid.\n\nMerely calling a creature a \"Beholder\" is not enough to violate the copyright, there would need to be actual copying of the description, or a sufficiently detailed similarity to make the use an infringement. That is always a matter of judgement, ultimately for a court in a copyright suit (or an appeals court).\n\nSo, while all the possibilities mentioned in [the answer by @Dale M](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64375/10) are valid, it is additional possible that the version used by HOMM3 is not sufficiently close to the one copyrighted as part of AD\\&D for a copyright claim to prevail, or the WotC fears that it would not prevail, and so does not spend the money to try.",

According to the information provided, the copyright on beholders has not been tested in court, and merely using the name \"beholder\" is not enough to violate copyright. For copyright infringement to occur, there needs to be substantial similarity or copying of the copyrighted description. It's possible that HOMM3's version of beholders is not sufficiently close to the copyrighted version from AD&D to constitute infringement, or that Wizards of the Coast believes they might not prevail in a copyright claim against HOMM3.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of HOMM3 obtaining a special license. Option B is false because the copyright is still held by Wizards of the Coast. Option D is also incorrect, as there's no indication that Wizards of the Coast only enforces copyright for online games."

Why isn\u2019t simply having an active statute (ie DPA 2018\\) remain on the books enough?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 2018 Data Protection Act specifically implemented the GDPR EU Regulation in the UK \\- while the regulation itself was directly binding it required member states to create their own legislation for implementing the details \\- setting up the required supervisory and accreditation bodies etc. The various 'opening clauses' in the regulation also provided the means for the members states to implement specifics in local legislation (so long as that legislation *exceeded* the minimums set out in GDPR).\n\nAt the end of the Brexit transition period the UK was no longer a member state (and it's citizens were no longer EU citizens), keeping the DPA 2018 as was would have actually meant that UK citizens weren't eligible for the very protections it was intended to provide them!\n\nTherefore the basis of the law needed updating (as well as certain minor provisions that no longer made sense) hence the \"UK GDPR\" provided a substitute. The fundamentals are the same and crucially it also codified the necessary basis for the UK's data protection laws to have what is referred to as \"adequacy\" \\- which means that the EU considers the UK GDPR/DPA to provide \"essentially equivalent\" levels of protection and therefore data is allowed to continue to flow between the UK and the EU.",

In other words, what does this \u201cor other\u201d clause refer to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cited provision is:\n\n> A person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment if the person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person's sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex.\n\nThis language originates in the [Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1102/made). This statutory instrument was made in response to a 1996 decision of the European Court of Justice ([*P v S and Cornwall County Council*, C\\-13/94](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0013)) that [Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31976L0207) , regarding equal treatment of men and women, also covered discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment. The regulations were made in order to bring domestic law up to date with the EU requirement, by amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1975\\. The definition at the time, found in the amended [section 82](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65/section/82/1999-05-01), was:\n\n> \"gender reassignment\" means a process which is undertaken under medical supervision for the purpose of reassigning a person\u2019s sex by changing physiological or other characteristics of sex, and includes any part of such a process\n\nSo the idea of \"other characteristics\" or \"other attributes\" comes from the 1999 version of the law. I expect that the change to \"attributes\" is simply because the Equality Act 2010 uses the term \"characteristic\" to mean something else, as it consolidates many different regimes about discrimination on the basis of sex, race, disability, etc., all of which are called \"characteristics\".\n\nThe more recent text removes the part about \"medical supervision\", and explicitly includes people at any stage of transition. [Explanatory Notes](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes/division/3/2/1/4) to the 2010 Act give the example:\n\n> A person who was born physically female decides to spend the rest of her life as a man. He starts and continues to live as a man. He decides not to seek medical advice as he successfully \u2018passes\u2019 as a man without the need for any medical intervention. He would have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment for the purposes of the Act.\n\n(These notes are not binding in law but they do give a good idea of what the drafters meant to say. The concept of 'passes' is also not the most sensitive language to bring in, since trans people do not necessarily want to measure themselves by their ability to pass undetected, and may present differently in different contexts.)\n\nThe example shows that someone can have the protected characteristic without having, or contemplating, any change to their body. So from this example, the other attributes of sex would include all those ways in which the man \"continues to live as a man\". From general knowledge of trans men, that could include using a masculine name and pronouns; wearing traditionally\\-male clothes; wearing a binder, baggy clothing, padding in the crotch, or other ways to suggest a more masculine than feminine body; having a traditionally\\-male haircut; using traditionally\\-masculine body language; pitching the voice lower; and so on. The situation for trans women would be parallel.

The key aspect is the person's intention to transition or live as a different gender, which is absent in this scenario.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the broad scope of gender reassignment protection under the Equality Act 2010, including non-medical aspects of transition and the importance of the individual's intention to reassign their gender."

Later, they discover the car had significant previous damage. The consumer wants to return the car and get their money back.

Instead, it recommends explaining the situation in simple English and asking for money back. Option C aligns most closely with this advice, making it the approach most likely to be successful. Options A and B involve legal complexity that the documentation discourages for small claims court. Option D asks for a remedy (car replacement) that the documentation suggests is unlikely, as small claims courts typically deal with monetary awards."

Even if the Defendant settles the initial dispute by paying the Plaintiff before the hearing, the Plaintiff may still have the right to pursue reimbursement for some legal fees, particularly the cost of filing the claim. This is because the Plaintiff incurred these costs as a direct result of the Defendant's initial failure to pay, which necessitated legal action. The court may consider awarding these fees to make the Plaintiff whole.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Overview:** \n\nMy partner has been going through a very drawn\\-out battle against the Portland police, mainly in regards to a single police officer. This officer had used various police resources and people to access personal information about my partner despite those inquiries having no lawful purpose. They also pulled information about family close to my partner too, which has been their own standalone case. This information gathering continued to happen on and off for years, some of which even took place after we told the city that we were concerned this may be happening \u2014 this was affirmed through an audit and investigation that took place.\n\nThis particular officer has also had a past of other misuse of police resources, some of which they've been punished for or put their job at risk of termination. Throughout our research, their action clearly violates policies and some of the guidelines deem these repeated actions as being immediate grounds for termination. However, the feedback we've gathered so far suggests that this officer not only wasn't terminated or adequately punished, but that they've continued to retain full access to these systems that were abused.\n\nWe're suspicious that there may be quite a few people in cahoots that is allowing this officer to avoid necessary punishment. Some of this suspicion comes from numerous contradictory claims in their communication compared to the documentation we received; the lack of transparency and effort when they were forced to report to other agencies (even ones above them); and that they have repeatedly went well beyond the deadlines of numerous statutes, resulting in some opportunities of tort to be impossible (we found these out afterwards, of course).\n\nIt's worth noting that we've contacted a few lawyers. Some claim this case doesn't align with what they practice or is much bigger than they can handle; others have claimed that it may not be financially feasible to fight.\n\n**Questions:** \n\n* If we went after the city (or state) for something like negligence (or whatever term fits the broad issues above), is it likely that we can recover monetary damages (and/or attorney fees) since they seem to have sided with the officer?\n\n\t+ My partner has diagnosed PTSD as a direct result of these ongoings.\n\t+ This case impacted my partner's ability to continue with college and they needed to drop out. They intend to re\\-enroll as soon as financially possible.\n* Are there any laws that force the police bureau to only retain quality officers for the public's best interest?\n\n\t+ Essentially, does the police bureau need a good reason for keeping this officer despite the guidelines saying they should be terminated?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are there any laws that force the police bureau to only retain quality\n>  officers for the public's best interest?\n\nThat depends on what the term \"quality\" is intended to mean; both officially, if such a standard exists, and your own definition.\n\n> If we went after the city (or state) for something like negligence (or\n>  whatever term fits the broad issues above)\n\nIn general, each governmental agency has a procedure for the public to lodge a complaint against an agent whom is acting within their official assigned duties, which would precede a formal civil action in a court of law, if the matter cannot be settled to your satisfaction at the administrative agency level.\n\n> is it likely that we can recover monetary damages (and/or attorney\n>  fees) since they seem to have sided with the officer?\n\nA civil action against any governmental agency is a time and resource consuming process, without any guarantees of victory whatsoever. \n\nEven a complaint filed at the agency level requires time, effort, resource expenditure and due diligence.\n\nSimply because an individual retains an attorney does not mean that your responsibility for your own claims can be relaxed and your efforts end when an attorney takes on your case. An individual would be prudent to be able to continually ask the attorney pertinent questions relevant to their prospective course of action, and, if possible, establish the course that the attorney will take themselves. \n\nThe decision of whether to pursue a local complaint or civil action in state or federal court challenging any action of a governmental agency should be analyzed from a cost\\-benefit perspective. \n\n* Are the individuals prepared for years of litigation?\n* What is the primary objective of the complaint or civil action?\n\n\t1. An injunction barring the entire agency from certain conduct and actions?\n\t2. Individual monetary judgment against a single agent for their conduct and actions?\n\netc.\n\nMany more questions need to be answered before commencing a protracted legal procedure against an individual acting in either or both their own and/or official capacities.\n\nThere will more than likely be an opposing party to your complaint or eventual civil action. The agency will more than likely not simply agree with your complaint and settle the matter with a remedy that is suitable to yourself and the agency.\n\nWhat you can do now is to phone as many civil law attorneys in your region that you can find whom specialize in actions against that type of governmental agency, describing your issue, and simultaneously visiting the law library in all of your spare time to perform your own research into similar actions brought by individuals against the same agency.",

Contacting multiple attorneys who specialize in such cases is recommended as an initial step to understand the viability and potential approaches to the case. Option A is premature without proper preparation. Option C is explicitly advised against, as the text states that retaining an attorney does not mean one's responsibility ends. Option D is too narrow in focus and doesn't address the broader preparatory steps advised. Therefore, B is the most appropriate initial step according to the given information."

The basis for that suit would be negligence, that is, they had a duty of care to you, but they failed to act in a reasonable manner to prevent the harm. A prominent question in such a case would be whether the damage was a foreseeable outcome (if not, there is no negligence), or one\\-time while foreseeable (if this is a repeat offense, the consequences to them of deliberately ignoring the problem could be worse). There is also the consideration of comparative liability, since you might have been able to avoid the situation by doing something else. In some states, any fault assignable to you means you lose, but in California they follow the pure comparative fault rule, where your portion of the liability is deducted from an award (but you can still collect something if it was 99% your fault).\n\n[Here](https://www.eater.com/2017/5/19/15662790/starbucks-hot-coffee-lawsuit-florida-100k) is an incident involving Starbucks (lids) where the plaintiff won, [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/11/starbucks-lawsuit-hot-coffee-cop-police-officer/27148147/) is one where the plaintiff lost",

Knowledge of the infringement is not required for direct infringement under this statute. While knowledge is a factor in contributory infringement (271(c)), it's not necessary for establishing liability in this case of direct infringement through sales."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm the defendant in a Maryland traffic case. It's an automated traffic enforcement ticket (red\\-light camera). I'm pleading not\\-guilty and have requested a trial. I'm not a lawyer but I have spent a lot of time in court successfully fighting traffic tickets and I have some legal background.\n\nIn my observation these red\\-light camera trials are usually perfunctory open\\-and\\-shut affairs where the defendant stands little chance of winning. Most of the time, they don't even have a good legal argument. There is little formality and the defendants hardly ever insist on asserting their full legal rights. Sometimes when they do, the prosecution and judge are caught unprepared. I hope to exploit this unpreparedness to win my case.\n\nIn a normal trial, the prosecution gives it opening statements, then the defendant gives their opening statement, then they cross examine each others' witnesses then they give closing statements. If one side fails to ask a question during the cross\\-examination, they cannot return to the cross\\-examination after the closing statements have started. Right? \n\nBut I have frequently seen traffic judges asking important questions about facts right before issuing their verdict. \"How fast were you going?\", \"Did you have your turn signal on\"? These seem to be questions that should have been asked by cross\\-examiners \\-\\- not the judge. If the prosecution failed to make their case when they had the chance, the judge should not help them by asking questions they failed to ask, right?\n\nIf \\-\\- after my closing statement \\-\\- the judge asks me factual questions that the prosecution forgot to ask, is it legitimate for me to raise an objection about it? Do you think its likely to be upheld? Would a good objection be something like \"Your honor the prosecution has to make its case without this court cross\\-examining on its behalf\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While you have correctly stated the usual order of events in a trial, the judge has wide discretion to modify the order if it seems that justice will be served. Even in a serious criminal case, the judge can reopen testimony after closing arguments have started if the judge finds that there is good reason to do so. Traffic cases are generally less formal, and the judge will more freely modify procedure to bring out the facts of the case. I have often seen judges at traffic court ask significant relevant questions, and if they are in fact relevant, i don't think you will get far objecting to their begin asked. I am not a lawyewr, but I also have observed several traffic cases in Maryland and in NJ.",

According to the documentation, judges in traffic court cases have wide discretion to modify procedures and ask relevant questions, even after closing arguments. This is especially true in less formal settings like traffic court. Objecting to a judge's questions is unlikely to be successful and may even harm the defendant's case. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge may ask questions at any point, not just after the prosecution's closing statement. \n\nOption B is incorrect because interrupting one's own closing statement to object to potential future questions from the judge would be highly unusual and likely ineffective.\n\nOption C is incorrect because objecting after a verdict has been issued would be too late and serve no purpose.\n\nOption D is the best answer because it recognizes the judge's authority and discretion in traffic court proceedings, and acknowledges that objecting to relevant questions from the judge is unlikely to be successful or beneficial to the defendant's case."

Word frequency lists derived from copyrighted works are considered factual information, which is not protected by copyright. As stated in the documentation, \"The frequency of words appearing in a given work is a fact.

The camera footage inadvertently captures parts of nearby houses and backyards. This footage was used as evidence in an unrelated lawsuit, and now the homeowner is being sued for invasion of privacy. During discovery, all available footage from the camera is requested. What is the most appropriate course of action for the homeowner?\n\nA) Refuse to provide the footage, citing privacy concerns for other neighbors\nB) Provide only selected portions of the footage that don't show other properties\nC) Destroy the footage to avoid potential legal issues\nD) Provide all requested footage as part of the discovery process\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, the purpose of discovery is for all parties to see all potentially relevant evidence before a trial. Even if the homeowner believes the footage might be used against them, they are obligated to provide it if requested during discovery. Refusing to provide the footage (A), selectively providing footage (B), or destroying evidence (C) could be seen as tampering with evidence or obstructing the legal process. The documentation emphasizes that \"You can't tamper with evidence\" and advises to \"Give them the footage and deal with what it shows in your case.\" It's important to note that the burden of proof still lies with the plaintiff, but withholding or altering evidence is not the correct way to approach this situation."

I'm not sure if I need to contact the person in the image directly, or the owner of the image, not even sure how to find that out.\n\n[I've read that](https://blog.printsome.com/printing-fan-art/) as long as I make it clear that the image is not official or linked to the person it should be ok. Also if the image is a parody or a criticism, or something that is highly transformative, that's also ok. Would my image manipulations fall within this category?\n\nMy questions are, what steps must I take in order to ensure the following is all legal;\n\n* setup an Instagram and post my photoshop work\n* accept commissions / requests and send this image back to a customer in digital format\n* sell my existing work\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several legal issues regarding this kind of image manipulation.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nThe first is Copyright. From the description, the modified images are *derivative works*. Making or distributing derivative works requires the permission of the holder of the copyright on the original (source) work. Some open source licenses (such as the Creative Commons licenses that do not include an ND clause) grant such permission in advance. Otherwise permission must be requested from, and granted by, the copyright holder or the holder's agent.\n\nIn the absence of permission this is copyright infringement. If advertised widely for a fee, a copyright suit is more likely, and might result in sizable damages. The holder might not grant permission, or might charge a fee. A lack of any answer from the holder must be treated as a \"no\".\n\nRight of Publicity\n------------------\n\nIn some jurisdictions a person has a \"right of publicity\" in his or her own image or likeness. This generally means that photos or images of the person cannot be used commercially without permission from the subject. In some places this right is limited to the use of such images in advertising, not as art subjects themselves.\n\nI don't know the extent of such rights in England and Wales, or elsewhere in the UK. In the US this varies by state. But if such rights apply, use of such images without permission can result in a suit and significant damages.\n\nDefamation\n----------\n\nIf showing an image of a person with added tattoos would tend to bring that person into disrepute, or make others think badly of that person, for example if the added tattoos were Nazi or gang symbols, then distributing such an altered image **might** be defamation. This would only apply if people actually thoguht the tattoos indicated that person's choice or attitude, or if reasonable people might think so.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBefore making this a business, even a hobby business, one would do well to consult a lawyer with IP expertise. There are significant legal risks here, which are increased by doing this for profit, and advertising it on the net. It might well be that in many cases appropriate permissions can be obtained free or cheaply, but it is not safe to assume this.",

Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the legal considerations they need to address?\n\nA) As long as the designer clearly labels the images as unofficial and not linked to the celebrity, there are no legal concerns.\n\nB) The designer only needs to obtain permission from the copyright holder of the original image, not the celebrity depicted.\n\nC) The designer must consider copyright laws, right of publicity, and potential defamation issues before proceeding with the business.\n\nD) If the manipulated images are highly transformative or considered parody, the designer is automatically protected from any legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it comprehensively addresses the main legal issues discussed in the documentation. The designer must consider:\n\n1. Copyright laws: Creating derivative works requires permission from the copyright holder of the original image.\n\n2. Right of publicity: In some jurisdictions, using a person's image commercially without their permission can lead to legal issues.\n\n3. Potential defamation: If the manipulated images could harm the celebrity's reputation, it might be considered defamation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply labeling the images as unofficial does not address all legal concerns. Option B is incomplete, as it doesn't consider the right of publicity or defamation issues. Option D is misleading, as even highly transformative or parody works are not automatically protected from all legal action. The documentation advises consulting with an IP lawyer before proceeding with such a business due to the significant legal risks involved."

The emails have a dual nature in terms of hearsay. They are hearsay if used to prove the truth of the complaints (i.e., that the tenant actually did what was alleged). However, they are not hearsay when used simply to show that the landlord received complaints, as this is a fact within the landlord's direct knowledge. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the emails are not entirely inadmissible.

Even with verbatim quotes and equations copied from the book, some amount of that is allowed under the [fair use doctrine](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info). There is not much (any) clarity in the law when it comes to educational\\-use quote\\-copying. However, based on your description, I would not conclude that this work counts as \"fair use\": but a judge or jury might decide it is, depending on the exact facts.\n\nIf you reduce a 600 page book to 200 pages, that sounds like \"copying\" while creating a derivative work. This would be especially the case if the structure of your book strongly resembled the structure of the original book, and what you did was omit some sentences and reword some sentences. On the other hand if you wrote an independent book on the topic, happened to reflect the original author's ideas, and even copied a small amount of text by way of illustrative quotes, then that resembles an independent creation rather than copying.\n\nThere are [4 plus factors](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7683/in-the-us-when-is-fair-use-a-defense-to-copyright-infringement) recognized in the fair use defense, where the fact\\-finder would somehow \"take into consideration\" these factors: purpose and character (non\\-profit, teaching, exegesis all in your favor), nature of the work (equations implies science hence facts, being factual favors fair use), amount and substantiality (not in your favor, if you're paraphrasing a whole book), and effect on market. As a first approximation, your work might have a devastating effect if your work is good and the original is expensive plus popular \u2013 you created a free competitor. Framed in terms of your intended original use, probably not so significant, limited to the size of your class (assuming that your work was a replacement for, and not a supplement to, the original \u2013 which may be what you did). The law isn't stated in terms of your intent in creating the work, it's stated in terms of what you did. Still, the fact\\-finders might be influenced by innocent intent. Then finally, there is \"transformativeness\" as a unifying consideration, so that copying that substantially transforms a work into a new work fares better under a fair use analysis \u2013 this would appear to be a quite transformative work.\n\nWhether or not the rights\\-holder is likely to go after you depends on many unknowables, especially whether there would be any point in suing you, and how much the publisher and author care.\n\nRegardless of the relationship between the original book and your version, you have created a work that is also protected by copyright. That means that it is illegal to upload your work to Scribd, Slideshare, or anywhere else, without your permission. When someone illegally uploads a work to a server, if you learn about it, you as author can file a [DMCA takedown notice](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24057/how-can-i-legally-protect-my-website-from-users-who-upload-copyrighted-material/24060#24060). A law\\-abiding service will then take the work down (unless the uploader officially claims he has the right to upload it). If they do claim they have the right, you have to sue them. So even if it's all over the internet, you can play whack\\-a\\-mole with copies and get many of them taken down.",

It's not definitely protected (ruling out A), nor is it clear infringement (ruling out B). The instructor does have the right to file DMCA takedown notices for unauthorized uploads, as they hold copyright on their own work regardless of its relation to the original book.

Although very unlikely, one might reach a different conclusion only if one is given additional context and/or additional contents of the article.\n\nIt appears that the focus of your question is the statement \"*the broader sentiment was endorsed*\". That statement does not appear to refer to the *acquitted individual* himself, but to the *people* or *community* who collectively hold(s) that \"sentiment\" (a sentiment which the statement does not even specify).\n\nThe statement is ambiguous also on whether \"*the broader sentiment*\" is about the accused for allegedly committing crime(s), or about the court for failing to serve justice. For a statement to be defamatory, it would have to \\[be false and] sufficiently identify \\-\\-even if indirectly or by implication\\-\\- the entity to which the statement refers. The aforementioned ambiguity means that there was no identification, whence the fact\\-finder would need to assess whether a reasonable person will interpret that statement as *referring to* the accused/acquitted individual.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the incriminating evidence and/or individual's inappropriate behavior was acknowledged by his own counsel mostly bars that individual from arguing that the statement at issue defamed him.

You cannot be arrested and imprisoned for allowing your gaze to pass over your neighbours lawn. It is legal for you to take out a tripod, canvas and paintbrushes and paint the general scene, even if it includes, for example, a tree standing on private land. Instead of a paintbrush, you may use a camera to create a picture of the scene.\n\nThere are a few exceptions\n\n* Some military installations\n* Some installations operated by the department of energy (e.g. some nuclear power stations)\n* You cannot photograph people where they have a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" \\- Note that this is not dependant on how the people feel about it.

The photographer doesn't need permission to take the photo from the homeowner or the person mowing the lawn. Publishing the photo is also generally allowed without permission from these individuals, as they are in a public view. However, if the sculpture in the front yard is an identifiable work of art, the photographer may need to obtain copyright permission from the artist before publishing the photo that includes the sculpture.

The law generally does not allow for vigilante justice or retaliation, even in cases involving sexual offenses against children. The father could face assault charges for beating up the offender, as this goes beyond the immediate need for self-defense or defense of others.\n\nHowever, the circumstances - including the sexual exposure to his children and the offender's aggressive approach - could potentially be considered mitigating factors that might reduce the severity of charges or punishment. The father might have a partial defense based on these factors, but his actions in beating up the offender rather than just defending against an immediate threat likely went beyond what would be protected under self-defense laws.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they overstate the legal protections for the father's actions.

There are issues regarding using a person's picture for business purposes without their permission (for example to sell a brand of toothpick) under the [right of publicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights), but that doesn't seem applicable here. Just posting a picture is not a problem, but adding a caption \"This person tried to break into my house\" or something like that could land you in legal trouble, where they sue you for defamation.\n\nIt isn't totally obvious what constitutes a defamatory statement: it is, approximately \"if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating with him\" (Restatement of Torts, Second). Words are not required, so a humiliating picture could count. An opinion or insult can't be the basis of a defamation suit, since such a statement isn't considered by the law to make a true or false statement. The worst possible accusation would be that the person was committing a crime, because that is a *[per se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law#Defamation_per_se)* defamatory statement and the victim does not have to prove that they suffered any loss; in the case of a *[per quod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_quod)* defamatory statement.\n\nOne way to defend against a defamation suit is to prove that the statement is true.

In particular:\n\n* Would, say, Shakespeare's works (published before the introduction of copyright) leave the public domain?\n* Would works previously under copyright whose original copyright term had already expired gain renewed copyright?\n* If the answer to the second question is yes, what would happen to derivative works of those works?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: See *[Golan v. Holder](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf)* 565 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2012\\).\n\nThe question was whether Congress could pass a law that caused works in the public domain to regain copyright.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that:\n\n> The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Historical practice corroborates the Court\u2019s reading of the Copyright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected works.\n\nSo, yes, works can come out of public domain and into Copyright protection.\n\nWhat about people who had been relying on the works not having copyright (i.e. people who had created derivative works, etc.)? That depends on how Congress intends the hypothetical law to apply to them. In the law in question in *Golan v. Holder*, Congress planned ahead for this, and included provisions for it in the law (quoting from *Golan v. Holder*):\n\n> Reliance parties may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce\u2014either by filing with the U. S. Copyright Office within two years of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance party. After that, reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a grace period of one year. Finally, anyone who, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, created a \u201cderivative work\u201d based on a restored work may indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the copyright holder of \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d to be set by a district judge if the parties cannot agree.\n\nLast, could Congress extend copyright for 10,000 years? In principle, the Supreme Court has not said anything against this, but they have indicated that there is some line beyond which a copyright term would no longer be considered a \"limited time\" as required by the Constitution.\n\nIn *Golan v. Holder* they mention in passing hypothetical successive re\\-applications of Copyright to a work after it expires, calling it \"legislative misbehavior\":\n\n> the hypothetical legislative misbehavior petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us.\n\nAnd in *Eldred v. Ashcroft*, they mention in passing hypothetical unlimited successive extensions of copyright, each of limited time, again calling that \"legislative misbehavior\":\n\n> Concerning petitioners' assertion that Congress could evade the limitation on its authority by stringing together an unlimited number of \"limited Times,\" the court stated that such legislative misbehavior clearly was not before it.\n\nI could imagine a court holding that the \"limited times\" clause in the Constitution does not permit Congress to extend copyright for 10,000 years, which is longer than the existence of the U.S. or any countries or even civilizations that the founders were aware of at the time of the Constitution's writing.",

Holder (2012), which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential extension of copyright terms and works in the public domain?\n\nA) Congress has no authority to extend copyright protection to works already in the public domain.\n\nB) The Supreme Court explicitly approved copyright terms of 10,000 years as constitutionally permissible.\n\nC) Works can be removed from the public domain and placed back under copyright protection, but Congress must provide accommodation for those who have relied on the public domain status.\n\nD) The Copyright Clause of the Constitution explicitly prohibits any extension of copyright terms beyond the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court's ruling in Golan v. Holder (2012) established that Congress has the authority to remove works from the public domain and place them back under copyright protection. The Court held that the Copyright Clause does not exclude such action. However, the ruling also emphasized that Congress should provide accommodations for \"reliance parties\" who had been using works they believed to be in the public domain. This is reflected in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court explicitly ruled that Congress can extend protection to public domain works. Option B is incorrect because while the Court has not ruled against very long copyright terms, it has suggested there may be limits to what constitutes a \"limited time\" as required by the Constitution. Option D is incorrect because the Constitution does not specify any particular copyright term length, leaving this to Congress to determine within the bounds of \"limited times.\""

The exemption applies to an organization whose 'purpose and character are primarily religious.'\" In all other respects, a religious organization is bound by the law that everyone else must follow. The EEOC defines [\"religion\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html#2-II-A-1-c) as \"includ\\[ing] moral or ethical beliefs as to right and wrong that are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views\", but that does not seem to encompass metaphysical beliefs (e.g. about reincarnation, who created the universe...). They also state that \"Religious discrimination also includes discrimination against someone because s/he is an atheist\". The wording there is of some significance, since it does not say that an atheist organization is a \"religious organization\" which would be entitled to discriminate in favor of atheists in hiring practices. The statutory [definitions section of the law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e) tells us that \"religion\"\n\n> includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as\n>  belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to\n>  reasonably accommodate to an employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s\n>  religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct\n>  of the employer\u2019s business\n\nwhich doesn't actually support the commission's decision to extend coverage to atheist employees. That interpretation comes from post\\-statutory case law, such as [Shapolia v. Los Alamos Nat'l Lab., 773 F. Supp. 304, 305](https://casetext.com/case/shapolia-v-los-alamos-nat-laboratory-2).\n\nWhat is unclear is what a \"religious organization\" is. The exemption comes from [42 USC 2000e\u20131(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e%E2%80%931):\n\n> This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the\n>  employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation,\n>  association, educational institution, or society with respect to the\n>  employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work\n>  connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association,\n>  educational institution, or society of its activities\n\nbut the definitions do not clearly state that an organization dedicates to denying religious beliefs is legally subsumed under the exemption.

However, this exemption is limited only to religious discrimination. In all other respects, such as discrimination based on race, gender, national origin, etc., religious organizations are bound by the same anti-discrimination laws as other employers.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the exemption is not complete - it only applies to religious discrimination.\n\nAnswer B is too narrow.

What is the general principle that keeps application of law sane, and not devolve into chaos and pedantry?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This ultimately is a matter of [Statutory Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation). One of the principles of statutory interpretation is that all words are interpreted in their context. For your example, that means we look at the title of 1464, \"Broadcasting obscene language\". From this it becomes apparent that radio is used in its common meaning of AM and FM radio broadcasts.\n\nStatutory interpretation is broader than that single rule, though. Legislative intent is another important factor, and that is rather effective in eliminating absurd arguments. Via the link above, from New Mexico's State Court: words have their ordinary meaning *\"as long as the ordinary meaning does not render the statute's application absurd, unreasonable, or unjust.\"* In other words, absurdity is so bad that the court will prefer an alternative interpretation of the offending words.",

The principle of statutory interpretation is explicitly mentioned in the passage as the key factor in preventing absurd interpretations of laws. This principle takes into account the context of the law, legislative intent, and aims to avoid interpretations that would lead to absurd, unreasonable, or unjust outcomes. The passage specifically states that courts will prefer alternative interpretations to avoid absurdity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while legislative intent is part of statutory interpretation, it's not the sole determining factor, and the legislature doesn't directly control interpretation.\n\nOption C touches on the idea of avoiding unreasonable results, but judicial restraint is not specifically mentioned and is not the primary principle described in the passage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it contradicts the main point of the passage, which emphasizes avoiding literal interpretations that lead to absurd results."

While automation itself is not inherently illegal, many websites explicitly prohibit the use of such tools in their terms of service. Users and developers need to carefully review these terms for each site they intend to automate.

The bank teller's refusal is likely due to regulations that restrict what non-licensed employees can discuss regarding account structuring and practices that might relate to anti-money laundering measures. While the teller's explanation of \"legal advice\" is imprecise, their caution stems from trying to avoid potential regulatory issues.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the teller may lack legal qualifications, this isn't the primary reason for their refusal.

Her 1 year fixed term lease expires at the end of February, leaving her about 4 days to move out after her quarantine period. Prior to leaving the country, she had planned to renew her lease, until the landlord indicated the rent would be increasing $100 per month.\n\nThe Landlord has made it clear that they have the right to show the premises at any time, and no intention of relinquishing that right, and therefore my daughter must find someplace else to reside during her 14 day quarantine. This would seem to meet the definition of a Frustrated Contract.\n\n\u201cA frustrated contract is a contract that, subsequent to its formation, and without fault of either party, is incapable of being performed due to an unforeseen event (or events), resulting in the obligations under the contract being radically different from those contemplated by the parties to the contract.\u201d Cut and pasted from Google.\n\nRealizing that my daughter would not be allowed to quarantine in her rented premises, we moved all her belongings into storage, cleaned the suite and turned in the keys a week ago.\n\nWe have also noticed a very strange clause in her lease:\n\n2\\.(c ) The Terms and Conditions and all Schedules of this Lease continue with the Occupancy of the Owner\u2019s property by the Tenant until the Tenant either signs a new lease with the Owner or vacates the premises, which ever occurs first.\n\nThis seems very strange to me, but it appears that the Terms and Conditions of the lease have no effect after the Tenant vacates the premises.\n\nSo the question is, do we file a claim for Frustration or simply that the Tenant has vacated the premises and rent is no longer payable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is not frustrated\n------------------------------\n\nThe fact that your daughter cannot reside in the premises for a period or that the landlord cannot show the premises does not amount to frustration. If the property had burned down \\- that might be frustration (if the lease didn\u2019t contemplate that \\- most do).\n\nUnfortunately, your daughter is obliged to comply with her obligations under the lease or she will be in breach. This includes paying rent until it ends and allowing the landlord to show the property as the lease permits.\n\nShe has correctly identified that if she quarantines in the property she will be preventing the landlord from showing it. She has two options:\n\n1. Quarantine elsewhere and comply with the lease,\n2. Quarantine at home, break the lease and pay damages to the landlord. The landlord would need to demonstrate that the breach had caused damage. That is, they would need to prove that being unable to show the property during the 2 week period had caused them to not be able to relet it and, probably, the maximum damage would be two weeks at the new rent \\- this would be full compensation for the two week delay in their ability to show the property.\n\nYour daughter chose 1\\., possibly without being aware that 2\\. was an option.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, parties must comply with their contractural obligations even if extraneous factors (like government regulations) make that more difficult. Civil law jurisdictions have the doctrine in law of [force majeure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure) but in common law jurisdictions, that concept is a creature of contract. That is, a party is only released from an obligation hindered by an external factor if the contract deals with it. For example, if a government mandate shuts down a construction site, the builder must still complete by the date for completion notwithstanding. Or, remember the ship stuck in the Suez Canal? Other ships delayed by that event would still be required to pay if they were late unless the contract released them (common law), but could claim force majeure if the contract was under civil law.\n\nThe narrower doctrine of [frustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration_of_purpose) requires that the *principal purpose* of the contract be impossible or radically altered by the extraneous event. The principal purpose of a residential lease is for the landlord to provide the dwelling and the tenant to pay rent: neither of these are affected so there is no frustration. The situation is certainly frustrating in an emotional sense but it isn\u2019t frustrated in a legal sense.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The lease contract is frustrated due to the quarantine requirement, releasing the tenant from further obligations.\n\nB) The tenant is in breach of contract for moving out early and may owe damages to the landlord.\n\nC) The landlord is in breach of contract for insisting on showing the property during the quarantine period.\n\nD) The tenant has no further obligations under the lease once they have vacated the premises and turned in the keys.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The quarantine requirement does not legally frustrate the contract, as the principal purpose (providing dwelling and paying rent) is not radically altered. By moving out early, the tenant may be in breach of the lease agreement. The landlord's right to show the property is typically protected in the lease. Vacating early and turning in keys does not automatically end the tenant's obligations under a fixed-term lease. The tenant may owe rent until the end of the lease term or until the landlord re-lets the property, whichever comes first."

If by \"across the state\" you mean some distance away but in the same state then the exact law will depend on which state you are in, but as a rule any \"conversion\" of property to the use of another counts as theft. In this case your aunt has \"converted\" the property to the use of your Nan (funny legal phrase). The fact that the people doing this are your relatives makes no difference.\n\n(When asking about the law here you should always say which state you are in.)\n\nAlthough theft is a crime, you could also start a civil case to get your property back without involving the police. The details depend on where you are, but try googling \"(your state) small claims court\". Many states have a process for collecting low\\-value debts or other property without needing lawyers.\n\nYou need to have a firm conversation with your aunt about this. Tell her that you want your property back, and don't back down. Also call your Nan and explain this to her as well; she may not have realised that she is in possession of stolen property, which is usually a separate crime.\n\nIf you want more advice on how to get your property back without starting a family row then you might ask on the Interpersonal Skills SE, but it might be better to start with \"When are you planning to return my property?\" and leave \"You are a thief\" as a last resort.\n\n**Edit:** As Eric Nolan points out in the comments, you may be a minor. If you are under 18 then your aunt has authority over you that she wouldn't have if you were older. For instance, if she is concerned about your use of video games impacting school\\-work then confiscating your console and putting it out of your reach would be perfectly legal.",

According to the documentation, taking someone's property without their consent and moving it to another location, even within the family, is considered \"conversion\" of property and counts as theft. The fact that the individuals involved are relatives does not change the legal status of the action.

Financially, it wouldn't be worth the cost of a lawyer.\n* Many of the folks doing the copyright infringement are in jurisdictions that look the other way. If you're a Russian citizen pirating content owned by American companies, the Russian authorities aren't going to cooperate and arrest you and the American companies likely can't recover any judgement they'd get because you don't have any assets in America.\n* There is a whack\\-a\\-mole problem. If there are hundreds of people posting pirated content to Facebook and each one is running hundreds of pages, that's tens of thousands of pages posting content. By the time you identify and close all of them, the pirates will have created tens of thousands of new pages.\n* There is a cat\\-and\\-mouse problem. Copyright owners have automated tools to scan for their IP to issue takedown notices. Piraters know this so they modify the video (posting it as a mirror image or adding some additional video elements) in order to evade the automated tools. If copyright owners have to manually identify pirated content, it's realistically not cost effective to do so. The humans finding that content would cost more than the business loses in revenue to pirates.\n* Tracking down the actual human/ business behind the copyright infringement is often a fair amount of work and may involve motions in courts in multiple countries. That work tends not to be highly prioritized by law enforcement. If you're a small fish, it is unlikely that anyone would go to the effort of unmasking you in order to sue.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a primary reason why copyright infringement on social media and leak sites often goes unprosecuted?\n\nA) Many infringers are \"judgment proof,\" lacking assets that make lawsuits financially worthwhile for copyright holders.\nB) The rapid creation of new infringing content makes it difficult for copyright holders to keep up with takedown efforts.\nC) Automated detection tools used by copyright holders are infallible and catch all instances of infringement.\nD) Infringers in certain jurisdictions may be protected by local authorities who are unwilling to cooperate with international copyright claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is incorrect and thus the answer to this question. Automated detection tools are not infallible; in fact, the passage mentions that infringers often modify content to evade these tools, creating a \"cat-and-mouse problem.\" Options A, B, and D are all valid reasons mentioned in the text for why copyright infringement often goes unprosecuted. A refers to the \"judgment proof\" nature of many infringers, B relates to the \"whack-a-mole problem\" described, and D addresses the jurisdictional issues that can protect some infringers from prosecution."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of international law and the UN Charter, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of warfare between two sovereign nations?\n\nA) A country can legally initiate war to reclaim disputed territory that it believes rightfully belongs to it.\n\nB) Wars of aggression are permissible under international law if the aggressor country has a historical claim to the territory in question.\n\nC) The UN Charter allows for warfare between member states as long as both countries agree to engage in hostilities.\n\nD) Only wars fought in self-defense are considered lawful under the UN Charter.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the UN Charter, wars of aggression are illegal under international law. The only type of warfare that is considered lawful is that which is conducted in self-defense. Options A, B, and C all describe scenarios that would be considered illegal under the UN Charter. Even if a country believes it has a legitimate claim to disputed territory, initiating warfare to seize that territory would be considered an act of aggression and therefore unlawful. The UN Charter prioritizes peaceful resolution of disputes and prohibits the use of force except in cases of self-defense or when authorized by the UN Security Council."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to copyright a video game I'm making but I want it to be part of a series where each title of the game will begin with the same prefix and end with a unique suffix for the game. I want to have ownership of the prefix so others cannot make any other games with it. For example, EA owns the Battlefield series and no one else can make games related to that. I think I'm probably thinking of more of a trademark and not a copyright but I'm not sure. How can I copyright/trademark and protect the prefix of my game for when I want to make another game related to the first? \n\nFor a different game I'm working on I want to include music made by composers who have their music protected under the CC 3\\.0 license and I have permission to use their works in a commercialised product as long as I'm not just reselling their music as is and without any form of modification. Obviously, since it's a game with graphics and other music that will be made by my team I will want to protect those assets and the game under a copyright, but if I copyright my project with music protected with a CC 3\\.0 license, would that cause problems with the copyright preventing me from protecting my stuff? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Titles / names are not protected by copyright. You might register a name as a trademark, but you would need to clarify with examples what you mean by \"prefix\" and a \"suffix\" (these have specific technical meanings in linguistics, and grammatical parts of a language \u2013 e.g. \"un\\-\", \"dis\\-\", \"\\-able\", \"\\-ation\") cannot be protected as trademarks. But straying from the technical meaning of prefix and suffix, as [USPTO points out](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BasicFacts.pdf), \"A trademark is generally a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a **combination thereof**\". If \"Apple\" can be registered and \"\\-tini\" can be registered, then the combination \"Appletini\" can be protected. \n\nWhether or not \"Apple\" can be registered as a trademark depends on whether there is a likelihood of confusion. In the domain of computers, it clearly would be, but not in the domain of trucks. A further consideration in trademark protection is whether it is \"descriptive\" versus \"fanciful\". A term like \"Flimptang\" does not at all describe a product, whereas \"Carwax\" effectively describes car wax. Descriptive terms way not be protectable \u2013 you can't lay ownership claim to ordinary words and meanings.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer wants to create a series of video games with titles that share a common prefix. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal protection of this naming convention?\n\nA) The developer can copyright the prefix to prevent others from using it in any game titles.\n\nB) The developer can trademark the entire game title (prefix + suffix) as a combination, but not the prefix alone.\n\nC) The developer can copyright the prefix if it's a unique and fanciful term not descriptive of the game.\n\nD) The developer can automatically prevent others from using the prefix once the first game in the series is released.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because titles and names cannot be protected by copyright. \nB is correct because trademarks can protect combinations of words, phrases, or symbols that identify a product or brand. The entire game title (prefix + suffix) could potentially be trademarked, but not the prefix alone.\nC is incorrect because even if the prefix is unique and fanciful, it still cannot be copyrighted as it's part of a title.\nD is incorrect because there's no automatic protection; legal measures like trademarking would need to be pursued.\n\nThe key points are that copyright doesn't protect names or titles, trademarks can protect combinations of words or phrases that identify a product, and the ability to trademark depends on factors like uniqueness and likelihood of confusion in the specific market."
