            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am from Mauritius and was supposed to take employment in Germany on the 23rd January in Dusseldorf. I was told by my company, who confirmed with the foreign office, that i should not require a visa to enter Germany and upon landing, i should go to the Foreign office to apply for residence permit.\n\nUnfortunately when i landed, the border officers didn't let me through and told me to go back to my country an apply for a visa.\n\nI did and today when i went to fetch my passport i was told that my visa application was denied because i was refused entry once.\n\nWhat is the next step i should do in order to get my visa? Many people have advised me to seek help with an immigration lawyer who is familiar with the German immigration.\n\nHelp please. Do i still h ave chance of getting a visa? Are there any kind of appeal i can make?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You were refused entry at a Schengen border control point because you intended to work but did not have the proper documentation to work. In order to work in the EEA you need to be an EEA national or have a work permit issued by one of the member states.\n\nSo you returned to your home country and filed a proper application which was refused...\n\n> I did and today when i went to fetch my passport i was told that my\n>  visa application was denied because i was refused entry once.\n\nThis is a *partial* reason only. Your refusal of entry was recorded on a database and there's an article at [On which registry or list are Schengen refusals of entry recorded?](https://gayotfow.wordpress.com/on-which-registry-or-list-are-schengen-refusals-of-entry-recorded/) describing the process. Despite internet lore that refusals of entry are not recorded and have no effect on a person's history, those events are in fact taken into account.\n\nBut I say '*partial*' because a visa refusal on this basis alone is disproportionate and unlikely to happen. You would have received a letter giving you you the lawful grounds for your visa refusal. \n\nYour questions...\n\n> Do i still h ave chance of getting a visa?\n\nYes. But given what's happened so far, it's likely you will need your next application to be represented by a practitioner with a practice area in work permit refusals. \n\n> Are there any kind of appeal i can make?\n\nYes, it is mandatory that the member state issuing a refusal provide appeals information whenever an appeal pathway is available to an applicant. It would be in your refusal notice. If you did not receive your refusal notice, or you misplaced it, you should submit a [freedom of information request](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/individuals/rights/index_en.htm) (or let your practitioner handle it).\n\n---\n\nIf you have a question about a specific work permit, you can use the [Expats site](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Mauritian citizen attempted to enter Germany for employment without a proper visa and was refused entry. They then applied for a visa from their home country, which was denied. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their situation and next steps?\n\nA) The visa application was automatically denied solely because of the previous entry refusal, and there is no chance of getting a visa in the future.\n\nB) The applicant should immediately appeal the visa denial without seeking legal assistance, as appeals are always successful in such cases.\n\nC) The applicant likely needs to consult with an immigration lawyer familiar with German immigration law, submit a new application, and may need to file a freedom of information request to obtain the full refusal notice.\n\nD) The applicant should attempt to enter Germany again without a visa, as the company's initial advice was correct and border officers made a mistake.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because:\n1. The visa denial was likely not based solely on the previous entry refusal, as this would be disproportionate.\n2. The applicant should receive a formal refusal notice detailing the grounds for denial and appeal options.\n3. Given the complexity of the situation, consulting with an immigration lawyer specializing in German law is advisable.\n4. A new, well-prepared application with professional assistance has a better chance of success.\n5. If the refusal notice is not available, a freedom of information request may be necessary to obtain full details of the denial.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect as they either oversimplify the situation, suggest inappropriate actions, or misunderstand the legal requirements for entry and work in Germany."

Y is a long\\-time member of the cult and has a fatal disease and the doctors give Y a month to live. Cult members live in a common compound and live all aspects of life within the compound. Many have been raised from an early age in the cult. X and the cult gather for the ritual killing of Y. X stabs and kills Y and then finds that Y cannot be brought back to life. Is X guilty of reckless or negligent homicide?\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe way I see it, X is guilty of negligent homicide. Reckless homicide is a reckless disregard for the safety/lives of others. However, X thought this would work. I think it would be reckless homicide if X had done it before and had been unsuccessful, but this is his first killing.\n\nIs this the right way to think about it? Is there a law or case that applies to this to strengthen my reasoning? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This assumes there is a difference under the law between reckless and negligent homicide (which does not exist everywhere). In Washington state there is a distinction between 1st and 2nd degree manslaughter, per [RCW 9A.32\\.060 and .070](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.32&full=true#9A.32.060). What could be called reckless homicide is when\n\n> (a) He or she recklessly causes the death of another person; or (b) He\n>  or she intentionally and unlawfully kills an unborn quick child by\n>  inflicting any injury upon the mother of such child.\n\nand 'negligent homicide' would be\n\n> A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when, with\n>  criminal negligence, he or she causes the death of another person.\n\nThe distinction is laid out in [RCW 9A.08\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.08.010), compare\n\n> A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and\n>  disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or\n>  her disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from\n>  conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\n\nand\n\n> A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when\n>  he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act\n>  may occur and his or her failure to be aware of such substantial risk\n>  constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a\n>  reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.\n\nHowever, it is important to know what \"knows\" means:\n\n> (i) he or she is aware of a fact, facts, or circumstances or result\n>  described by a statute defining an offense; or\n> \n> \n> (ii) he or she has information which would lead a reasonable person in\n>  the same situation to believe that facts exist which facts are\n>  described by a statute defining an offense.\n\nThe fact that X has manufactured a nutty belief that killing a person doesn't lead to death does not override the fact that a reasonable person would know that stabbing a person in the heart will in fact kill them, and is murder. You could put that in contrast to the situation where he has a belief that stabbing a victim in the butt will cure him, and he is unaware that the victim's heart is freakishly in the wrong place, near his wallet \u2013 that would be negligence (being unaware). \n\nIn general, you aren't given legal credit for having bizarre beliefs about how the universe works, unless it can be turned into an insanity defense.",

Even though X had a bizarre belief about resurrection, the law states that a person \"knows\" something if \"he or she has information which would lead a reasonable person in the same situation to believe that facts exist which facts are described by a statute defining an offense.\" A reasonable person would know that stabbing someone is likely to cause death. X's manufactured belief does not override this standard of knowledge. Furthermore, the law doesn't generally give credit for bizarre beliefs unless they can be used as part of an insanity defense. Therefore, X would likely be charged with first-degree murder, as he intentionally caused Y's death, regardless of his belief in resurrection."

In reality, enemy agents could potentially face prosecution under the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920, which might lead to execution after conviction by a court or court martial. However, the most common approach was actually to turn captured spies into double agents under the Double-Cross System. This allowed British intelligence to feed false information back to the enemy.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's legal liability?\n\nA) The company cannot be prosecuted for past actions because the majority of employees involved no longer work there.\n\nB) The company is immune from prosecution as long as it has changed its corporate values and practices.\n\nC) The company can still be held legally responsible for past actions, regardless of changes in personnel or stated values.\n\nD) The company can only be prosecuted if current employees were involved in the past corrupt practices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: A company is considered a legal person, separate from its employees or management. Therefore, it can be held accountable for its past actions, even if the individuals involved are no longer with the company. Changing corporate values or replacing employees does not erase a company's legal responsibilities or liabilities for past conduct. The principle of corporate personhood means that the company's legal identity persists despite changes in personnel, and it can be investigated and prosecuted for violations of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regardless of when they occurred or who was employed at the time."

Most locally, [this question](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/96713/how-does-windows-10-allow-microsoft-to-spy-on-you) on the Stack Exchange network makes some of the same claims.\n\nHowever, it seems that many of those sources have conflated the developer pre\\-release version of Windows 10 with the official release, and I'm having trouble separating the wheat from the chaff. My goal in asking this question is to look past the sensationalist reporting and see what rights Microsoft holds.\n\nThe official [End\\-User License Agreement](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm) for the final retail release of Windows 10 says the following:\n\n> **Privacy; Consent to Use of Data.** Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or receive information when using those features. Many of these features can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement (aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the software features.\n\nThe referenced [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx) says the following:\n\n> Microsoft collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. \\[...] We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device.

In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.\n\n---\n\nPutting aside the technical question of what information the software actually does collect (which would be off topic)...\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the retail version of Windows 10:\n\n* How does Microsoft's claim to user data differ from previous versions of Windows?\n* Does Microsoft have the right to record arbitrary keystrokes or clicks made while using their operating system and send that data to external servers?\n* Does Microsoft have the right to share user usage data with third parties (such as advertising agencies), either at a price or without compensation? Despite saying that they currently don't use data directly from our personal files for this purpose, do they have a right to begin doing so at any time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (**2019 update** See comments for my exchange with @benrg updating this 2015 answer. In particular, they do a fair job of representing a much less \"paranoid\" take on MS's take on users' privacy than my highly skeptical one. Also, the links in the answer below are to the latest versions of the respective documents. Archive.org has 2015 versions at [2015 EULA](https://web.archive.org/web/20150801002634/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm) and [2105 privacy statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150930181210/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx).)\n\n[IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL). This answer is just a broad picture. It's a simple explanation of Microsoft's own words, as they were at the time of originally writing this (just after the final release of Windows 10\\).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **Microsoft does *not* recognize users' privacy rights.** The [Microsoft Privacy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) does not say *anything* positive about privacy in this document that isn't contradicted by their own words elsewhere in the same document.\n* **Microsoft *does* explicitly reserve rights to share users' private data** with just about anyone and everyone.\n* **Microsoft explicitly disallows legal recourse regarding privacy.** The [Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm) comprehensively denies legal recourse related to privacy (and indeed anything other than IP disputes).\n\n---\n\nIt's Microsoft's offerings as a whole, not (just) Windows 10\n============================================================\n\nThe key document to focus on is [Microsoft's Privacy policy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/).\n\nThis policy applies to many Microsoft products and services, including, but definitely not limited to, Windows 10\\.\n\nMicrosoft reserve the right to share your private data\n======================================================\n\nQuoting the \"Privacy\" document, Microsoft reserves the right to share users' private data:\n\n> among Microsoft\\-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries\n> \n> \n> with vendors or agents working on our behalf\n> \n> \n> as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets\n> \n> \n> \\[to] comply with applicable law\n> \n> \n> \\[to] respond to valid legal process\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect our customers, for example to prevent spam\n> \n> \n> \\[to] operate and maintain the security of our services\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect the rights or property of Microsoft\n> \n> \n> as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized\n\nDo users have any privacy rights?\n=================================\n\nOne can presumably fight for one's (perceived) rights even if Microsoft attempts to deny them.\n\nHowever, from the [English Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm):\n\n> you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve \\[a dispute] informally. If we can\u2019t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration ... and not to sue in court\n\nAdditionally, collective action or any other form of representative action is explicitly disallowed.\n\nWindows 10 data collection defaults to \"Full\" mode\n==================================================\n\nYou've said that *what* data is collected is off topic. But I think it's worth recognizing that, with Windows 10, Microsoft have made the most popular install option collect and send to their cloud all data collected from your local device (\"Full\" collection) and have effectively made it a breach of contract to reduce it below a minimal level (\"Basic\" collection) that they get to determine and change as they see fit. And they can pretty much enforce the latter; if you hack a system to stop \"Basic\" data being sent to MS, they explicitly disable updates for that system.",

[https://www.businessinsider.com/places\\-where\\-salary\\-question\\-banned\\-us\\-2017\\-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/places-where-salary-question-banned-us-2017-10) \n\nHowever, in each interview situation multiple states can be involved, so I'm wondering how to determine which law(s) apply here. Options are \n\n1. Residence state of candidate and/or interviewer\n2. Headquarter state of the company\n3. State where the company is incorporated (mostly Delaware these days)\n4. State where the interview takes place (could be two, if it's a phone or video call)\n5. Location of work place (often not known during exploratory phase)\n\nThe last one seems like a reasonably choice, but it many cases it's not been determined yet. For example, my current employer has offices in multiple states and we leave it up to the candidate to pick the location they like best. That happens fairly late in the game and sometimes only after the offer has been signed, so any salary negotiation would happen before that.\n\nAnother example: if it's a Work Remotely gig: Is it the candidate's resident state or the nearest company location, where you need to show up once a month?\n\nRelated: [Will New York City's new law prohibiting questions about salary history protect residents who are applying for jobs outside the city?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18797/will-new-york-citys-new-law-prohibiting-questions-about-salary-history-protect) gives a partial answer but is less comprehensive.\n\nAlso related: [Statutory Rape: Which State's Laws Apply?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19559/statutory-rape-which-states-laws-apply). This one concludes \"state is determined by the location of the offense\". If we apply the same logic here, we'd get \"physical location of the interviewer at time of interview\". Which would mean that an interviewer from New York (here it's illegal) could just drive over the river and make the phone call from New Jersey (where it's legal).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None, any or all\n----------------\n\nThere are two related questions here:\n\n1. Which court has jurisdiction? When a case is brought the first thing a court does is look at the facts and the relevant law (both the law relating to the facts and the law that empowers the court itself) and make a decision if it has jurisdiction to hear the case. In most cases, this is not an issue so the decision is tacit. A court may not have jurisdiction for all sorts of reasons: there is a money value limit, there is a geographical limit, the parties do not have standing etc. Note that multiple courts can have jurisdiction at the same time allowing the plaintiff to 'forum shop' their case: for example, it is much better to bring a defamation case almost anywhere in the world over the USA.\n2. Which law applies? A court, having decided it does have jurisdiction, needs to decide which law applies. Again, multiple laws may be applicable at the same time depending on the wording of the laws and precedent. So, New York courts can have jurisdiction to decide a case under Texas law.\n\nAny of your suggestions may or may not engage jurisdiction or legal system of none, any or all of the relevant states \\- it depends on the circumstances of the particular case and the wording of the particular statute. For example, assume NY has a law applying only to businesses and TX has a law applying only to residents \\- a NY business interviewing a TX resident would be captured by both while a TX business interviewing a NY resident would be captured by neither.",

The interviewer is physically located in Texas during the video call interview. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the applicability of laws prohibiting salary history questions?\n\nA) Only California law applies, as it's the company's headquarters location.\nB) Only New York law applies, as it's the candidate's state of residence.\nC) Only Texas law applies, as it's where the interviewer is physically located during the interview.\nD) Laws from California, New York, and Texas may all potentially apply, depending on the specific wording of each state's statutes and the circumstances of the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because, as explained in the documentation, multiple jurisdictions may have applicable laws in such a situation. The company's headquarters (California), the candidate's residence (New York), and the interviewer's physical location (Texas) could all potentially have relevant laws that apply to this interview scenario. The applicability would depend on the specific wording of each state's laws and how courts interpret jurisdiction in such cases. It's not accurate to assume that only one state's laws would apply, as employment law can be complex when crossing state lines, especially in remote work situations. Therefore, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is that laws from all three states may potentially apply, and careful consideration of each jurisdiction's statutes would be necessary to determine the full legal implications of the interview process."

Specifically: \n\nAn American lands in JFK and CBP demands to search electronics, under what circumstances does the authority have standing to search / seize (review \\& copy) the information in the device? Assume that the citizen has not committed any criminal act nor is she acting suspicious or setting of any flags. Does the 4th amendment requiring searches / seizures to be reasonable no longer apply at border checkpoints?\n\nWhat are the contours of expecting privacy in this scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a long\\-standing border search exception to the usual 4th Amendment no\\-search protections, but there still are limits. As you know, warrantless searches are allowed when an arrest occurs in public and is based on probable cause, and searches and seizures of limited duration and intrusiveness may be allowed given reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The [border search exception](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep473/usrep473531/usrep473531.pdf#page=8) (US v. de Hernandez) means that limited searches are allowed at border crossing without any suspicion at all. This happens to also hold of the \"extended border\" that reaches in to the US by 100 miles, but only in connection with immigration issues. In the case of [Riley v. California](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf), SCOTUS held that searching digital information on a cell phone requires a warrant, with certain exceptions pertaining to officer safety or destruction of evidence. No risk is posed by data on a cell phone, so no compelling government interest is posed by requiring a warrant to search a cell phone. The *seizure* of a cell phone, in aid of obtaining a warrant or in connection to officer\\-safety issues on the other hand could be reasonable.\n\nThe question of just how intrusive a search is allowed in the border crossing context is not clearly resolved: a cursory search is reasonable, an intrusive search is not. Full\\-scale forensic searches are unreasonable. In [Alasaad v. Nielsen](https://casetext.com/case/alasaad-v-nielsen-1) (Nov 12, 2019\\), the district court in Massachussetts ruled against a warrantless search which was \"non\\-cursory\", which gives you a state of the art view of what is allowed. In this case,\n\n> an advanced search is defined as \"any search in which an officer\n>  connects external equipment, through a wired or wireless connection,\n>  to an electronic device, not merely to gain access to the device, but\n>  to review, copy and/or analyze its contents\"\n\nThe alternative, under CBP policy is\n\n> a basic search, which is merely defined as \"any border search that is\n>  not an advanced search.\"\n\nPolicy requires reasonable suspicion for an advanced search. In this case, a number of individuals (US citizens and one LPR) were subjected to an advanced search of their cell phones. In connection with these searches, data was copied and retained for an extended period of time.\n\nThe court points out that the border search exception applies to \"routine inspections and searches of individuals or conveyances seeking to cross our borders\", where \"routine search\" is defined in terms of cursoriness \u2013 the court concludes that forensic searches are by nature non\\-routine (get a warrant). This seems to kick the can down the road (what is a forensic search) \u2013 the court has some suggestions:\n\n> Basic searches, defined only as any search of an electronic device\n>  that is not an advanced search, can access content from space\n>  physically resident on a device using the devices' native operating\n>  system.\n\nSo,\n\n> Using a device's native operating system, a basic search can access\n>  content from the allocated space physically present on the device, it\n>  can extend to any allocated file or information on the devices and,\n>  for devices that contain metadata, it can reveal \"the date/time\n>  associated with the content, usage history, sender and receiver\n>  information or location data.\"\n>  Even in a basic search, agents can peruse and search the contents of\n>  the device, using the native search functions on the device,\n>  including, if available, a keyword search. An agent conducting a basic\n>  search may use the device's own internal search tools to search for\n>  particular words or images\n\nThe court does not address the question of what it means by \"a device's native operating system\" (Given things that I installed on my laptop which are not part of the OS, you can get a lot more information than you can with plain vanilla Win10\\). This, at least, suggests where the line is \u2013 it's about the tools that you use to obtain the information.",

Will it lead to legal issues ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is likely that someone will be offended, no matter what you do. From a legal perspective, India has [constitutionally protected freedom of expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression_in_India), but that doesn't mean you can say absolutely anything anywhere with no legal consequences (you can't threaten to kill a person). Restrictions are allowed under section 2 of [Article 19](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_III#Article_19_.7BProtection_of_certain_rights_regarding_freedom_of_speech.2C_etc..7D) for reasons of \"public order, decency or morality\". There are, thus, [laws against \"hate speech\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India#Laws_restricting_the_freedom_of_expression) (which are unconstitutional in the US). Penal Code section153A says\n\n> Whoever (a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by\n>  visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote,\n>  on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language,\n>  caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or\n>  feelings of enmity, hatred or ill\\-will between different religious,\n>  racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, or (b)\n>  commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony\n>  between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or\n>  castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the\n>  public tranquillity, . . . shall be punished with imprisonment which\n>  may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\nNeutral quoting of Hitler is not *per se* forbidden hate speech, and unlike certain European countries, display of a *svastika* is not against the law \\-\\- probably not even the *Hakenkreuz*. What a court would look at is whether a given quote is \"likely to disturb the public tranquillity\".",

This action could be seen as promoting \"disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups,\" which is explicitly prohibited. It's also the most likely to \"disturb the public tranquility,\" a key consideration in applying hate speech laws in India."

Is a person's dying will not the final say unless extenuating circumstances are proven?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A child is not property, therefore a (deceased) parent cannot transfer ownership. In case the sole custodial parent dies, the court will appoint a guardian for a minor child, and will take into consideration the wishes of the deceased parent, however their primary duty is to protect the interest of the child. It follows from this that objections to nomination of Smith as guardian are more easily sustained, since the requirements for being a guardian (e.g. [in Washington](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=11.130&full=true)) are stricter than the requirements for receiving $100,000\\. RCW 11\\.130\\.090 excludes any guardian who has been \"convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, neglect, or use of physical force or other crime relevant to the functions the individual would assume as guardian\", but such a person is not barred from inheriting property.\n\nThere are limited formal grounds for contesting a will: testator mentally incompetence, formal failure of the document, (the laws surrounding signatures and witnesses), no clear indication that the document is intended to be a will, forgery or fraud, undue influence (such as a gun to the head), or mistake (for example, mistakenly believing that their child was dead therefore leaving it all to a neighbor). So it is possible, but not so easy, to contest a will.\n\nOrgan donation takes place under separate laws: you can't wait for the probate process to get finished in three months before donating organs.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy businessman, John, dies unexpectedly, leaving behind a 10-year-old daughter. In his will, John explicitly stated that he wants his daughter to be raised by his best friends, a married couple with no children of their own. However, John's parents (the child's grandparents) contest this decision, claiming they can provide a better life for the child due to their greater wealth. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The court must honor John's will without question, as it represents his final wishes.\nB) The grandparents' claim of greater wealth automatically overrides John's stated preference in his will.\nC) The court will consider John's wishes but will ultimately make a decision based on the best interests of the child.\nD) John's will is invalid because he cannot transfer custody of a child as if it were property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In cases involving the guardianship of a minor child after the death of a parent, the court's primary duty is to protect the interests of the child. While the court will take into consideration the deceased parent's wishes as expressed in their will, these wishes are not absolutely binding. The court will evaluate all relevant factors, including the child's relationship with potential guardians, their ability to provide care, and the child's best interests overall. The grandparents' wealth may be a factor, but it's not the sole determinant. The court will weigh all aspects of the situation to make a decision that best serves the child's welfare.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while a will is an important document, it's not the final say in matters of child custody. Answer B is wrong because wealth alone doesn't automatically override other considerations in guardianship decisions. Answer D is incorrect because while it's true that a child is not property to be transferred, this doesn't invalidate the entire will or the expression of the parent's preferences regarding guardianship."

As quoted in [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/450800-bernie-sanders-says-he-would-move-to-rotate-supreme-court-justices-if): \n\n> \"I do not believe in packing the court,\" Sanders said during the second of the first two 2020 Democratic presidential debates. \"We\u2019ve got a terrible 5\\-4 majority conservative court right now. But **I do believe constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts and that brings in new blood into the Supreme Court** and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has a right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the United States of America.\"\n\nFor background, [Article III, Section 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section1) of the US constitution is in full:\n\n> The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\n\n[Article II, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii), states in part:\n\n> \\[The President,] by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for...\n\n**Is Sanders' claim (in bold above) correct?** Does the US President, or anyone else for that matter (other than a Supreme Court justice choosing to retire from their position on the Supreme Court) have the power to \"rotate\" those judges to other courts? \n\n*Consistent with Sanders' claim, this question is asked under the **current** US constitution assuming no amendments; just about anything is possible via amendment.*\n\nAlso, while a bunch of folks on Law.SE might be able to speculate or find persuasive arguments posted in answers below, who would be able to *authoritatively* decide the constitutionality of such a question, with all Supreme Court justices having clear conflict of interest on the matter?\n\n---\n\nA couple law professors posts proposals [here](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/9/6/17827786/kavanaugh-vote-supreme-court-packing) (and in more detail [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3288958), reviewed [here](https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/12/academic-highlight-epps-and-sitaraman-on-how-to-save-the-supreme-court/)), one for a rotating panel of appeals court judges to serve on the Supreme Court, and another for a 15\\-justice Court with 5 appointed by each party and 5 picked unanimously by those 10, without the ability to hear cases if those seats are empty. There is also a proposal [circulating](https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1144578878951874560) for 18\\-year term limits followed by remainder\\-of\\-lifetime service on a circuit court. If any of those, or other strategies, appear constitutional at present, an explanation of why would be a great answer, as would be an explanation of why *any* proposal involving rotation consistent with Sanders's quote would not be possible under the current constitution unamended.\n\n---\n\n*Note: The question framing intentionally excludes consideration of any person or military force who might have the physical firepower to remove Supreme Court justices in a way that would leave them unable to serve as a judge in another federal court. That's not \"rotating\" off.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will only address this part of the question:\n\n> Who would be able to authoritatively decide the constitutionality of such a question, with all Supreme Court justices having clear conflict of interest on the matter?\n\nThe Supreme Court could still hear such a case, as the justices make their own decisions about when to recuse themselves. In particular, they might decide to hear the case based on the \"Rule of Necessity\", which says roughly that a biased judge is better than none at all: a judge can hear a case, even in the presence of a conflict of interest, if there is no other way for it to be heard. See [*United States v. Will*, 449 U.S. 200 (1980\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/449/200/), in which the Supreme Court ruled 8\\-0 that federal courts could try a case related to the salaries of federal judges.\n\nAnother possibility is that the case could be brought in a lower federal court, say District Court. There is a question here: the Supreme Court has [original jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_jurisdiction_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) in \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls\" (US Constitution, Article III, Section 2\\), and I do not know whether Supreme Court justices are \"public Ministers\". However, if a lower court did have jurisdiction, it could rule on the constitutionality of the question, since a District Court judge would not have a significant conflict of interest. The relevant Circuit Court of Appeals could presumably hear an appeal. If the Circuit Court's ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court felt that they all had conflicts of interest (and decided not to invoke the Rule of Necessity), then they could simply not vote to grant certiorari, in which case the Circuit Court's ruling would stand.",

The Supreme Court could potentially hear a case challenging the constitutionality of rotating justices by invoking the \"Rule of Necessity.\" This principle allows judges to hear cases even when they have a conflict of interest if there is no other way for the case to be heard. The Supreme Court applied this rule in United States v.

While a constitutional amendment might be one way to allow rotation, the question is about addressing the constitutional challenge under the current Constitution.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because even if lower courts initially heard the case, there would still be potential for Supreme Court review, either through granting certiorari or by choosing not to hear the case, thus letting a lower court ruling stand."

Would this be illegal under copyright law? technically I didn't copy anything because I translated a page using google translate, then fixed up the words so the meaning is more clear. So technically I am re\\-writing some words, and the words are not from the original source but are just from applying google translate to a page.\n\nFor example, I originally have this online documentation:[https://cohesiondocs.acquia.com/6\\.1/tutorials/using\\-acquia\\-cohesion\\-existing\\-website](https://cohesiondocs.acquia.com/6.1/tutorials/using-acquia-cohesion-existing-website)\n\nthen I use the google translate chrome extension to translate the page:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jPc7.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jPc7.png)\n\nSome of the words are wrong so I fix them up and make a post on my own website.\n\nWould it be legal If I say \"originally translated from this site\" or just list the site as a reference?

Could someone find it and link it in their answer, and interpret how the copyright text answers my question?\n\nEssentially, I could translate the whole documentation by myself to avoid this problem. However, that's quite tedious and is much easier if I use the automated tool that is Google Translate, then do a Quality Check and fix up the errors.\n\nIf copy\\-pasting the google translate is illegal, then exactly how much must I edit, move around sentences, change words, and such until the text is no longer plagiarized? Is this plagiarism or copyright infringement? where can I check the copyright for the above link?\n\nIt would really help to get some feedback and some things to watch out for. \n\nThe thing is, even if I do write information originally, it ends up really similar to the original document because it's mainly just a step\\-by\\-step guide to doing things (which don't have much room to be changed). So is it more about the mode in which the new document is created, rather than how similar the actual document is to the reference? If I write my own step\\-by\\-step guide on how to use some software, even if it is very similar to the original, it's totally legal? So many how\\-to guides are similar out there.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A translation is a [devivative work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work) \\- the copyright owner has the exclusive right to these\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, yes, translation is *prima facie* copyright infringement. \n\nStrictly speaking, if *you* translate it, it's a derivative work because you exercised creativity in making the translation; what Google translate does is not a derivative work, it's a copy because there is no creativity. Either way, only the copyright owner can do (or authorise) this.\n\nWhether it's legal or not depends on if what you are doing falls within one of the exceptions to the applicable copyright law such as [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) or [fair dealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing). \n\nAttributing the original author does not, of itself, allow translation.\n\n> Additionally, I'm not able to find the copyright documentation for the site link I provided above.\n\nWhat is \"copyright documentation\"?

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To briefly summarize the situation, a video game was made fifteen years ago. Two development companies and one publisher were involved. All three companies have now been sold to other companies, some of them several times, and some copyrights they held were sold independently of the companies themselves. There doesn't seem to be a record of this particular game's copyright in any of these deals (the game did not sell particularly well).\n\nSpeaking with members of the original development team, it is believed the publisher had the original copyrights, but none of them are sure. The copyright does not appear on <http://cocatalog.loc.gov/> using any conceivable search. The company most likely to have picked up copyrights from the original publisher is not responding to communication attempts.\n\n**In the US, is it possible to find out who owns a copyright? If so, how is this done?**\n\n**UPDATE** The game was first published in Europe, then the [PAL region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region), finally being published in the US. I'm only concerned with the US copyright, but it appears the dates and locations of original release may be important to consider. At least some development occurred in England.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright law is a country\\-by\\-country matter. Most countries are signatories to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), which provides a common framework, but there are still variations, generally in the duration of copyright or the definition of copyrightable material.\n\nAccording to the [Hirtle chart](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm), a *video game* that was first published *in Europe* in the year *2000* and subsequently published in the United States is still copyrighted in both the United States and whichever European countries it was published in. It is likely to be a work of corporate authorship, so the US copyright will expire on January 1, 2096 (unless a law extending the duration is passed).\n\nIn the United States, the requirement to register a copyright was eliminated in 1989 as part of the [Berne Convention Implementation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988); registration still provides benefits when filing a copyright\\-infringement lawsuit. Most European countries eliminated their registration requirements much earlier, if they had them at all: the Berne Convention dates from 1887\\.\n\nCopyright does not simply cease to exist when the owner does, or if the owner cannot be determined. The difficulty of tracking down copyright holders for old or little\\-known works is the driving force behind [orphaned works legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works). There are no orphaned works laws in the United States, and since copyright is country\\-by\\-country, European laws won't help you if you're interested in publishing in the US.\n\nIn order to track down the copyright holder, you'll need to figure out who originally held the copyright (probably the publisher, but it could be either development company, or both, or the game might be a collective work of the individuals who worked on it). If it was a work of corporate authorship, and none of the game\\-copyright sales mention it, copyright will have been transfered when the company owning the copyright was sold (as part of a general \"and all intellectual property\" clause).",

Based on this scenario and U.S. copyright law, which of the following statements is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The copyright has expired because the original companies no longer exist.\nB) The copyright is now in the public domain due to lack of proper registration.\nC) The copyright still exists but may be difficult to trace to its current owner.\nD) The copyright automatically transferred to the game's original developers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The copyright still exists but may be difficult to trace to its current owner. Copyright does not expire simply because the original owner no longer exists or cannot be easily identified. In the U.S., copyright registration is not required for protection, though it offers benefits in infringement cases. The copyright would have been transferred during company sales as part of the intellectual property assets, even if not explicitly mentioned.

But I realized the answer *might* be **four** (that is, `a2`, `a3`, `b2`, `b3` all count as derivative works of the original code \\-\\- but **not sure**), given that in the copyright law (using [US copyright law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) as an example):\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nThe definition given in the [Apache 2\\.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) is more direct:\n\n> \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\nI think a key point a software is different from a book/painting/movie is that software is very much a \"live\" thing \\- that is, software is constantly being updated after being \"published\". Especially, each small iteration (commit) of an open source project is accessible publicly, instead of periodically being made public after accumulating a few months' works behind the scene.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Four\n----\n\nYes, each version is a derivative work, as mentioned in [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14\\.pdf](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf)\n\n> The following are examples of the many different types of derivative works:  \n> \n> ...  \n> \n> A new version of an existing computer program",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a software development scenario, repository A contains versions a1, a2, and a3 of a program. Repository B is forked from a1 and contains versions b2 and b3. How many derivative works exist in total?\n\nA) 1 - Only repository B is a derivative work\nB) 2 - a2 and a3 are derivative works\nC) 3 - b2, b3, and either a2 or a3 are derivative works\nD) 4 - a2, a3, b2, and b3 are all derivative works\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to copyright law and the Apache 2.0 license definition, each new version of a software program that represents an original work of authorship is considered a derivative work. This includes both minor updates and major revisions. In this scenario, a2 and a3 are derivative works of a1, while b2 and b3 are derivative works of a1 (via the fork). The US Copyright Office circular specifically mentions that \"a new version of an existing computer program\" is an example of a derivative work. Therefore, all four versions (a2, a3, b2, and b3) qualify as separate derivative works."

Option A is too definitive, as names alone are not protected. Option B overlooks the health information aspect of birth. Option D is incorrect because the hospital's social media practices don't negate the nurse's potential violation, and such posts likely have parental consent. C is the most accurate, acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the potential for a HIPAA violation due to the combination of name and health information."

When the fight escalated to its peak, I called the police. I then did not hesitate to show them my injuries (which were scratches and thus immediately visible\\-\\-hers were bruises that did not show up till later), but she refused to cooperate with the police and even lied to them that she started the whole fight by dumping hot tea on me. She did, in fact, dump *warm* tea on me, but that was not what started the fight. She defended me and then the police decided to arrest her, at which moment I realized I fucked up and repeatedly asked the police to forget about it and stop the arrest, to no avail.\n\nShe got charged with misdemeanor battery which then got dropped by the state attorney about a month later because it would've been a bogus prosecution. The fact remains that my record is spotless despite inflicting much more damage on her and she is facing all the stress of the legal system and every lawyer I speak to says using **her** one\\-time expungement card is the only way to remove the arrest from her record. Better yet, she is studying to become a teacher and I've been told that even with expungement she will need to disclose to all potential employers that she was arrested and why. **Is there any legal recourse to get her record cleared as if she never got arrested, potentially at my expense?** There's not a doubt in my mind that she got the short end of the stick both from me and this flawed justice system.\n\nShe is from Virginia and probably will not be teaching in Florida: do state boundaries affect the interaction between arrest disclosure and public records, with or without expungement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a \"one time\" expungement rule in Virginia.\n\nUnder [Section 19\\.2\\-392\\.2](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-392.2/), a person whose charges have been nolled can file a petition for expungement.

As he can claim that when handling over the cans his intention was to provide the beer only (cans contents) and not motorbike. One simmilar case that could be used is `barren cow` [where both assumed that cow was barren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_v._Walker), court ruled that contract invalid... Same is here I am pretty sure that buyer didn't have intent on giving moto away... Although the case above is indeed contract law and beer can is a gift and not a contract... Does mutual mistake rule applies to gifts?\n\n**Who gets to keep it? Person who bought it or person who opened the can?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the buyer gave the beer away, the recipient gets the winnings. But he could explicitly give away just the content of the beer can, and not the ring tab that entitles one to something of value. Ordinarily, one would understand the gift of a car of beer to include the can, so if that is not your intent, you should be clear that you're only giving away the fluid content, and you expect to get the can back. You could take the controversy to local courts and see what they think about this; maybe Khmer Brewery has contest rules which you can read.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Cambodia, a person buys 10 cans of beer that have a lottery feature where one can win prizes like additional beer, money, or even a motorbike. The buyer takes these cans to a friend's house and one of the cans wins a motorbike. According to legal principles, who has the right to keep the motorbike?\n\nA) The buyer of the beer, as they purchased the cans and didn't intend to give away potential prizes.\nB) The friend who opened the winning can, as they were gifted the entire can including its contents and potential prizes.\nC) The beer company, as they retain ownership of prizes until claimed.\nD) It depends on whether the buyer explicitly stated they were only giving away the liquid contents of the cans.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The ownership of the prize depends on the specifics of how the gift was presented. If the buyer explicitly stated they were only giving away the liquid contents of the cans and not the cans themselves or any potential prizes, they could claim ownership of the motorbike. However, if no such clarification was made, it would typically be understood that the entire can, including any potential prizes, was gifted. This aligns with the principle that gifts, once given, belong to the recipient unless explicitly stated otherwise. The buyer would need to have been clear about retaining ownership of the cans and any associated prizes to have a valid claim on the motorbike."

If so, can anyone please point me to any statute(s) and/or case law that would illustrate such an outcome? Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is no. You don't have to leave until the term of the lease ends or you are required to move based upon some new default under the lease.\n\nI'm not sure that there would be case law exactly. The default rule is that you don't have to move unless there is a reason that you have to move. The landlord brings suit under the law to get an order from the court granting the landlord possession and evicting you. If that order isn't granted, the landlord is back where he started without a right to evict you, which is the status quo.\n\nIf you were forcibly removed from the premises by the landlord without an order (particularly when it has been legally adjudicated that he doesn't have a right to evict you), you would probably have grounds to sue the landlord for wrongful eviction and there might be criminal charges that apply as well against the landlord and everyone who participated in the wrongful removal.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, a tenant is named in an Unlawful Detainer action. The tenant answers the Summons and Complaint, appears in court, and the judge rules in the tenant's favor. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal position after this ruling?\n\nA) The tenant must vacate the premises immediately, as the Unlawful Detainer action has concluded.\nB) The tenant can stay until the lease ends, but must pay double rent for the remaining period.\nC) The tenant can remain in the property under the existing lease terms, unless a new valid reason for eviction arises.\nD) The tenant gains permanent residency rights and cannot be evicted for any reason in the future.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a judge rules in favor of the tenant in an Unlawful Detainer action, the tenant is not required to move out. The ruling essentially maintains the status quo, allowing the tenant to continue residing in the property under the existing lease terms. The landlord's attempt to evict the tenant has been legally rejected, so the tenant's occupancy rights remain intact.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the tenant winning the case means they do not have to vacate.\nAnswer B is wrong as there's no legal basis for doubling rent after winning an Unlawful Detainer case.\nAnswer D is too extreme; while the tenant can stay for now, they don't gain permanent residency rights immune to all future eviction attempts.\n\nThe key point is that the tenant can remain in the property, but they must still adhere to the lease terms, and the landlord could potentially file for eviction in the future if new, valid reasons arise."

I intend to take them to the [ACAT](https://www.acat.act.gov.au/).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, you cannot sue\n------------------\n\nWhen you signed up to Uber you agreed to their [Terms and Conditions](https://www.uber.com/legal/terms/au/). In Section 6, you agreed that disputes should be settled first by Mediation and, if that fails, by binding Arbitration \\- both under the respective International Chamber of Commerce Rules. These will be have their seat in Amsterdam and be conducted under Dutch law. This does not mean that you will need to travel to Amsterdam \\- you will be able to participate remotely.\n\nNotwithstanding, the [Australian Consumer Law](http://consumerlaw.gov.au/the-australian-consumer-law/) (ACL) cannot be excluded by contract or choice of law clauses and will still apply. Of direct relevance here is the consumer guarantee (Part 3\\-2\\) that services will be provided with \"reasonable skill and care\" and that this is a 'consumer contract' and subject to the unfair contract provisions of Part 2\\-3\\.\n\nThe dispute resolution clause 6 is not unfair \\- Australian law supports alternative dispute resolution and a term is not unfair if it is allowed by law.\n\nThe Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity Clause 5 is problematical for Uber as, while limitation of liability clauses are not *ipso facto* 'unfair', when the seek to limit liability for a breach of a consumer guarantee, they must be limited to what can be excluded by s64A. As written, these are far broader and, notwithstanding the savings clause about 'applicable law' they would probably be held to be misleading. A misleading term is *ipso facto* unfair. You may be able to approach the court to have Clause 5 declared an unfair term under s250 before proceeding to arbitration \\- the court may defer that decision to the arbitrator of course.\n\nYou can, of course, sue the driver. Uber maintains that their drivers are contractors and not employees (which may or may not be true). If Uber is right, you have no contract with the driver and are free to bring a negligence suit.",

While the Australian Consumer Law still applies and cannot be excluded, the dispute resolution clause is considered valid and not unfair under Australian law.

The initial term of the lease was for 1 year and then converted into a month to month tenancy after the first year.\n\nThe home was sold to a new owner, N and N moved to terminate the tenancy immediately after purchasing the home by sending out a Notice to Quit that terminated the tenancy after 1 month. Even though N terminated the tenancy, N continued to accept rent from T for two months *after* the termination date on the Notice to Quit.\n\nT wants to dispute both the underlying grounds for termination as well as the validity of the Notice to Quit.\n\nT's original lease from the previous owner, O contains an arbitration agreement. Can T legally force N to arbitrate both the underlying grounds for termination and the validity of the Notice via arbitration, not in court?\n\nAccording to @ [David Siegel](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86498/36096), the arbitration agreement is binding on N just as it is on the original owner.\n\nCan the new owner, N, argue that s/he isn't bound by the arbitration agreement since T is in a month to month tenancy and s/he moved to terminate the tenancy as soon as s/he purchased the home?\n\nWhether or not N is bound by the arbitration agreement depends on two factors:\n\n1. analysis of the underlying contract \\- whether it is binding only during the first year or also during the month to month\n\nParagraph Term states that:\n\n> the term of this lease is for 1 year\n\nand that:\n\n> the parties are bound to this lease for the entire initial term, and\n> any additional term as per Section \"Renewal\"\n\nSection Renewal states that:\n\n> After expiration of the term, this lease shall continue as a month to\n> month tenancy until terminated by either party\n\nIs the month to month tenancy considered an \"additional term\"?\n\n2. whether he is bound by the terms of the lease by law once he accepts rent\n\nCan T legally force N to arbitrate the validity of the Notice to Quit \\& the underlying cause for eviction during the month to month tenancy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The arbitration agreement is probably binding to arbitrate the validity of the notice to quit. Once the leases and ended and the original tenants are gone, those leases are probably spent, however, and at that point the arbitration agreement lapses.\n\nCourts tend to err very generously on the side of enforcing arbitration agreements which there is a plausible connection of contactual ties to the original agreement signed by both sides.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is probably the governing law, so the analysis is fairly uniform nationally.\n\nThe \"Renewal\" language states that the lease survives into the month to month period after the initial term. Consider, for example, that the terms related to the security deposit, maximum occupancy, pets, and who pays for which utilities would remain in force. If the lease still has effect so does the arbitration clause.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court surveys the circumstances under which someone other than an actual signatory of an arbitration agreement can be bound by it in *In re N.A. Rugby Union v. U.S. Rugby Football Union*, [2019 CO 56](https://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/supreme-court/2019/19sa22.html), starting its general overview of the law at \u00b6 19 (on page 8\\), after reviewing the facts of the particular case and its procedural posture. While it is less than obvious, it is piecing together FAA cases rather than merely applying Colorado law, so its analysis has potentially broad applicability as a persuasive precedent in other jurisdictions. The core holding, at \u00b6 21 (citations omitted), is that:\n\n> \\[C]ourts have observed that ordinary principles of contract and agency\n> law may apply to bind a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement.\n> Specifically, these courts have recognized the following theories for\n> binding a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement: (1\\) incorporation\n> of an arbitration provision by reference in another agreement;\n> (2\\) assumption of the arbitration obligation by the nonsignatory; (3\\)\n> agency; (4\\) veil\\-piercing/alter ego; (5\\) estoppel; (6\\)\n> successor\\-in\\-interest; and (7\\) third\\-party beneficiary.\n\nIn this case, theories (2\\) and (6\\) are particularly relevant to reaching the same result in the month\\-to\\-month period with a new owner that it would have reached with the same landlord and same tenant who signed the original lease.\n\nThese theories are spelled out in more detail in a review article [here](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/-/media/files/nyaw-2020/practical-law-joining-nonsignatories-to-an-arbitration-in-the-us-w0113186-pdf.pdf).",

This means that Yuki's current marriage, even though not conducted in the US, is still considered valid and binding. To legally marry Alex in the US, Yuki would need to first divorce their current spouse. The location of the previous marriage (whether in the US or abroad) doesn't affect its validity in the eyes of US law. Multiple simultaneous marriages are not recognized in the US, so Yuki cannot maintain two marriages. Returning to the home country for divorce is not necessarily required, as long as a legal divorce is obtained and recognized by both countries involved."

You cannot ask a person a question about their sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation (gender identity and employment are established law in Washington, and possibly the law at the federal level), but at least under present legal standards, a question about preferred pronouns is not necessarily in violation of that restriction. However, it is implausible that such a question would be asked in a interview for the purpose of not offending the candidate, since pronouns are sex\\-uniform for first and second person, so you would simply address the candidate as \"you\". Asking for preferred pronouns in an interview is tantamount to asking for prohibited information on sex and sexual orientation.\n\nVery many questions that can lead to bias, and are perfectly legal, for example \"Have you ever operated a fork lift?\" creates a bias against a person who gives a negative answer, when the job is operating a fork lift. There are protected categories such as sex and religion, and asking questions about those categories can lead to legal action against the company. [This](https://www.hum.wa.gov/employment) is the state's list of prohibited categories, which includes\n\n> Opposition to a discriminatory practice; Presence of any sensory,\n>  mental, or physical disability; Use of a trained dog guide or service\n>  animal; HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C Status; Race/Color; Creed; National\n>  Origin;Sex (including pregnancy); Marital Status; Age (40\\+); Sexual\n>  Orientation, including Gender Identity; Honorably discharged Veteran\n>  or Military Status; State Employee or Health Care Whistleblower Status\n\nSince you refer to the hiring entity as a \"company\", I assume the entity is a private business. A private business may mandate that an employee express a particular viewpoint in the course of employment, or prohibit them from doing so. So if the boss tells you to use or not use a particular word, that is legal.\n\nAn exception would be if there is a religious basis for your resistance to complying with the employer's rule. An employer cannot mandate that you act contrary to the principles of your religion, and they must make reasonable accommodations in case there is some conflict. Thus if your religion prohibits you from eating lettuce or working on Saturday, they cannot force you to do these things. I am not aware of any religion that actually dictates that it is forbidden to address a biological female who identifies as male as \"he\", but that doesn't matter, since the law also does not make determinations as to what are \"legitimate religious beliefs\". If a person purports that they must, according to their religion, use the pronouns \"she\" (etc.) when speaking of a biological female, then that is the end of the matter: the employer must make a reasonable accommodation. In other words, it depends on why the interviewer doesn't want to.",

He is convicted of third degree rape and that's it. What exactly that he did that the jury think truly happen that cause his conviction? We'd never know.\n\nFor example, some argue that all penetrative acts, or all prostitution, as non consensual, for example. In US, for example, you can't hire a girl to be both personal assistant and sugar baby. So saying that third degree rape happens if the sex is not consensual don't really add much.\n\nIt'll be pretty helpful if anyone can have a sample, like in Harvey's case, of what exactly he did that results in his conviction? Did he offer money? Fame? Promotion? Does that count as non consensual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He was indicted on many charges including 1st degree rape. So your question is why the jury returned the specific verdict, and did not convict on all charges. There is no record of the jury deliberations, so the best we can conjecture is that they didn't find the other charges to have been proven, and in lieu of a tell\\-tale juror, we can't know what evidence persuaded the jury. He was convicted on counts of criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree, but acquitted of two counts of predatory sexual assault, and it is suggested by media who make suggestions that this is because the jury did not believe the testimony of Annabella Sciorra.\n\nThe crime of third degree rape (the charge involving Jessica Mann) is when a person engages in nonconsensual sex with another person. The crime of first degree rape, a charge that he was acquitted on, is when a person\nsubjects a victim to nonconsensual intercourse through forcible compulsion, or when they are incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless.\nA person is guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree if they engage in oral or anal sex with someone who is incapable of consent, or if they use forcible compulsion.

However both claimant and employer settle before Tribunal Hearings through negotiation of a COT3 agreement. Can the ex\\-employee later face defamation claims by the employer regarding their dismissal?\n\nFor example, the ex\\-employee claims their dismissal is because of reason X while the employer has claimed at the time it is categorically not because of reason X but Y \\& Z. The ex\\-employee mounts their tribunal claim on the fact that Y \\& Z have not resulted in dismissal for other staff so X must be the reason. If the claimant shares their believe that X is the reason for dismissal, with friends or colleagues, can they later face defamation charges?\n\nI understand Defamation in the terms of [this HSE page](https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/reporting-defamation.htm).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Typically in defamation law, claims made persuiant to litigation are not defamatory, since they are going to be tested for validity if the case goes to trial. I'm not familiar with any differences in what is generally done in settlements between the U.K. and the U.S., but since both are Common Law countries, and Settlements are very common in civil proceedings in the U.S., it's a good start.\n\nGenerally a settlemant can occur anytime before the verdict of the case is rendered, although usually it will happen after preliminary hearings during the Discovery phase. In the U.S., Discovery is very broad and one need not prove that the requested items contain evidence but might contain evidence. This means that, for example, you could request a substantial amount of e\\-mail records from the opposing party because somewhere on the company e\\-mail server, there might be something to help your case. And even if after you sift through the emails and find no smoking guns related to your case, you could find some dirty laundry that's unrelated but still damning... if not more so than the initial case. Many people, especially big compainies, would rather just give the ex\\-employee some what he/she wants, if it means they don't get to see the proverbial man behind the curtain.\n\nAdditionally the practice might fall into a legally gray area of the law that, if it reaches trial, could hurt the company or even the industry if a judge rules against the company, effectively saying that this gray area is now definately illegal. Better to eat the loss of capital with the settling out of court than to take the much larger hit of the buisness practice being illegalized all together.\n\nTypically in settlements, both parties agree to terms and sign a contract. While the whole of the terms are never discussed, almost all include that the plaintiff will drop the case and never bring the matter to court again and that both parties will sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) meaning that they won't discuss the rest of the settlement terms with anyone not party to them.\n\nIf the plaintiff does break the NDA, the defendant can sue for breech of contract and recover at the least the monitary compensation they awarded in the settlement. Conversely, if the respondent breaks the NDA, the plaintiff can refile their initial suit with the addition of breech of contract (and this time it will get to court... and all the dirty laundry sees the harsh light of day.).\n\nWhile the respondent in a settled case can possibly sue for defamation if the plaintiff said the respondent did what the initial suit claimed they did (legally, it was never proven or disproven), or they were guilty (again, since no verdict was reached at trial, no guilt was established), the breech of contract is a much more airtight case and doesn't open up discovery to the respondent's cupability in the settled case (since the breech is about discussing the settled case at all, not the validity of the accusations of the settled case). Typically they would not go this route because then it opens the can of worms the settlement was trying to keep a lid on.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The ex-employee is fully protected from any legal action by the employer due to the settlement agreement.\n\nB) The employer can successfully sue the ex-employee for defamation, as the dismissal reasons were never proven in court.\n\nC) The employer is more likely to pursue a breach of contract claim if the COT3 agreement included a non-disclosure clause, rather than a defamation claim.\n\nD) The ex-employee can freely discuss the details of the case without fear of legal repercussions, as freedom of speech protects their right to share their personal beliefs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. While the ex-employee might face legal consequences for discussing the case, a defamation claim is less likely and more complicated for the employer to pursue. This is because:\n\n1. Defamation claims related to legal proceedings are typically more difficult to prove, as statements made in the context of litigation are often protected.\n2. Pursuing a defamation claim could potentially reopen the original dispute, which the employer likely wanted to avoid by settling.\n3. If the COT3 agreement included a non-disclosure clause (which is common in such settlements), the employer would have a much stronger and more straightforward case for breach of contract.\n4. Breach of contract claims are generally easier to prove and don't risk exposing additional company information, unlike a defamation case which might involve further discovery.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they overstate the protections afforded to the ex-employee. Option B is less likely because defamation claims in this context are more complex and risky for the employer to pursue compared to a breach of contract claim."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential copyright infringement?\n\nA) The developer risks copyright infringement by using similar gameplay mechanics, even if all other elements are original.\n\nB) As long as the developer doesn't copy the exact code, there's no risk of copyright infringement regardless of how closely the mechanics are replicated.\n\nC) The developer can safely recreate the game mechanics without infringing copyright, but must be cautious about using any original names or lore.\n\nD) Copyright does not protect game mechanics or methods of play, so the developer can recreate these aspects without infringement as long as the expression is original.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the U.S. Copyright Office, copyright does not protect ideas, systems, or methods of playing a game. It only protects the particular expression of these elements in literary, artistic, or musical form. Therefore, recreating gameplay mechanics is not copyright infringement as long as the developer creates their own original expression of these mechanics through new code, artwork, and other creative elements. The developer should avoid copying specific artistic assets, lore, or names from the original game to ensure they're not infringing on the copyrighted expression of the original work."

Once copyright expires, books are considered public domain and you don't need permission to reproduce or copy etc.\n\nBooks, as well other types of creative works listed at [17 USC \u00a7102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102), are automatically protected by copyright even without a copyright notice. You need the permission of the copyright owner to reproduce or transmit such works.\n\nOn top of that is generally accepted to make a copy (often referred as backup copy) of a work protected by copyright for you own benefits. That means that if you bought a printed book and you want to read on your e\\-book reader, you could scan it and store on your device. However you must keep in mind these:\n\n* It's meant for your personal use;\n* You can't share it\n* You'll be considered responsible if somebody else gets a copy of that book\n\nFurthermore in some countries, laws explicitly forbidden to scan the whole book without the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nIt's worth to ask the publisher for permission to scan it if you want to read on you e\\-book reader for personal use. Some publishers offers digital copies of their book (either for free or for a very small charge) and you'll get a better copy than what you could scanning the book.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright considerations for this project?\n\nA) All books published in the 1960s are now in the public domain and can be freely digitized and distributed.\n\nB) The library can digitize any book that doesn't have a visible copyright notice, as these are automatically in the public domain.\n\nC) The library needs to check the death dates of the authors and can only digitize books whose authors died more than 70 years ago.\n\nD) The library should assume all books are under copyright protection unless proven otherwise, and seek permission from copyright holders before digitizing.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Copyright protection is automatic for creative works, even without a copyright notice. The duration of copyright is typically 70 years after the author's death, not from the publication date. Books from the 1960s are likely still under copyright protection. The library should assume works are protected and seek permission from copyright holders before digitizing, unless they can definitively prove a work is in the public domain. Option A is incorrect because the 1960s are too recent for automatic public domain status. Option B is wrong because lack of a copyright notice doesn't mean a work is in the public domain. Option C is partially correct about the 70-year rule, but this would rarely apply to 1960s books, and the library shouldn't rely solely on author death dates without considering other factors."

I have been stopped by the police, and they told me to open the window. However it is not an obvious requirement, as communication is possible through a closed window, and any document exchange could be done by say placing the documents on the windscreen while the officer is not near the vehicle.\n\nIf one found oneself in such a situation, would it be legal to refuse to open the window, and to conduct the interview in a way that does not expose oneself to the risk of physical assault?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, one must obey lawful orders from a police officer during a traffic stop, or indeed any encounter where the officer is engaged in official police business. An order to open the window, or indeed to get out of the car, is generally lawful.\n\nIf one suspects that the \"officer\" is actually an imposter, or that the officer is a real officer but may use unlawful violence, one is entitled to take some measures of protection. One can use a cell phone to call emergency services and report the incident, asking if the person making the stop is a legitimate officer. This is particularly desirable if the car is unmarked and the person is not in police uniform. One can ask to see a badge or other police ID. One can drive, slowly, to a nearby police station, or to a well\\-lighted, public place where others are likely to be about. The call to emergency services has the advantage that the call will be officially recorded, and if the person is not an officer, actual officers will probably respond quickly.\n\nIt is a good idea to communicate intentions to go to a station or public place so that an actual officer will not think the driver is trying to flee.\n\nHaving an in\\-car video recording setup may also be a good idea.\n\nBut once the driver has good reason to believe that the officer is legitimate, instructions to open the window or come out of the car should be obeyed. Failure to obey may itself be a crime, depending on the jurisdiction.",

Calling emergency services allows the driver to verify the officer's identity through official channels while also creating a recorded account of the incident. Clearly communicating intentions shows cooperation and reduces the risk of misunderstandings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refusing all commands, even after verification, could be seen as non-compliance and may escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nOption B is dangerous and illegal. Fleeing at high speed could lead to charges of evading arrest, even if the initial stop was illegitimate.\n\nOption D is insufficient. While asking to see a badge is reasonable, judging its authenticity through a closed window is unreliable and doesn't provide the same level of security as contacting emergency services.\n\nThe correct approach balances safety concerns with legal obligations, allowing for verification while demonstrating a willingness to comply with legitimate law enforcement."

Which states have the most lax restrictions, and how do they differ from the general restrictions?\n\n**EDIT**: At what point does an uninvolved lawyer's public commentary on a case constitute a legal opinion which, according to ethics rules, requires due diligence to be done by the uninvolved lawyer? At what point does the due diligence needed become so great that it can only be done someone with access to non\\-public information, and thus the uninvolved lawyer is certainly violating ethic rules? \\[**NOTE**: This isn't *my* understanding of bar ethics rules, but that of someone I'm arguing with.]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As George White says, it's hard to prove a negative, but in this instance, there's quite a bit of evidence supporting you. First, *the ABA has standards for legal commentators* but they are very weak. They say pretty much what you would expect, and, they are *non\\-binding:* they explicitly say they \"*not intended*\" to provide grounds for \"professional discipline.\" Second, there are articles by lawyers indicating there are no state bar standards. Taken together, the weak ABA standards and the articles should give you enough evidence to prove your case in the \"court of buddy opinion.\"\n\nThe [ABA](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards/crimjust_standards_fairtrial_blk/) rules on legal commentators were issued in 2013 as part of a *Fair Trial and Public Discourse Black Letter*. The letter covered public comments on cases by lawyers involved in the case, lawyers not involved (ie, commentators) and judicial and judicial employees.\n\nAccording to the ABA, the standards are:\n\n> intended to provide a *guide to best practices* for lawyers who provide public commentary or consult on criminal cases in which they are not personally involved; (Standard 8\\-1\\.1(a)(ii))\n\nTo explain what it meant by a \"guide to best practices,\" the ABA included the following caveat about the applicability of the standards:\n\n> While these Standards are intended to provide a basis for the formulation of internal guidelines within lawyers\u2019 offices...**they are not intended to serve as the basis in and of themselves for the imposition of professional discipline...**(Standard 8\\-1\\.1(c))\n\nIn other words, the ABA's rules truly are just a *guide* to best practices.\n\nAs for the guidance itself, it does not come close to requiring \"due\\-diligence.\"\n\n> A lawyer who is serving as a legal commentator **should strive** to ensure that the lawyer\u2019s commentary **enhances** the public\u2019s understanding of the criminal matter and of the criminal justice system generally, **promotes respect** for the judicial system, and **does not materially prejudice** the fair administration of justice, in the particular case or in general. To that end, a legal commentator **should:**\n> \n> \n> (i) Have an understanding of the law and facts of the matter so as to be competent to serve as a commentator;\n> \n> \n> (ii) **Refrain from providing commentary designed to sensationalize a criminal matter**; and...\n\nIt may be that some states provide more stringent restrictions, but a quick search suggests they don't. Otherwise, there would not be a law review [article](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/iplj/vol26/iss1/4/) arguing \"The Legal Profession Must *Broaden* Ethical Standards for Legal Commentators,\" or an [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/law-camera-action-attorney-commentators) article (from this June) giving advice on becoming a legal commentator without mentioning state bar restrictions.\n\nI'm sure if you look, you can find more evidence.",

The standards encourage legal commentators to enhance public understanding of criminal matters and the justice system, promote respect for the judicial system, and avoid materially prejudicing the fair administration of justice. However, these are presented as recommendations rather than strict rules. The standards do not require extensive due diligence or access to non-public information, nor are they uniformly enforced by state bar associations.

According to copyright law, the creator of the code (Alice in this case) retains full ownership of their work, unless there is a written contract transferring the copyright or the work was done as part of employment or as a work-for-hire. The act of uploading code to a repository, even a private one owned by someone else, does not transfer ownership or grant usage rights. Without an explicit license or permission from Alice, Bob's startup cannot legally use the code in their product. The presence of Alice's name in the header further reinforces her claim to ownership.

It appears that what is \"over reached\" is an *occupier's* (e.g. a tenant) overriding interest. Also to explain in the context of overriding interest:\n\n1. Normally, when one purchases land \"unencumbered\", one has all the property rights associated with that land.\n2. It is possible to distribute interests in the land to other parties (e.g. tenancy, or granting a right to use a portion of a stream on a given property for fishing).\n3. It is possible to register such interests in the Land Registry; if such interests are not registered, they \"die with the grantor\" or at least with their interest.\n4. There are certain interests that do not need to be registered with parcel in the Land Registry. These are the \"overriding\" interests, that \"override\" the rule that interests need to be registered to survive transference.\n5. The overreaching doctrine allows distributions or sales from trusts to \"overreach\" certain overriding interests into the real property. The overreaching doctrine therefore is a means of \"quieting\" a title to real property.\n\nWith that in mind:\n\n1. \"trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust\"\n\nImagine scenario \\#1, a trust exclusively of money. The trustee\ndivides the money appropriately, and gives (distributes) it to the\nbeneficiaries. Straightforward.\n\nNow, imagine scenario \\#2, a trust exclusively of property (clothes,\njewelry, automobiles, other goods and yes, real estate). It is quite\npossibly for a trustee to sell such goods on the open market, and\ndistribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries of the trust. Likewise,\nscenario \\#3, in which the trust contains property (it need not be of\nexclusive composition). It is possible, rather than to sell property\nand distribute money, to distribute other property directly to\nbeneficiaries, e.g. one's parents die, and one inherits their house\n(generally that would be through a will not a trust, but the two instruments are similar).\n\nThus, \"The overreaching doctrine is not confined to sale of trust property; it will also apply where the trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust.\" can be read as \"regardless of whether the trustee sells the property to a third party, or distributes it to the beneficiary, the overreaching doctrine applies\".\n\n2. Those beneficiaries will receive the property absolutely and, since there is no exchange product, there will be no replacement property in which the remaining beneficiaries have an equitable proprietary interest \\[emphasis mine].\n\nImagine a scenario where a trust grants 3 beneficiaries (let's call them Alice, Bob and Charlie) equal stakes in say, a house. One beneficiary wishes to own the house outright ( Alice), and so a fair price for the house is determined (3 pounds, or 3 million pounds) and the first beneficiary pays it to the trust, as in scenario\\#2 above. However, generally what what happens is that the first beneficiary would only actually pay only a fraction of the price, divided proportionally among the other (\"remaining\") beneficiaries. E.g. the house is determined to be valued at 3/3million pounds, so Alice pays 2/2million pounds to be split between Bob and Charlie. The money is the \"replacement property\".\n\nMy reading of the bolded section is that it is clarifying that in the case where the real property is distributed, rather than sold. E.g. Imagine a trust with a 1 million pound house, and 2 million pounds in \"cash\" money; the trust could distribute the house to Alice, and a million pounds each to Bob and Charlie.\n\n\\#3\\.

In this scenario, the trustee distributes the trust property (the house) directly to Alice, and the remaining cash is divided between Bob and Charlie. This aligns with the explanation that when a trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries, those beneficiaries receive the property absolutely. Since there is no exchange product (the house wasn't sold), there is no replacement property in which the remaining beneficiaries have an equitable proprietary interest. The distribution is complete, and all beneficiaries have received their share without any ongoing interests in the trust property.\n\nOptions A, C, and D all involve selling the house, which would create an exchange product (cash from the sale) in which the beneficiaries would still have an equitable proprietary interest until final distribution, making these scenarios incorrect in the context of the question."

And after I do the anmeldung my application will also be forwarded to the Berlin office.\n\nThis appears quite hopeless to me since in Berlin my request will not be even looked at before the end of this year due to the centralization of the Einburgerung office in Berlin. Let alone normal cases, Berlin also has a significantly durable process on this topic compared to other cities, and can take years instead of months.\n\nMy question is, can you please suggest a few ways to me to keep my application running in Bayern not to be transferred to Berlin? Because otherwise, it would be really hopeless...\n\n\\-\\-Possible ways that I have thought of so far is mentioning my place in Berlin as a Zweitwohnsitz, but I doubt I can find a landlord to accept doing the Anmeldung with me in Bayern while I don't live there, and don't know about potential risks. Another option also not doing Anmeldiung for a while...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This answer is based on a legal greyzone and Berlin's notoriously inefficient bureaucracy. As @Trish noted, you are legally required to register your new residence within two weeks [\u00a7 17 BMG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bmg/__17.html). In some (most?) German states you can just walk into a B\u00fcrgeramt and register your new residence so it is perfectly straightforward to do that within two weeks and that is expected.\n\nThis is not the case in Berlin, you need to get an appointment to register and these are hard to get. I just searched online for B\u00fcrgeramt in Berlin, picked [one](https://service.berlin.de/standort/122231/) and then you can choose the service your want (register new residence) and look at the available appointments. Right now on July 7th there were appointments available on exactly one date, September 1st. Note that this is nowhere near within two weeks.\n\nTo my knowledge, if you have an appointment at the B\u00fcrgeramt to register your new residence than current legal opinion is that you did fullfill the two weeks requirement regardless of when the appointment actually is. After all it is not your fault if the city doesn't offer a faster registration.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A German resident is moving from Bayern to Berlin and has concerns about their naturalization application. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their legal obligations and the potential impact on their application?\n\nA) The resident can legally maintain their registration in Bayern indefinitely to keep their application processing there, as long as they occasionally visit Bayern.\n\nB) The resident must register their new address in Berlin within two weeks of moving, but can request that their naturalization application remains in Bayern.\n\nC) The resident is required to register their new address in Berlin within two weeks, but having an appointment scheduled (even if it's months away) satisfies this requirement.\n\nD) The resident can avoid registering in Berlin for several months without any legal consequences, allowing their application to continue processing in Bayern.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, residents are legally required to register their new address within two weeks of moving (\u00a7 17 BMG). However, due to Berlin's notoriously inefficient bureaucracy, it's often impossible to get an appointment within this timeframe. The current legal opinion is that having a scheduled appointment for registration, even if it's far in the future, fulfills the two-week requirement. This allows the resident to comply with the law while potentially giving them more time before their application is transferred to Berlin. Options A and D involve deliberately avoiding registration, which is not legal. Option B is incorrect because the resident cannot choose where their application is processed after moving."

According to U.S. law, active-duty soldiers do not have any special law enforcement authority in civilian situations. However, like any other citizen, they have the right to perform a citizen's arrest when witnessing a felony in progress. The Posse Comitatus Act actually restricts the use of military in domestic law enforcement, rather than granting additional powers.

Option B is too restrictive, as it doesn't acknowledge the rights that soldiers share with other citizens."

The numbering system typically reflects the chronological order of individuals holding the office. Even in extreme circumstances, maintaining consistency in the numbering system would be important for historical record-keeping. The re-elected president would likely be assigned the next available number, acknowledging both the period of occupation and the continuation of the presidency as an institution.

Federal statutes of limitations are established by Congress, so they're found in federal statutory law \\-\\- for example, you can find the general felony statute of limitations at [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3282), but Congress can set different statutes for different offenses.\n\nState statutes of limitations are similarly set by the state's legislative authorities.

Federal statutes of limitations are indeed established by Congress and found in federal statutory law, such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 for general felonies. State statutes of limitations are set by state legislatures, not county governments.

The example of Denver, Colorado illustrates this point, where the city can establish municipal offenses, but the state law sets an 18-month statute of limitations for all misdemeanors.\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain inaccuracies:\nA is incorrect because there isn't a single federal database for all jurisdictions' statutes of limitations.\nB is wrong because state statutes are set by state legislatures, not county governments.\nC is inaccurate because municipal governments don't have universal authority to set statutes of limitations independently of state law."

In case one goes temporarily missing, is it possible for the other to take over decisions for both of them (e.g. agree to an acquisition)? Is there some kind of deal stipulated when establishing the society that covers these situations, and is it imaginable that they agreed on terms such as \"if Person A can not be contacted successfully for 24 hours, then Person B is allowed full decisional power\" (regardless of how poorly thought through such an agreement might be)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is absolutely possible. Much depends on the type of business, and the type of decision. I'll assume for purposes of this answer that normally the particular type of business decision requires the assent of both of the people involved, like a decision to sell out the business. I'll also assume that both of the people involved actually own the business. There are several different ways that this could happen.\n\nMost business decisions require the assent of people involved in the business, but not the owners. The corporation's board of directors can often authorize things, for instance. Most boards can meet and vote whether or not all of the directors are present, provided proper notice of the meeting is sent to all of the directors. So if Person A goes missing, Person B can still call a meeting, send out notice, meet, and vote. If Person B's presence at the meeting is enough for quorum, then Person B can still vote. That vote will then be the decision of the full Board, even though Person A was not present.\n\nIf the decision requires the assent of the owners, that can usually be handled the same way: notice of a shareholder meeting, attendance by Person B after proper notice to Person A, a vote and it is the action of the shareholders.\n\nIt is also possible that such dramatic steps are unnecessary. For instance, say the business is a partnership between Person A and Person B. In that case, Person B can usually speak for the partnership in all affairs (so can Person A). Person B may ultimately have to answer to Person A for what was done, if it violated some agreement or something, but the decision will stick. For many decisions, the law permits a forward agreement that Person A's assent is unnecessary. For instance, in a Limited Partnership, if Person B is the General Partner and Person A is a Limited Partner, most of the decision\\-making is in Person B's hands. Similarly if Person B is the Manager of a Manager\\-Managed LLC.\n\nSome decisions absolutely require the assent of Person A. For instance, if there are only two owners and a decision is being made to take the company through bankruptcy, both owners may have to assent. In that circumstance, it is still possible for Person B to go ahead. For instance, if Person A delivered a proxy to Person B in advance, then Person B can vote for Person A. If the proxy was discretionary, then Person B can vote however Person B wants for Person A.\n\nIn the most extreme circumstance, Person A can voluntarily make Person B an \"attorney\\-in\\-fact\" by signing and delivering a Power of Attorney to Person B, or else Person B can force the issue by causing Person A to be declared dead or incompetent. Powers of attorney are uncommon, but not so uncommon as you might think \\- I have seen them used for precisely this circumstance, where one coventurer delivers to the other (or more commonly, each to the other) a limited, durable power of attorney to make certain business decisions in the event of incompetence or unavailability.\n\nBottom line, in answer to your question it is absolutely possible, and could certainly be done (depending on circumstance) through some kind of advance agreement.",

They included a clause in their partnership agreement stating, \"If either partner cannot be contacted for 72 hours, the other partner gains full decision-making authority.\" Alice goes on a backpacking trip and loses cell service. After 73 hours without contact, Bob receives an acquisition offer. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's ability to accept the offer?\n\nA) Bob can immediately accept the offer without any further action, as the 72-hour clause automatically grants him full authority.\n\nB) Bob must first have Alice declared legally incompetent before he can accept the offer on behalf of the partnership.\n\nC) Bob should call a partnership meeting, provide proper notice, and then vote on the acquisition offer as the sole attending partner.\n\nD) Bob cannot accept the offer under any circumstances without Alice's explicit consent, as acquisition decisions always require unanimous partner approval.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the partnership agreement includes a clause about decision-making authority after 72 hours of no contact, it's prudent for Bob to follow proper legal procedures. Calling a partnership meeting and providing proper notice ensures that Bob is acting in good faith and following standard business practices. This approach aligns with the information provided about how decisions can be made when one partner is absent. It offers the most legally sound method for Bob to proceed with the acquisition decision, balancing the partnership agreement's clause with standard corporate governance procedures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediately acting on the clause without any formal process could be legally risky. Option B is extreme and unnecessary given the situation. Option D is incorrect because the partnership agreement specifically allows for decision-making in the absence of one partner, and the information provided suggests that there are ways to make significant decisions without unanimous approval in certain circumstances."

Lets begin with, I am playing it on his computer whenever he authorizes me to do so. Surely that can't be illegal. Later, I make a separate user account on Windows to play the same game (Steam has a feature of \"Library sharing\" on the same computer). \n\nLets then say that I install Linux on his computer and play the same game, just from a different OS and user account.

This means hospitals can implement reasonable procedures for handling such requests, which may include directing patients to make written requests through specific departments.

I have this chapter wherein the protagonist, a 21 y.o. normal human male is transformed into a Superman\\-like being, the **only** such \u201csuper\u201d in the world. Powers include flight and invulnerability.\n\nJust a few hours after this freakish transformation, he goes riding on his Harley\\-Davidson Sportster motorcycle, to think (this takes place in Florida). While he is riding along, he runs over a pit in the road, blows a front tire, and pancakes, eating pavement in the process. He slides into the opposite lane into the path of an 18\\-wheeler and gets run over. In the following, he suffers *no* harm whatsoever as he is invulnerable.\n\n![EIGHTEEN WHEELER SEMI](https://i.stack.imgur.com/chB0D.png)\n\nHis path is in purple (*under* the truck). The front tire of the truck hits him and blows as well, causing the truck driver to lose control.\n\nLong story short, he rises to his hands and knees at **X**, in effect becoming an roughly 30 inch tall, immovable, indestructible object. Then he\u2019s struck by the trailer rear tires *(red squares)*. They shear off, all 8 tires and two axles as a unit, go airborne and land across the road in a parking lot on top of a car. A woman inside that car is killed immediately. The truck itself jack\\-knifes and wrecks, turning over.\n\nThe protagonist doesn\u2019t notice crushed car across the road, checks out the truck driver (who\u2019s the sole occupant), sees that he\u2019s belted up, unharmed, and coming to. He looks around; there are no other witnesses\\-\\-it\u2019s a Sunday morning, and leaps over to his slightly damaged bike. Handlebars in hand he rises straight up a thousand feet or so, surveys the scene, hears sirens, and leaves the scene. Why? He\u2019s a physical freak, and he\u2019s nervous about revealing himself so early. Read too many comics ;).\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know about the *fatality* until weeks later when it\u2019s revealed to him. Now he decides to turn himself in, even though the authorities are unaware of him (the truck driver was blamed, even though he swears a motorcyclist caused him to wreck). The protag, remorseful, does turn himself in, although he mentions nothing of his abilities, the super powers that is. Just a clear\\-cut case, he lost control of his bike, the wreck and fatality occurred. He miraculously escaped injury, he claims, and panicked (which I doubt the investigators would buy), not noticing the crushed car across the street.\n\n**First question:** what would he be charged with, since I assume he caused the wreck and he did leave the scene? Maybe involuntary manslaughter?\n\n**Next question:** if found guilty, could he face incarceration? I should add he has *no* record.\n\nWorking toward my next question; during the wait for trial an alphabet agency in DC discovers (long story) that this guy is a freak, a superhuman of *unknown* abilities. They approach the judge in the case and ask him to make the defendant an *offer* when he announces the sentence. *Jail or join the military*. The Feds wants the man\u2019s real abilities investigated and possibly have him utilized in say, special forces. So...\n\n**Last question:** This offer seem possible in today\u2019s courts? I think the actor Steve McQueen was offered this (before fame), IIRC.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not sure what jurisdiction you're referring to, but here are the [state involuntary manslaughter](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/involuntary-manslaughter.html) laws. Broad brush, the elements tend to be:\n\n1. Someone was killed as a result of act by the defendant.\n2. The act either was inherently dangerous to others or done with reckless disregard for human life.\n3. The defendant knew or should have known his or her conduct was a threat to the lives of others.\n\nHowever, you're really backwards planning from a jail vs. army decision, so you might actually be after something like **felony hit and run**, which can most certainly result in incarceration. The elements of felony hit and run generally include leaving the scene of an accident regardless of fault (hit and run typically becomes a felony when someone was injured in the accident). Since the elements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it makes sense to look them up wherever the accident will take place in the book. If it takes place in the U.S. [this](http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-tickets/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-hit-and-run-state-laws.html) is a state\\-by\\-state compendium.\n\nThen you can tweak the story to satisfy the applicable elements and induce the jail vs. army decision (even if army policy prohibits it, it's still pretty common fiction!).",

The death was a result of a chain of events, making this charge less likely.\n\nC) Felony hit and run: This is the most appropriate charge given the circumstances. The protagonist left the scene of an accident that resulted in a fatality, which typically elevates hit and run to a felony offense, regardless of who was at fault for the initial accident.\n\nD) Vehicular homicide: This charge usually requires direct causation of death through the operation of a vehicle. In this case, the death was indirect and occurred after the protagonist had already left the scene.\n\nThe felony hit and run charge best fits the described scenario, as it accounts for the protagonist leaving the scene of a serious accident, which resulted in a fatality, even though he was not directly responsible for the death."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The 1st Amendment states\n\n> Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\n\nSo how can libel law be constitutional?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's an interesting philosophical debate you can have. By the plain text of the First Amendment, it protects libel.\n\n---\n\nAside: Yes, the First Amendment does apply to libel cases. A libel case, like all lawsuits, involves the government's judicial branch using its coercive power to make you pay money as a result of your speech, based on a law requiring you to pay money for certain kinds of speech. Tort law is not optional; a libel case isn't \"you promised not to say bad things and then said bad things,\" it's the government saying \"what you did is bad, now pay the person you hurt because of your speech.\" \n\nThe idea that \"you can say it, you just have to face the consequences\" isn't enough and hasn't been for quite a while now. Traditionally, the main point of freedom of speech was that a court couldn't stop you from saying something, but could only seek to punish you after the fact (and for that you get a jury, a public hearing, etc.) But more recently, courts realized that subsequent punishment had similar effects to prior restraint. If you're going to be punished for some kind of speech, you're going to steer clear of saying anything a jury *might* think is that kind of speech.\n\nLibel law is *heavily* influenced by the First Amendment, and has been for over 40 years.\n\n---\n\nThe First Amendment looks like it protects libel, but it also looks like it should protect your right to reprint any book you want. It also looks like it should protect your right to tell someone \"go and murder this person.\" It also looks like it should protect your right to say whatever you want in court, whether or not it's true. It also looks like it should protect your right to falsely shout \"fire\" in a crowded hall, with the intent to cause a stampede (this isn't just a turn of phrase, there was an actual incident in which 73 people were killed which is believed to have started when someone falsely shouted that there was a fire). It also looks like it should protect your right to post a sign saying \"There is a bomb at this elementary school.\"\n\nYet the Constitution explicitly sanctions copyright, and no one would seriously conclude that Congress may not protect the integrity of the judicial process by punishing perjury. Ordering a hit, making bomb threats, intentionally causing panics \\-\\- the fact that speech is a key part of these can't mean that the government isn't allowed to criminalize them. You cannot run a civilized society in which death threats are legal.\n\nSo, the courts interpret. Language in the Constitution that appears absolute is understood to have implied exceptions. The people writing the document were well aware that perjury was generally a crime. The same Congress that proposed the First Amendment passed a law criminalizing perjury. Sure, you're punishing someone based on their speech, but it's clearly not *meant* to be protected. You can't run a court system without perjury laws, and its absence from the First Amendment doesn't mean that the First Amendment thereby upended this basic principle.\n\nThe courts have identified a number of kinds of speech that, by longstanding practice, are not protected. Intellectual property violations are one. Obscenity is another. So are threats. So is \"speech integral to criminal conduct\" (e.g. \"what'll it be, your money or your life?\") And so is defamation. The text of the First Amendment may not exclude it, but courts have uniformly held that it's not something the amendment was ever meant to protect. \n\nThe First Amendment does still pose constraints, which are some of the most defendant\\-friendly in the world (interestingly enough, US law is descended from English law, and English libel law used to be among the most plaintiff\\-friendly in the world). It's not libel if it's true. It's not libel if it's an opinion (unless it's a statement of fact dressed up as opinion). It's not libel unless you were at *least* negligent; if it was about a public figure, you have to have known it was false or seriously doubted its truth. But these restrictions leave a core of speech that is and always has been punishable.",

The passage explains that while the plain text of the First Amendment appears to protect all speech, including libel, courts have interpreted it to have implied exceptions. Libel is considered one of these exceptions, along with other forms of speech like perjury, obscenity, and threats. The courts have consistently held that defamation was not meant to be protected by the First Amendment, even though it's not explicitly excluded in the text. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that there are exceptions to First Amendment protections, including libel.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the passage indicates that the First Amendment does impact libel laws, making them \"heavily influenced by the First Amendment\" for over 40 years.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest that libel laws are unconstitutional.

You don't state the jurisdiction, and your question implies that you are somewhere other than the US, so there's really not much we can do to say what laws there are in your jurisdiction. As far as the fraud issue, suppose we assume for the sake of argument that the claim is false. Assuming that your jurisdiction defines \"fraud\" in manner similar to how the US defines it:\n\n> In the United States, common law generally identifies nine elements needed to establish fraud: (1\\) a representation of fact; (2\\) its falsity; (3\\) its materiality; (4\\) the representer\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5\\) the representer\u2019s intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6\\) the injured party\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7\\) the injured party\u2019s reliance on its truth; (8\\) the injured party\u2019s right to rely thereon; and (9\\) the injured party\u2019s consequent and proximate injury.\n\n[https://www.mitchell\\-attorneys.com/common\\-law\\-fraud](https://www.mitchell-attorneys.com/common-law-fraud)\n\nYou seem to be presenting \"The law requires broadcast of the content\" as (1\\). So we need this to be false (2\\); again, I don't know what your country or its laws are, but for the sake of argument, let's assume that the claim is false. The third condition is its materiality. This means that it must actually be relevant. This would be difficult to prove. Does it really matter whether it's true? Does its falsity affect the value of the product being offered? Similarly, for (5\\) and (7\\), in what way would buyers being \"acting\" or \"relying\" on this claim? How would a decision whether to purchase something depend on the claim? And there is (9\\): you would have to show that you actually suffered as a result of the claim being false. \n\nI suppose that if there's a show that you want to watch, and you, when you bought the antennae, were expecting be able to watch it using the antennae, but it turned out that you weren't able to, then you would have a case. You would have to show that your belief that you would be able to watch it was caused by the defendant's claim, that your belief was a reasonable inference from that claim, that the defendant intended you to believe that, and that you have damages from not being able to watch the show.",

It's difficult to show that this specific claim, rather than other factors like price or features, was material to the purchase decision.\n\nC) Proving the seller's knowledge might be difficult, but could potentially be inferred from their marketing practices or industry knowledge.\n\nD) The existence of a representation of fact is clear from the advertisement's claims, making this the easiest element to establish.\n\nThe materiality of the claim (B) is particularly challenging because it requires proving that the specific legal claim was a key factor in the consumer's decision-making process, which is often subjective and hard to quantify."

For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, **by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.**  \n> \n> **d.** Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, **You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation**...\n\n### Does changing the logo on all pages imply an endorsement of the site/organisation by the user?\n\nIt is likely, though not definite, that this positioning of the logo will imply that the user endorses the website. However, actions taken by the user \\- such as creating an account, accepting the Terms, contributing content \\- are likely to affirm this view.\n\n### Does changing the logo imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view?\n\nAgain, it is likely, not definite, that changing the logo will imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view.\n\nDoes changing the logo impute support of a political view to the user?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this case, however, it is ***highly unlikely*** that the change of logo would impute to the user support of the political view.\n\nIn a case such as this, onus of proof is on the plaintiff \\- were this claim brought in court, it would need to be proven on the balance of probability (or, less likely, on the preponderance of evidence) that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality (and perhaps some other) agenda to the user. *Reasonable* person does not mean any *particular* person, nor does it mean, *all* people.\n\nPart of the imputation must come from the purpose that the user subscribes to the site. Perhaps if StackOverflow were a site that promoted marriage equality or judicial activism, this could support an opinion that the user supports this view. However, StackOverflow is about programming, and programming doesn't imply that kind of agenda. Perhaps if the icon had been changed to something that suggested support for object\\-oriented programming, the icon *could* be taken to suggest that the user supports this agenda. Neither does the user's content suggest support for this cause \\- if they constantly made off\\-hand remarks about it in their posts, then perhaps, again, a reasonable person may make that imputation.\n\nIn any case, the damages awarded to the user would likely be compensatory rather than punitive \\- the user would need to therefore demonstrate actual suffering or loss as a result of the change of icon. If there were actual damages or loss, the way in which the user contributed to them \\- perhaps by posting a thread that would be likely to be inflammatory and attract attention to the user \\- may reduce an award of damages. In the case of no actual suffering or loss, the user could be awarded nominal damages.\n\nInjunctions that could be awarded would need to be proportionate to the breach of license \\- the court could require references to this user to be anonymised. This is easily done. It is unlikely that the court would require all contribution by the user to be removed \\- this is unlikely to pass a public interest test.\n\nIn relation to placing a disclaimer in the footer, US courts have generally accepted disclaimers if they are positioned such that a reasonable user is likely to see it... In the footer? It's not a great place, and easily missed. It could be better than nothing, though, and may help with the likelihood of someone imputing such opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\nEssentially \\- it's extremely unlikely that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality agenda on a user based on a logo change, because the support is not sufficiently connected to the primary purpose of the site, or the user's activities on the site.\n\nEven ***if*** the user were successful in showing that this is the likely conclusion of a reasonable person, the remedies available to them would be limited to damages (which limited to actual losses, including suffering), and an injunction (which is likely to be anonymisation).\n\nA disclaimer may not, on its own, actually preserve the validity of the license, but it may be useful on determining the likelihood of a reasonable person imputing opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\n1\\. This is larger than normal, because I think it is more important than normal.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user contributes content to a programming Q&A website under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license. The website temporarily changes its logo to support a political cause unrelated to programming. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential license violations?\n\nA) The logo change definitely violates the CC BY-SA 3.0 license as it implies the user's endorsement of the political cause.\n\nB) The logo change likely violates the license, and the user could easily win a lawsuit for significant damages.\n\nC) The logo change is unlikely to violate the license, as it would be difficult to prove that a reasonable person would impute support of the political cause to the user based solely on their contributions to a programming website.\n\nD) The license violation can be easily remedied by adding a small disclaimer in the website's footer stating that users do not endorse the website's political views.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that it is \"highly unlikely\" that changing the logo would impute support of a political view to the user. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. The burden of proof would be on the plaintiff to show that a reasonable person would impute such support.\n2. The primary purpose of the website (programming Q&A) is unrelated to the political cause.\n3. The user's contributions are typically not related to the political cause.\n4. Even if a violation were found, remedies would likely be limited to actual damages (which would be difficult to prove) or anonymization of the user's contributions.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they overstate the likelihood and consequences of a license violation. Option D is incorrect because while a disclaimer might help, it's not a guaranteed solution, especially if placed in the footer where it might be easily missed."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Yesterday, Evilstan declared war on Ruritania. One of the Ruritanian units, let's call them the 1st Chasseurs manages to encircle a splinter troop of Evilstanian troops from the 2nd Armored Rifle Brigade. Encircled and rounded up, the commander of this group from the 2nd ARB pops a white flag and his troops leave their vehicles, arms raised to surrender. However, it's a trap and they gun down a couple of the 1st Chasseurs in their act of **[Perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy)**. In response, the rest of this group from the 2nd ARB is wiped out. Clearly, the commander from the 2nd ARB had committed a war crime, and the unit was free game, their protection of the white flag removed by the perfidy.\n\nThe survivors of the 1st Chasseurs manage to encircle *another* group of tanks from the 2nd ARB today morning. Apparently, they are just that good. When the commander of this unit pops the white flag after comparable resistance, instead of stopping the fire to receive the POWs in a similar fashion, the soldiers of the 1st Chasseurs only pause long enough to top up their guns with fresh ammunition and then mow down the possibly surrendering soldiers, assuming this too was an act of Perfidy.\n\nHowever, having not honored the white flag in the second instance and by giving [no quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_quarter), have the Ruritanian 1st Chasseurs troops committed a war crime by eliminating the 2nd unit from the Evilstanian 2nd ARB?\n\n#### notes\n\nDeclaring no quarter will be given in itself would breach the rules of war under *Article 23 (d) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV \\- The Laws and Customs of War on Land.* Assume no such declaration was given.\n\nEvilstan (Evil \\+ the Slavic end for a country) and [Ruritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruritania) are **fictional countries**. They are **not** real countries. They are not made to mimic any actual operation. All matches and similarities are coincidental. In fact, the two countries can be assumed to be reappearing from [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/54934/what-happens-if-a-country-re-emerges).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Geneva Conventions prohibit attacking anyone who has clearly communicated an intent to surrender. Certainly, there is a point at which if perfidy reaches a sufficient level of frequency, then the side committing it will lose the ability to \"clearly communicate\" an intention to surrender, but it isn't clear just where that point is.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of international law and the laws of war, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the actions of the Ruritanian 1st Chasseurs in the second encounter with the Evilstanian 2nd ARB?\n\nA) The 1st Chasseurs committed a clear war crime by not honoring the white flag, regardless of previous perfidy by other units.\n\nB) The 1st Chasseurs were fully justified in their actions due to the previous act of perfidy by another unit of the 2nd ARB.\n\nC) The 1st Chasseurs' actions exist in a legal grey area, as the frequency of perfidy required to negate the protection of a white flag is not clearly defined.\n\nD) The 1st Chasseurs did not commit a war crime as long as they genuinely believed the surrender attempt was false.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the situation described falls into a complex legal area where the rules are not entirely clear. While the Geneva Conventions prohibit attacking those who have clearly communicated an intent to surrender, the previous act of perfidy by another unit of the 2nd ARB complicates the matter. The law does not specify exactly how many instances of perfidy are required before a force loses the ability to \"clearly communicate\" an intention to surrender. This creates a grey area where the actions of the 1st Chasseurs are neither clearly legal nor clearly illegal under international law. Options A and B are too absolute in their judgments, while D introduces a subjective element (genuine belief) that is not a deciding factor in determining war crimes under international law."
