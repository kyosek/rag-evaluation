Bob was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on March 7th at 11 p.m. local time. Alice was born the next day, March 8th, in Halifax, Nova Scotia at 1 a.m. local time, which is 2 hours before Bob was born, due to the time zone difference. Who inherits Charlie's estate?\n\nI'm interested in the answer for Canada, but other countries would also be of interest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you have stated, Alice was born two hours prior to Bob. In a will, \"eldest\" or \"oldest\" typically is equated with \"first\\-born\" (see Daniel N. Mattarlin, \"[A Simple Legacy: 'To My Children'](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1967CanLIIDocs112)\" (1967\\) 12:3 McGill L.J. 240; Frederick Read, \"[The Legal Position of the Child of Unmarried Parents](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1931CanLIIDocs20)\" (1931\\) 9:9 Can. Bar Rev. 609; *An Act Relating to Wills, Legacies and Executors, and for the Distribution of the Estates of Intestates*, S.N.S. 1758, c. 11, s. XII). It often is a reflection of an intention to borrow from the ancient law of primogeniture (which is all about literal order of birth), rather than to refer to a person's legal age as defined by statutes and anniversaries. Between Alice and Bob, Alice is the first\\-born and therefore the oldest under that understanding.\n\nBut the question of *who inherits* depends on much more than the interpretation of this one word. For example, most (or all) provincial succession statutes give courts the power to rectify a will if the court determines that the will fails to carry out the will\\-maker's intentions. Evidence could be presented **about how the birthdays of the two were celebrated in relation to each other, who the will\\-maker understood to be the oldest (if they both existed when the will was made), etc**."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Charlie's will states that his estate should go to his \"oldest living grandchild.\" He has four grandchildren:\n\n1. Alice, born March 8th at 1:00 AM in Halifax (Atlantic Time Zone)\n2. Bob, born March 7th at 11:00 PM in Vancouver (Pacific Time Zone)\n3. Carol, born March 8th at 3:00 AM in Toronto (Eastern Time Zone)\n4. David, born March 7th at 10:00 PM in Los Angeles (Pacific Time Zone)\n\nCharlie always celebrated Alice and Bob's birthdays on the same day, considering them \"twins.\" He often referred to David as his \"firstborn grandchild.\" Which factors would a Canadian court most likely consider when determining who inherits Charlie's estate?\n\nA) Only the exact time and date of birth, regardless of time zones\nB) The legal age of majority in each grandchild's province of residence\nC) Charlie's understanding of who was oldest and how birthdays were celebrated\nD) The order in which the grandchildren's birth certificates were issued\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, while the literal order of birth (which would favor Alice) is typically considered, courts have the power to rectify a will if it fails to carry out the will-maker's intentions. The question specifically mentions that evidence about \"how the birthdays were celebrated in relation to each other\" and \"who the will-maker understood to be the oldest\" could be presented. This aligns most closely with option C, which takes into account Charlie's understanding and how he celebrated the birthdays. The fact that Charlie considered Alice and Bob as \"twins\" and referred to David as his \"firstborn grandchild\" would be relevant factors for the court to consider in interpreting Charlie's intentions when he wrote \"oldest living grandchild\" in his will."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59171/injunction-petition-or-other", "docs_id": 59171, "title": "Injunction, petition or other?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A Florida homeowner association is violating its bylaws and statutes by performing action X.

However, state law is only advisory for select purposes of federal law, such as citizenship, which ultimately, for that purpose, is a question of federal law.\n\nIn California, in a case involving an unmarried woman and an unmarried man, when there is no putative but legally invalid marriage, but they cohabit, there is only one circumstance where a man is presumed to a parent in the absence of court action or an acknowledgement of paternity, under Family Code \u00a7 7611\\. This is a man \"who receives the child into his or her home and openly holds out the child as his or her natural child.\" Family Code \u00a7 7611(d).

The list of banks representing the loans to be consolidated on the second note are in conflict with the list on the first note. I am not sure which list is accurate.\n\nIs either note valid and/or enforceable? The information is in conflict. Also, my signature is crossed out on the second, initialed and signed differently. I don't remember doing that and it's not on the copy I have. And lastly, both notes were printed years before the 1992 amendments so not all options for repayment are listed and the disclosure \"this is a loan which must be repaid\" is not present anywhere. I had read in the Colorado Student Loan Training Manual that duplicate notes are not enforceable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without reading the exact language of the documents it is hard to tell. Two possible interpretations of these documents are most plausible.\n\nOne interpretation is that the first note is the true promissory note and the second note is a written reaffirmation of the original promissory note which would extend the statute of limitations for enforcing it if there had not been regular payments, but does not create a new obligation or supersede the original note. But, it probably could be enforced if push came to shove, on some legal theory if the original first note was unavailable.\n\nA second interpretation is that the second note is a novation of the original note that replaces and supersedes the original note. Given the differences in the parties to the second note, I would be inclined to give this interpretation a greatly likelihood of being correct, but again, it would come down to the exact language of the documents.\n\nPromissory notes are tricky because they are \"negotiable instruments\" which means that the right to receive payment and enforce the note can be transferred to a new \"Note Holder\" by transferring the physical original note and endorsing the back.\n\nThe concern in the case of a promissory note is that someone with a photocopy could claim to be the Note Holder when in fact, the physical original has been negotiated to another person who is the true Note Holder to whom the obligation is now currently owed. If judgment were entered against the former Note Holder that might not prevent the true Note Holder from also getting a judgment against you, leaving you to try to vacate the judgment in favor of the former Note Holder and to seek restitution of any funds paid to the former Note Holder.\n\nThis could be prevented by insisting on an original note or by requiring the party bringing suit without an original note to post a bond to protect you in the event that the note was actually physically negotiated to someone else. The risk could be mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, if you were sued in a collection action, by joining all of the note holders listed on either note and their successors in interest, as third\\-party defendants.\n\nWhile I'm not aware of any significant litigation concerning who the Note Holder is in the case of student loans, there was quite a bit of litigation concerning the true Note Holder in the subprime mortgage loan context around the time of the Financial Crisis of 2008\\.\n\nThe modification of the signature, apparently without your authorization, is deeply problematic and might amount to fraud, but could be found by a court to be harmless because you admit to signing the original. Fraud in a matter that is immaterial is usually not actionable, although it could still constitute grounds to disbar an attorney if this action was authorized by an attorney.\n\nThe fact that neither of the notes complies with subsequently enacted legislation is irrelevant as you can't have an *ex post facto* law that *impairs obligations of contracts* under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn the meantime, don't throw out anything related to this loan or delete any files related to it. You could need them to defend yourself in future litigation."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student loan borrower signed two conflicting promissory notes for a FFEL guaranteed student loan consolidation.

The answer provided in the documentation suggests that given the differences in the parties listed on the second note, it is more likely that the second note constitutes a novation of the original note, replacing and superseding it. This interpretation takes into account the changes in listed banks and recognizes that the second document, despite its flaws, could be seen as a new agreement that replaces the first. \n\nOption A is incorrect because conflicting information doesn't automatically invalidate both notes; courts would likely try to determine which note takes precedence. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the existence of a second note with different terms suggests it may have been intended to replace the first, rather than the first automatically being the only valid one. \n\nOption D is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, ex post facto laws cannot impair obligations of contracts under the U.S. Constitution, so the lack of later-required disclosures doesn't invalidate the notes."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82105/is-it-copyright-infringement-to-send-a-message-with-a-trivial-photograph-you-don", "docs_id": 82105, "title": "Is it copyright infringement to send a message with a trivial photograph you don&#39;t own", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say for example you want to convey a detail to someone of a common object, and showing them a picture would be a lot simpler than describing it in words.

While B-1 visas typically do not allow for compensation for work performed in the U.S., there is a specific exception for members of boards of directors. This exception allows foreign board members to attend meetings in the U.S. and receive compensation for their board duties.\n\nA) H-1B visa is incorrect because it is designed for specialty occupations and requires sponsorship from a U.S. employer for full-time work, which is not applicable for periodic board meetings.\n\nB) E-2 visa is incorrect as it is for investors who are making a substantial investment in a U.S. business, which may not apply to all board members.\n\nD) L-1 visa is incorrect because it is for intracompany transfers of executives or managers, which doesn't fit the scenario of a board member who primarily works for a foreign company.\n\nThe B-1 visa provides the flexibility needed for periodic visits to the U.S. for board meetings while allowing for compensation, making it the most suitable option for this scenario."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58263/timing-of-the-death-of-a-president-elect", "docs_id": 58263, "title": "Timing of the death of a president-elect", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Section 3 of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States begins with this:\n\n> If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President.\n\nI am presuming at this point that no one is \"the President elect\" in the eyes of the Constitution until the electoral college votes in December.

At that time, not only have the electors already voted since at least a month, but Congress supposedly has certified the election of the dead guy and his running mate 14 days prior. That's the time when someone is or isn't president\\-elect in regards to this amendment.\n\nThat's for your first sentence. Now for the rest, and taking your example of the 2020 election, if Biden had died between November and December, the options available to the Electors in each state are different. Some will be able to vote for someone else than Biden for president, possibly someone named by the DCCC, but many Electors in different states will not have that option.\n\nThe way I see it, there's two options. Either there are no (or almost no) faithless Electors, then the Biden/Harris ticket gets certified on January 6th (what could possibly go wrong \ud83d\udc40), then pursuant to the 20th amendment Harris gets sworn in as the President on January 20th.\nOr, a lot of the Electors who can legally be faithless, get faithless, then the democratic electoral votes are split, no ticket gets to 270, which triggers a [contingent election](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-1/clause-3/) by the House of Reps (and the Senate selects the VP). Who they elect is anyone's guess.\n\nSo, if you allow me a bit of presumption as to what you meant, you seemed to imply that Electors voting for a dead guy would be absurd, but in fact it seems like it would be the safest scenario for their party."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: If a presidential candidate dies between the general election in November and the Electoral College vote in December, which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur, assuming many states have laws against faithless electors?\n\nA) The Electoral College votes are automatically nullified and a new general election is held.\n\nB) The vice presidential candidate of the deceased automatically becomes the new presidential candidate.\n\nC) The electors still vote for the deceased candidate, potentially leading to their ticket winning and the vice presidential candidate becoming president on Inauguration Day.\n\nD) The opposing party's candidate automatically wins the presidency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, if a presidential candidate dies between the general election and the Electoral College vote, the most likely scenario is that electors would still vote for the deceased candidate. This is because:\n\n1. Many states have laws against faithless electors, limiting their ability to vote for someone else.\n2.

It *is* pointless to complain about internet service rates, because the FCC does not regulate those rates.

You could then escalate the matter to the status of a formal complaint (which costs money), and eventually you might get a full formal explanation that they are not required to tell you how to do it (unless they *are* required to, then they presumably will have told you before you got to this stage). The [FCC guide on porting numbers](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/porting-keeping-your-phone-number-when-you-change-providers) does not indicate whether the provider has to explain to you how to do it, but their guide is a good starting point."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is experiencing issues with their telecommunications provider and wants to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

For the insurance company it was enough just to get the case number on the ticket and they did the leg work. Consider yourself lucky it was only cosmetic. You can also reach out to the officer in the report OR the prosecutor's office. Although they might reach out to you, don't expect it, as they only need you to testify in court if a plea agreement isn't struck (90% of all criminal cases in the U.S. end in a plea bargin of some sorts.).\n\nEither way, it's prudent for your own records to get copies of the reports as well as the estimation for the repairs. As you said, it is cosmetic, so it's not like the repairs are necessary to the safe operation of the car (However, if you can clarify what the truck is used for, it might make a difference. It's one thing if it's your own pickup truck used for hauling stuff for weekend projects you have to fix up the house... it's another thing if it's a pickup truck you use to carry your equipment for your landscaping company, as the \"cosmetic\" damage impacts your proffessional image in that people will be less likely to contract with you, in addition to any custom paint job with contact information needing specialty repairs.\n\nSuing for damages will likely put this in small claims court, which is helpful as it's more friendly to pro se litigants and if you have all your above information in order, it should be sufficient to win (Civil courts do not need to meet \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" standards of evidence, but Preponderance of evidence (i.e. it's more likely that it happened one way vs. the other) which this should cover.). The down side is a lot of people who drink and drive are often not financially well off... and a lot of people who don't have insurance do so because they can't afford it... I'm not saying this is 100% of the case, but if she can't afford auto insurance, well, she's not likely to afford a $1800 repair job, oh, and she's likely going to do some jail time, as DUI with a collision normally carries jail time, and that's before the fact that she was driving without insurance (usually a fine). So she's going to be out a good chunk of cash from criminal cases. You don't have to wait for criminal proceedings to occur, but having the conviction as evidence helps a lot... but this means you have to wait for her to get out of jail to really begin to start the legal process of trying to collect.\n\nSure you can sue, but you still can't get blood from a stone (As Lawyers say, there may be a case, but it's not worth it if they can't even pay).\n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what you do, try and keep some perspective. As unlucky as it is that this happened to you, there are lots of DUI victims out there who would gladly give their first born son (or any child of your choosing, it's 2020\\) to come out of their experiene with only cosmetic damage that did not total a 14 year old vehicle.

For example, this obligation is expressed in Art 24 GDPR:\n\n> Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. \\[\u2026]\n\nWhat risks exist for what activities is extremely contextual. Leaking information through metadata is a *potential* risk, but it's not a risk in every context. Thus, data controllers *should* consider whether metadata could pose a privacy problem in their workflows, but they are not necessarily required to redact such metadata.\n\nThis provision of the UK GDPR is already enforceable, but it would need a case by case analysis to determine whether the risk analysis and selection of technical and organizational measures have been conducted incorrectly.\n\nThe documents you linked are a HMRC internal manual. These are not normative \u2013 they do not bind other organizations.

UK data protection law, based on the GDPR, takes a principle-based approach rather than providing specific checklists. Organizations are expected to assess risks, including those potentially posed by metadata, and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures based on their specific context. The law doesn't mandate blanket redaction of all metadata (ruling out option A), nor does it provide a strict checklist (ruling out option B).

The preexisting oral agreement granting Alice reasonable easement through Bob's room to access her storage area is still valid. Bob's unilateral decision to deny Alice access does not override their joint tenancy rights or the previous agreement.

But their website not being completely correct doesn't mean their service isn't, that's why I'm asking the question\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mailchimp as a company is probably mostly GDPR\\-compliant. But this doesn't mean that *using* the Mailchimp service would be compliant as well.\n\nThis is because the GDPR has different compliance obligations for \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cdata processors\u201d. The data controller is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities they determine the purposes and means for, regardless of whether those activities are actually outsourced. In contrast, the primary responsibility of a data processor is to only use the data as instructed by the controller, but not for the processor's own purposes.\n\nSo Mailchimp probably doesn't abuse its customer's data, and offers an Art 28 GDPR conformant data processing agreement as part of its contracts. Mailchimp also offers features that assist with related privacy laws, such as collecting proper consent as required by the EU ePrivacy Directive.\n\nAnd Mailchimp has a page about [European data transfers](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-european-data-transfers/). This is where it gets tricky. Not the Mailchimp service, but the customer is the data exporter / data controller and is responsible for compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR. The data controller must decide *themselves* whether the international transfer into the US is legal. Briefly, the GDPR allows the following grounds for an international transfer of personal data:\n\n* target country has an adequacy decision from the EU \u2013 no, because the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield was invalidated in the *Schrems II* ruling\n* Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) \u2013 maybe, see below discussion\n* Binding Corporate Rules \u2013 not applicable\n* exceptions, including explicit consent or only occasional transfers \u2013 not applicable\n\nThe Mailchimp guide about EU data transfers correctly states that the *Schrems II* decision only invalidated the Privacy Shield, and did not invalidate the concept of SCCs. That means it is still legal to use SCCs as a basis to transfer personal data in non\\-EU countries. But this doesn't imply that SCCs can serve as a basis for transferring personal data specifically to Mailchimp in the US \u2013 a case by case analysis is necessary that determines whether security of processing is guaranteed and whether data subjects would have effective legal remedies if their rights were breached.\n\nIt now happens that exactly the same reasons that caused the Privacy Shield to be invalid must also make us doubt whether SCCs can be valid in their place. The problem with transfers to the US never was the risk that the recipient would sell the personal data to the highest bidder, but that the US\\-based company is subject to US spy laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333 that do not provide effective legal remedies for foreign affected persons. (Mailchimp explicitly confirms that it is subject to those spy laws as an \u201celectronic communication service\u201d.)\n\nIn the wake of the *Schrems II* ruling the EDPB has published a document with recommendations for supplemental safeguards that could make SCCs permissible, but these recommendations (like end to end encryption, or only transferring pseudoymized data) cannot work for US\\-based cloud services such as Mailchimp. Some (such as the US government) have argued that *Schrems II* was based on outdated information, but this standpoint is not shared by European regulators.\n\nSo, the data controller \u2013 the Mailchimp customer \u2013 has to make their own judgement about this international transfer.\n\n* If SCCs combined with Mailchimp's supplemental measures provide sufficient safeguards, then the international transfer is legal and GDPR\\-compliant. Mailchimp offers all the necessary paperwork such as DPAs, SCCs, and so on.\n* If there are no sufficient safeguards, then the transfer is clearly illegal.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Mailchimp's supplemental measure fall far short of what would be required per the EDPB recommendations. Lower courts in the EU now routinely consider all transfers to the US as illegal. A company using Mailchimp was also an early target of a post\\-*Schrems II* enforcement action, though it wasn't fined since it immediately stopped using the service.\n\nSo while it's not possible to *definitely* say that using Mailchimp would be a GDPR\\-violation, it's very difficult to argue that such use could be compliant."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A European company is considering using Mailchimp, a US-based email marketing service, for its newsletter.

The Schrems II decision invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield, and the same concerns apply to SCCs. US companies like Mailchimp are subject to surveillance laws (e.g., FISA 702) that conflict with GDPR principles. The European company, as the data controller, must assess whether sufficient safeguards exist for the international transfer. Given current regulatory views and court decisions, it's difficult to argue that using a US-based service like Mailchimp could be fully GDPR-compliant. Option A is incorrect because a company's claims don't guarantee compliance. Option B overlooks the international transfer issue. Option D is incorrect because explicit consent is generally not considered a valid basis for systematic transfers to the US under GDPR."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78442/what-is-considered-a-derivative-work", "docs_id": 78442, "title": "What is considered a derivative work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: US Copyright law defines \"derivative work\":\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.

I'm not a native English speaker, and thought 'derivative' means 'inspired or motivated by something'...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Derivative Works under US law and the Berne Convention\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS Copyright law defines \"derivative work\" in [17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) as:\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nArticle 2 of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) reads, in relevant part:\n\n> (3\\) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nUnder [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) one of the things that a copyright owner has the exclusive right to do or authorize is:\n\n> (2\\) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nNote that under the US definition, a derivative work is one **based on** an earlier work, not one that merely **refers to** a derivative work. Merely mentioning or citing a previous work is not enough to make the later work derivative. It must, in some substantial way, **use** and be developed out of the previous work.\n\nThe classic examples of a derivative work are: a translation into another language; an adaptation into another medium or form (such as making a novel into a play or film); and making a sequel. But derivative works can be derivative in various other ways.\n\nExamples from the Question\n--------------------------\n\nLet us look at the examples mentioned in the question:\n\n> * an academic paper that cites or refers to other papers\n\nThis is a mere reference and is not at all derivative. However a paper that contained little or no original content, but consisted almost entirely of such citations might be considered derivative.\n\n> * a discussion thread on Internet (or each comment or reply on it) about a work\n\nDiscussion or criticism of a work, or a reply to it, is not normally considered derivative. Such comments are not derivative of the work under discussion, nor of the previous comments. Quotations of either are likely to be permitted fair use, and so not infringing, although that will depend on the exact details of each case.\n\n> * a fanart or a fanfiction\n\nThis is likely to be a derivative work, depending on how much of the source work is used, and whether distinctive details are reproduced. Note that **ideas** cannot be protected by copyright. (See 17 USC 102(b) for this.) So the idea of a person who turns into an animal of a particular type, or has some special power or ability or characteristic is not protected by copyright. But the details expressed in the source work, such as the mannerisms or appearance of a character, or the specific nature of a setting, can be protected, and to draw on them may be infringement, unless fair use applies.\n\n> * metadata\n\n\"Metadata\" is a very general idea. Typically the kind of information included in metadata is not protected by copyright, but in some cases it may be.\n\n> * a review or a criticism\n\nA review, criticism of, or comment on an existing work is not normally considered a derivative work. Quotes used in a review or criticism are often protected by fair use under US law, but if the quotation is excessive, and particularly if it allows the review to serve as a replacement for the original and to harm the market for the original, it may be infringement.\n\n> * a work inspired by other works\n\nAgain, this depends. If only the general idea is imitated, then the later work is not derivative If detailed, distinctive, and specific characters, settings or plot lines are imitated, then the later work may be considered derivative, and infringing if permission is not obtained.\n\nThe *Nichols* Case\n------------------\n\nIn the case [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation*, 45 F. 2d 119 \\- Circuit Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (1930\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064&q=Nichols+v.+Universal+Pictures+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) Judge Learned Hand, a famous judge, wrote a very influential and often cited opinion describing when two similar plays are, and when they are not, infringements of one another. It is worth reading to better understand this issue, even though it is over 90 years old.\n\nWhat makes a Work Derivative\n----------------------------\n\nSo in general a work is derivative when it uses significant, distinctive, and detailed elements of a previous work, or is a revised or altered version of the previous work.\n\nCopyright in a Derivative Work\n------------------------------\n\nIf a derivative work is made with proper permission, or the source work is out of copyright, the author of the derivative work has copyright in all the original parts of the derivative work. However if the derivative work is infringing, and was created without permission, the author has no valid copyright in it at all.\n\nFair Use and True Parody\n------------------------\n\nIf a work is held to be a ***fair use*** of the original, it is not infringing even if it is a derivative work, this is an ***exception to copyright*** in US law. It may still be important to note that the work is derivative, because the author has copyright only in the original aspects.\n\nIf a work is a ***parody***, it is likely to be held to be a fair use. Note that in copyright law a **true** parody is a work that comments on the source work by imitating or mocking it. A work that imitates a source work merely to be funny, or to comment on general social conditions, or to make some other point, but **not** to comment on the original, is not a parody in US copyright law. Courts often refer to such a work as a \"satire\", even though this is not the standard literary definition of \"satire\". A Satire will usually not be a fair use of the source, or if it is, it will be for other reasons.\n\n**Addition** (in response to an addition to the question)\n\n> * original work : poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope(1688\\-1744\\)\n> * (potential) derivative work : film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" directed by Michel Gondry\n> \n> \n> The film's title is a quotation from the poem, and the quoted part is cited within the film. Does it make the film a \"derivative work\" of the poem?\n\nNo. First of all, any copyright on the poem has long expired, it is in the public domain.\n\nSecondly, merely referring to a previous work in the title and citing it in the body does not make the later work derivative, it is merely a ***literary reference***. A significant part of the earlier work would need to be used to make the film derivative. Unless much more was used than is mentioned above, this would not qualify even if the poem were still in copyright.\n\n### Meaning of \"Derivative\"\n\nLike many other words of the English language, the word \"derivative\" has several different senses. The sense leading to the definitions:\n\n> * imitative of the work of another person\n> * inspired or motivated by something\n\nis mostly used in the context of criticism and review of works of art or literature. In copyright law, \"derivative\" is a technical term, defined by the definition section of the law, and by previous court cases. It is not unrelated to the meaning from literary or art criticism, but it is specific and by no means the same. The word \"derivative\" also has other specialized meanings, for example in chemistry, and in mathematics."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered a derivative work under US copyright law?\n\nA) A movie review that quotes brief passages from the film's script\nB) A sequel novel continuing the story of characters from an existing book series\nC) A research paper citing multiple academic sources\nD) A social media post discussing the themes of a popular TV show\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is correct because a sequel novel that continues the story of existing characters would typically be considered a derivative work.

This approach is similar to that taken by other EU countries like Germany and Denmark, which have also challenged certain aspects of EU law supremacy without leaving the EU. The Polish court's decision does not nullify Poland's membership in the EU, but rather challenges the extent of EU law's supremacy in specific areas.

The money was intended for a business. They are aware that this must be an error but spend the money anyway. The bank wants the money back. The couple quits talking to the bank. The couple is charged with theft and receiving stolen property.\n\nI am very confused how they can be charged with either of these things. In the case of theft, I think it is fairly plain the couple did nothing to receive the money. No act on their part caused the money to enter their account. I think most reasonable people would agree that at that point, they \"have\" the money, and what they do with it after that is irrelevant to whether it was stolen. *If this is not the case, and the act of spending the money is the theft, then it implies that any money in anyone's account is not theirs, which I seriously doubt a jury would agree with.*\n\nWith regards to receiving stolen property, there are two options.\n\n1. My claim above is true, and the couple did not steal the money. If the property then is \"stolen,\" the uncomfortable implication is that the bank stole the money. (Teller Error, I don't think, counts as theft).\n2. My claim above is untrue, in which case, it's hard to argue they received it at all, since they are the thieves (the reception becomes trivial).\n\nIt seems to me that the prosecution is doomed if the couple decides to go to trial.\n\n**What's going to give the prosecution a chance to succeed? If they are doomed, why bother filing the charges at all?**\n\nNote: I am aware of statues in the case of mail where receiving mail which is not yours and failing to make a reasonable attempt to return it is theft.

I simply don't see how either choice in charge by the prosecution results in a conviction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Broadly speaking, theft offences in common law jurisdictions are defined as the dishonest appropriation of property that belongs to another with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it, without proper authority (e.g. permission or legal right to do that). \n\nAppropriation means the assumption of the rights of ownership of the property, i.e. behaving as if you were now its owner, not simply or solely the taking of the property.\n\nPossible defences include absence of intent to deprive the rightful owner of the property and intent to search for the rightful owner of the property and return it to them.\n\nYou say:\n\n> The facts are presented as follows: One day, couple wakes up to\n>  $120,000 extra dollars due to teller error.

It seems like that would be reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment.\n\nIs the interstate commerce clause? That seems iffy to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's the interstate commerce clause. Because of how the modern economy works. there's really pretty much nothing that's confined to a single state in its effects and doesn't affect other states. Almost any law can be justified as a regulation of interstate commerce these days, especially if that law is actually directly about commercial activity.\n\nThe big case to cite here is *United States v. Darby* ([312 US 100](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1183543472021488573)). This case tested a federal minimum wage law which banned shipping goods in interstate commerce where they were produced by people paid less than minimum wage, and also banned the employment of those people at less than minimum wage in that context. The Supreme Court found this law constitutional, even though the manufacturing employees weren't personally engaged in interstate commerce, because the employer *was* engaged in interstate commerce and regulating production was a permissible way to regulate that commerce.\n\nNow, after that decision, there was a major broadening of what was allowed to be regulated under the interstate commerce clause. In *Wickard v. Filburn* ([317 US 111](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685)), the Supreme Court ruled that the appropriate test to see whether something could be regulated as interstate commerce was whether it had a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce. Under this rule, federal regulation under the commerce clause is very far\\-reaching. It supports extending a minimum wage to domestic service workers ([*Marshall v. Rose*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6853240429044189885), a Fourth Circuit case from 1980\\); it supports extending EEOC rules to state employers ([*EEOC v.

The federal government's authority to set a minimum wage stems primarily from its power to regulate interstate commerce, as established by several key Supreme Court cases.\n\nA) The 10th Amendment is incorrect because it actually reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. It would limit, not enable, federal minimum wage laws.\n\nB) The Interstate Commerce Clause is correct. Cases like United States v. Darby and Wickard v. Filburn broadened the interpretation of the Commerce Clause, allowing the federal government to regulate activities that have a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce, including minimum wage laws.\n\nC) The Equal Protection Clause, while important for civil rights, is not the primary basis for minimum wage legislation.\n\nD) The Necessary and Proper Clause, while it expands federal power, is not the primary justification for minimum wage laws. The Commerce Clause provides a more direct basis.\n\nThe Interstate Commerce Clause has been interpreted broadly by the Supreme Court to allow federal regulation of many economic activities, including employment practices like minimum wage, even when the activities themselves are not directly involved in interstate commerce."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/how-can-a-lender-of-a-small-loan-protect-himself-from-the-borrower-not-paying-th", "docs_id": 86043, "title": "How can a lender of a small loan protect himself from the borrower not paying them back?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: An acquaintance asked me to lend him money.

Is\n> this correct?\n\nYes. This is an annualized interest rate of 715,586,124,880,210%, which is far, far in excess of the maximum interest rate allowed by law.\n\nThe maximum legally allowed interest rate in British Columbia is 60% per annum. So, an interest rate of 65 cents or more in a five day period on a loan of $100\\.00 is illegal.\n\n> I don't know his current address.\n\nLending money without collateral to people without knowing their current address is just plain stupid when it comes to lending practices. Nobody does that without a primarily donative intent.\n\n> Would have holding collateral been a legal solution?\n\nPotentially. This is essentially the business model of a pawn shop.\n\nIn the case of a pawn shop, the borrower delivers tangible personal property to the pawn shop owner who takes custody of it, which serves as collateral for a small loan with a set, legal interest rate, for a fixed period of time much greater than five days (typically several weeks or to several months). If the loan is not repaid, the collateral becomes the property of the lender in full payment of the loan, and the parties haggle in advance over the fair market value of the collateral against which the customer may borrow the full amount.\n\nA pawn is essentially equivalent to an outright sale of tangible personal property (almost always used) in exchange for cash, with a right to rescind the deal for a modest interest charge within X number of days after the sale.\n\nSince the pawn shop owner has some asset of the borrower to collect from in the event of non\\-payment, and the loan is \"non\\-recourse\" (i.e. collection rights are limited to taking ownership of the collateral), it isn't important to even know the address of the borrower, and no lawsuits are necessary for the lending pawn shop owner to be made whole if the loan is not repaid.\n\nThe down side of running a pawn shop is that the owner needs to have considerable skill to value the collateral at a price sufficient to repay the loan together with a fair share of the administrative expenses of the operation on a case by case basis, for the very modest profit margin associated with a typical pawn shop.\n\nMost people who are skilled enough to value tangible personal property accurately enough to make money running a pawn ship are also skilled enough to do other things that pay better.\n\n> Late Charge: Any payment not remunerated within 10 days of its due\n> date shall be subject to a belatedly charge of 5 percent (%) of the\n> payment, not to exceed $500 for any such late installment.\n\nLate charges are considered in the maximum interest rate calculation, so you need a much longer term loan and a much lower interest rate for this to be legally permissible.\n\n> Collection fees: If this note is placed with a legal representative\n> for collection, then Borrower agrees to pay an attorney's fee of ten\n> percent (10%) of the voluntary balance. This fee will be added to the\n> unpaid balance of the loan.\n\nNot sure what is meant by the \"voluntary balance.\" It isn't inherently improper to include the costs of collection in a loan agreement, and indeed, I think that this may be the default rule of law in British Columbia without any contractual term under loser pays rules of civil procedure.\n\nBut, a court can decline to award more than the \"reasonable\" legal fees incurred to collect a debt, and it is not at all clear that even the minimal amount of legal fees one could incur to collect a debt would be reasonable to collect a loan of $100 and interest.\n\nLikewise, while there are \"hard money loans\" (i.e. loans secured only by collateral and no personal obligation to pay that can be enforced against an individual's assets in court), where it is customary for the legal costs of drafting the loan documents to be paid by the borrower rather than the lender, for the most part, this simply makes no sense, because even 12 minutes of legal time (0\\.2 hours in the typical legal billing format) is an excessive amount to charge for a $100 loan for a five day period of time. This would typically be $50\\-$60 or more. It would probably be treated as an interest charge and hence would be illegal in British Columbia.\n\n> Would a term like \"if the lender needs to resort to legal action to\n> enforce a term of this agreement, the borrow will reimburse him for\n> all related expenses and his time\" be enforceable?\n\nReimbursement for out of pocket court filing fees and any photocopying costs and process server costs is likely to be enforceable. Reimbursement for the lenders own time to enforce the loan in the event of a default is probably not enforceable in the case of a $100 loan, even at minimum wage.\n\nMaking small loans has historically been a marginal economic sector for precisely this reason. Even if the default rate is low, the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing (in the event of defaults) a small loan and the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing these promise for a much larger loan are similar. But the dollar amount of interest generated by a small loan is much smaller relative to the administrative costs involved than the interest on a large loan.\n\nCredit card companies and similar lenders make small loans affordable by automating the lending process, screening borrowers based upon credit ratings, making many loans each month to the same borrower, and making loans to many, many borrowers to spread the risk out. But making small loans on a one\\-off basis is not a profitable venture.\n\nBusiness models that charge enough to be profitable with small loans, like payday lenders and car title lenders in the United States, usually have some sort of collateral or *de facto* collateral (like a post\\-dated check), and tend to be shut down by regulators because their interest rates typically need to be on the order of 150%\\-400% per annum to make a profit, due to high administrative costs involved in making small loans relative to the amount of the loan. But interest rates this high are considered exploitive and are illegal.\n\nAnother business model, which essentially describes the business model in the question except for the enforcement method, is called \"loan sharking\". The main difference between legitimate or almost legitimate small loan lending and loan sharking, is that loan sharks enforce their loans by having organized crime enforcers beat up people who don't pay, rather than using lawsuits to deal with loan defaults. This is, of course, completely illegal and a serious crime."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A lender provides a $100 loan to be repaid as $150 in 5 days.

The Personal Representative (in this case, Sarah as the executor) is responsible for managing the tenancy as part of the estate. She has the right to serve a notice to quit to the landlord to end the periodic tenancy. Until this notice is served and the notice period expires, the estate remains liable for rent payments.

Is there any legal action or rights (the law or police) I can use as a deterant to allow common sense to prevail so that this person doesn't discard my stuff before they can be collected this Friday? The person lives in a university accomodation, would contacting the university help?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your agreement amounted to a contract, then by discarding your property this person might be committing a breech of contract, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. If you paid this person to look after your property, then s/he has a greater responsibility than if it was merely a personal favor that was not paid for or compensated.\n\nA person who is in possession of the property of another (with permission) is in general required to give thew owner \"reasonable notice\" to reclaim the property before discarding it, but is not required to retain it indefinitely. If there is some specific legal duty to care for the property, that will increase the required level of care. Otherwise what is reasonable will depend on the specific circumstances. I don't know if German law would impose any specific time limits in such a situation.\n\nI wouldn't think that the landlord, whether it is University housing or not, would impose any duty or exercise any control over the resident, unless perhaps you had recently lived in that dwelling.\n\nThis answer is under general principles of law, and is not specific to the law of Germany."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John agreed to store Sarah's two suitcases in his university apartment for a week. After three days, John threatens to discard Sarah's property if she doesn't retrieve it immediately. Sarah has arranged for collection on Friday, two days from now. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's legal position?\n\nA) Sarah can immediately call the police to enforce her property rights, as John's threats constitute theft.\n\nB) Sarah has no legal recourse, as John has the right to dispose of any property in his apartment at will.\n\nC) Sarah may have a claim for breach of contract against John if he discards her property without giving reasonable notice.\n\nD) The university housing office has a legal obligation to intervene and protect Sarah's property from John.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. If Sarah and John had an agreement (which could be considered a contract) for John to store Sarah's property for a specific time, John's threat to discard the items prematurely could potentially be seen as a breach of contract. The documentation mentions that a person in possession of another's property is generally required to give \"reasonable notice\" before discarding it. While the exact timeframe for \"reasonable notice\" may vary, John's threat to discard the items after only three days, especially when Sarah has already arranged for Friday collection, likely falls short of this standard.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this situation doesn't constitute theft, and immediate police intervention isn't typically warranted for such disputes. Option B is incorrect because John doesn't have the right to arbitrarily dispose of Sarah's property, especially given their prior agreement. Option D is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, the university (as John's landlord) likely has no duty or control over this personal agreement between John and Sarah."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9360/oracle-vs-google-can-oracle-sue-any-company-who-is-using-java-and-making-profit", "docs_id": 9360, "title": "Oracle vs Google: Can Oracle sue any company who is using Java and making profit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lot of companies in the world use Java including the company I work for.

The key document that you need here is a copy of the registration of birth document that the Indian mission gives you from the previous step.\n\nAfter acquiring the Indian passport of your child, you can go ahead and then apply for an American passport. Do note that a minors passport is only valid for 5 years at a time and you will need to renew this every 5 years. And when the child turns 18 then they will need to either renounce their foreign citizenship or Indian citizenship. In general by acquiring foreign citizenship the individual is deemed to have lost their Indian citizenship, however the issue is that a minor cannot renounce their Indian citizenship.\n\nThis is the route that I have personally taken and my child holds both an Indian and American passport.\n\nNow getting to your particular question, the short answer is yes your child is eligible to acquire Indian citizenship by registration.

On the facts in your question, it is clear that no such Final Charging Order was issued before the bankruptcy commenced.\n\nAn Interim Charging Order will by necessity end unless a Final Charging Order is made. Since no such Order was made, it would seem that the Interim Charging Order has ended: the interim order is designed to stop someone from disposing of assets until the court can decide whether a final order is necessary. If no final order is made, the interim order dies with it.\n\nA check on the Land Registry against the property would be needed to ensure that any notices or restrictions have been removed. If they are still present against the property's entry, an application to have them removed will have to be filed.\n\nFurthermore, the Limitation Act 1980 provides a time limit of six or twelve years (cause of action dependent) for the creditor to take action to enforce their rights.\n\n* In relation to enforcing judgments, the creditor has six years from the date of judgment to enforce it ([Section 24 of the Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/24))\n* In relation to recovering money secured by a charge or to recover the proceeds relating to a sale of land, the creditor has twelve years from the date that their right to receive the money started ([Section 20 of the Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/20))\n\nIn either case, even if a Final Charging Order were able to be made in these circumstances, it is possible to argue that the relevant sections of the Limitation Act 1980 prevent the creditor from pursuing any right of action and so the debt (and any enforcement action) is statute\\-barred."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John obtained an Interim Charging Order against Sarah's property on October 1, 2009.

Based on the case of Nationwide Building Society v Wright [2009], Sarah's bankruptcy would have prevented a Final Charging Order from being issued. An Interim Charging Order ends if no Final Charging Order is made. Additionally, the Limitation Act 1980 provides time limits for enforcing judgments (6 years) or recovering money secured by a charge (12 years). Since over 13 years have passed, John's claim is likely statute-barred, meaning he can no longer legally enforce it.

The Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual has a [section on misdemeanor offenses that apply to postal crime:](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1468-misdemeanor-postal-crimes)\n\n> Among the misdemeanor dispositions available are: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 (obstruction of mails generally); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(b) (opening,destroying, or detaining mail without authority); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1707 (theft of property used by postal service); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 (misappropriation of postal funds). **When the charge might best lie under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705 (destruction of letter boxes or mail) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1706 (injury to mail bags) and in other appropriate circumstances, an applicable misdemeanor may be found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (theft of government property); or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (destruction of government property).**\n\nThat suggests (at least to me) that federal prosecutors are supposed to at least consider misdemeanor instead of felony charges for minor cases of mailbox destruction. [Under normal circumstances,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1361) destruction of federal property only becomes a felony if the damage (or attempted damage) is more than $1,000\\.\n\nThis is a pretty good example of how US laws are written with prosecutorial discretion in mind. In other systems, the law about destruction of mail or mailboxes would lay out when it's a serious crime and when it's minor. In the US, it's always considered a serious crime because the assumption is that prosecutors won't charge it in minor cases (in fact, official guidance to prosecutors lays out ways they can charge it without charging the felony).\n\nIt's also possible to be prosecuted at the state level for this, and if you're actually a juvenile that's much more likely than federal prosecution. The feds don't really like handling juvenile cases; they normally leave those up to the states unless there's some good reason not to. Even if you're an adult, the feds may well leave the issue up to the state for prosecution. At the state level, the threshold for felony vs. misdemeanor vandalism would depend on the state.

These fees can be substantial ($75 per NOI plus $10 per group of 1-100 additional titles) and may exceed the actual royalty amount for small quantities. \n\nOption A is incorrect because simply paying $0.10 directly to the copyright holder is not sufficient under current law. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while HFA may charge $16, this is not a legal requirement but rather their business policy. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the 9.1 cent rate is not directly set by statute, and the copyright holder is not automatically required to grant a license upon offer of payment."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85723/when-does-a-judge-decide-to-address-issues-outside-the-scope-of-a-specific-case", "docs_id": 85723, "title": "When does a judge decide to address issues outside the scope of a specific case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a 2012 case, Associate Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (now King's Bench) of Alberta, J.D. Rooke, wrote a decision which ran to 176 pages and contained what was essentially a thesis on Sovereign Citizens and similar persons who use pseudo\\-legal arguments to attempt to achieve their ends in court. The case of [*Meads v Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html) has become fairly famous and [somewhat influential](https://ablawg.ca/2013/04/08/what-has-meads-v-meads-wrought/), which seems to have been what the judge was hoping for.\n\nHowever, on what basis did the judge decide to stray beyond the matter immediately before him (a divorce dispute)? The *Meads* decision categorised several different (albeit related) types of vexatious litigant. Surely Meads himself was just one type, so the others were not relevant in the immediate context of the case. In terms of court procedure, it seems to me that J.D. Rooke probably *should* have written a much shorter decision, relevant only to the facts immediately before him, and published the rest as an article in a law journal.\n\nIs there any reasonable constraint on how much a judge can or should write in a decision? How common is it for judges to sneak essays into their rulings? Given that this was a civil case between two private citizens, using the opportunity to address the nation, as it were, seems out of place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These decisions are inherently individual. The judge in this case explained the reasons why he thought it would be helpful to set out the full context of organized pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments. *Meads v. Meads*, [2012 ABQB 571](https://canlii.ca/t/fsvjq):\n\n> \\[2] Over a decade of reported cases have proven that the individual concepts advanced by OPCA litigants are invalid. What remains is to categorize these schemes and concepts, identify global defects to simplify future response to variations of identified and invalid OPCA themes, and develop court procedures and sanctions for persons who adopt and advance these vexatious litigation strategies.\n> \n> \n> \\[3] ... One of the purposes of these Reasons is, through this litigant, to uncover, expose, collate, and publish the tactics employed by the OPCA community, as a part of a process to eradicate the growing abuse that these litigants direct towards the justice and legal system we otherwise enjoy in Alberta and across Canada. I will respond on a point\\-by\\-point basis to the broad spectrum of OPCA schemes, concepts, and arguments advanced in this action by Mr. Meads.\n> \n> \n> \\[5] The Meads case illustrates many characteristic features of OPCA materials, in court conduct, and litigation strategies. These Reasons will, therefore, explain my June 8, 2012 decision and provide analysis and reasoning that is available for reference and application to other similar proceedings.\n> \n> \n> \\[6] Naturally, my conclusions are important for these parties. However, they also are intended to assist others, who have been taken in/duped by gurus, to realize that these practices are entirely ineffective; to empower opposing parties and their counsel to take action; and as a warning to gurus that the Court will not tolerate their misconduct.\n\nOne of the roles of a judge in the common\\-law legal system is to guide the development of the law. By describing this collection of vexatious tactics, the judge was hoping to allow future courts to simplify court responses to these tactics in future cases.\n\nWhile the reasons in *Meads* were written prior to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Hryniak v. Mauldin*, 2014 SCC 7, it is consistent with the Supreme Court's direction to create an environment that promotes timely access to justice.\n\n> Increasingly, there is recognition that a culture shift is required in order to create an environment promoting timely and affordable access to the civil justice system. This shift entails simplifying pre\\-trial procedures and moving the emphasis away from the conventional trial in favour of proportional procedures tailored to the needs of the particular case. The balance between procedure and access struck by our justice system must come to reflect modern reality and recognize that new models of adjudication can be fair and just.\n\nBy helping other judges efficiently understand and dispose of pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments, the reasons in *Meads* further the goals of access to justice. This implication was recongized in *Jarvis v. Morlog*, [2016 ONSC 4476](https://canlii.ca/t/gsdr5):\n\n> In my view, precious judicial time should be spent on resolving real matters. Simply taking judicial time to respond seriously to OPCA claims gives the claimants a measure of success in advancing their improper purposes. Associate Chief Justice Rooke spent more than enough of his very valuable time creating a textbook of abusive OPCA practices in *Meads v. Meads.* In my view, not another moment of judicial resources or party expense should be invested on OPCA claims.\n\nThe legacy of *Meads* is examined by Donald J. Netolitzky, \"[After the Hammer: Six Years of *Meads v. Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/2019CanLIIDocs2094)\" (2019\\). He argues that the judge was successful in this goal. He also agrees with you that this decision is \"exceptional\": in the breadth of its investigation and its choice of audience (at times speaking \"directly to those who use and promote OPCA concepts\"). He notes that *Meads* has been accepted in subsequent jurisprudence as a \"critical resource\" in Canada and around the world.\n\nWhile one might expect that the material in *Meads* would have been the more appropriate role of an academic article, Netolitzky observes that \"\\[i]n Canada, legal academia has paid essentially no attention to pseudolaw, both before and after *Meads*.\" Perhaps had there been a helpful body of academic literature, *Meads* would have been unnecessary.\n\nNetolitzky argues that the reasons in *Meads* reflected \"trial court expertise.\" These matters tend not to end up in courts of appeal. He also agrees with your analogy to an academic article, calling this a \"review judgment\" (like a \"review article\"). He says that *Meads* \"atypical content\" was needed to \"fill a gap in legal literature\" and that it was sufficiently connected with the materials and arguments put forward in the case. \"Without that context, Meads is a bizarre, inexplicable actor, a caricature of vexatious litigation.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about the Meads v. Meads case and its impact, which of the following statements best describes the primary justification for Justice Rooke's extensive 176-page decision?\n\nA) To set a precedent for judges to regularly include lengthy essays on legal theory in their rulings\nB) To provide a comprehensive resource for future courts to efficiently address pseudo-legal arguments\nC) To publish an academic article disguised as a court decision due to lack of interest from legal academia\nD) To unnecessarily extend the scope of the ruling beyond the immediate facts of the divorce case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Justice Rooke's primary justification for writing such an extensive decision was to provide a comprehensive resource for future courts to efficiently address pseudo-legal arguments. This is supported by several key points in the text:\n\n1. Justice Rooke explicitly stated his intention to \"uncover, expose, collate, and publish the tactics employed by the OPCA community\" to help eradicate abuse of the justice system.\n\n2. He aimed to \"provide analysis and reasoning that is available for reference and application to other similar proceedings.\"\n\n3. The decision was meant to assist others in realizing these practices are ineffective, empower opposing parties, and warn \"gurus\" against misconduct.\n\n4. The text notes that Meads has been accepted as a \"critical resource\" in Canada and around the world, fulfilling this intended purpose.\n\n5. It's mentioned that the decision helps further the goals of access to justice by allowing judges to efficiently understand and dispose of pseudo-legal commercial arguments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the decision was lengthy, there's no indication this was meant to set a precedent for all judges to regularly include such essays.\n\nOption C, while touching on the lack of academic attention, is not the primary justification. The decision was primarily meant as a judicial resource, not a disguised academic article.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, although the decision went beyond the immediate facts of the divorce case, this was done purposefully to address a broader legal issue, not unnecessarily."}}
