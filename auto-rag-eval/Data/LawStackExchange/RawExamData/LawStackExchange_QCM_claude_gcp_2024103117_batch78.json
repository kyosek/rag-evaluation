Of course one can not have this conversation without mentioning of the so\\-called \"[Prosecutor's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy)\". Most of the examples of this date back to the late\\-90s/early 2000s e.g Sally Clark, Angela Cannings etc.\n\nThe fallacy involves statistical reasoning in court cases. Basically, it is the error of assuming that the odds of a false positive are the odds of the defendant's guilt. So when the expert witness declares that the DNA test is 99\\.9% accurate, the prosecution tells the jury this means there is only 0\\.1% chance that the defendant is innocent.\n\nMy question is has anything actually been done to address the issue of prosecutors and unqualified expert witnesses giving misleading statistics in the courtroom? Or have lawyers more or less learned their lesson from these instances and are more careful about it now?\n\nMoreover, does anyone know of any other general practises that have been implemented to help prevent faulty scientific analysis from being presented in court?\n\n(I'm asking mainly about the English legal system, however please feel free to present anything relevant about the American system or any other).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This [article on the Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) is a reasonable intro\\-level presentation of the relevant case law for the US. This related to [\"Rule 702\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702), a rule governing the admissibility of evidence. The rule is based on, three Supreme Court rulings: Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; General Electric Co. v. Joiner; Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael. The main points of the rule are that the judge decides what is admissible (as opposed to judges letting anything be admitted and juries decide what they believe), and must determine that the expert testimony is relevant and reliable (it must be more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand). The court adopts the hypothesis\\-testing viewpoint, and proof/falsification is based on criteria for acceptance or rejection: is the theory generally accepted in the scientific community, has it been subjected to peer review and publication, is it even testable and has it been tested, is the (potential) rate of error acceptable, and does the supporting research exist independent of the proposed testimony.\n\nNeither prosecutors not defense attorneys testify, and there is little that can be done to limit the creativity of attorneys to ask questions that have the effect of making people believe that the question was a factual statement. Judgments of \"qualifications\" are extremely hard to make, however in some instances there are certification boards (typically, for any regulated industry such as mechanical engineering or medicine). Since I have no medical credentials, I doubt that any judge would allow me to testify as an expert witness on a medical question. Being a particle physicist is not a regulated industry at least in the US, so the criteria for expertise would be more subjective (judges aren't expected to know who the leading physicists are).\n\nThe general remedy for \"faulty scientific reasoning\" is cross\\-examination and competing testimony. That is, the \"other side\" needs a scientific consultant to point out the flaws in the reasoning. Word\\-of\\-mouth is one way that attorneys learn who to call, when scientific questions arise.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the Daubert Standard and its impact on expert testimony in US courts?\n\nA) It allows judges to admit any expert testimony, leaving juries to decide what to believe\nB) It requires expert witnesses to have formal certifications in their field of expertise\nC) It establishes criteria for judges to determine the admissibility of expert testimony based on relevance and reliability\nD) It prevents prosecutors from presenting statistical evidence in court cases\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Daubert Standard, as described in the passage, establishes criteria for judges to determine the admissibility of expert testimony based on relevance and reliability. It requires judges to act as gatekeepers, ensuring that expert testimony is both relevant to the case and based on reliable scientific methods. The standard is derived from several Supreme Court rulings and is codified in Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Daubert Standard actually gives judges more control over what expert testimony is admissible, rather than allowing all testimony and leaving it to juries to decide.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the passage mentions that some fields have certification boards, the Daubert Standard does not specifically require formal certifications for expert witnesses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Daubert Standard does not prevent prosecutors from presenting statistical evidence.

The developer needs to ensure they have proper authorization to use the SDK, which typically was only licensed to selected game companies. They must also adhere to any requirements in the license agreement, such as registering with Nintendo if required. While Nintendo cannot prevent others from writing programs for their hardware, they can control the use of their development software. The developer must also be careful not to reproduce any of Nintendo's copyrighted software without permission.

This can be done and the example you provide could happen.\n\nThis is done in civil cases, but not in criminal cases. The other main exception is that a court will not apply another jurisdiction's tax laws, although this is less absolute and the other jurisdiction's tax laws may still be considered as relevant to a civil dispute, so long as they are not enforced.\n\nFor example, I have litigated a case where the events took place in France in a U.S. Court where the court had jurisdiction over the parties and the relevant choice of law rules pointed to French law.\n\nThe overarching principle of that the law of the place with the most significant connection to the legal issue decided applies. But there are many subsidiary rules that provide clarity in some areas (although the clarity was reduced with the effect of making forum law apply more often, in the 1960s\\-1980s after a previous regime of more black and white rules).\n\nA clause like this is generally effective if it the parties have any connection to the forum chosen. It is a close cousin, although not nearly so strongly preferred in the law, of an arbitration clause.\n\n> Also do such clauses go by other names than \"attornment\" clauses? This\n> article points out such a name is specific to Canada.\n\nYes. In the U.S. an \"[attornment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attornment)\" clause is a provision that requires a party to a contract to affirmatively declare upon notice from the other party if the attorning party claims that the other party is in breach of the contract or has unfulfilled obligations (with the attorning party waiving any claims for breach of contract not identified at that time). An \"attornment\" clause is normally found in a lease or secured promissory note and facilitates the transfer of the leased property or secured debt in a way that the new owner can know that there is no risk that it is already in default apart from the transferor's representation.

According to the expert response, there is no obvious reason why the customer cannot initiate a chargeback, even after winning a court judgment. The chargeback in this context is considered a form of payment, where money moves from the business owner's account to the customer's account. This should be treated as a satisfaction (or partial satisfaction) of the court judgment, depending on the amounts involved. The business owner would be justified in insisting that the chargeback be applied towards the judgment amount. They should then file the appropriate documentation with the court to reflect this payment or partial payment of the judgment. Options A and B are incorrect because they mistakenly assume the customer is limited to only pursuing payment through the court system.

Isn't it entirely a state matter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitution delegates the power of selecting Electors to the states themselves, through whatever method the state legislature so chooses (today it is always through a popular vote, in most cases statewide but in two cases it is done also by district). Elections for the Senate and Congress are also specifically delegated as to be done however each state legislature so chooses. A right to vote isn't mentioned in the constitution until the suffrage amendments. These protected the right to vote independent of race, servitude, and gender. Moreover, they granted Congress the authority to legislate so as to achieve these ends. So there is federal power intersecting with voting, at least.\n\nThose probably aren't the bone of contention here, however. The claimed issue, as I understand it, is actually from the first part. The claim is that what is going on\u2014extending deadlines etc. via decisions of election boards, court orders, or whatever\u2014is a violation of the Constitution delegating control over voting to the legislatures. In the case of decisions by election boards (or similar thing), as the legislature in question will have of necessity passed legislation empowering the board to make such a decision on their own, it boils down to whether or not the legislature is held to have the power to delegate that power or not. There's no hard and fast rule for this: sometimes the US Congress has been held to have delegated too much, other times it's held to be just fine (and Kavanaugh, I think, seems inclined to think it has delegated too much in general and this needs to be addressed). For court orders, it becomes a question of whether the court has the authority to make such orders, or if this is an infringement of a power reserved to the legislatures.\n\nEither way, it becomes a constitutional issue: do actions of election boards, duly enacted by legislation, or court orders, (sometimes) run afoul of the Constitutional grant of this power to the state legislatures? Chief Justice Roberts appears to be trying to toe a line where he does not want to get involved with second\\-guessing state election boards and state courts, wanting to just let those stand as state matters reserved to them by the constitution. His problem, it would seem, is with what federal courts can do, and he seems open to reviewing decisions from federal courts that concern the exercise of state powers on elections. In other words, he seems inclined to let stand a state court ruling to extend a deadline, but may take issue with a *federal* court issuing such a ruling. Of course, there are now 5 other \"conservative\" justices besides Roberts, only 4 of which are needed to hear a case, so the ability for Roberts to get the court to go along with this apparent line of legal reasoning will be strongly dependent on his ability to convince at least two of those conservatives of the correctness, or at least wisdom, of doing so.

This means that when PayPal split from eBay, the existing user agreements could be transferred to the new PayPal entity without requiring new agreements from users. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the split itself doesn't necessarily require new agreements from limited accounts. \n\nOption B is false because the information states that users not in good standing (with limited accounts) were not given the option to agree or disagree with new terms. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation specifically mentions that PayPal does not allow users with limited accounts to close their accounts easily.\n\nThe key point is that assignment clauses in the original agreements likely allow for the continuation of existing terms, even after the corporate split."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44051/how-much-authority-do-teachers-get-from-in-loco-parentis", "docs_id": 44051, "title": "How much authority do teachers get from *In Loco Parentis*?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am concerned entirely with the issue as it relates to property. \n\nLet's say at Madeup Prep the cell phone policy allows for phones to be in pockets, but not out in class. Some teachers, however, ignore this, and have students use their phones to answer questions in real time (via something like TopHat). \n\nNow let's say Alice has her phone out when she should not, and it is taken away by the teacher. It is returned sometime later. Then Alice's mother tells Alice's teacher that the phone is her property, not her daughter's, not the teacher's, that only Alice has permission to use it, and that if the teacher takes the phone away again, the mother considers it theft and (legal threat here). \n\n**Can the teacher/district take the phone anyway due to In Loco Parentis?**\n\nNote: For the record, the better solution for the district is to simply give detentions every time Alice violates the rule from now on, leading to eventual suspension and expulsion, but I'm far more interested in how much parenting authority a teacher/school can legally exert even when the actual parents are *clearly and conspicuously opposed to such exertion.* \n\n**Bonus Question: The phone is actually Alice's property, bought and paid for with money Alice earned at her job. Does this change the answer?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The school can confiscate a cell phone if you violated phone usage policy, because schools have broad powers to set student conduct policies. Searching the phone is a separate matter: a search requires reasonable suspicion and the search has to be narrowly related to that suspicion. As long as there is an actual policy and a violation of the policy, there seems to be no limit on confiscating phones.\n\nSchool authority over children in the US was historically justified by reference to the *in loco parentis* doctrine since [State v. Pendergrass](https://la.utexas.edu/users/jmciver/357L/19NC365.html), 19 N.C. 365, granting school \"the authority necessary for preserving discipline\", which is \"analogous to that which belongs to parents, and the authority of the teacher is regarded as a delegation of parental authority\". More contemporary rulings on the question of school authority, again in the domain of \ncorporal punishment,\nas articulated in [Ingraham v. Wright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/651/), 430 U.S. 651 find that \n\n> the concept of parental delegation has been replaced by the view \\-\\-\n>  more consonant with compulsory education laws \\-\\- that the State itself\n>  may impose such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary \"for\n>  the proper education of the child and for the maintenance of group\n>  discipline\".\n\nIn other words, the courts do not rely on the parental doctrine to justify school authority, instead they rely on what is reasonably necessary to achieve an end. Thus in [New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/469/325), 469 U.S. 325, *in loco parentis* was rejected as a rationale for an unconstitutional search, reasoning \n\n> If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the\n>  constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it\n>  is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising\n>  parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of\n>  their students.\n\nInstead, the court frames the test in terms of competing interests:\n\n> Against the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial\n>  interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in\n>  the classroom and on school grounds.\n\nSince school authority to confiscate cell phones does not rest on acting according to the wishes of the parent, it is irrelevant that the parent approves of the child's actions. They may take the phone away, but it is not because of *in loco parentis*, it's because of necessity. It does not matter whose property it is; and it is not theft, because the confiscation was lawful.\n\n*In loco parentis* is not necessarily dead, see [Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/646/), 515 U.S. 646, where compulsory drug testing was justified, finding that\n\n> the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government's\n>  responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian and tutor\n>  of children entrusted to its care...\n> \n> \n> when the government acts as guardian and tutor the relevant question\n>  is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian and tutor\n>  might undertake\n\nIt is not part of a school's remit to promulgate the drug\\-free life, so drug testing cannot be justified by appeal to necessity. Disciplinary matters are squarely within the scope of what is necessary for schools, so disciplinary questions don't need to rely on *in loco parentis*. In the Vernonia case, the court still finds that the state has limited reach to override the rights of children \u2013 parents still have much broader rights to restrict children than the state does.

Modern court rulings have moved away from relying solely on the in loco parentis doctrine to justify school authority. Instead, courts now consider what is reasonably necessary for schools to maintain discipline and achieve educational goals. The school's ability to confiscate a cell phone is based on the necessity of enforcing their policies and maintaining order, not on acting as a parent substitute. The ownership of the phone (whether it belongs to Alice, her mother, or anyone else) is irrelevant in this context. The school's authority to confiscate the phone as a disciplinary measure is not considered theft, as it's a lawful action within their authority to maintain discipline.

For example it increases the penalty for vandalizing government property, creates offenses for assault on a first responder carrying out their duties (depending on the severity of the assault), increases the penalty for aggravated rioting, obstruction of highways and so on. It also clarifies that being assembling or being present at the scene of a riot is not an offense. The only new crime created is assault on a first responder. Unauthorized camping on state property was already a crime: this is an increase in the penalty for committing that crime. It does have a requirement for notice and continued violation for 24 hours, unlike vandalism where if you do the deed, you can be arrested.\n\nThe courts have not held that the First Amendment protects the right to trespass, assault or commit vandalism. The only viable avenue for a legal challenge is that the punishment is cruel and unusual (too severe). A change from Class A misdemeanor to Class E felony is the smallest increment in penalty. The state will argue that the increase in penalty is necessary to maintain public order, and that it is not arbitrary or capricious, because there have been many recent violations of the law.

The legislation in Tennessee does not create a new crime, but rather increases the penalty for the existing offense of unauthorized camping on state property. While this change is significant (from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class E felony), it's not unprecedented for governments to increase penalties for frequently violated laws. \n\nThe state could potentially defend this change by arguing it's necessary to maintain public order, especially if there have been numerous recent violations. Courts have generally not held that the First Amendment protects acts like trespassing or unauthorized camping, so a First Amendment challenge is unlikely to succeed.\n\nWhile the severity of the punishment could be challenged as cruel and unusual, the change from a misdemeanor to the lowest class of felony might not be considered extreme enough to meet that threshold.

It's important to note that this law applies to indirect as well as direct promises of value, so the method of donation doesn't matter.

E\\-mail and name will typically be covered by contract reasons; you may need consent for other pieces of information if they are not needed to fulfill the contract or legal obligations. Other data may require the user's consent.\n\nSending to a user his own data is not an issue, as e\\-mail is usually considered a safe communication channel.\n\nA different issue is that, by using this mechanism, that data is going to appear in more places than needed. For example, in your server and firewall logs, that registers accesses to `https://business.lee-m123.example/login?email=mysecreteemail@gmail.com&name=DrDoom`, for example. These registers then become affected by the GDPR, and if the person asks you to provide which information do you have about them, you have to include them1.\n\nAdditionally, someone could object to the system on the grounds of data rectification. If a customer tells you \"My name is not Larry, but Lawrence (or, FWIW, Vanessa)\", the link will still fill the fields with the old name. I would say that you would be ok (it is not your data that is wrong), but a less technically savvy person may object and get upset and force you to do some work explaining your system without need; and in the best of cases it is a nuisance to your customer who will be correcting the name each time.\n\nFrom a technical POV I do not understand why you do not just send an ID in the parameters and then, when you get that ID, fill the forms with the data that you have in your database. And of course, keep that form protected2 with a password or whatever so nobody can just pass random IDs and retrieve your users data without proving that it is them.\n\n---\n\n1It would also become an issue if the user asks you to delete your records about him; you might be able to claim \"legitimate needs\" to keep the logs but it is still an unnecessary trouble.\n\n2Because you are already protecting that form from unauthorized access, AREN'T YOU?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company uses personalized email links with query string variables (e.g., domain.com?email=larry@test.com&firstname=Larry) to populate forms on landing pages.

If you stop paying the finance company, they will initiate legal proceedings against you to make good on your obligation, and that won't affect what the contractor does. It might not hurt you to write a formal letter (no phone calls) to the contractor stating that you require them to complete the job by some date certain, and hope that you won't have to take the matter to court. If you decide to write the letter yourself, you want to avoid saying anything that could be held against your interest, for example \"I don't care how crappy a job you do, I just want this job done!\": you need to be sure that what you say in a letter does not put you at a legal disadvantage. The best way to guarantee that is to hire an attorney to write the letter. If you want your money back (plus interest), you will almost certainly need to hire an attorney to write the letter.\n\nIt is possible that there is an arbitration clause in your contract, requiring you to settle disputes with the firm Dewey, Cheatham \\& Howe.

But there are alternative options to prove the same thing, even then.\n\nA copyright registration certificate is not like a dollar bill or an original promissory note, where a copy isn't as good as the original, even though it can be slightly convenient to have the original in hand.\n\n> Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?\n\nIf you scan them and then shred them, nothing horrible will happen. In the rare worst case scenario where the fact of your registration is disputed by a stubborn defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit all of the way up to trial, you could get a replacement certified copy from the Copyright Registrar, or you could prove your registration with other evidence.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nRegistration is not required for a copyright to come into being in U.S. law. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 408(a). But it is a condition precedent (i.e. a requirement that must be met prior to taking action) to certain legal remedies. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\\. So, proving your registration is usually one element of your infringement claim in a typical copyright infringement lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, if you actually go to trial, you need to prove that the copyright was registered in a timely fashion, if the other side won't stipulate to that fact.\n\nBut it would be rare for a defendant who had been presented with a copy to insist that the fact of registration be proven at trial because being that stubborn is likely to piss off the judge unless they can successfully prove that you have faked your claim to have a registered copyright, which is something that almost no intelligent lawyer in a copyright infringement lawsuit wants to do, since judges have broad discretion on so many issues, even in a jury trial.\n\nThe easiest way to prove the fact that your copyright was registered on a particular date is to offer up a certified government document like the ones that you have in your office into evidence as an exhibit (typically, one of your very first exhibits in your infringement case). This is because an official government certificate is exempt from the hearsay rule, is \"self\\-authenticating\" ,and its contents are admissible if not barred by another rule of evidence (which it almost never would be). The legal reason for keeping these paper documents is to get that evidentiary benefit at trial. *See* Federal Rules of Evidence [803(8\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803) (exceptions to the hearsay rule), [902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902) (self\\-authentication) and [1005](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_1005) (admissibility of public records).\n\nOf course, mostly, these fancy certificates are issued as a matter of pride and ego and customer satisfaction. Prior to an actual trial or evidentiary hearing in a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copy, supported by your declaration under penalty of perjury that the copy isn't a fake, would be the usual way to establish your registration in documents that are e\\-filed through the federal electronic e\\-filing service called CM/ECF rather than presented in person on paper anyway.\n\nTypically, pretrial document disclosure is done via an electronic transmission of scanned copies as well.\n\nIn practice, it would be quite rare for a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit to insist that you prove up your registration at trial, rather than just stipulating to it. Indeed, it is you who might not want to stipulate in a jury trial, just so you can flash an important looking document in front of the jurors right at the start of the trial for dramatic effect. But you don't have to do that.\n\nUltimately, if the defendant really did insist on proof of your registration, you could get a new certified copy from the Copyright Registrar (which wouldn't be quite as pretty, but would have the same legal effect) for a small fee without too much advanced notice, or you could introduce your scanned copy into evidence and authenticate it through, for example, your testimony on the stand under oath that you scanned the original and that it is a true and correct copy of the original.\n\nYou also might want to keep a paper copy because it will still be around if all of the relevant electronic records are destroyed or inaccessible for some reason.

The sign-up process for PACER is described as \"horrible.\"\n3. Users should be cautious when searching, as some queries can result in unexpected high costs.\n4. The RECAP browser extension is recommended as a way to potentially access documents for free if they've been previously purchased by other users.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documents are not freely available on a public website. Answer B is incorrect because physical visitation is not necessary; documents can be accessed online through PACER.

The manner of entry (e.g., avoiding official border crossings, bypassing quarantine requirements, or entering without proper documentation) can be illegal even for citizens. The illegality lies not in the act of entering itself, but in violating specific laws or regulations about the entry process.

Essentially, someone prepares a map of the initial boundaries of the municipality and a proposed name and proposed charter to a court of general jurisdiction in that area in a petition that also recites that all requirements to form a municipality have been met, and then gives public notice to everyone owning property in the area, usually by both mail and publication.\n\nOne or more hearings are held at which the court determines if notice was adequate and that the petition complies with the statute, and hears any objections (e.g. that some of the land is subject to some other municipality, or that someone doesn't want to be in the municipality, or that the population is insufficient to qualify).\n\nIf every property owner has consented in writing and it meets the requirements either with no objection, or with objections not supported when an evidentiary hearing is held on the objections, then the municipality is created. Otherwise, if any objections are overcome following hearings on them, then the judge orders that a vote be conducted, and if a sufficient percentage vote and a sufficient percentage of voters support creating it, then the municipality comes into being. An election for initial elected officials is held either contemporaneously with the formation vote or separately shortly afterwards.\n\nSometimes, much less commonly these days, a municipal government or local government is created by a law passed to create it.\n\nIn Colorado, the relevant statute is Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 [31\\-2\\-101](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-31-government-municipal/co-rev-st-sect-31-2-101.html) to 31\\-2\\-109\\.\n\nIn practice, it is now very rare that new municipalities are created.

The municipality is then created if a sufficient percentage of voters support its creation. Option A is incorrect because automatic creation only occurs if all property owners consent in writing and there are no objections.

However, I'm not sure if it would be legal to do so in the US. I source all my information from publicly available sources (usually sources from Wikipedia or anything I google)/declassified documents, and I don't ever plan on actually *building* the design I'm making. I'm still worried that what I'm doing might be illegal, though.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure the basic thrust of the matter is \"you're protected by the first amendment protections of speech and journalism\", though I think formally speaking the exact legal status of nuclear weapons publications are not entirely clear. Cases about it have tended to fall apart and get dropped before precedents got set.\n\nThe [Atomic Energy Act of 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Act_of_1946) ostensibly automatically classifies and controls any and all information about nuclear weapons, regardless of the circumstances of their creation. [United States v. Progressive, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Progressive,_Inc.) was a case about a publication purporting to reveal the secrets of the H\\-bomb, and based on unclassified/public information, that was challenged under this provision. Ultimately the case was dropped by the government, and many legal pundits believed it likely that SCOTUS would have ruled the provision an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. But it otherwise appears to be valid law, at least in the sense of not having been struck down by a court, to this day. [The government has tried to censor publications even within the last decade](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/hydrogen-bomb-physicists-book-runs-foul-of-us-energy-department-20150401-1mcp4g), though with limited success, in part because of the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect): aggressively trying to prevent people from looking at it just gives it free publicity and makes more people look at it. A more successful attempt by the government appears to be the case of [\"The A\\-bomb kid\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristotle_Phillips), who wrote a college paper with a design for a nuclear weapon, and made a mockup of the design, both of which were confiscated by the FBI, but this was back in 1976 (and said kid later wrote a book about the whole thing).\n\nThat said, there are quite a number of ways of easily finding varying levels of nuclear weapons designs online already. [Including on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon). Government policy across the world has usually been to never acknowledge any purported leaks in any way; the US Department of Energy calls it their \"no comment\" policy. But such purported leaks do exist and can be found with relative ease, and many of the weapons designs you can find are based both on such leaks, as well as reverse engineering from non\\-weapons nuclear technologies such as nuclear reactors. The government is far more likely to try to restrain those who have actually encountered actual governmental nuclear weapons information, and have signed NDAs, but even then it rarely succeeds or pushes too hard. Most of the scientists who worked on developing the first nuclear weapons have published or publicly stated information concerning such endeavors, after all (though usually not terribly deep and technical; scientists have self\\-censored on nuclear weapons pretty much since German scientists first made public their possibility in the early 1930s).\n\nAs such, you are most likely just fine, and any attempt by the government to stop you is probably just going to result in more publicity and potentially more sales and money for you.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ostensibly classifies all nuclear weapons information, but its constitutionality in this context has been questioned. Cases like United States v. Progressive, Inc. were dropped before setting clear precedents. While there is a strong argument for First Amendment protection, the government has occasionally attempted to censor such publications, though often with limited success.

According to the information provided, it is legal for Steam to disable content on a user's PC, including downloaded demos. This is because when users download content from Steam, they agree to Terms of Service (TOS) and/or End User License Agreement (EULA), which are legally binding contracts.

That the fence is on your property, but adjacent to the school's property, is a complication. The school, observing that there is a boundary fence, might reasonably rely on that to exclude people from entering other than at desired entry points. So it might be that your entry over the fence would be unauthorized and thus technically trespassing. If you were to put a gate in your own fence, the school's reliance is probably less reasonable. Or if you were to formally notify the school that you intend to enter the school grounds over your own fence.\n\nHowever, in practice, you are not trespassing until you are notified by the owner or owner's agent or someone with proper authority.

Duration of copyright: Works created on or after January 1, 19784 (a) In General.\u2014Copyright in a work created on or after January 1,\n>  1978, subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the\n>  following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the life of\n>  the author and 70 years after the author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (b) Joint Works.\u2014In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more\n>  authors who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a term\n>  consisting of the life of the last surviving author and 70 years after\n>  such last surviving author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.\u2014In\n>  the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for\n>  hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of\n>  its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first. If, before the end of such term,\n>  the identity of one or more of the authors of an anonymous or\n>  pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of a registration made\n>  for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of section 408, or in the\n>  records provided by this subsection, the copyright in the work endures\n>  for the term specified by subsection (a) or (b), based on the life of\n>  the author or authors whose identity has been revealed. Any person\n>  having an interest in the copyright in an anonymous or pseudonymous\n>  work may at any time record, in records to be maintained by the\n>  Copyright Office for that purpose, a statement identifying one or more\n>  authors of the work; the statement shall also identify the person\n>  filing it, the nature of that person\u2019s interest, the source of the\n>  information recorded, and the particular work affected, and shall\n>  comply in form and content with requirements that the Register of\n>  Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.\n\nSo, this is if the work was published after 1978, in this case, sometime in 2001 or 2002, it says that it's \"70 years after the authors' life\", but in this case, the orginazation that published the works is not the author, they just got it from somewhere else and published it, so I'm not sure if that would still be the case here, since, as mentioned before, the author was from 1813, and 1813 \\+ 70 \\= 1883, long ago, so seemingly it should be ok. However, maybe this would then fit under subsec. \"c\", \"Anonymous works etc...\", which states, as quoted above: \n\n> In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made\n>  for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year\n>  of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first.\n\nSo in this case, the first publication (although not in the US) was in the year 1848, and 1848 \\+ 95 \\= 1943, which has already passed. Or, it said, 120 years from \"its creation\", lets see: it doesn't say in the wikipedia page when it was created (as opposed to published), but even assuming it was created right before it was first printed, that would be 1848 \\+ 120 \\= 1968, still a year that has already passed.\n\nSo, can someone explain to me how the modern day book publishing company can copyright this work that was first published way more than 120 years ago? Do they own the rights to it at all? Can anyone republished (the original text of) it? If not, this seems to be similar to copyrighting a bible or Torah text itself, which I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to do, meaning copyrighting it has no effect, since its so old.\n\nSo what's the law here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They have copyright in their additional text, and possibly in things like their visual design choices (fonts, layout etc).

I worked for an Internet company that not only dealt with User Generated Content on our own servers, but also browsed the web looking at other sites quite a lot. This gives me an odd perspective.\n\nThere is a US law called [18 USC 2257](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257), and I fully expect Europe has similar laws. It requires any porn provider who shows people with genitals displayed in a suggestive manner to \n\n* obtain **informed\\-consent**, in writing.\n* obtain *in advance* certain specific **documents to confirm legal age** (you can thank [Traci Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traci_Lords) for that) and make good copies of them\n* **retain these documents on file**.\n* Keep these files in an **office which is staffed Monday\\-Friday 9\\-5**, effectively so Feds can walk into that office anytime and inspect the records.\n\nThe record\\-keeping requirements were originally thought to be the government harassing the porn industry, since it [had a long history of doing so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt). However in actuality, the porn industry was developing a very professional and cordial relationship with the Attorney General's office. The process got smoothed out: the \"staffed office\" requirement could be subcontracted to third party companies, so it became like a Registered Agent, something every company must have. \n\nAs Internet porn took off, they worked out ways for Site X to license content from Provider Y, and have the 2257 stuff work smoothly. Federal prosecution for porn had fallen to almost nil. Even amateur producers were entering the scene and not having any trouble with compliance.\n\nEnter revenge porn\n------------------\n\nNow you can see, under the 2257 legal framework, revenge porn is impossible because it does **absolutely none of this stuff**. It tossed the \"known rules\" and the working relationship right out the window. \n\nI expected revenge porn to end with door kickdowns and 2257 prosecutions, but it never happened. I suspect the Attorney General's office is a heavy \"ship of state\", and it is unable to make a \"snap turn\" from the cordial relationship with the porn industry, and feared damaging the relationship while the EFF screams about the bad old days. \n\nHowever, 2257 is still on the books, and *still* binds anyone who publishes porn. \n\nThe casual publisher\n--------------------\n\nThe Internet has created a real problem for the old model of \"all porn coming from companies with lawyers and 2257 offices\". Is it reasonable to hold a 16 year old boy with a smartphone to the 2257 laws? If you never meant to publish, but someone hacked your phone, who's responsible? That's for the courts to decide, but yeah, my intuition is that courts will seek to find an original *publisher* of a work, i.e. the guy/gal who turned it from a private document into \"one that is loose on the Internet\". **So to answer your question, it's not on the *producer*, it's on the *publisher*.** If you re\\-post porn that you \"found somewhere\", then you're the publisher, unless you can document a prior source.\n\n**But then, there are the child porn laws**. Mere possession of any pornographic photo of someone under 18 is an essentially automatic lifetime branding as a sex offender in the US, and most likely, a trip to prison. Publication is a confession to possession. On the other hand, the person actually being 18 is an absolute defense; the 2257 law doesn't apply to *mere possession*. Europe may be more lax, it's difficult to imagine them being more draconian. \n\nAnd then, you have all the common law that comes from the **basic sexual assault** that it is to publish someone's sexy pics without permission. And both state attorneys (criminally), and victims' attorneys (civilly), have a variety of legal approaches to go after you, if they want to. I can't guess at the risk of this happening over a random posting on the Internet, but it is certainly all downside risk, and no measurable benefit for you. So why do it? \n\nAlso, it's a completely horrible and evil thing to do.

Then, the controller must find a legal basis for this processing. Consent is only one legal basis among many. Consent is only explicitly required for a few narrow cases, however certain use cases effectively require consent as well, such as email marketing without a prior business relationship.\n\nBy itself the queries to B's list are not an actual purpose of processing so it depends on *why* these queries will be done.\n\nFor example, if membership in B's list is used to infer interests for marketing purposes that would be a purpose that would make it possible to discuss whether consent would be required. My hunch is that for that specific example, an argument could be made for legitimate interest instead. But the processing might be considered to be profiling, in which case additional restrictions might apply (e.g. some kinds of profiling do require consent).\n\nIf personal data was collected for one purpose but shall be used for another, Article 6(4\\) requires the controller to perform an analysis to determine whether this repurposing is possible: just because you have the data does not mean you can use it towards your goals.

An airplane is heavy, so [this](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-113/) may also apply:\n\n> If it is found by the judge of a court of proper jurisdiction that the violation of any provision of this title (i) was a serious traffic violation as defined in \u00a7 46\\.2\\-341\\.20 and (ii) that such violation was committed while operating a vehicle or combination of vehicles used to transport property that either: (a) has a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds or (b) has a gross combination weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds inclusive of a towed vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, the judge may assess, in addition to any other penalty assessed, a further monetary penalty not exceeding $500\\.\n\nBy the way, I couldn't find a general reckless endangerment statute (unrelated to specific objects like firearms or specific results like injury or death) in Virginia law. The closest thing I could find was [disorderly conduct](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter9/section18.2-415/), which is also a class 1 misdemeanor. It's possible I just don't know where to look.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An airplane flying at 471 mph is \"pulled over\" while flying over a road with a 45 mph speed limit in Virginia. Assuming the airplane is considered a vehicle under relevant traffic laws, what is the maximum possible fine the pilot could face based on the information provided?\n\nA) $2,500\nB) $3,000\nC) $500\nD) $5,000\n\nCorrect Answer: B) $3,000\n\nExplanation: The question requires combining multiple pieces of information from the Virginia law:\n\n1. The speed qualifies as reckless driving under Virginia law, which is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n2. A Class 1 misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of up to $2,500.\n3. For heavy vehicles (which an airplane would likely qualify as), there's an additional penalty of up to $500 for serious traffic violations.\n4. Reckless driving would likely be considered a serious traffic violation.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible fine would be $2,500 (for the Class 1 misdemeanor) plus $500 (for the heavy vehicle violation), totaling $3,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the additional heavy vehicle penalty.\nOption C is incorrect as it only accounts for the heavy vehicle penalty, not the base fine.\nOption D is incorrect as it exceeds the maximum possible fine based on the given information."}}
