The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Verbal agreements can be legally binding contracts, even in real estate matters. The tenant's agreement to give 30 days notice creates a new contractual obligation.\n\n2. The original lease likely contains provisions for transitioning to a month-to-month arrangement, which would include notice requirements. This reinforces the 30-day notice expectation.\n\n3. The tenant's verbal agreement to the 30-day notice period supersedes the ending of the original lease term. It creates a new month-to-month tenancy with specific terms.\n\n4. In most jurisdictions, including Illinois, landlords are entitled to rent for the notice period, even if the tenant moves out earlier.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the binding nature of verbal agreements and the creation of a new month-to-month tenancy. Option C is a common misconception about verbal agreements, which can be binding in real estate matters, especially for short-term arrangements.

Expedia offers airline credit but it's extremely restricted. Basically you can only use it for a single ticket on one booking for the same person on the same airline departing from the same country and costing the same price. Ideally we want cash back or at least Air France's conditions which offer a voucher that becomes refundable after one year.

They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.\n\nSo, no matter what, you can\u2019t get your money from them.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nWe have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and *why* Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... \n\nAs an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree\n\nThe first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund \\- that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, \u201cwe can fly you tomorrow\u201d \\- they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don\u2019t want to fly tomorrow.

That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?\n\nIf the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under?

The correct approach (D) acknowledges the complexity of the situation and avoids oversimplified solutions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as mentioned in the documentation, EU Regulation 261/2004 may not apply in \"extraordinary circumstances,\" and the DOT's jurisdiction over foreign carriers is limited.\n\nOption B is premature without first understanding the legal situation, as advised in the question background.\n\nOption C is problematic because, as stated in the update, Expedia took the payment, not Air France, making them the primary point of contact for refunds.\n\nOption D is correct because it addresses the multiple factors at play:\n1.

Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_v._Garner), common law allowed police to use deadly force to effect the arrest of a person suspected of a felony. Even though SCOTUS there held that such a practice violates Fourth Amendment civil rights, I was surprised to find that [in some states it is *still* lawful for police to use deadly force to effect an arrest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206192128/http://www.slu.edu/colleges/law/journal/police-use-of-deadly-force-state-statues-30-years-after-garner/)!\n\nLet us examine the most extreme case, which is that the police can legally shoot at you to effect your arrest. As explained [here, you are always allowed to resist \"excessive force.\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/2211/10) If you make it to court, these qualifications (e.g., \"necessary\" and \"excessive\") are ultimately decided based on what a \"reasonable person\" would have believed in the situation. So if a cop shoots at you, and you \"dodge\" the bullet, it is *possible* for you both to be found not guilty of any crime. I.e., the cop can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because he believed you were a violent felon and shooting you was the only way to stop you. And you can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because you believed you were being subject to excessive force.\n\nWhile this is an interesting hypothetical, in practice of course by the time a cop is shooting at you you are almost certainly going to be *charged* with resisting arrest.

The correct answer is C because it captures the nuanced legal landscape described in the documentation. According to the explanation provided, both the officers and the suspect could potentially be found to have acted reasonably in this scenario.\n\nThe officers' use of deadly force might be considered reasonable if they believed the suspect was a violent felon and shooting was the only way to effect the arrest.

Garner.\n\nSimultaneously, the suspect's act of dodging bullets could be interpreted as a reasonable response to what they perceived as excessive force. The documentation states that individuals are \"always allowed to resist 'excessive force,'\" and the reasonableness of both parties' actions would be judged based on what a \"reasonable person\" would have believed in the situation.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they oversimplify the legal complexities and ignore the possibility of the suspect's actions being justified.

Fair\\-use defenses look at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *(This is the most important factor in the analysis.)*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could emjoy the work again whenever you felt like it, that may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy just so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \u2013 either in the raw amount or as a fraction of the whole work \u2013 it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when dealing with a copy of a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. Such works are still protected by copyright, but that protection is not as strong.\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nThese questions can be trickier than you might think. If you're dealing with a real situation, you should consult an attorney to get an answer specific to your situation.\n\nBut what if I don't make any money?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis fact tips the scales in your favor, but only on Question 2; you still need to consider the other factors. Whether you make money is less important than whether your copying deprives the copyright owner of the opportunity to make money, but then you have to balance that consideration against the First Amendment principles embedded in fair\\-use analysis.\n\nSo if you're ripping *Star Wars* DVDs to hand them out as Christmas presents, your lack of a profit motive will not save you.

Market effect: Using clips from very recent or still-in-theater films is most likely to negatively impact the market for the original works.

Nature of the copyrighted work: Recent blockbuster films are highly creative works at the core of copyright protection, making fair use claims more difficult.\n\n3.

The fact that the security guard was convicted of a misdemeanor does not necessarily indicate that the deputy was allowed to have the gun in the IRS office, only that the security guard's response to the situation was not acceptable.\n\nI am not able to locate any firearm policy for the Lucas County, Ohio' sheriff's office. Many US law enforcement agencies have a policy that their officers carry their firearms essentially at all times, so that they can respond to unexpected incidents even when they are off duty.\n\nAt the same time, owners of private property ordinarily can admit people, or not, for any reason at all. Unless the officer has an official reason for entering a property when the owner doesn't want the officer there, the officer isn't allowed to enter. It appears that in this case the officer had no official law\\-enforcement reason to enter.\n\nBut this case doesn't involve private property, it involves federal property.

According to the FBI digest mentioned in the documentation, \"Federal laws or regulations are not superseded by LEOSA. Qualified officers may not carry concealed weapons onto aircraft under the act. They also cannot carry firearms into federal buildings or onto federal property.\" This indicates that the deputy is indeed in violation of federal regulations by attempting to enter the IRS building (a federal property) with his service weapon while off-duty and for personal business.\n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by the security guard's response. The follow-up story mentioned in the documentation states that the security guard pleaded no contest to simple assault, suggesting that his actions were deemed excessive or inappropriate given the circumstances. This implies that while the deputy was not allowed to bring the firearm into the building, the security guard's method of addressing the situation was problematic from a legal standpoint.\n\nThe question requires analysis of multiple aspects: federal regulations on firearms in government buildings, the limits of law enforcement privileges when off-duty, and the appropriate use of force by security personnel.

Take Nick Sandman's case as a hypothetical example. If CNN paid him several million dollars, and Sandman spends it quickly, it will be obvious to everyone that CNN paid him. Sandman isn't otherwise wealthy, if he suddenly buys a Lamborghini or a private jet, that money must have come from CNN. So doesn't this violate his NDA?

Payment of a substantial sum is oftentimes the main or only incentive for the injured party to bind himself in an NDA. A prohibition to spend that money would *de facto* nullify the benefit without which the party would have declined the NDA.\n\n> Sandman isn't otherwise wealthy, if he suddenly buys a Lamborghini or a private jet, that money must have come from CNN.

The correct answer is C because directly disclosing the exact amount received in the settlement to a third party (even a close friend) would typically violate the terms of an NDA.\n\nOptions A and B represent scenarios where the individual is spending or investing the money received from the settlement.

The public might infer that a settlement occurred, but this doesn't provide new information beyond what could already be reasonably assumed from the known facts of the case.\n\nOption D presents a more complex scenario.

Since the lease is silent on animals, the manager's new rule may infringe on this right.\n\n2. Lease interpretation: The absence of animal-related clauses in the lease suggests that the manager cannot unilaterally impose such restrictions mid-lease.\n\n3. Practical considerations: While the tenant could legally challenge this new rule (option A), or demand justification (option D), these approaches might escalate tensions unnecessarily. Completely ignoring the request (A) could lead to further conflicts.\n\n4.

Are there changes to be made?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two relevant EU laws: GDPR and ePrivacy.\n\nUsing Google Analytics does not require consent as far as the GDPR is concerned. The processing can instead be based on legitimate interest, but you do have to offer opt\\-out and must use suitable security measures, for example by signing the data processing agreement with Google. Alternatively, an argument is possible that the collected data doesn't qualify as personal data \u2013 but I don't think that argument is correct.\n\nThe ePrivacy directive is more tricky. It is not directly enforceable law. Instead, directives are implemented through member state law. As a result, there can be subtle differences between member states. What one data protection authority allows is not necessarily relevant in another country.\n\nePrivacy requires you to collect consent when you access information on the user's device, for example when you read or write cookies or use similar technologies, regardless of whether the information is personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The only exception is when the access is strictly necessary for your application \u2013 but that doesn't cover analytics. This ePrivacy requirement is the source of all the cookie consent banners you see on the web.\n\nGoogle Analytics stores a Client ID on the user's device, which is used to combine separate events into a session or user profile. Optionally, this Client ID can be linked with a User ID, which lets you track a signed\\-in user across devices.\n\nBut storing/acessing this Client ID requires consent under ePrivacy.\n\nIf you want to avoid asking for consent, you must disable storage of the Client ID. On the web, this can be reached by setting `'storage': 'none'` for analytics.js or `'client_storage': 'none'` for gtag.js. I use this approach on my personal website, with the result that \u201cpageviews\u201d and \u201csessions\u201d are now synonymous. I am not sure what the equivalent would be on mobile, but the same concerns apply.\n\nI assume (but do not know for sure) that the consent requirement only applies to persistently stored data.

The correct answer, B, addresses several key points:\n\n1. It avoids storing the Client ID on the user's device, which would require consent under the ePrivacy directive. By setting 'client_storage' to 'none' (or its mobile equivalent), the app doesn't access or store information on the user's device that would trigger the consent requirement.\n\n2. Keeping a transient User ID in memory only while the app is open likely doesn't require consent, as it's not persistently stored. This allows for some level of analytics (correlating events into a session) without triggering consent requirements.\n\n3. This approach balances the need for analytics with compliance, demonstrating an understanding of the \"legitimate interest\" basis under GDPR and the stricter requirements of ePrivacy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because default settings would store the Client ID on the device, requiring consent.

An assault is a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person which puts the person in immediate danger of or in apprehension of such harm or contact. Groping is an example of offensive contact that does not involve bodily harm. Assault is against the law in two ways. First, it is a tort, meaning that the victim can sue the assailant for the damage that was caused. Second, it is generally a crime, meaning that the assailant might be punished, if convicted. The Canadian law regarding the crime of assault is [\u00a7265 of the Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-265.html). The law says plainly that\n\n> A person commits an assault when (a) without the consent of another\n>  person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly\n>  or indirectly\n\nWhether or not the government will pursue the matter is difficult to say. The standard procedure is that the victim reports the event to the police, who will decide whether to investigate, and it could end up in court being prosecuted by the Crown.\n\nThe other path is a lawsuit, where the person harmed files a lawsuit and has his day in court. The victim files a complaint alleging that certain events took place (it has to match toe legal definition of assault), and that you were harmed in a way that can be redressed with an award of money. You would, of course, hire a lawyer to pursue this, because you can't just say to the court \"Make him pay, he punched me\". You might be awarded something for emotional distress. You might want to talk to a lawyer about the prospects for getting an award large enough to cover your legal bill.\n\nNeedless to say, punching as payback is *also* assault, which as I mentioned is a crime. It's quite possible that the police will decide not to pursue the first assault but would take a dimmer view of revenge assault and prosecute you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A 14-year-old student experiences unwanted physical contact from a classmate during an in-school field trip.

Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 150\\. But \u201ca statute which, while furthering \\[a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\u2019s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 877 (plurality opinion), and \u201c\\[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right,\u201d id., at 878\\.\n\nJustice Ginsburg provided a separate concurring opinion in which she said:\n\n> ... Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory\\-surgical\\-center or hospital admitting\\-privileges requirements...\n> \n> \n> ...abortion \u201cis at least as safe as other medical procedures routinely performed in outpatient settings\u201d. Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u201cwould simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was passed in Texas in 2013, I recall some Texas lawmakers in support of the bill claiming that the law would help prevent some abortions, [for example](https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/13/texas-abortion-regulations-debate-nears-climax/):\n\n> The regulations in HB 2 will end up saving many babies, he said, \"so that families can adopt them and love them and be able to cherish them.\u201d\n\nIt seems like the bill was struck down by the Supreme Court because the bill did exactly what it was supposed to do. Perhaps if the decision was 8\\-0 one could argue that the Texas lawmakers should have known better and were just wasting taxpayers' time and money, but there were 3 dissenting justices, which to me, legitimizes the attempt to pass the law. Yet, I'm not fully understanding the dissenting opinions.\n\nMy question: are the dissenting opinions claiming that Texas HB2 does not present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or are they claiming that the premise is wrong and it should be OK for a law to present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or something else entirely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Justice Thomas's position is two\\-pronged. First, he argues that the court has taken the wrong approach to protecting abortion all along:\n\n> I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court\u2019s abortion\n>  jurisprudence.\n\nHe then argues that even taking *Casey* as precedent, the court has raised the standard that laws affecting access to abortions are judged by:\n\n> These precepts \\[...] transform the undue\\-burden test to\n>  something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\n\nMy takeaway is that he thinks jumping straight to a balancing test muddles the \"undue\\-burden\" and \"legitimate interest\" portions of the *Casey* test. He would have answered *first* whether these laws posed an undue burden upon women seeking abortions. If the answer there was \"no\", then the law only needs to pass a rational basis test. However, by immediately jumping to a test than balances the burden on women and legitimate interests of the state, he argues that a more heightened scrutiny is applied to these laws than *Casey* stands for.\n\nFurther, he argues that the clinics should not be able to sue to protect a right that they don't even claim belongs to them:\n\n> This suit is possible only because the Court has allowed\n>  abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional\n>  right that does not belong to them\u2014a woman\u2019s\n>  right to abortion.\n\nJustice Alito's position rests on *[res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata)*.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Texas HB2, which of the following best represents the core argument of Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion?\n\nA) The law does not present a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions\nB) The Court has misapplied the undue-burden test established in Casey\nC) Abortion clinics lack standing to challenge the law on behalf of women\nD) The state's interest in protecting fetal life outweighs any burden on women\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion primarily focuses on the Court's application of the undue-burden test established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He argues that the Court has effectively transformed this test into something more akin to strict scrutiny, which is a higher standard than originally intended.\n\nWhile Thomas does touch on the issue of standing (option C) by questioning whether abortion clinics should be able to invoke a right that belongs to women, this is not the central thrust of his argument. He does not directly claim that the law doesn't present a substantial obstacle (option A), nor does he primarily argue about the state's interest in protecting fetal life (option D).\n\nThe core of Thomas's dissent is that the Court has raised the standard for judging laws affecting abortion access beyond what Casey originally established.

The correct answer is D because it aligns most closely with the court's ruling and the terms of the advertisement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the advertisement specified using the ball \"three times daily for two weeks,\" so one week of use would not meet the conditions.\n\nOption B is clearly not valid as the customer never used the product, violating the terms of the offer.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the advertisement specifically mentioned \"influenza\" and \"colds,\" so a common cold would likely be covered, not excluding the customer from the reward.\n\nOption D is the most challenging and correct answer because:\n1. It meets the conditions specified in the advertisement (use for two weeks as directed).\n2. The customer contracted influenza, which was explicitly mentioned in the offer.\n3.

Resol. 669 (2001\\)](http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=facpub) in \"Mandatory Binding Arbitration and the Demise of the Seventh Amendment Right to a Jury Trial\" partially addresses this (the focus though is on binding arbitration). One thing to note is that the Seventh Amendment does not appear to apply to issues in state court (it is a separate and fascinating question to wonder what parts of The Constitution are incorporated against states, and why). All is not lost for the constitutional question, we just need a different constitution.\n\nBy the agreement terms, \"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\". Therefore, New York's Constitution (Article 1 Sect 2\\) is also applicable:\n\n> Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed\n>  by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever; but *a jury\n>  trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to\n>  be prescribed by law*.\n\nThus, the right may be waived. Waiver of a right to jury trial is not the same as waiver of the right to trial: what the agreement says is that litigants would have a civil bench trial, where the judge determines whether there was a breach.\n\nIn New York, [NY CPLR \u00a7 4102](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2012/cvp/article-41/4102) allows parties to waive civil trial by jury (and unlike [California](https://casetext.com/case/grafton-partners-v-superior-court-2)), such waiver terms have been [upheld](http://www.chadbourne.com/sites/default/files/publications/hall%20judge%20smith%20nylj%20reprint%2012%2009.pdf), but the courts have recognized that there is a problem, so it's not always obvious whether such waivers in contracts are legal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software company includes a clause in its End User License Agreement (EULA) stating that users waive their right to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that the Seventh Amendment (right to jury trial) doesn't appear to apply to state courts, shifting focus to state law.\n2. The New York State Constitution (Article 1 Sect 2) explicitly allows for waiver of jury trials in civil cases \"in the manner to be prescribed by law.\"\n3. New York law (NY CPLR \u00a7 4102) allows parties to waive civil trial by jury, and such waivers in contracts have been upheld by courts.\n4.

The relevant law is 18 USC 2252A which refers as a subcase to \"an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\". Obscenity is not actually a requirement for conviction under the law, it suffices for material to be non\\-obscene \"child pornography\" ([Osborne v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/103/), 495 U.S. 103\\). Outside of the realm of child pornography laws, there don't appear to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years. The Miller test ([Miller v. California](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/413/15/), 413 U.S) potentially applies to cases not involving children, but nothing recent clearly establishes a concrete category of prohibited materials.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about US obscenity law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A controversial artist creates a series of explicit drawings depicting fictional adult characters engaged in unconventional sexual acts.

The correct answer is C because the Miller test, which is still the prevailing standard for obscenity not involving minors, includes consideration of \"community standards\" as a key factor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while artistic merit might be considered, it's not the most crucial factor according to current law. Option B is a distractor based on the documentation's emphasis on child pornography, but the question specifically mentions adult characters. Option D is incorrect because a judge's personal beliefs should not be the determining factor in obscenity cases.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the examinee to distinguish between factors that might seem relevant (like artistic merit or involvement of minors) and the actual legal standard that would apply in this case.

You mention having a company email domain and associated email signature; that is certainly good practice and would go a long way towards creating a presumption that you were acting for a company. Also signing yourself with your job title or role (e.g. \"Joe Bloggs, Chief Bottlewasher\") makes it clear that you are speaking in your role as an employee.\n\nThe content of the communication also matters; if you use your company email address to order goods from a supplier that the company has used before then the recipient can reasonably assume that you are ordering on behalf of the company and a court is likely to agree.

Adding a job title to communications, which aligns with the advice to sign with a job title or role to make it clear you're speaking as an employee.\n3.

Signing contracts with only her name doesn't clearly indicate she's acting on behalf of the company.\n\nOption C is problematic because mixing personal and company email addresses could lead to confusion about capacity.

The landlord discovers the tenants aren't using the system and wants to discontinue it to save money.

So there are a few GDPR violations on the web blog that don't seem that obvious (or serious) to the naked eye, for example:\n\n* Visitors are not asked to consent to using cookies\n* The blog uses a web analytics plugin, that sends customer's IP addresses and locations to a 3rd\\-party company outside of UK/EU, and the business owner does not sign any additional agreements with the 3rd party\n* The website has a very short and generic Terms of Service page that are just copied over from another similar website, and are not using contractual language\n* Visitors are allowed to upload images to the web server when they write comments, but are not asked/warned to avoid uploading any illegal/copyrighted content\n\nNow, the business owner has no malicious intent to steal people's data, etc, and there have been no security breaches where hackers could gain access to the data.

Since we are not privy to the letter from Hasbro, the best we can do is guess based on the degrees of freedom that exist under the law. The claim that this game was a \"parody\" is an affirmative defense that Mane6 would have to raise in response to a copyright infringement claim (we don't know if there were also trademark infringement claims in the letter). Then the jury would look at the arguments of the two sides to determine whether this was really \"fair use\", performing the \"balancing act\" to see how much of the original work was copied, how transformative the derived work is, what the effect on market would be.

Her will, as she explained to me, explains how the estate will be divided among her 3 children (not the grandchildren, just 3 equal divisions). Granted, at the time, the Bush tax cuts were due to expire in 10 years so it wasn't guaranteed, but it was likely to avoid any inheritance tax.\n\nShe told me that as a result of being married to a partner, she had free legal care if she ever needed it.

The correct answer is C because the documentation indicates that when paying a law firm for a will, clients typically pay for one-time drafting and execution of documents.

Section Section 12182 (a) and Section 12182 (b) (1\\) (A) would also seem to apply.\n\nFiling an actual suit under the ADA would be a possibly costly and time consuming solution, however. It would probably require a lawyer knowledgeable in DA practice.

The correct answer, B, directly violates Section 12182 (b)(2)(A)(iii) of the ADA, which requires public accommodations (including medical offices) to take necessary steps to ensure individuals with disabilities are not denied services or treated differently due to the absence of auxiliary aids and services. \n\nRefusing to assist the legally blind patient in filling out forms is a clear failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.

However, because unemancipated minors cannot buy or sell property on their own, managing their stocks can be a hassle. For example, children need a guardian if they want to sell the stock.\n\nTo avoid these hassles, in many (most?) cases, the stock is owned through some legal entity that gives an adult control over that stock. These range from custodial IRAs to living trusts. In all of these, the stock belongs to the minor, but is managed by an adult. These entities differ in all sorts of ways, including when (if ever) the minor gets control of the stock, how the stock is taxed, what the stock can be used for, and so on.\n\nOne of the most popular entities is a [UTMA Account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utma.asp). These are named after the *Universal Transfer to Minors Act,* found at [Chap. 201A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201a) of the *General Laws of Massachusetts*. These are custodial accounts designed specifically to allow minors to hold property, including stock. These accounts simplify the management of the minor\u2019s stock, and offer some tax breaks. In Massachusetts, the custodianship *[generally](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201A/Section20)* terminates when the minor turns 21\\. At that point, she gets complete control of her stock.\n\nTo find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of the UTMA compared to other ways of holding property for children, see [here](https://www.thebalance.com/beginners-guide-to-ugma-and-utma-custodial-accounts-4060475), [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinefletcher/2019/12/12/why-utma-accounts-are-not-as-simple-as-they-seem/#74aeb79c7b34) and [here](https://southcoastestateplanning.com/when-can-my-child-get-the-money-in-the-utma-custodial-account-i-created-2/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup in Massachusetts wants to incentivize young talent by offering stock options to high school interns.

Option B is the most appropriate solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Legal Compliance: The documentation confirms that minors can legally own stock in Massachusetts, but managing it directly can be challenging due to legal restrictions on minors buying and selling property.\n\n2. Simplicity of Management: UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) accounts are specifically designed to allow minors to hold property, including stocks. They simplify the management process compared to direct ownership or more complex structures like living trusts or IRAs.\n\n3. Protection of Minors' Interests: UTMA accounts offer a balance between protecting the minors' interests and allowing for professional management. The stock belongs to the minor but is managed by an adult custodian until the minor reaches the age of 21 in Massachusetts.\n\n4. Tax Considerations: The documentation mentions that UTMA accounts offer some tax breaks, which could be beneficial for both the company and the minors.\n\n5. Future Control: At age 21, the minors gain complete control of their stock, aligning with the company's goal of incentivizing young talent.\n\nOption A is problematic because it doesn't address the management challenges for minors. Option C (living trust) is more complex than necessary and might not offer the same tax advantages.

The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.\n\n...\n\n> To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.\n\nIn short the phrase \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d excludes three and only three groups of people:\n\n* Children born to foreign diplomats here on diplomatic business, who have diplomatic immunity to US Law;\n* Children of members of an invading army that has occupied and controlled some part of US territory, born on that occupied area, who are obviously not subject to US Law (which has rarely happened in the US, although Guam was occupied during WWII, and parts of Alaska, and small parts of Maine during the War of 1812\\); and\n* Members of Native American tribes, subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, who do not pay US taxes. (This was true when the 14th amendment was passed, but it no longer is. See section below on the act that changed it in 1924\\.)\n\nAny other person born in the proper US or in incorporated US territory is a citizen, no matter who his or her parents are or were. (The case is less clear for unincorporated US territory.)\n\nSee also [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark)\n\nThis view was confirmed in 1995 in [an opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/626891/download#page=352) written by then\\-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, taking the position that this rule could not be changed by legislation, only by Constitutional Amendment, writing:\n\n> My office grapples with many difficult and close issues of constitutional law. The lawfulness of this bill is not among them. This legislation is unquestionably unconstitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \u201c\\[a]ll persons bom or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1\\.

Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe) the Supreme Court of the United States struck down both a state statute denying funding for education to children in the United States illegally and a municipal school district's attempt to charge an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student. The case upheld the same principle that the constitutional phrase \"within the jurisdiction\" applies to the children of people who had entered the US illegally.\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe):\n\n> Texas officials had argued that illegal aliens were not \"within the jurisdiction\" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim, finding instead that \"no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.\" The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim, agreeing with the Court that \"the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state.\"\n\nThus the question of whether such aliens were \"within the jurisdiction\" of the US was very much at issue in *Plyler v. Doe*\n\n**EDIT:**\nSince the [Indian Citizenship Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act) was passed, all Native Americans born within the US have been citizens by birth, and the third class of exceptions noted in the earlier cases non longer exists. Prior to this act Native Americans were in many ways treated as foreigners by the US. They were not citizens by birth, and their tribes had some but not all of the attributes of independent nations.\n\nThe text of the law is:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.\n\n(End edit on Indian Citizenship Act of 1924\\)\n\n**Edit**: On reading through the decision of the case of *Wong Kim Ark* I find one more small exclusion: persons born on board a foreign naval ship, even though present in US waters in time of peace, are not citizens of the US because of their birth location. This is apparently not a usual case, but is premised on the ground that a military vessel remains the territory of the nation it belongs to. Such persons might of course be citizens by inheritance if one or both parents are US citizens, and the statutory conditions are complied with. (The term \"public ship\" in the 1800s was used to mean a national ship, that is a military ship.)\n(End edit on naval ships)\n\nI just learned that some parts of the State of Maine were occupied by the British during the war of 1812\\.

Which of the following most accurately describes the child's citizenship status under the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\nA) The child is automatically a U.S. citizen because U.S. embassies are considered U.S. soil.\nB) The child is not a U.S. citizen because the parents are not U.S. citizens or subject to U.S. jurisdiction.\nC) The child is not a U.S. citizen because they were not born within the territorial limits of the United States.\nD) The child's citizenship status is ambiguous and would require a Supreme Court ruling for clarification.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause and the principles established in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The Fourteenth Amendment grants citizenship to persons \"born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\"\n\n2. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court interpreted this to mean birth within the territory of the United States, with few exceptions (children of foreign diplomats, invading armies, or Native American tribes at the time).\n\n3. While U.S. embassies are often colloquially referred to as \"U.S. soil,\" they are not actually part of the territorial United States for the purposes of citizenship.\n\n4. The parents' status as local employees of the embassy does not confer any special jurisdiction - they are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic immunity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, despite common misconception, U.S. embassies are not considered U.S. territory for birthright citizenship purposes.\n\nOption B is partially correct about the citizenship but for the wrong reason. The parents' non-citizen status is not the determining factor, as children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents (except diplomats) are generally granted citizenship.\n\nOption C is correct. The child was not born within the territorial limits of the United States, which is the key requirement for birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted in Wong Kim Ark.\n\nOption D is a distractor that might appeal to those unsure about the legal status of embassy births, but existing precedent and interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment are clear enough that a new Supreme Court ruling would not be necessary.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the territorial requirement for birthright citizenship, the actual status of U.S. embassies, and the application of constitutional principles to a real-world scenario."}, "66": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82383/what-is-the-appropriate-way-to-initiate-a-money-claim-if-the-defendant-will-not", "docs_id": 82383, "title": "What is the appropriate way to initiate a money claim if the defendant will not provide an address?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say Alice was in an accident with Bob that was 100% Bobs fault.

This approach aligns with the airline's terms and conditions, which state that if they are informed prior to the flight, they won't cancel the remaining flights. While the couple lacks physical evidence, they believe the doctor notified the airline. This strategy has the strongest potential for success because:\n\n1. It directly relates to a specific clause in the airline's T&Cs, providing a contractual basis for the argument.\n2.

It addresses the core issue of notification, which is central to the airline's policy on preserving remaining flights.\n\nOption A is less likely to succeed as courts generally uphold contract terms unless they are egregiously unfair.

For example, it does not account for victims who are violated while incapacitated in a medical setting, and it also does not consider the possibility of male victims.\n\nExample where rape charges requires non\\-voluntary intoxication:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere have also been attempts within the legal system to distinguish between people who were unknowingly drugged and those who voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol and became intoxicated.\n\n> The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a person can\u2019t be found guilty of sexually assaulting someone, who is mentally incapacitated due to intoxication, if that person became intoxicated by voluntarily ingesting drugs or alcohol.\n\nIn Minnesota, for example, there was a requirement for non\\-voluntary intoxication.\n\n[A Minnesota man can\u2019t be charged with felony rape because the woman chose to drink beforehand, court rules \\- March 26, 2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/26/minnesota-rape-alcohol/)\n\nHowever, the Minnesota legislator has recently amended their legal codex for this.\n\n[New Minnesota Law Is 'Significant Victory' For Survivors Of Sexual Assaults While Intoxicated \\- September 14, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/new-minnesota-law-is-significant-victory-for-survivors-of-sexual-assaults-while-intoxicated/)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A legal reform group is analyzing sexual assault laws across different countries. Which of the following scenarios would most likely highlight the need for legal reform in a country with laws similar to pre-2021 Minnesota or pre-reform Japan?\n\nA) A woman is forcibly assaulted in a dark alley by a stranger using physical violence.\nB) A man is sexually assaulted by another man while unconscious due to a medical condition.\nC) A college student willingly consumes alcohol at a party and is later sexually assaulted while heavily intoxicated.\nD) A person is unknowingly drugged at a bar and sexually assaulted while incapacitated.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because it highlights key limitations in laws similar to those in pre-2021 Minnesota or pre-reform Japan. \n\nIn pre-2021 Minnesota, the law required non-voluntary intoxication for a sexual assault charge, meaning voluntary intoxication (as in option C) would not meet the legal standard for rape. Similarly, in Japan, the definition of rape required \"assault or intimidation,\" which might not apply in cases of incapacitation due to voluntary intoxication.\n\nOption A would likely be considered rape under both systems due to the use of force. Option B highlights issues with Japan's definition (which doesn't account for male victims) but would likely be prosecutable in Minnesota. Option D involves non-voluntary intoxication, which would meet Minnesota's pre-2021 standard and might be prosecutable in Japan if the drugging is considered \"assault.\"\n\nThe question tests critical thinking about legal definitions and their real-world implications, requiring integration of information from multiple countries and legal systems.

[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 713](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/713) says:\n\n> (a) Whoever knowingly displays any printed or other likeness of the great\n>  seal of the United States, or of the seals of the President or the\n>  Vice President of the United States, or the seal of the United States\n>  Senate, or the seal of the United States House of Representatives, or\n>  the seal of the United States Congress, or any facsimile thereof, in,\n>  or in connection with, any advertisement, poster, circular, book,\n>  pamphlet, or other publication, public meeting, play, motion picture,\n>  telecast, or other production, or on any building, monument, or\n>  stationery, for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner reasonably\n>  calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by\n>  the Government of the United States or by any department, agency, or\n>  instrumentality thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n>  not more than six months, or both.  \n> \n>  ...  \n> \n>  (e) Whoever, except as directed by the United States Congress, or the\n>  Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives,\n>  acting jointly on its behalf, knowingly uses, manufactures,\n>  reproduces, sells or purchases for resale, either separately or\n>  appended to any article manufactured or sold, any likeness of the seal\n>  of the United States Congress, or any substantial part thereof, except\n>  for manufacture or sale of the article for the official use of the\n>  Government of the United States, shall be fined under this title or\n>  imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\nI am not sure if someone could make a First Amendment argument, but it seems likely. I note that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) isn't afraid to have *pictures* of the Great Seal on the webpage about it. Also, a modified Great Seal was used in the film *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* (although it purported to be a presidential seal). I also found an [instance](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028070028/http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/26/odd.onion.reut/index.html) where the White House officially asked the Onion to stop using the Presidential seal, but it's unclear what happened with that. The Onion did not immediately remove the seal, however, and I think we would have heard if they had been arrested. I do not believe that Wikipedia, the filmmakers, and the Onion would have done this if there was a serious risk of six months in prison. In each of those cases, there was a strong First Amendment speech/press use, and there was no risk of anyone thinking the seal was being used for a government endorsement.\n\nThere is an executive order (visible from the \"Notes\" section of the link to the law) regarding the use of the seals of the President and Vice President:\n\n> Section 1\\. Except as otherwise provided by law, the knowing\n>  manufacture, reproduction, sale, or purchase for resale of the Seals\n>  or Coats of Arms of the President or the Vice President of the United\n>  States, or any likeness or substantial part thereof, shall be\n>  permitted only for the following uses:\n> \n> \n> (a) Use by the President or Vice President of the United States;\n> \n> \n> (b) Use in encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, journals, pamphlets,\n>  periodicals, or magazines incident to a description or history of\n>  seals, coats of arms, heraldry, or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (c) Use in libraries, museums, or educational facilities incident to\n>  descriptions or exhibits relating to seals, coats of arms, heraldry,\n>  or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (d) Use as an architectural embellishment in libraries, museums, or\n>  archives established to house the papers or effects of former\n>  Presidents or Vice Presidents;\n> \n> \n> (e) Use on a monument to a former President or Vice President;\n> \n> \n> (f) Use by way of photographic or electronic visual reproduction in\n>  pictures, moving pictures, or telecasts of bona fide news content;\n> \n> \n> (g) Such other uses for exceptional historical, educational, or\n>  newsworthy purposes as may be authorized in writing by the Counsel to\n>  the President.\n\nThis provides several legal ways to use the Presidential seals.

Airpods cost about 150\u00a0\u20ac, so Sania is entitled to a Fider's reward of 7,50 \u20ac. Anything more would be at the discretion of Tam, accepting less is at Sania's discretion.\n\nDo note, that denial of the finder's reward at the moment that Sania hands over the item means, that they also deny their entitlement to the reward. In fact, it is upon Sania to demand the reward, and unless they do so, it is presumed that they do not want a finder's reward.\n\n**However** in making her entitlement to the reward known, Sania may not cross the line into coercion or blackmail (\u00a7\u00a7 240, 253 StGB). Should Sania say, without explanation \"I demand a payment of 100\u00a0\u20ac for the airpods\", that could be coercion, as she is not entitled to that. If she however says \"I am entitled to finder's reward of 7,50\u00a0\u20ac, and had expenses of 2\\.50\u00a0\u20ac to get the phone to you, therefore you owe me 10\u00a0\u20ac\" the picture is different \\- that is *exactly* the amount that the law says she would be owed.

Only an invention is subject to being patented, thus becoming an enforceable property right. Disclosing ideas, without restrictions, can quickly mean you lose any control over resulting inventions. No, marriage does not automatically imply ownership of ideas of the spouse, let alone inventorship.\n\nHypothetically, under US law, each inventor must file an oath and declaration regarding inventorship of the invention disclosed and claimed in the application for a patent. Where an inventor has a legal obligation to the employer to cooperate in such things, but refuses, there are other ways to file a substitute.\n\nHowever, where the inventor is independent, the employer has no inherent ownership claim and the inventor has no obligation to sign anything. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the \"idea\" is prematurely disclosed to others, outside of fiduciary or other obligations of confidentiality, such others could proceed to make their own invention, using their own inventors, and file and claim the patent advantages of that invention without regard to where they obtained the initial idea.\n\nOne major goal of the patent system is to reward the disclosure of \"new and useful\" inventions to the public (in the form of a patent application), in exchange for a \"limited right\" of the inventors to reap the financial advantages, once the invention is deemed patentable.

Does this change the issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend a good deal on there exact nature of the clips being reused. it will also depend, at least somewhat, on what country or countries the various parties are in.\n\n**General Principle**\n---------------------\n\nThe general principle is that a peerson's post on social media is protected by copyright, just as all original works are. It is a copyright infringement to copy and redistribute the, **unless** permission has been granted by the copyright holder (normally the author in the case of a social media post, as those are rarely sold) or an exception to copyright applies.\n\n**Permission**\n--------------\n\nThere are various ways in which permission might be granted. \n\nThe re\\-user might directly email (or otherwise reach out to) the original author and **ask**, and be granted permission.\n\nThe original author might have released some or all of his or her posts under a permissive license.\n\nSome social media might **require** that posts be released under a permissive license, or otherwise automatically grant such permissions. Remember that Wikipedia, for example, mandates that all posts and contributions be released under a CC\\-BY\\-SA license, although posters have the option to add an additional alternate license, or more than one. \n\n**Exceptions**\n--------------\n\nThe most obvious exception is Fair use, **if** the parties are (or at least the re\\-user is) in the US. People sometimes speak as if fair use is a world\\-wide legal rule. it is a very specifically US legal concept. Some other countries have a somewhat similar concept, known in English as \"Fair Dealing\". It is, i understand, rather moore limited than fair use. [This law.se question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/) discusses fair use in some detail.\n\nMost of the posts being reused here have no market, and so their re\\-use cannot harm the market. That would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-user uses the whole post, or a substantial part of it, that would weigh against fair use. If the re\\-user inserts significant comment on each re\\-used post, that would be analytical if not transformational, and would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-use is monetized, that would weigh against fair use somewhat.\n\nIn short, we cn't tell in general if fair use would apply to any particular post being re\\-used. it might or it might not. Specifics will control, and ultimately it is a judgement call to eb made by a court, if the matter comes to that.\n\n**Enforcement**\n---------------\n\nUnless the copyright holder for a given post files an infringement suit, or files a take\\-down notice, or complains to the host site, there will be no enforcement and no consequences. If a complaint or a take\\-down is filed, the host could remove the content, cancel the re\\-user's account, or both. If the user has monetized the re\\-use, ad revenue can be redirected to the copyright owner. \n\nIf the copyright holder files an infringement suit, and wins, there will be an award of damages, which might be quite small, or rather large. But with no market for the original, and probably little or no income from the re\\-use, low damages are more likely than high. And the original copyright holder would have filing fees, legal expenses, and possibly other expenses in advance.\n\nThere are firms with which one can register one's copyrighted work, who search for it being improperly used and take action, in return for a small up\\-front fee and a share of any damages recovered. But posters of general opinion on social media seem unlikely to use such services.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nSuch a \u201cSocial Media Reacts\u201d\\-video is somewhat risky, from a copyright perspective, but the **likely** negative outcomes are not large.

The correct answer is B because it aligns with the fundamental concept that independent contractors are paid for producing the contracted outcome, not for their time or methods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it attempts to control the contractor's methods, which is generally not allowed for true independent contractors.

This depends on the place and date of publication. In many countries copyright now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. Some countries use different rules. In the US, a work published before 1978 is in most cases copyrighted for 95 years. Works published after that are protected for 70 years after the death of the author. More complex cases are detailed in [this well\\-known chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain).\n\nWho holds the Copyright?\n========================\n\nFor most novels, copyright is initially held by the author(s). The author may sell or give away the copyright at any time. If the author does not transfer the copyright during life, it will pass with other property st the author's death. It may pass by will or by default (intestate) inheritance in the absence of a will. The author's surviving spouse children, if any, are often the heirs to any copyrights, but not always. Authors with many works still in print may have s \"literary estate\" set up to handle their copyrights.\n\nWorks with multiple co\\-authors usually have the copyright shared between all authors; in equal shares unless they agree otherwise. Any one copyright holder may license a derivative work such as a translation.\n\nA would\\-be translator of a work still under copyright must find the copyright holder(s) and obtain permission. If the holders cannot be found, no permission can be obtained, and any translation would be an infringement of copyright. The copyright holder could sue for damages after publication. Damages may be quite substantial in some cases. This varies by country and by the facts of the case.\n\nIn the US The [Federal Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)  will search its records to try to determine who holds a copyright. They charge a fee for doing so, and success is not guaranteed. Other countries may have similar services.\n\n**Addition**:\nThere is no automatic or guaranteed way to find who now owns a copyright. In some cases the owner does not even know that s/he owns the copyright. If the holder died without heirs the copyright may belong to the government (state government in the US).\n\nResearch into the author's life may reveal probable heirs.

Which of the following actions would be the most appropriate first step in determining the copyright status and obtaining permission for the translation?\n\nA) Begin translating the work immediately, as the author's death and defunct publishing house likely place it in the public domain\nB) Contact the Federal Copyright Office to conduct a search of their records for the current copyright holder\nC) Research the author's life to identify potential heirs, starting with any available obituaries\nD) Assume the work is still under copyright and abandon the translation project to avoid potential legal issues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The work is likely still under copyright. Given the publication date (1960) and the author's death date (1985), in most countries, including the US, this work would still be protected by copyright (70 years after author's death or 95 years from publication for pre-1978 works).\n\n2. The defunct publishing house doesn't automatically place the work in the public domain. Copyright typically belongs to the author or their heirs, not the publishing house.\n\n3. While contacting the Federal Copyright Office (option B) is a valid step, it's not necessarily the most appropriate first step. It involves a fee and isn't guaranteed to be successful.\n\n4. Researching the author's life and potential heirs is a practical and often effective first step. Obituaries can provide valuable information about surviving family members who may have inherited the copyright.\n\n5.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. John's actions likely don't constitute criminal check fraud. For fraud, there typically needs to be an intent to deceive, which isn't clear from John simply abandoning the check.\n\n2. Jane cannot successfully sue for the full amount because the check was essentially worthless when she found it.

Only a court can answer that. I can give you general information about laws involving destruction of mail.\n\nUnder [18 USC 1703](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1703):\n\n> Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, unlawfully secretes, destroys, detains, delays, or opens any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail entrusted to him or which shall come into his possession, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, or carried or delivered by any carrier or other employee of the Postal Service, or forwarded through or delivered from any post office or station thereof established by authority of the Postmaster General or the Postal Service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nSo it would generally be a crime to deliberately destroy or delay mail that was otherwise deliverable.\n\nIf a carrier took back mail that should have been delivered, that would probably count as \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" that mail. In the case at hand, though, I suppose the carrier might argue that when you refused to sign for the letter, it gave her reason to doubt that the addressee(s) actually lived there, in which case perhaps the mail should not have been delivered after all. So she might say that she took it all back to the post office for further investigation as to where or whether it should be delivered.\n\nDestroying the mail would similarly be illegal. However, based on other information in your question that is now removed, it appears that she did not actually do so. Merely *threatening* to destroy mail, if the threat is not carried out, does not seem to be a crime under this section. I don't know whether it might be prohibited by some other statute.\n\nCrimes involving mail are normally investigated by the [US Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/), not by local police.\n\nOf course, even if the behavior is not a crime, it may still be cause for the postal employee to be fired or otherwise disciplined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Understood.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The US Postal Inspection Service is specifically mentioned in the documentation as the appropriate agency to investigate crimes involving mail, not local police.\n\n2. The postal worker's actions potentially violate 18 USC 1703, which prohibits postal employees from unlawfully destroying, detaining, or delaying mail. The threat to destroy mail and the act of taking back deliverable mail could be considered \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" under this statute.\n\n3. While the threat itself may not be a crime, the overall behavior warrants investigation by the appropriate federal agency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because local law enforcement isn't typically responsible for mail-related crimes.

Braithwaite](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1990&context=ohlj) that basically discusses my question in pgs 213\\-220, minus the portion about copying the original being legal. However, it discusses Canadian copyright law as it was in 1982 and is rather inconclusive.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whoever \"derived\" the illegal derivative work most likely has copyright in his derivations, unless they are not worth copyright protections. Say I take the Harry Potter books and add a few chapters and try to sell it \\- that's copyright infringement of course, but *I* have the copyright on these additional chapters. \n\nHowever, I don't have the right to allow you to copy the derived work. And even if you have the right to copy the original work, you don't have the right to copy the derived work because it is a different work. I could extract my changes, and allow you to take them and do with them what you like. You could then create an illegally derived work yourself. I couldn't sue you, but the original copyright holder could. \n\nTo the comments: One, a work and a derivative of the work are not the same, so even if you have the right to make a copy of a work, that doesn\u2019t give you any right whatsoever to copy a derivative work \\- they are not the same work. Two, the copyright holder has the exclusive right to control copying *and* the creation of derivative works. If the copyright holder doesn\u2019t want derivatives to exist, then creating them, copying them etc. is always copyright infringement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Canadian musician creates an unauthorized music video for a popular song and uploads it to a video-sharing platform. A fan downloads this video and wants to share it on their personal blog. Assuming the fan has the legal right to copy the original song for personal use under Canadian law, which of the following best describes the legal implications of sharing the unauthorized music video?\n\nA) The fan can legally share the video as they have the right to copy the original song and implicit permission from the video creator.\n\nB) The fan cannot legally share the video as it infringes on the original song's copyright, despite having the right to copy the song for personal use.\n\nC) The fan can legally share the video only if they obtain explicit permission from both the original song copyright holder and the music video creator.\n\nD) The fan can legally share the video but must remove the unauthorized visual elements, keeping only the audio track they have the right to copy.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from copyright law. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The right to copy the original song for personal use does not extend to copying or distributing derivative works (like the music video).\n2. The unauthorized music video is an infringing derivative work, and the video creator does not have the legal right to grant permission for its distribution.\n3. The fan's knowledge of the video's infringing nature is irrelevant; copyright infringement doesn't require intent.\n4. Copying and sharing the video would infringe on the original copyright holder's exclusive right to create and distribute derivative works.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the scope of the personal use exemption and ignores the infringement in the derivative work. Option C is partially correct but overly restrictive, as permission from the video creator alone wouldn't suffice. Option D presents a creative but legally unsound solution that still involves copying and distributing elements of the infringing derivative work.\n\nThis question tests the application of copyright principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of concepts related to derivative works, personal use exemptions, and the limits of copyright permissions."}, "90": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24780/what-kind-of-lawyer-would-our-company-need-to-file-criminal-charges-against-a-cu", "docs_id": 24780, "title": "What kind of lawyer would our company need to file criminal charges against a customer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **About Us**\n\nI work for a company and our company sells very popular electronic products to consumers in the automotive industry. \n\n**Our Problem**\n\nWe have one particular customer that has ordered one of our products legitemately and about 30 other orders of the same product with stolen credit cards.

From my interactions with them I think their ethos would absolutely allow this sort of fraud, but can I do anything about it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe in truth, justice and equality for all\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat I get is something else.\n\nNobody cares what you believe: what can you prove? And what can they prove?\n\nThey say they posted you this letter. You say you never received it. If it goes to court they will submit evidence about how their internal letter generation and postal system works, this either will or will not convince the court on the balance of probabilities that the letter was posted. If it does convince the court, you will provide evidence of how you deal with incoming mail and that it never arrived, this will either convince the court that the postal service did or did not deliver the letter to you. Then you\u2019ll know who wins.\n\nAs to your allegations of fraud: never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence\\- theirs, the postal service or yours.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the LawStackExchange documentation you provided:\n\nQuestion: A customer is in a dispute with their utility company over back billing. The company suddenly produces a digital copy of a letter they claim to have sent years ago, which the customer doesn't remember receiving. Which of the following actions would be most appropriate for the customer to take in this situation?\n\nA) Immediately accuse the company of fraud and threaten legal action\nB) Accept the letter as legitimate and pay the full amount requested\nC) Request evidence of the company's internal letter generation and postal system processes\nD) Ignore the letter and continue disputing based on the Back Billing Code\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the situation and application of legal concepts. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate action because:\n\n1. It avoids making unfounded accusations of fraud, which could weaken the customer's position.\n2. It doesn't concede to the company's claims without verification.\n3. It aligns with the legal principle mentioned in the expert's answer: \"Nobody cares what you believe: what can you prove? And what can they prove?\"\n4. It puts the burden of proof on the company to demonstrate their claim.\n5. It provides a basis for further action depending on the evidence provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because making accusations without proof could harm the customer's case. Option B is incorrect because it accepts the company's claim without verification. Option D is incorrect because ignoring evidence, even if suspicious, could weaken the customer's position if the dispute goes to court.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about evidence, proof, and appropriate dispute resolution strategies."}, "98": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77/what-laws-are-there-regarding-being-pulled-over-by-an-unmarked-cop-car-undercove", "docs_id": 77, "title": "What laws are there regarding being pulled over by an unmarked cop car/undercover cop?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Although this has never happened to me, I've read and heard about people driving on the road and then being signaled (in some way, usually with reds and blues) to pull over for a ticket and the car doing this isn't the usual police car for that area but instead an unmarked car.\n\nAre you legally required to pull over for this unmarked car just like you would for a regular police car? What laws mention or describe this situation (in any state)? If it *is* required, how are you to know if the police car is legitimate?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most states you are required to pull over to the side of the road and come to a stop for *any* vehicle displaying flashing red and/or blue lights, whether oncoming or overtaking. If you don't you are guilty of a moving violation.[1](http://www.fearlesstiger.com/safetyTips/policeStoppingUnmarked.htm)\n\nIf the vehicle with the lights then pulls in behind you the same law forbids you from moving your vehicle. So that's the law for being pulled over by an unmarked car.\n\nIf you are concerned that you were stopped in this manner by someone not authorized to do so (police impersonators have been known to do this) you should call 911 and get the dispatcher to confirm whether the apparent emergency vehicle is legitimate. In general, if you fear for your safety, you can stay in your car and ask to be escorted to a known police station before exposing yourself. E.g., [here's the advice of one Ohio State Highway Patrolman](http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/police-offer-tips-on-what-to-do-if-you-are-pulled-over-by-an-unmarked-car):\n\n> If the area where you stop looks desolate, Miller said you don't have\n>  to stop there.

The driver is concerned about their safety due to recent reports of police impersonators in the area. What is the most appropriate course of action for the driver in this situation?\n\nA) Immediately pull over to the side of the road and stop, as required by law for any vehicle displaying flashing red and blue lights\nB) Continue driving at normal speed while calling 911 to verify the legitimacy of the stop with the dispatcher\nC) Increase speed to reach a well-lit area or police station before stopping, then explain the safety concerns to the officer\nD) Slow down, activate hazard lights to acknowledge the signal, and proceed to a well-lit public area while contacting 911 for verification\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This situation requires balancing legal obligations with personal safety concerns. Option D is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the legal requirement to respond to emergency lights by slowing down and activating hazard lights, showing compliance with the spirit of the law.\n2. It addresses safety concerns by proceeding to a well-lit public area, as advised by the Ohio State Highway Patrolman in the documentation.\n3. It involves contacting 911 to verify the legitimacy of the stop, which is a recommended safety measure when unsure about an unmarked vehicle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't address the safety concerns in a potentially dangerous situation. Option B is problematic because maintaining normal speed might be interpreted as failing to yield to an emergency vehicle. Option C is incorrect because increasing speed could be seen as attempting to flee, which is illegal and potentially dangerous.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, apply multiple concepts from the documentation (legal requirements, safety recommendations, and communication with authorities), and make a judgment that balances competing priorities in a real-world scenario."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82697/could-one-house-of-congress-completely-shut-down-the-other-house-by-passing-a-la", "docs_id": 82697, "title": "Could one house of Congress completely shut down the other house by passing a large number of frivolous bills?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that for some reason, the House of Representatives wants to stop the Senate from doing anything.

Which of the following best describes the potential impact and legality of this approach?\n\nA) It would effectively halt Senate operations, as they are constitutionally required to vote on all House-passed bills\nB) It would be an illegal obstruction of congressional duties and could lead to sanctions against the House members involved\nC) It would likely fail to significantly impact Senate operations, as the Senate has discretion over which bills to consider\nD) It would force the Senate to expand its staff and resources to handle the increased workload, potentially causing budgetary issues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legislative process and the relationship between the two chambers of Congress. The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, \"neither House nor Senate is obliged to consider each and every bill brought to it.\" This means that the Senate has the discretion to choose which bills to bring to the floor for consideration and voting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it falsely assumes that the Senate must vote on all House-passed bills, which is not the case. The Senate leadership and committees have significant control over the legislative agenda.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while this strategy might be seen as politically unwise or obstructionist, it is not illegal. Each chamber of Congress has the right to pass bills as they see fit, even if the intent is questionable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it assumes the Senate would be forced to process all the bills, which is not true given their discretion in considering legislation.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of legislative processes, inter-chamber dynamics, and the limits of parliamentary tactics, requiring critical thinking about the application of constitutional principles in a real-world scenario."}}
