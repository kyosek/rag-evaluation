            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [8 USC \u00a71324b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324b) prohibits employers from discriminating against employees or prospective employees on the basis of immigration status, if the individual in question is\n\n* a citizen or national of the United States,\n* a lawful permanent resident (with a proviso that I won't discuss here), or\n* an asylee or refugee.\n\nI'm wondering whether the existence of 8 USC \u00a71324b rules out the possibility of any stronger state law. For example, suppose a state had a law that says employers can't discriminate against people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This doesn't directly conflict with federal law, since TPS people have an immigration status that allows them to work for any employer. However, I am not sure whether the concept of field preemption would apply here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is well established that the federal government has complete control over immigration. See especially [Arizona v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf) which holds that\n\n> States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress\n> has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.\n\n[De Canas v. Bica](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/351/) (1976\\), 424 U.S. 351 is also relevant to the application of field preemption to INA. In this case, the courts found that Congress had *not* (at that point) entered the field of employment of unauthorized workers, so state laws were not preempted by federal law. Laws can change, and with them, potential state powers.\n\nIn Arizona the court held that\n\n> Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation \u201cso pervasive .\n> . . that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it\u201d or\n> where a \u201cfederal interest is so dominant that the federal system will\n> be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject\u201d\n\nand with respect to issues of immigration,\n\n> Because Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state\n> regulation is impermissible.\n\nThe [Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg3445.pdf) adds provisions to the Immigration and Nationality Act, including employment\\-related law, thus Congress has entered the field of regulating immigration with respect to employment. Current 8 USC \u00a71324b arises from various amendments to the INA, where the present expression \"protected individual\" was inserted, by [Public Law 101\\-649](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg4978.pdf#page=77), to replace earlier \"citizen or intended citizen\". Congress also introduced Temporary Protected Status in \u00a7302 of the law, which has specific (more restricted) provisions regarding employment.\n\nThe evidence clearly indicates that Congress intended to include employment issues w.r.t. their supreme power regarding immigration. These discrimination provisions are in the field of immigration, and not discrimination legislation (where Congress has not preempted the field). Congressional silence must, in the light of what Congress *did* say, be interpreted to mean that the US immigration policy only offers certain specific protections, and states cannot add to or subtract from those protections.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A state government is considering passing a law that prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in hiring practices. Based on federal immigration law and relevant Supreme Court decisions, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The state can pass this law because it provides additional protections not covered by federal law and doesn't directly conflict with 8 USC \u00a71324b.\n\nB) The state cannot pass this law due to field preemption, as Congress has occupied the field of immigration-related employment regulations.\n\nC) The state can pass this law as long as it's framed as anti-discrimination legislation rather than immigration-related legislation.\n\nD) The state can pass this law because Temporary Protected Status is not explicitly mentioned in 8 USC \u00a71324b.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The concept of field preemption applies in this case. As established in Arizona v. US, the federal government has complete control over immigration, and states are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and subsequent amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act show that Congress has entered the field of regulating immigration with respect to employment. The Supreme Court has held that even complementary state regulation is impermissible when Congress has occupied the field. Therefore, despite the state's intention to provide additional protections, it cannot pass laws in this area due to field preemption.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even though the proposed law doesn't directly conflict with 8 USC \u00a71324b, field preemption still applies. Option C is incorrect because the Court has established that the federal interest in immigration is so dominant that it precludes state laws on the same subject, regardless of how they're framed. Option D is incorrect because Congressional silence on TPS in 8 USC \u00a71324b doesn't imply that states can regulate this area; rather, it suggests that Congress intentionally limited protections to specific categories."

The Order, effective immediately, says vaccines are available but not mandated in the state and cites freedom and privacy concerns as the primary basis for the action.\n\n**Given that Florida public schools require MMR vaccinations** (precedent?), how is it possible that such an order be lawful?\n\nOther interesting \\& relevant precedent includes:\n\n* [Jacobson vs. Massachussets:](https://www.history.com/news/smallpox-vaccine-supreme-court) Supreme Court finds Vaccines can be mandatory\n* Roman Catholic Diocese Of Brooklyn, New York v. Andrew M. Cuomo\n\nI am having difficulty reconciling that the Supreme Court would uphold fines for not vaccinating, yet it concluded that NY state violated the right to congregate, despite a pandemic.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As is the case in all 50 states there is statutory and constitutional law allowing governors to issue orders, pursuant to a declared emergency. The most recent order from Florida is [here](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2021/EO_21-81.pdf). As usual, the order includes relevant citations, viz.\n\n> Article IV, Section 1 (a) of the Florida Constitution and by the\n> [Florida Emergency Management Act](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0200-0299/0252/0252.html), as amended, and all other applicable\n> laws\n\nThe section numbers and act names differ between the 50 states, but it reduces to the same logic as was employed to mandate different degrees of shut\\-down and mask\\-wearing. The emergency powers granted to the governor are very broad, and nothing within \u00a7252\\.36 hints that he overstepped his authority. Such powers might (rarely) be limited under a strict scrutiny judicial review, though such reviews in the age of covid have had limited success. There is no construal of \"fundamental rights\" whereby a limit on what government agencies can do could be called into question.\n\nGovernments have a well\\-established power to regulate businesses, which this order does. The order addresses a compelling government interest (assuring the privacy of individuals, and their ability to live their lives without discrimination, etc.), and it is narrowly tailored (temperature screening is still allowed). Perhaps a business can file a lawsuit, advancing a non\\-obvious argument that the order infringes on the liberty of businesses, but I doubt that it would gain judicial traction.\n\nThis is not to say that the Florida legislature could not pass a mandatory vaccination law coupled with a mandate to prove one's compliance: but they have not done so. So until a law is passed by the Florida Legislature that says otherwise (and its veto is overridden), the order is just as legal as its thousands of cousins have been.",

Andrew M. Cuomo.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The order is lawful because it falls under the governor's emergency powers granted by the Florida Constitution and the Florida Emergency Management Act. The documentation explains that governors in all 50 states have statutory and constitutional authority to issue orders during declared emergencies. The Florida order cites specific legal bases, including Article IV, Section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution and the Florida Emergency Management Act. These emergency powers are broad and allow the governor to take various actions to address public health and safety concerns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Jacobson vs. Massachusetts allows for mandatory vaccinations, it doesn't require them, and the governor's emergency powers can override such considerations during a declared emergency.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the existence of MMR vaccination requirements for schools doesn't negate the governor's authority to issue emergency orders regarding a different vaccine.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Supreme Court ruling in the Roman Catholic Diocese case did limit some government restrictions, it's not directly related to the legal basis for the Florida governor's order on vaccine passports."

If I go into a restaurant and order hundreds of dollars of food, then leave before it arrives, I would imagine there is some recourse that the proprietor could take. However, if I order a single item and it doesn't show up for over an hour, despite me inquiring about it's status, would I be compelled to pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In placing an order (for anything, not just in a restaurant) and in the supplier accepting it then a legally binding verbal contract has been created. There are terms that come into being implicitly: some come from statute law and some from common law.\n\nFor example, in most jurisdictions there will be either a common law or specific statute that requires the product to be of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose the customer explicitly or implicitly made known to the vendor. In a restaurant, this means that the food must be presented in a way that enables you to eat it and it must be fit for human consumption.\n\nIt also means that, in the absence of a time for delivery being specified, that the meal must be delivered within a reasonable time. Reasonable has a specific legal meaning and is an objective test: what an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person would expect in the specific circumstances.\n\nIt is clear that a reasonable time varies with the circumstances. Reasonable in McDonalds is different from reasonable in a 3 Michelin star restaurant and also different from the same McDonald's when it is obvious to the customer that they are currently insanely busy.\n\nIf the supplier does not supply the goods and services within a reasonable time then they have breached a term of the contract. The customer has several options: \n\n* repudiate the contract and sue for damages if this is a breach of a condition of the contract (a condition is a term that is fundamental to the contract; late delivery of food probably isn't a condition),\n* repudiate the contract and sue for damages if this is a major breach of a term of the contract (late delivery probably is),\n* sue for damages if this is an intermediate breach of a term or a breach of a warranty.\n\nEnough generalities, for your specific queries:\n\n> What law in involved in restaurant orders?\n\nContract law, consumer protection law, health and safety law, business law, food hygiene laws, tax laws etc. etc.\n\n> If I go into a restaurant and order hundreds of dollars of food, then leave before it arrives, I would imagine there is some recourse that the proprietor could take.\n\nSure, there is a contract, you breached it, the restaurant can sue for damages. In addition, they could make a complaint to the police that you have acted fraudulently by ordering food you never intended to pay for.\n\n> However, if I order a single item and it doesn't show up for over an hour, despite me inquiring about it's status, would I be compelled to pay?\n\nIt depends on if an hour is a reasonable time or not. By inquiring you have demonstrated that you don't believe that it is but you may not be \"an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person\". If the breach is actual and egregious enough then you probably have the right to repudiate the contract; that means the contract is at an end and neither of you have any further obligations under it including an obligation to pay.\n\nThat said, you would be on surer ground if you attempted to renegotiate the contract to make time a condition. \"Look, if the meal is not here in 15 minutes, I'm leaving\"; if the restaurateur accepts this renegotiation by, for example, saying \"I'm terribly sorry, we will sort it out\" then your position is much clearer.",

After waiting for 45 minutes without receiving her meal, she politely inquires about its status. The waiter apologizes and says it will be ready soon. Another 30 minutes pass, and Sarah still hasn't received her meal. She decides to leave without paying. Which of the following best describes the legal situation?\n\nA) Sarah has breached the contract and must return to pay for the meal, even if she doesn't eat it.\n\nB) The restaurant has breached the contract, and Sarah is within her rights to leave without paying.\n\nC) There is no legally binding contract since the food was never delivered, so neither party has any obligations.\n\nD) Sarah should have explicitly renegotiated the contract with a time condition before leaving to be on legally solid ground.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, when placing an order, a legally binding verbal contract is created with implicit terms, including delivery within a reasonable time. \"Reasonable\" is determined by what an ordinary, prudent person would expect under the circumstances. In this case, waiting for 75 minutes in a busy restaurant for a simple steak dinner likely exceeds a reasonable time frame, especially after inquiring about the status.\n\nBy significantly delaying the meal beyond a reasonable time, the restaurant has likely committed a major breach of a term of the contract. This gives Sarah the right to repudiate the contract and leave without paying. While option D suggests a safer approach, it's not strictly necessary for Sarah to be within her rights to leave.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's the restaurant, not Sarah, that has breached the contract. Option C is wrong because a legally binding contract was formed when the order was placed and accepted, even if the food wasn't delivered. Option D, while a good practice, is not required for Sarah to be legally justified in her actions."

For example is it normal for the damaging affects of a demotion to be given as a reason to have \"tolled the time\" to file a complaint?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An appeal, realistically, in New York State, takes more than a year, and often two years to run its course. It could take longer in some cases as there are no firm deadlines for appellate courts to rule within (at least in this kind of case).\n\nThe grounds asserted in the appeal are facially reasons for appealing a decision that make logical, legal sense. Whether the facts and the trial court's ruling actually support those grounds for an appeal making it likely to prevail is another question.\n\nBoth issues are going to be evaluated on the basis of whether there was any evidence in the record to support the findings of fact made in the trial court to support its decision, and whether accepting all findings of fact that have support in record as true, the trial court's decision was an abuse of discretion. Those are difficult, but hardly impossible, hurdles to get over to prevail on an appeal.",

For example, a jury might happen to say, \"We know he's guilty, but we're acquitting him because we hate the government.\" Or they might say, \"We know he's innocent, but we're convicting him because he's (race).\"\n\nYes, I know jury selection is supposed to weed out people like that. But with millions and millions of trials taking place, sooner or later, someone will probably slip through, and sometimes it only takes one or two people to incite \"mob mentality.\"\n\nYes, I know that juries are sternly instructed not to make rulings like that and to rule according to the law. But just asking someone to do something is not really binding.\n\nIf a verdict like that did happen, there are some cases where it couldn't be appealed at all (like an acquittal), and even if it is possible to appeal it, many US courts seem to have a tendency to reject appeals of criminal convictions. And even if you got it overturned, this would still be a horrifying and costly ordeal.\n\nSo let's say a jury openly admitted that they made a bad decision out of malice. Could the jury be charged with anything? Would the verdict still stand?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No more than any other system\n-----------------------------\n\nUltimately, when deciding a criminal or civil matter and forcing people to abide by the decision **somebody** has to make that decision.\n\nA jury made up of members of the public can make poor, arbitrary, malicious or otherwise \u2018wrong\u2019 decisions. But so can a trained and experienced judge. Or police officer. Or surgeon.\n\nIn countries where [jury trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Pros_and_cons) are an embedded part of the legal system, they are seen as providing an important balance to government power, an egalitarian measure that places judgement in the hands of lay members of the public rather than a judicial elite and a defence against bias since they require unanimous or near\\-unanimous (10 of 12 is common) verdicts.\n\nIn countries where they are not part of legal\\-social culture they are often regarded as stupid.\n\nBoth positions are arguable.\n\nAt the end of the day, juries can be biased and arbitrary. So can judges. The protection against this for judges is they have to give reasons for their decision and that is subject to appeal. The protection against this for juries is that their decisions have to be unanimous or, where majority verdicts are accepted, they have to be a super\\-majority \\- usually 10 from 12\\. However, the decision of the jury is typically not subject to review and they are usually prohibited from discussing their reasons: what happens in the jury room stays in the jury room. There are arguments both for and against why this is a good thing.\n\nHowever, in most jurisdictions, if there is clear evidence of jury misconduct (like jurors conducting a [seance](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-08/ouija-board-juror-misbehaviour-murder-trials/9734868)), a mistrial can be declared and we all start again. Similarly, if the judge reaches the opinion that the prosecution or plaintiffs has not provided enough evidence such that no reasonable jury could find that they have met their burden of proof, they can enter a directed verdict. Jurors who are corrupt or otherwise engage in criminal conduct can be prosecuted. Jurors who are just idiots are just idiots.",

The documentation highlights that while jury trials are seen as an important balance to government power and allow for public participation in the justice system, they are not without flaws. Juries can potentially make biased or arbitrary decisions, similar to judges or other decision-makers. However, there are safeguards in place, such as the requirement for unanimous or near-unanimous verdicts, the possibility of declaring a mistrial in cases of clear misconduct, and the option for judges to enter a directed verdict if there is insufficient evidence. The other options are either too extreme (A and D) or inaccurate (B) based on the information provided."

In this case, there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration (the actions to be taken by both parties) established in the text messages. The original agreement, if it meets all contract requirements, would be considered legally binding. The unilateral attempt to change the terms after an agreement has been reached and partially executed would not be enforceable without the other party's consent.

Since this is fairly likely is there a de facto restriction on the content?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The U.S. Supreme Court has held time and time again that all restrictions on Speech must be \"content neutral\" and using the least restricted means available. Furthermore, Speech is presumed to be \"protected political speech\" until proven other wise in a court of law.\n\nThis means that the specific nature of the hacked content (a pro Nazi ad) is no more illegal than the [1987 Max Headroom Broadcast Signal Intrusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion). Wikipedia lists the maximum legal fine as a $1000 fine and a year in jail (although no one has ever been prosecuted for the incident.). While the incident did include several obscene gestures that would not be allowed on Television, these restrictions are part of the deal for a broadcast signal licenses with the FCC and are not applicable in this case due to the crime being that the parties involved didn't have a broadcast liscense for that channel to begin with.\n\nIn the hypothetical where the unexpected interruption lead to a Jewish Man having a fatal arguement, again, the law is constructed in a manner to charge with a crime, specifically \"Felony Murder\". Felony Murder is said to occur when a person, in the commission of a felony, is responsible for the death of another person, be it a co\\-conspirator or an innocent bystander. The typical hypothetical case used for this is if a bank robber with a non\\-functional gun (clearly intending to not hurt anyone) and the little old lady bank patron has a fatal heart attack when the robber brandishes the weapon and yells \"Nobody move, this is a stick up.\" Because robbing a bank is illegal, it doesn't matter that she was susceptible to heart attacks because she's an old lady, but that the robber chose to break the law and in doing so, directly caused the fatal heart attack. If the crime in question is a misdemeanor that leads to someone's death, then the charge is Manslaughter, not Murder (i.e. If you are speeding going into a green light, and a kid runs into your path and is killed in the car crash, this could result in a manslaughter charge. Even though the kid was Jaywalking, which is a crime, you were speeding, which is also a crime, and thus responsible for the fatality, but not to the level of murder, due to reckless disregard.).\n\nIn your scenario, the Jewish Man's death can be prosecuted, but is not specifically because of the content of the message broadcast (the Nazi ad) but the underlying crime of the broadcast hijacking a signal which he is not licensed to broadcast on by the FCC. Given that the penalty includes a possible year in jail, this means the crime is a felony offense (and a Federal one at that, but that speaks more to the certainty of conviction on charges brought against the accused party. The Feds are very very good at making sure they get their man).\n\nAgain, it is not specifically because content discussing conspiracies about the Nazis was broadcast (we're not arresting the History channel for all their Nazi conspiracy theories) but because the event violated a law that is content neutral. If the hacker interrupted the signal to broadcast Martin Luther King Jr's. \"I have a dream\" Speech, causing a Klan member to die in shock, he'd be no less guilty of the same crimes as he would be in your scenario. He did something illegal which resulted in someone's death. The law doesn't care about the specific details of the content of the death in determining the charge. Certainly the fact that the content was Nazi propaganda would matter, but only in establishing this particular case. If a similar incident occurs and no one dies, then the second hacker wouldn't be charged with \"attempted murder\".\n\nEven in the very limited restrictions on speech, context is critical and will be judged more then content. The classic \"You can't shout fire in a crowded theater\" is not universal. I can in fact shout \"Fire in a Crowded Theater\" if there is in fact a fire... or I am speaking to the audience on matters of U.S. Free Speech and am pointing out a case where my shout is still protected because I am discussing an oft cited example case of speech that has reasonable restrictions but narrowly so and in certain contexts is still protected political speech (Deadpool eat your heart out on that meta).\n\nFinally, since you bizzarely tagged this as copyright, the Supreme Court also held that trademarks are not government endorsement of speech and thus the government cannot with hold any registration of copyright's, trademarks, or patents because of the use of offensive language. The case stems from an all Asian American band being denied the trademark for the act's name, which was a slur for Asian people that the band was trying to reclaim (aka using an offensive slur in a positive way to take it back from the bigots). The court found in favor of the band as the government was using it's interpretation of the band's name as offensive to deny them equal protection under the law (in this case, the Trademark that would allow the Band the exclusive use of the stylized name in merchandise).\n\nIt's also very rare that a First Amendment case will be decided on a 5\\-4 decision margin by SCOTUS, and most justices tend to rule on the side that the First Amendment protects \"the speech I do not like.\" In fact, in the vast majority of cases dealing with the First Amendment, the justices tend to be 9\\-0 more often then not.",

The hacker can potentially be charged with felony murder, but this charge would stem from the underlying felony of unauthorized broadcast intrusion, not the specific content of the advertisement. The law focuses on content-neutral violations, and in this case, the illegal act of hijacking a broadcast signal (which can carry a penalty of up to a year in jail, making it a felony) led to a death. This falls under the felony murder rule, where a death occurring during the commission of a felony can be charged as murder.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because hate crime charges based solely on the content would violate First Amendment protections against content-based restrictions on speech.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the content itself might be protected speech, the act of illegally broadcasting it is not, and deaths resulting from felonies can lead to murder charges.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the potential year-long jail sentence for unauthorized broadcasting makes it a felony, not a misdemeanor, and the resulting death could elevate the charges to felony murder."

And if so, how would I approach this problem in the right manner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend on whether those services act as independent controllers, or as your data processors.\n\nIf they are separate controllers, then you need a legal basis for sharing your user's personal data with them, which happens e.g. by loading content from their services. This legal basis will typically be consent, and will typically be implemented in a click\\-to\\-load fashion, where the functionality initially has a placeholder that asks for consent, and is later replaced with the embedded content if consent is given. You are not responsible for the independent controller's privacy practices, though. You are not the data controller for the services' logfiles.\n\nIf they are your data processors, then things are very different. You are not sharing your users personal data with another service, you are processing personal data under your authority, and have merely outsourced some aspects of these activities. If a data processor maintains logfiles, these are your logfiles that they just maintain on your behalf. You would be fully responsible for them, including, if appropriate, by facilitating the exercise of data subject rights like access or erasure.\n\nSince you cannot delegate responsibility for compliance to your data processors, you should only engage data processors where you are confident that using their services allows you to be fully GDPR\\-compliant. Before integrating their services, you might evaluate what data will actually be processed, whether this is necessary for your purposes, how you can configure the data processing activities, and how you can fulfil data subject rights with regards to these processing activities. For example, a service provider might offer a data protection dashboard where you can export or delete user data, if that service provider wants to make it easy to use their services in a GDPR\\-compliant manner.\n\nEven if engaging the service as a data processor, you will need a legal basis for the actual processing activity. This might be consent (opt\\-in), or a different legal basis like a legitimate interest, in which case an opt\\-out may be required. When consent is revoked or a legitimate interest is objected to, past processing activities remain lawful. Whether past data will have to be deleted depends on context.\n\nWhether or not an \"account\" was created on your backend is a red herring. If you can identify the data subject's information on the backend, they can exercise their data subject rights. This is possible without an account e.g. if pseudonymous client IDs are used. However, you are not required to keep identifying data just for GDPR purposes (see Art 11\\). If it is not possible for you to locate the data subject's records, then the data subject rights like access and erasure don't apply.\n\nPersonal tip for Google services: Google offers a wide variety of services under very different terms. You will have to investigate those services on a case by case basis. For some such as Maps, Google will be the data controller. For other such as Crashlytics, Google will act as a processor. But as of 2023, Google does not guarantee for most of its services that personal data will only be processed in the EU or in countries with an adequate level of data protection. This can make it extremely tricky (or outright impossible) to use their services in a GDPR\\-compliant manner. Sometimes the use of such possibly\\-noncompliant services can still be a valid business decision, but the safer approach would be to avoid Google services whenever possible. Crashlytics is closely related to the Analytics product, for which some European data protection authorities have explicitly stated that it cannot be used in a compliant manner.",

The developer would need to ensure they can configure data processing activities and fulfill data subject rights.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because GDPR applies regardless of whether users sign in. \n\nAnswer B is partially true but oversimplified; the need for opt-out depends on the legal basis for processing and Google's role.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because account deletion on the backend doesn't address data held by third-party services like Crashlytics or Maps.\n\nThe question highlights the complexity of GDPR compliance when using third-party services and the importance of understanding the role of each service provider in data processing."

Subsequently a bill arrives for this service.\n\nThe initial conversation typically starts along the lines of \"we advertise \\[xyz] online and we are ringing to update the details\". The confirmation of details is interpreted by the seller to be a verbal contract. I have one instance of where \"we advertise \\[xyz]\" was a complete lie. Other cases are a bit greyer, for example one listing is there with details that appear to date back to the previous ownership of the venue (though I suspect that they never paid the bill when it arrived either).\n\nWhen the bill is ignored, they use a London\\-based harassment service to start sending official\\-looking letters. This service advertises that it will \"send a carefully crafted series of letters prompting payment directly to the supplier\". The letter states that the debtor should not reply to it and instead direct all correspondence to the creditor.\n\nI have personally taken some of the phone calls, from three different websites that are using this tactic. All are registered to the same individual. I even spoke to one guy who claimed to be a debt collector when I clearly recognised his voice as being from one of these websites.\n\nWhat aspects of this operation are illegal? Could any of these verbal agreements be enforceable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Given that this is a UK based company, the most applicable Act would be the [Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/30)\n\n> A person who, not having reasonable cause to believe there is a right\n>  to payment, in the course of any trade or business makes a demand for\n>  payment, or asserts a present or prospective right to payment, for\n>  what he knows are unsolicited goods sent (after the commencement of\n>  this Act) to another person with a view to his acquiring them \\[for the\n>  purposes of his trade or business], shall be guilty of an offence and\n>  on summary conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 4\n>  on the standard scale.\n\nThis law specifically refers to \n\n> \\[unsolicited] charges for entries in directories.\n\n---\n\nYou also mentioned that they're misrepresenting that a company is *already a customer* and sending out invoices on that basis.

If this came before an actual judge, the judge would throw it out in a heartbeat.

The Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 prohibits demanding payment for unsolicited goods or services, which applies to the situation described. Additionally, misrepresenting that a company is already a customer and sending invoices on that basis likely violates the Fraud Act 2006, which prohibits making false representations dishonestly.

He didn't live long enough to actually write the book, but some scholars are interested in working out what form it might have taken. This is because the arrangement is incomplete: it lists a bunch of texts and numbers them, and assigns about 2/3 to one of the four main divisions in an accompanying table of contents, but it doesn't specify which subdivisions they belong in, or how they should be ordered. Hence the scholarly speculation.\n\nI'm working on a web app that would allow scholars to work on arrangements of these texts: basically assign them to sections, order them, etc. All of the texts I'm using are taken from an online scholarly edition of the author's works. Now these texts were written almost 150 years ago, and I'm using them in the original language, not in English translation, so I'm not infringing on the copyright of a more recent translation.\n\nHowever, the online edition I took the texts from is basically a digitized version of the standard scholarly print edition, funded by a few major organizations. Because the author's originals were notebook material, the editors of this standard edition had to distill them into printable texts, which were never set in print that way by the original author.\n\nMy question is: does the publisher of the standard edition hold the copyright for their print renditions of these texts, or are their renditions public domain because the texts themselves were written so long ago? The author has been dead for well over 100 years.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If only such content as is in fact in the public domain is reprinted, it will not matter that a later edition that is protected also includes the public domain content. No later edition can confer copyright protection on a work already in the public domain. However, if the older content is so rewritten in the new edition as to be a new, if derivative, work, that would be protected by a new copyright.\n\nAlso, if creativity were used in the selection and arrangement of texts from a public domain source, copying that selection and arrangement could be an infringement.",

What is the most likely outcome of this situation?\n\nA) Bob will successfully patent the design, and Alice will have to stop producing her coffee maker.\nB) Bob's patent application will be rejected due to Alice's prior art, and Alice can continue producing her coffee maker.\nC) Bob and Alice will have to share the patent rights and split the profits from the coffee maker.\nD) Alice will be forced to buy the patent rights from Bob to continue producing her coffee maker.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this scenario, Alice's production and public sale of her coffee maker for 2 years constitutes \"prior art.\" Prior art is any evidence that an invention was already known to the public before a patent application was filed. This is an absolute bar to patentability for anyone else trying to patent the same invention.\n\nWhen Bob attempts to patent the identical design, the patent office will likely discover Alice's existing product during their search and examination process. As a result, Bob's patent application will be rejected due to lack of novelty, as Alice's prior art demonstrates that the invention was already in public use before Bob's application.\n\nAlice can continue producing and selling her coffee maker as she has been doing, as she hasn't sought patent protection herself. However, by choosing not to patent her invention, Alice has effectively placed her design in the public domain, meaning others are free to copy and produce similar coffee makers as well.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't accurately reflect how prior art affects patent applications and existing unpatented products in the market."

A narrow interpretation of the word \"sign\" is some physical object with appropriate words like \"Road closed for parade\", but a broader interpretation is \"an indication\", such as a person saying \"Road closed for parade\". Nothing in state law restricts this notification power to only uniformed officers. However, [ORS 811\\.535](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_811.535) which is the general \"failure to obey\" law only applies to disobeying uniformed police officers displaying a badge. The difference between the two offenses is that violating \"use when prohibited\" is only a class D infraction while disobeying a uniformed police officer is a class B infraction.\n\nState law does not say what kind of person can direct traffic, it frames restrictions in terms of what a traffic authority can regulate (such as parades). County or municipal ordinances might then specifically say who is authorized to direct traffic. I assume it was not unknowable that there was a parade then and there, so the driver was already on notice that the road was closed to regular traffic. Nevertheless, state law does require that there be a \"sign\", so if you had called the police to ticket a person, they might have made a federal or at least state case out of it, and we could learn what, in Oregon, the word \"sign\" means in the context of that law.\n\nA crucial question is whether the road was closed by a competent traffic authority.

If the auctioneer also knows the max bid (of the real potential buyer, let's called that person BidderA for clarification) and places shill bids (fake bids) to increase the price all the way to the BidderA's max bid, is that illegal?\n\nThe buyers and sellers do not know that the auctioneer can see max bids as well.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nAn example for clarification: ItemA's highest bid is $100 and has a minimum of $5 increases. BidderA places a bid on ItemA for $105 but they also are willing to bid up $200 so they place a max bid $200\\.\n\nThe way the max bid should should work is if BidderB places a bid of $150, the auction site will automatically place a $155 bid for BidderA and BidderA is still the highest bidder. If BidderB placed a $250 bid instead, they would become the highest bidder.\n\nInstead, what is happening is that the auctioneer (the company running the auction) sees that BidderA placed a max bid of $200 and places a bid for $195 (for what they claim is on behalf of the seller).

Options A and B are incorrect as they state prohibitions that don't exist in the UCC. Option D is incorrect because it's normal and expected for an auctioneer to have access to all bid information."

These aren't the intuitive meanings, but you'll just confuse people if you use them with other meanings. Windows is not either free or open source by these definitions.\n\nIf you disregard the license, that's not going to help you legally. To quote [the Gnu General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), section 9,\n\n> You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\n>  a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n>  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer\\-to\\-peer transmission\n>  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.

Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n>  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nSection 2 supplies the basic permissions, including\n\n> You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\n\nand\n\n> Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nI've removed the material that gives you slightly more freedom when subcontractiong development. Clearly, you can change the software without any further permission, and you have permission to redistribute under the terms stated later in the license.\n\nYou can read [Wikipedia on US copyright law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States). There are a large number of things you aren't allowed to do, and an agreement that allows you to do those things anyway is generally called a license.\n\nTherefore, if you redistribute a GPL\\-covered work without complying with the license, you don't have a valid license, and you're committing copyright infringement. The section \"Infringement\" should summarize what you might face if you violate copyright, which is injunctions and possible statutory damages.\n\nOther problems are possible. The [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) has provisions to allow a copyright holder to ask a web host to remove content from their site. Depending on what you're doing, you might face [criminal prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Copyright_Law_in_the_United_States), although I wouldn't expect that to come in unless you're particularly flagrant.",

In all likelihood, no. Community property state laws generally state that property (not just real property) acquired during a marriage becomes part of the \"community\" (the community of the two spouses) and is usually divided 50/50 in the instance of a divorce. Laws may vary by state on how that property is divided, though. For example, California does 50/50, equally, whereas Texas does it \"equitably.\" \n\n**Factors Used in Equitable Distribution:**\n\nIf you live in a state using the equitable distribution doctrine, the [main factors](http://family.findlaw.com/divorce/community-property-overview.html) are each spouses earning capacity on their own, if and which parent is the legal caretaker of the children if there are children, and whether there are any examples of specific fault for the divorce, such as adultery, abuse, etc. \n\nMore granular factors related to the main ones include whether someone would lose a benefit or mode of compensation they would have been entitled to if the marriage continued; health matters; age differences and how they may relate to ability to maintain employment or receive benefits; what size inheritance, if any, a spouse may be positioned to receive; and the size of the estate itself.\n\n**Community Property or Not:**\n\nIf the property is acquired while you are married, it is generally considered community property (this is true often in states that don't have community property statutes, but especially so in those that do). This [includes](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/the-ins-and-outs-of-community-property-law) income, real or personal property acquired with income earned during the marriage (cars, houses, luxury items, appliances, etc.), as well as debts. \n\nConversely, property you had before you got married, property you acquired after you and your spouse became legally separated, and any property received as a gift or as an inheritance *from a third party* remains separate after divorce. On the latter item, the party that received the gift or inheritance must keep it separate during the marriage in order for it to remain separate. If you receive a cash inheritance, don't dump it into your joint bank account, or you will likely have waived your separate claim to it. \n\nThis website provides some common examples and their dispositions as separate property or community property toward the bottom of the page: [http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/separate\\-community\\-property\\-during\\-marriage\\-29921\\.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/separate-community-property-during-marriage-29921.html). \n\n**Addition:**\n\nAfter @ohwilleke's helpful comment below about the post\\-nup, I'm adding the following.\n\nA couple may create a [transmutation agreement](http://www.assetprotectionattorneys.com/Asset_Protection_Blog/2013/April/How_can_we_protect_our_assets_if_we_live_in_a_co.aspx), which is a type of post\\-nuptial agreement. A transmutation agreement operates in a community property state to keep the two spouse's property separate despite the state law (it is worth noting, this is similar to the principle of contract law where parties to a contract usually are able to waive certain rights guaranteed them in statute assuming the waiver was made knowingly and willingly). It is recommended that both spouse's acquire separate counsel so as to ensure both spouse's are fully aware of the potential outcomes of the agreement. That will protect the agreement from being challenged by one of the spouse's later.",

But that isn't really analogous to the situation with marijuana.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the state action contrary to federal prohibition involves at least tacit consent from U.S. attorneys and from legislation from Congress limiting expenditures of federal funds for enforcement of state legal marijuana transactions in most casees.",

Or it could be requested directly from the holder or holder's agent, in which case the terms would be whatever the holder will agree to.\n\nMaking recordings of a copyrighted musical work, even if they are not distributed, also requires permission (which can be obtained through a compulsory \"mechanical\" license or directly).\n\nCites to US Copyright Law\n-------------------------\n\n[17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) says:\n\n> To perform or display a work \u201cpublicly\u201d means\u2014\n\n> (1\\) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or\n\n> (2\\) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1\\) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\n\n[17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) lists as among of the rights which a copyright holder has:\n\n> (1\\) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\n> (4\\) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;\n\n[17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115) covers \"mechanical\" or \"cover\" compulsory licenses.\n\nPractical Considerations\n------------------------\n\nGiven that the web site will be on an invite\\-only basis, it is likely that the copyright holder would never learn of it. Even if the copyright holder does learn, many holders would not consider filing suit, which would involve court fees and legal expenses, in such a case. If no fees are being charged, and the market for the copyrighted work is not harmed. the likely damages even if a suit is filed and won, are relatively small, so a suit might well not pay off.\n\nBut some holders would sue on principle, and there is no way to know in advance who would or would not. There would be an element of legal risk in putting up such a web site.\n\nOther countries\n---------------\n\nThe above is all based on [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law. I believe that the law would be similar in most countries that have signed the Berne Copyright Convention, but the details would differ.",

This is true regardless of whether the website is private or if no fees are charged. The act of reproducing and distributing copyrighted work, even on a small scale, requires permission or a license. While the risk of discovery or legal action may be low in this scenario, it does not change the fact that the practice is technically infringing on copyright. The band would need to obtain proper licensing or permission to legally share their cover recordings, even in this limited capacity."

Since the instructions say not to do this and \u201cpersonal projects\u201d probably isn\u2019t what they were looking for, this contract was filled out wrong.\n\nThis is just an example but in general what happens when something legally binding is filled out wrong? Does it invalidate the whole thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One of the principles of contract law is that the offer and acceptance are evaluated based on the objectively ascertainable intentions as judged by a reasonable person.\n\nOn the facts that you have provided \\- even if your friend claims that they filled it out wrong, there is no reason for someone to objectively think so, particularly given the fact that they went to the trouble of writing the information in.\n\nHowever, this will depend on what kind of legally binding document this is. If it is, in fact, a contract, then the employer must accept it before it becomes legally binding, and they must actually communicate this acceptance to your friend (the **offeror**). \n\nIf this is a policy document, then it is only legally binding if another contract has said that it is legally binding \\- generally, (smart) employers will include a clause in their employment contract stating that you are to adhere to policies but that those policies do not form part of the contract. If that is the case, then your friend is legally bound by the terms of the policy and will breach their employment contract if they do not adhere to this policy.\n\nThis is unlikely to be an issue of contract law in and of itself \\- your friend cannot unilaterally bind their employer to terms as he sees fit. More information \\- including the nature of the document and other agreements that were made \\- would be required to provide more useful information (and that's what you would give to a lawyer).",

The reasonable person standard would assume the employee intended to include this information, as they took the effort to write it down. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a minor error typically doesn't invalidate an entire document.

While creating an advertisement for educational purposes is generally allowed, publicly sharing it online introduces complexities. The student needs to consider:\n\n1. How they used Wacom's trademarks and logos in the video.\n2. Whether the video could be mistaken for an official Wacom advertisement.\n3. If the use of Wacom's intellectual property in the video falls under fair use for educational or portfolio purposes.\n4. The potential impact on Wacom's brand and market.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores potential legal issues.

Would that argument just be discarded? Could a jury be forced to consider the question? Or does each legal system have pre\\-specified philosophical ground rules within which trials are held?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a defendant, one can argue almost anything in defense of one's self and one's case, as long as one (as a *pro se* defendent, or one's legal representation) is truthful (see [Officer of the court \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_court)). There is no legal barrier to any argument or framework of an argument, be it religion or philosophy when one is arguing a case. (But there are limits; arguing that you're a sovereign citizen \\- or that you're the second coming of Christ \\- and laws don't apply to you might get you jailed for contempt).\n\nI can argue that I'm entitled to take food from the grocery store without paying because I am entitled to it because I am, well, **I am me**, the greatest person in the history of mankind, and as such, I don't have to buy food. Because I am me.\n\n> Would that argument just be discarded?\n\nBut the \"I am me\" argument isn't going to fly in court (and possibly very quickly because the court will not be happy about a frivolous argument not based in the law) against a charge of theft because we're talking about the rule of law, which is established and adopted as a framework of justice in the interest of a legal system fair to all, and not a speculative framework, such as philosophy, or a religious framework based on concepts of faith. The rule of law is a general agreement (subject to change, of course; see below) that certain things are wrong, and there is a price to pay, and that price to pay is written down and established as a norm and formalized through the lawmaking arm of the government, which can change that rule of law in a lawful way. See [Rule of law \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law).\n\n> Could a jury be forced to consider the question?\n\nA jury can't be forced to consider a philosophical (or religious) idea. A judge might encourage a jury to consider a philosophical or religious theory as a way to arrive at a verdict, but to arrive at verdict based in the law, not based on that philosophy or religion. A jury can certainly take a defendants' arguments into consideration; that's the basis of their debates. The members of jury may talk among itself about theories and philosophies in order to debate and arrive at a verdict based in the law. Some members of the jury may only refer to philosophy or relgion, and solely and hold out and prevent a verdict from being arrived at, because that juror(s) are pursuing something based in ideology, or they are confused about the rule of law. Those jurors could be removed from the jury (under the rule of law) in order to arrive at a verdict.\n\n> Or does each legal system have pre\\-specified philosophical ground\n>  rules within which trials are held?\n\nIt could be argued that our rule of law is derived from a set of philosophical (and arguably religious, too) ground rules that began with the [United States Constitution \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution), and the rule of law as codified as a necessity excludes other philosophical ground rules in the interest of even\\-handed and fair justice for all.\n\nThere are many other rules of law which are based in other legal, philosophical and religious traditions. And those rules of law may include written \"ground rules\" that are referred to as objective and based on something like a Constitution; or they may include judgements derived from the warm entrails of animals.",

How would the court likely handle this argument?\n\nA) The court would be required to consider the philosophical argument as a valid defense and instruct the jury accordingly.\nB) The argument would be immediately dismissed as frivolous and the defendant held in contempt of court.\nC) The defendant would be allowed to present the argument, but it would likely not be considered a valid legal defense under the established rule of law.\nD) The court would need to consult philosophical experts to determine the validity of the argument before proceeding.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While defendants are generally allowed to present various arguments in their defense, including philosophical ones, the court operates under an established rule of law. The philosophical objection to premeditation would likely be allowed to be presented, but it would not override the legal definition and precedent regarding premeditated murder. The court and jury are bound to consider the case within the framework of existing laws and legal principles, not speculative philosophical arguments. The argument would not be automatically dismissed (ruling out option B), nor would the court be required to give it special consideration (ruling out options A and D).

As I understand it, the appellate decision was that the IRS is permitted to compel state authorities to surrender information it wants on this marijuana dispensary. The writ of certiorari then was an attempt to get SCOTUS to overturn that, correct? Which they have denied, hence effectively supporting the government's stance on cannabis.\n\nSo, with that in mind, this statement is kind of a rant (totally righteous IMO, FWIW) on why the US position toward cannabis is incoherent and inconsistent.\n\nAssuming all that is correct, what is the function of the statement? Is it a \"yeah, this sucks and the US position is ridiculous but you're stuck with it\"? Or a \"dissent\" from the denial of certiorari?\n\nAnd is it normal for there to be a statement associated with a denial of certiorari?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd say it's more like a concurrence than a dissent. Justice Thomas isn't saying the Court should have taken the case; he's just raising question about the (implicit) reason the Court isn't taking the case.\n\nMost experienced observers will read the statement as a signal that he is open to reversing *Raich* and hoping that someone will bring the right case in which to do that. But in the end, t amounts to pure commentary and has no legal effect.\n\nThe practice of filing these types of statements is not \"normal,\" as the Court rejects probably more than 95 percent of the cases that come to it, and it does so without comment. But it is hardly unprecedented to see these types of statements, and I assume that every justice (except perhaps Barrett, given her recent arrival) has made similar statements.

And if that carer, through their intention or negligence, inspires the cared for human to act in some way against the law \\- is it not always the carer that is responsible?\n\nWith respect to the human carer and cared for individual \\- there is no veil, just the consideration of both individual's intention, or lack thereof. For the corporation, sometimes the 'veil is lifted', but what is a, or any, beneficial purpose of this veil of intention for the corporate person? Is it not a starting point of obfuscation, and at the extreme \\- honest consideration of human mens\\-rea? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main topic you have spoken of is intention of a corporation. You question the ability of organisations to have intent. A corporation can be fully responsible for negligent behaviour when multiple employees knowingly acted against the interest of their customers/clients because Corporations are separate legal entities meaning they are kept separate from their owner/s liability wise. \n\nYes the actions of many employees give rise to business operations and hence, the employees act on behalf of their organisation as one. Whilst ceos can be sued individually for bad company direction, it often comes down to the type of claim and who by.\n\nAs for other issues faced by corporations as legal persons.\nIn private law there have been cases brought forward about a companies right to privacy as a legal person, this has not been upheld in Australia where the media have a right to post and companies must be transparent in their actions. The ability for a corporation to be fully viewed as a legal person is in question here.\n\nIn another issue, land can be declared a legal person. It cannot be said it has intention and it is unlikely it would be sued by anyone, however, the governing authority responsible for the land can take action on behalf of the land to protect \u2018its interests\u2019 \\- interests being an objective point of view as to obligations of the governing body rather than a subjective point of view from the actual land itself.\n\nIn short, yes corporations have leaders and governing owners that put forth actions, but they are a legal person in the sense that they act as one body rather than many individuals with different subjective intentions and views. It makes it easier to claim legal issues this way. For example the intention of Bob as marketing chief would be more subjective and harder to determine than the intention of the actions of the whole company in a misleading advertising claim. Also Bob may not have enough money to be worth going to court to attempt to claim compensation.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large corporation is sued for negligence resulting in environmental damage. The CEO claims they were unaware of the specific actions that led to the damage. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal perspective on corporate responsibility in this scenario?\n\nA) The corporation cannot be held liable because it lacks human intention, and only individual employees can be sued.\n\nB) The CEO is personally liable for all damages because they are the primary decision-maker for the corporation.\n\nC) The corporation can be held liable as a separate legal entity, regardless of the CEO's personal knowledge of the specific actions.\n\nD) The corporation can only be held liable if the \"corporate veil\" is lifted and individual employees' intentions are proven.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because corporations are recognized as separate legal entities that can be held responsible for their actions, including negligence, even if specific individuals within the company (like the CEO) were unaware of particular actions. This concept of corporate personhood allows for the corporation to be sued as a whole, rather than just individual employees. While option D touches on the concept of \"lifting the corporate veil,\" this is not typically necessary for general negligence claims against a corporation. Options A and B are incorrect as they misrepresent the nature of corporate liability in such cases."

The documentation emphasizes that rights and obligations in such situations are contingent on local laws and contract details. It also suggests consulting with a local employment lawyer for a more accurate assessment based on the full facts of the case.

Would it possibly be ineligible for copyright?\n\nFor instance, let's say that I go to Stack Overflow because a Python math function like math.modf is not working. I then see a Stack Overflow post explaining that to make math functions work, you need to enter this line:\n\n`import math`\n\nIf I copy and paste the `import math` code into my own program, then release it under a non\\-Creative Commons license, does that mean that I am violating copyright? I'm doubtful that this would be the case due to the originality requirement within U.S. copyright law:\n\n> **The Originality Requirement**\n\n> Originality is \u201cthe bedrock principle of copyright\u201d and \u201cthe very premise of copyright law.\u201d Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 347 (1991\\) (citation omitted).\n\n> \u201cTo qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author,\u201d which means that the work must be \u201cindependently created by the author\u201d and it must possess \u201cat least some minimal degree of creativity.\u201d Id. at 345 (citations omitted)\n> \n> \n> [Source](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf)\n\nThe above chapter goes on to say that:\n\n> \u201c\\[T]here is nothing remotely creative\u201d about a work that merely reflects \u201can age\\-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come to be expected as a matter of course.\u201d\n\nA line like `import math` does not strike me as very creative; rather, it is simply a required bit of code for getting Python's math library to run within a program. I doubt it would be necessary to rewrite the code as `import math as m` when `import math` works just fine.\n\nIn other words, I am wondering if the originality requirement implies that some code snippets on Stack Overflow may not be original enough to be copyrightable in the U.S. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n1. I do not believe that [this FAQ post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12527/do-i-have-to-worry-about-copyright-issues-for-code-posted-on-stack-overflow), while informative, addresses this specific question, since that post does not make any reference to the originality requirement for U.S. copyright. The answer to that post states, in part, that \"Anything that you post to Stack Overflow will be under the terms of the Creative Commons license.\" However, I believe there are cases (such as the one in my example above) where a code snippet may not qualify for a Creative Commons copyright because it fails to meet the originality requirement. In fact, such cases may be substantial, especially for beginner\\-level questions that address general programming conventions.\n2. tpg2114 pointed out in the Meta forum (where this question had originally been posted) that a detailed explanation \\+ import math or similarly non\\-original code block \\+ detailed explanation as a whole would qualify for a CC license. I think my main concern is about situations where the code provided is the widely accepted best practice for a particular language, rather than someone's original creative work. In other words, if the line of code reflects how thousands of programmers around the world would accomplish a task because it's the best way to do so, I'm just doubtful whether a copyright license would apply.\n3. tpg2114 also helped me realize that a relevant question here is: if something can't be copyrighted, does it qualify for a Creative Commons license? The following quotes from the Creative Commons website indicate that material that can't be copyrighted also can't have a Creative Commons license applied to it:\n\n> 1. \"CC licenses do not contractually impose restrictions on uses of a work where there is no underlying copyright.\"\n\n> 2. \"CC licenses are operative only when applied to material in which a copyright exists, and even then only when a particular use would otherwise not be permitted by copyright.\"\n\n> 3. \"You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses to works that are no longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the public domain.\"  \n> \n> Source for all 3 quotes\n\n4. This raises a new question: even if a post \\+ code snippet as a whole are eligible for Creative Commons (due to the originality expressed in the text, for instance), if the code snippet by itself does not qualify for copyright because it's similar to import math, would I be able to use that without releasing my own program under Creative Commons?\n\nI believe the following quote may help answer this question:\n\n> \"To constitute an adaptation \\[which would need to be licensed under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well if the source was CC\\-BY\\-SA], the resulting work itself must be considered based on or derived from the original. This means that if you use a few lines from a poem to illustrate a poetry technique in an article you\u2019re writing, your article is not an adaptation because your article is not derived from or based on the poem from which you took a few lines.\" [Source](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/4-4-remixing-cc-licensed-work/)\n\nSo in other words, if I take an excerpt like import math from a CC\\-BY\\-SA post on Stack Overflow and incorporate it into a larger project, my project may not be an adaptation of the Stack Overflow post, and therefore I may not need to release my project under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well. I say \"may not\" because (1\\) I'm not a lawyer, and (2\\) the code snippet isn't just an illustration or an example, but rather plays an important role in the functioning of my actual program.\n\n5. I also found [this helpful article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-code-snippets-violate-copyright-law-russ-pearlman/) from an attorney that addresses whether simple code snippets can be copyrighted: However, this article states that Stack Overflow posts are covered by CC\\-BY, when in fact they're covered under CC\\-BY\\-SA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are in general correct, KBurchfiel. A code snippet such as\n\n```\nimport math;\n\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nFor i := 1 to 10  \n  print i;\n\n```\n\nhas no originality, and is not protected by copyright. A post eplaining the meaning an usage of such a snippet might well be original enough to be protected by US copyright, indeed it probably would. But the code on its own would not be. Anyone could read such a post, and if s/he understood it, use the code snippet and not be in violation of copyright, not compelled to place the entire program in which such a snippet was used under a CC\\-\\=BY\\-SA license.\n\nThe creative commons people would prefer that a CC license not be applied to a publication that is not protected by copyright, and if it is so applied it is legally meaningless. But they have no legal way to enforce such a preference.\n\nA stack exchange post that consisted of **nothing** but such an uncopyrightable code snippet, with no explanation r discussion, might well be downvoted or even deleted. But that is a matter of site policy on what is a useful answer, not a matter of copyright.\n\nUsing an excerpt from a copyrighted work so small that the excerpt alone would be uncopyrightable, would probably be fair use under US law, and might well be fair dealing in UK law.\n\nSomething that is fair use does not compel the reuser to abide by the terms of a CC license, because those terms apply **only** when the content could not be reused without the CC license's permission.\n\nHowever, a code snippet does not need to be very much more original than the above examples before it becomes copyrightable. Whether it can be used via fair use rather than via the CC\\-BY\\-SA license is a very fact\\-based decision (the usual four\\-factor analysis is spelled out in 17 USC 107\\).. But if the snippet can be rewritten to express the same concepts but in a different expression, then there is no copyright issue, and again the CC license will not apply.\n\nIf the snippet is complex and original enough to be copyrightable (a fairly low bar) and it is re\\-used unchanged, under conditions where fair use does not apply, then the CC\\-BY\\-SA license's terms must be complied with for the use to be legal. That is several \"IFs\" however. The exact details of a specific case will matter in such cases, there is **not** one rule for all snippets, all posts, or all programs.",

Option D is incorrect because using a small potentially copyrighted snippet doesn't necessarily require licensing the entire project under CC-BY-SA.\n\nOption C is correct because it recognizes that while simple statements like \"import math\" lack the originality required for copyright protection, the function definition might be original enough to be copyrightable. The specific implementation of calculating a circle's area, while common, could potentially have enough creativity in its expression to meet the low bar for copyright protection.

Instead, it is done mostly piecemeal. Some of the more important laws in Massachusetts are:\n\n* In Massachusetts, the age of majority is eighteen. (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 231, section 85P)\n* In most circumstances, a contract will be invalid if one party to the contract is a minor. Massachusetts recognizes a few exceptions for necessaries and education, motor vehicle liability insurance (if age sixteen or older), and life insurance (for age 15 or older). (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 175 sections 113K and 128 and court decisions).\n* A minor may file a lawsuit against another party though a \u201cnext friend,\u201d representative, or guardian ad litem (Rules of Civil Procedure 17(b)).\n\nOther state statutes govern the voting age, tobacco purchasing age, the age at which one can work at particular kinds of jobs, consent to medical treatment, the age of consent for purposes of statutory rape laws (which are generally below age eighteen), the ages for which marriage is possible (without parental or court consent, with court consent, and with parental consent), status as a child for purposes of child support and custody cases, status as a child for purposes of tolling statutes of limitations during minority, statutes of limitations in paternity cases, and ages at which school attendance is mandatory.\n\nFederal law sets an age limit of eighteen years old to act in pornographic material and for moving someone across state lines for the purpose of having sex with them, even though the age of consent in a non\\-commercial, private context is lower.\n\nAlso, for some purposes, an eighteen year old is not an adult. For example, drinking alcohol, buying state law authorized marijuana, service in some elective offices, serving as a fiduciary in a probate estate, guardianship or conservatorship, serving as an officer or director in certain kinds of entities, termination by operation of law of statutory custodianships for minors, etc.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Section 106 of the USA copyright law lists the exclusive rights of copyrighted works. These are the rights that a software developer may grant for software they have developed. Unfortunately the exclusive rights were drafted long before software was invented and it's hard to understand how they directly relate to software.\n\nTwo of the exclusive rights are the right to `publicly perform` the work and the right to `publicly display` the work.\n\nIn the context of a source code and binary code software license what do each of these two rights convey and how are they different from each other? \n\nCitations to third party sources that address this would also be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [17 USC 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101), \"perform\" is defined as:\n\n> To \u201cperform\u201d a work means to recite, render, play, dance, or act it,\n>  either directly or by means of any device or process or, in the case\n>  of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show its images in\n>  any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\n\nTo display is:\n\n> To \u201cdisplay\u201d a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by\n>  means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or\n>  process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovis\u00adual\n>  work, to show individual images nonsequentially.\n\nThe terms \"display\" and \"perform\" do not apply to what one ordinarily does with software. Software isn't an audiovisual work so the second half of the definition of \"perform\" is inapplicable. You also can't recite, render, play, dance, or act software \\-\\- you can run / execute it, and that isn't part of what \"perform\" means. Likewise you don't display software when you execute it \u2013 you might display a thing created by software, but you don't (usually) display the software itself.\n\nThere are competing legal theories (held by judges) about how to interpret laws. One approach pays attention to the literal meaning of words, and in that approach one cannot say that running software constitutes \"performance\" or \"display\". Another approach is to decide what the outcome is supposed to be in a given case, and then stretch the meaning of words (or not) to fit that end. You might guess I don't like the latter approach: I mention this because it's not inconceivable that the meaning of \"perform\" could be stretched to mean \"execute\", given a bit more shift in judicial philosophy.\n\nBut notice that [section 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) (4\\)\\-(6\\) specifically ties \"performance\" to literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works\" as well as sound recordings, and ties \"display\" to \"literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work\". In other words, we don't need to care about \"perform\" and \"display\" because performing softward and displaying software is not a protected right anyhow, at least by the letter of the law.\n\nUsing software at all without permission is prohibited, even in the privacy of your own home. To use software, it has to be copied (which you can't legally do without permission). Copyright law is mostly irrelevant to questions of software, and what really controls what you can and cannot do is the license agreement. Because of copyright law, you can't say \"But this was an unlicensed usage so I'm not bound by those terms\", so copyright law provides the Scylla and the license provides the Charybdis.\n\n[17 USC 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117) says:\n\n> it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer\n>  program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation\n>  of that computer program provided:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) that *such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step\n>  in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a\n>  machine and that it is used in no other manner*\n\nInstalling (copying) sure enough is an essential step in utilization. This slice of code suggests that you can use the software, given copyright law. But that would be so only if you are the *owner* of a copy of the program, and one often does not buy a copy of the program, one buys a license, if you are to believe what the license says.\n\nIn [Vernor v. Autodesk](http://www.citizen.org/documents/Vernor_Autodesk_Ninth_Circuit_Opinion.pdf), the court held that customers are \"licensees of their copies of the software rather than owners\" (so Vernor did not buy his copy from an owner). One reason why Autodesk ultimately prevailed is that they asserted in the license that they retain title (they lost in the lower court, [Vernor v. Autodesk, 555 F. Supp. 2d 1164](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1457201/vernor-v-autodesk-inc/)). Similarly, the Office 2007 license says \"The software is licensed, not sold\", thus closing any arguments that you can do things not permitted by the license. The point being, if you don't own the software, you can't execute it in public, unless the license allows it.\n\nIf you do own the software, then we can turn to questions of what copyright law might allow. In order to prevent you from publicly running software, the act would have to be something prohibited by copyright law \\-\\- like making a copy. the degree of copying involved in installing / executing software would be allowed by section 107, and there is no statutory restriction on public \"use\" except that which is limited to literary, musical etc. works. At present, software is not considered to be a \"literary work\" or similar, therefore there is no statutory basis for prohibiting the public execution of a piece of software. Any such limitations must derive from the license agreement.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their ability to do so under U.S. copyright law?\n\nA) They can rely on the \"public performance\" right in copyright law to prevent public use of their software.\nB) They can use the \"public display\" right in copyright law to stop users from executing the software in public.\nC) Copyright law directly prohibits the public execution of software, so no additional measures are needed.\nD) They would need to include specific restrictions in the software license agreement to prevent public use.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Copyright law, as outlined in Section 106, does not directly address the public execution of software. The rights of \"public performance\" and \"public display\" were not designed with software in mind and don't typically apply to software execution. To restrict public use of software, a company would need to include specific terms in their license agreement. This is because software usage is primarily governed by license agreements rather than direct application of copyright law. Options A and B are incorrect because \"public performance\" and \"public display\" rights don't apply to software execution in the traditional sense. Option C is incorrect because copyright law doesn't explicitly prohibit public execution of software; such restrictions would need to come from licensing terms."

I don't know about America but I am pretty sure that most/all Western European courts would ignore such a clause and apply the local labour laws in case of a dispute because it would be considered unreasonable that a strong part (the employer) could force a weak part (the employee) to enter a contract that favoured the strong part (it is usually very expensive and difficult to engage a arbitration panel in a foreign country).\n\nAnother similar situation would be that a big company, like Apple or Google, in their terms and conditions for a consumer service prescribed that all disputes should be resolved as in the previous example. Again, I think most courts would ignore such a clause and instead apply the local consumer laws for the same reasons as in the previous example.\n\nA third example could be parents and their minor children. I have some difficulties coming up with a good example but say that a grandparent willed a large amount of money to a minor grand child and that in the current jurisdiction A, the parent's aren't allowed to access this money. The parents therefore decide to move to another country B that allows them free access to their children's money (and waste it while the child still is a minor).\n\nFinally the child returns to A and seeks compensation. I reckon a court in A would apply A's laws to the situation and conclude that the move to B benefited the parents in an extremely one\\-sided and unfair way since the child had no means to object to the decision to move, and as a consequnce was robbed on her/his money.\n\nIf the situation had been a married couple (or soon\\-to\\-be married couple) where one party X had a lot of money that the other party Y had no access to in A but free access to in B and the couple voluntarily and consensually moved from A to B, I doubt that X could seek compensation from Y for spending the money because they are both adults with full legal rights and responsibilities and if they decide to marry and live in B rather than A, X can't afterwards return to A and demand that the courts in A should overrule the laws in B.\n\nThe third example(s) is quite artificial so no need to nitpick on details...\n\nBut back to the question. If I generalize the examples above there is one strong party and one weak party. The strong party, more or less, forces the weak party to enter an agreement that heavily benefits the strong party. Such a contract would in many cases not be upheld by a court because it is considered unfair. Is this \"principle\" called something?\n\nI am interested in answers that go all the way back to the Roman legal system and up to current \"Western\" legal systems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're thinking of \"unconscionability.\"\n\nIn the United States, the general rule is that a contract provision will not be deemed unenforceable for unconscionability unless it is both procedurally and substantively unfair.\n\nA provision is considered procedurally unfair if it results from some sort of unfair asymmetry in bargaining positions. This could include situations where a party was acting under duress, had a diminished mental capacity, or unequal experience in the .\n\nA provision may be considered substantively unfair if it imposes disproportinately unfavorable terms on one party, perhaps by imposing costs far out of line with market prices, or by allocating all risk to that party.\n\nIf the agreement is not both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, it won't be voided. So the Google TOS may be procedurally unfair because Google's market position gives it disproportionate bargaining power, but because they don't really impose any serious costs on you, they aren't unconscionable. Similarly, a contract provision requiring you to give me your house if you ever forget to turn off the porch lights at night wouldn't be unconscionable if it was agreed to after lengthy negotiations between our lawyers.",

She has a 11\\-year\\-old son from a previous marriage. I looked in Google Search to find a general answer (there is no prospect yet, so there is no point in going to an immigration lawyer). She does not want to get separated from her son.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You haven't actually asked a question, but I presume that you want to know how the 11\\-year\\-old son could accompany his mother to the US if she moves to the US as the fianc\u00e9e or spouse of a US citizen.\n\nThe US Department of State has a [page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration/nonimmigrant-visa-for-a-fiance-k-1.html) about this on their site. It says:\n\n> Overview: What Is a K\\-1 Visa?\n> \n> \n> The fianc\u00e9(e) K\\-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the foreign\\-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) of a United States (U.S.) citizen. The K\\-1 visa permits the foreign\\-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) to travel to the United States and marry his or her U.S. citizen sponsor within 90 days of arrival. The foreign\\-citizen will then apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident (LPR) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Because a fianc\u00e9(e) visa permits the holder to immigrate to the U.S. and marry a U.S. citizen shortly after arrival in the United States, the fianc\u00e9(e) must meet some of the requirements of an immigrant visa. Eligible children of K\\-1 visa applicants receive K\\-2 visas.\n\nLater, it says:\n\n> Does My U.S. Citizen Fianc\u00e9(e) Need to File Separate Petitions for My Children?\n> \n> \n> No. Your eligible children may apply for K\\-2 visas based on the approval of Form I\\-129F, Petition for Alien Fianc\u00e9(e), that your U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9(e) filed on your behalf, but your U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9(e) must list the children on the petition. Separate visa applications must be submitted for each K\\-2 visa applicant, and each applicant must pay the K visa application fee.\n> \n> \n> After your marriage, your children will need to file separately from you for adjustment of status. They cannot be included on your application for adjustment of status. More information about adjustment of status is available on USCIS\u2019s website under Green Card (Permanent Residence).\n> \n> \n> Important Notice: Under U.S. immigration law, a child must be unmarried. In order to file for adjustment of status for your child following your marriage to your U.S. citizen spouse, the child\u2019s stepchild relationship with your spouse must be created before the child reaches the age of 18\\.\n\n(Emphasis and links in the original have been removed.)\n\nIf she marries before moving to the US, then the process is somewhat different, but it is still possible for minor children to be included. You can read more about that at [Immigrant Visa for a Spouse of a U.S. Citizen (IR1 or CR1\\)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration/immigrant-visa-for-spouse.html).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A divorced woman with an 11-year-old son is considering marrying a U.S. citizen and moving to the United States. Which of the following statements is correct regarding her son's immigration status?\n\nA) The son cannot accompany his mother to the U.S. until he turns 18.\nB) The U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9 must file a separate petition for the son to obtain a visa.\nC) The son can apply for a K-2 visa based on his mother's approved I-129F petition.\nD) The son automatically becomes a U.S. citizen once his mother marries the U.S. citizen.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, eligible children of K-1 visa applicants can receive K-2 visas. The U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9 does not need to file separate petitions for the children, but must list them on the I-129F petition filed for the mother. The son can then apply for a K-2 visa based on the approval of this petition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because minor children can accompany their parent to the U.S. under certain visa categories. Option B is wrong because a separate petition is not required for the son, although a separate visa application must be submitted. Option D is incorrect as the son does not automatically become a U.S. citizen upon his mother's marriage; he would need to go through the adjustment of status process after arriving in the U.S."

(see [https://www.anthonyjohnsonphotography.com/blog/what\\-you\\-need\\-to\\-know\\-using\\-event\\-images\\-for\\-commercial\\-purposes](https://www.anthonyjohnsonphotography.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-using-event-images-for-commercial-purposes)).\n\nWhen researching this in terms of videography, I am not finding much guidance. I *assume* this will follow the same rules as photography, but would like to confirm that is indeed the case.\n\nAdditionally, \"commercial use\" seems to be subjective. For example, if a company posts a video from an event and simply says\n\n> \"Our Company would like to congratulate Acme organization on your latest event! Check out their video\"\n\n...with a link to the video, does that constitute commercial use?\n\n***Note:** I'm talking about a California S\\-Corp is that matters.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"right of publicity\" is highly variable \u2013 it even has different names depending on jurisdiction. In the US, it is state\\-dependent, and what that right encompasses depends on jurisdiction. There is no such right in Oregon, there is a [statutory right in Washington](https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/7/v2/27932/01-09-2013-WA-Publicity-Laws.pdf), and a common law right in Idaho. California has both. Cross\\-jurisdictional generalizations are thus highly perilous.\n\nThat said, I am aware of no jurisdiction that treats still photographs different from moving pictures. The right centers around \"identifiable characteristics\" of an individual. Under the \"incidental use\" doctrine, permission may not be required. Hence in Washington, under [RCW 63\\.60\\.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=63.60.070), consent is not required if the use \"is an insignificant, de minimis, or incidental use\".\n\nUnder Washington's scheme, the conversation about your example ends before it starts because the right of publicity doe not exist for corporations, see [RCW 63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.010), [63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.040) (individuals and personalities, not corporations). \"Commercial use\" is irrelevant, see [\u00a750](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.050) \"An infringement may occur under this section without regard to whether the use or activity is for profit or not for profit\". [\u00a770](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=63.60.070) states exceptions, which include things that are conceptually similar to \"fair use\" (in particular, \"comment\"). The legislature did not draw a bright line, leaving that to the courts. I don't find any case law in WA that addresses an alleged infringement that \"X, which is a commercial operation, mentioned our name, without out permission\", but a straightforward reading of the statues indicates that this is permitted, even when a business congratulates a named individual.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A California-based S-Corp creates a video showcasing highlights from a recent industry event, including footage of identifiable attendees. The company posts this video on their social media with the caption: \"Congratulations to all participants at the Annual Tech Summit! Watch the highlights here.\" Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The company has clearly violated California's right of publicity laws and must obtain explicit consent from all identifiable individuals in the video.\n\nB) As long as the video doesn't directly promote the company's products or services, it falls under \"incidental use\" and doesn't require consent from individuals shown.\n\nC) The legal implications would be different if this were a photograph instead of a video, as video footage is subject to different publicity rights.\n\nD) The company's action may potentially infringe on individuals' right of publicity, but the specific circumstances and how the video is used would need to be carefully evaluated to determine if consent is required.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate because:\n\n1. California has both statutory and common law right of publicity, which applies to both photographs and videos.\n2. The right of publicity laws can be complex and vary by jurisdiction.\n3. \"Commercial use\" is not always clearly defined and can be subjective.\n4. While the company's post doesn't directly promote their products, it could still be considered commercial in nature as it's coming from a business entity.\n5. Factors such as how prominently individuals are featured, the context of the video, and whether it could be considered \"incidental use\" would need to be evaluated.\n6. The \"congratulations\" context might be viewed similarly to a \"comment\" exception in some jurisdictions, but this isn't guaranteed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation. Option B is incorrect because \"incidental use\" isn't automatically applied just because there's no direct product promotion. Option C is incorrect because publicity rights generally treat photographs and videos similarly."

Since the code is hardware related I might patent it (the entire system) outside US at some time.\n\nI want to use Github to store my code because I believe it's better protected against hacking there as opposed to self\\-host the repository (ransomware).\n\nCould a counterparty file a case to a US court and ask the source code of my invention because the hosting company (Microsoft) is US\\-based? If that would happen, would I get informed?\n\nI ask this because defending in US would be much more expensive considered the high salary level there and the translation costs and eventually travel costs.\n\nThe company is not planning to be active in the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a tangle of issues going on in this question.\n\nFirst, distribution of hardware\\-related code in commerce might very well void any right you have to patent the software and might bring it into the public domain for purposes of patent law. Publicly disclosed inventions, even if protected by copyright, are part of the \"prior art\" and can't be protected by patents.\n\nSecond, you have to disclose the material ideas in an invention in order to patent it, in your patent application. The bargain of a patent is that you get protection for about two decades in exchange for contributing your idea to the public domain when it expires.\n\nThird, usually people protect software with copyright rather than patent, although there are pros and cons to each approach.\n\nFourth, if someone knows enough about your invention to subpoena the place where you store it, you have probably disclosed too much information pre\\-application to patent it.\n\nFifth, usually the \"real\" target of a subpoena gets notice of it and an opportunity to defend against the subpoena (e.g. for improperly disclosing a trade secret) before it is carried out, but the same does not apply, for example, to National Security Letters under the Patriot Act (which are supposed to be used only in national security investigations or counter\\-terrrorism operations, but might be abused). Certainly, an ordinary person can't issue a National Security Letter for private commercial gain without corrupt government assistance.\n\nSixth, to issue a subpoena, there must be some pending case to which someone can claim the subpoena is relevant. A random person can't just subpoena information because they want to.\n\nSeventh, even if a server host isn't based in the United States, that doesn't mean that there isn't some means by which a court might assert subpoena power over information on server host. There are many legal \"hooks\" that could apply.\n\nEighth, defending an isolated subpoena isn't terribly expensive. Typically, you'd be looking at a legal fee in the $1000 to $5,000 (U.S.) range, which is much, much less than the dollar cost of patenting an invention in any country.\n\nIn short, while there are pros and cons of using a U.S. based server host, people in the IT industry routinely attach far too much importance to this fact which is only very rarely an important one legally. There are many other issues which are much more important in this fact pattern to your ultimate goal.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal implications of this decision?\n\nA) Storing the code on GitHub automatically voids any patent rights and places the invention in the public domain.\n\nB) The company can safely store their code on GitHub without risk, as long as they don't operate in the US.\n\nC) Storing code on GitHub could potentially impact patent rights and may make the information more accessible to legal discovery, but this is just one of many factors to consider.\n\nD) Using a US-based server like GitHub guarantees that the code will be subject to US court jurisdiction, making it easy for competitors to access via subpoena.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While storing code on a platform like GitHub could potentially impact patent rights (as public disclosure can affect patentability) and may make the information more accessible to legal discovery due to GitHub's US-based servers, this is just one of many factors to consider in protecting intellectual property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely storing code on GitHub doesn't automatically void patent rights or place the invention in the public domain, though it could potentially impact patentability if the code reveals key aspects of the invention.\n\nOption B is overly optimistic. Even if the company doesn't operate in the US, using a US-based service could still have legal implications.\n\nOption D is an overstatement. While US-based servers may be subject to US court jurisdiction, it doesn't guarantee easy access to the code via subpoena. There are legal protections and processes in place, and a subpoena requires a pending case and relevance to that case.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges the potential risks while also recognizing that this is just one of many factors in the complex landscape of international intellectual property protection."

You shall not sell, assign,\n>  rent, lease, distribute, export, import, or otherwise grant rights to\n>  use the Product or any part thereof to a third party.\n\nBut also this:\n\n> The Product may be incorporated into, and may incorporate itself, into\n>  software and other technology owned or controlled by third parties.\n>  The use of any such third party software or technology incorporated\n>  into the Product shall fall under the scope of this Agreement.\n\nI find these two statements contradictory:\n\n**As a third party, can I integrate their software in my own solution that I plan to resell?**\n\n---\n\nI've heard of [white label software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product), I don't know if it applies for me, if there are better solutions, or if I'm simply free to go without proper relicensing.\n\nIf it can help, I live in France and the company that owns the other software is Russian.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, you cannot do that based just on the EULA. You need to talk to the product owners and make a deal.\n\n> The Product may be incorporated into, and may incorporate itself, into software and other technology owned or controlled by third parties.\n\nAlthough the EULA mentions third parties, it is focused on what *end users* (the \"second\" parties) can do with the product. *They* can use it for free, not the third parties.\n\nThird parties who incorporate the product are not granted rights by this EULA. They are supposed to have private agreements with the product owners allowing them to incorporate it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer wants to create a SaaS (Software as a Service) product that incorporates a proprietary desktop application. The EULA of the proprietary software states: \"No Granting of Rights to Third Parties. You shall not sell, assign, rent, lease, distribute, export, import, or otherwise grant rights to use the Product or any part thereof to a third party.\" What is the correct course of action for the developer?\n\nA) The developer can freely incorporate the proprietary software into their SaaS product without any additional permissions.\n\nB) The developer must abandon the idea entirely as it's impossible to use proprietary software in a SaaS product.\n\nC) The developer should negotiate a separate agreement with the owners of the proprietary software to incorporate it into their SaaS product.\n\nD) The developer can use the software in their SaaS product as long as they don't charge for that specific component.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct course of action is for the developer to negotiate a separate agreement with the owners of the proprietary software. The EULA specifically prohibits granting rights to third parties, which would include incorporating the software into a SaaS product for resale. While the EULA mentions that the product may be incorporated into other software, this doesn't grant blanket permission for third-party use. Instead, it implies that third parties who incorporate the product should have their own agreements with the product owners. Therefore, to legally and ethically use the proprietary software in a SaaS product, the developer needs to reach out to the software owners and establish a specific agreement for this use case."

She had significant medical bills from her final illness and some credit card debt solely in her name. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's responsibility for these debts?\n\nA) John is automatically responsible for all of Mary's medical bills and credit card debt as her surviving spouse.\n\nB) John is not responsible for any of Mary's debts, as Kansas is not a community property state.\n\nC) John may be responsible for Mary's medical bills under the doctrine of necessaries, but not for her credit card debt, unless he co-signed or made purchases on the card.\n\nD) John is only responsible for Mary's debts to the extent of assets in Mary's probate estate, unless the doctrine of necessaries applies to the medical bills.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In Kansas, which is not a community property state, the surviving spouse is generally not personally responsible for the deceased spouse's sole debts. These debts are the responsibility of the deceased person's probate estate. However, there are two important considerations:\n\n1. The doctrine of necessaries in Kansas may make John responsible for Mary's medical bills, as medical care is considered a necessary item.\n\n2. For the credit card debt, John would only be responsible if he co-signed the card or made purchases with it.\n\nTherefore, John is primarily only responsible for Mary's debts to the extent of assets in her probate estate. The exception is that he may have additional liability for the medical bills under the doctrine of necessaries. This makes option D the most comprehensive and accurate answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates John's responsibility. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't account for the doctrine of necessaries or potential responsibility through the probate estate. Option C is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the extent of John's potential responsibility through the probate estate."

It is certainly a federal crime \u2013 [18 USC 875(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875). The FBI doesn't publicly disavow the possibility of an investigation in cases that you might think are hyperbolic speech. There is the case of [Elonis v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-983_7l48.pdf), who was investigated and prosecuted for \"making threats\" \u2013 focusing on the statutory language\n\n> transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication\n> containing any threat\n\nDefendant argued that *threat* \"conveys the\nnotion of an intent to inflict harm\", but the court disagreed with both prosecution and defense w.r.t. a mental state requirement in the statute. The court explores various *scienter* requirements, and concludes that there is a mens rea component to the crime (this is not a strict liability crime). The basis for the appeal is that defendant wanted an jury instruction read saying that \"the government must prove that he intended to communicate a true threat\", and what the jury was told was that\n\n> A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a\n> statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a\n> reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be\n> interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a\n> serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take\n> the life of an individual\n\nThe court rejected importation of the negligence\\-law \"reasonable person\" standard, when the question for criminal law should be \"awareness\". The standard for conviction is that \"wrongdoing must be conscious to be\ncriminal\".\n\nAs for investigations, law enforcement can investigate the *possibility* that a literal threat corresponds to an awareness in the utterer's mind that this is a real threat. When the prosecution makes the case in court, they would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that in the defendant's mind, he intended to make a true threat. Based on the snippet that you posted, there is reasonable doubt as to there being a true threat.",

US rejected both the prosecution's argument for no mental state requirement and the defense's argument for specific intent to threaten. Instead, the Court held that there must be some level of awareness on the part of the defendant that the communication would be viewed as a threat. This aligns with the principle that \"wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal.\" The Court specifically rejected the \"reasonable person\" standard (option B) as importing a negligence standard inappropriate for criminal law. Option A goes too far in requiring specific intent, while option D is explicitly rejected by the Court's ruling that this is not a strict liability crime."

I'm planning to move to a state where such ignorance of law is an excuse. Is there such a state?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not understanding a EULA is not \"not understanding the law\". A EULA isn't a law. If we assume that the EULA is part of a contract, then you may not be understanding part of a contract, but that has nothing to do with not understanding the law. \n\nIf you are a consumer, there are plenty of laws in most countries that protect you from your own stupidity when entering a contract to some degree. So \"punishing\" you for doing something against the EULA will be difficult. It is a civil contract, things might go to a civil court. But terms that you cannot understand may very well be interpreted in your favour. If the court decides that someone created a 50 page EULA to trick you into violating it, there's a good chance it will be thrown out altogether. \n\nIf there are terms that only a lawyer can understand and not a normal consumer, they will likely be thrown out. If there are terms hidden in a 50 page EULA that nobody is every going to read, they will likely be thrown it. However, that's because you couldn't be expected to understand things. If the company in question explains relevant parts of the EULA to you, then after getting the explanation you'd be unlikely to be protected by your ignorance. \n\nAnd as a last measure: For software the situation is usually that you are asked to accept a EULA in order to be allowed to install and use the software. You can always claim that you didn't accept the EULA (and nobody can prove otherwise) and be guilty of copyright infringement, so that is the absolutely worst that can happen to you. \n\nIf you are a company, things are different.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) The teenager can be criminally prosecuted for violating the EULA terms they didn't understand.\nB) EULAs are considered law, and ignorance of the law is never an excuse in any state.\nC) Consumer protection laws may offer some safeguards against unreasonable or incomprehensible EULA terms.\nD) Moving to a different state can provide legal protection against all EULA violations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Consumer protection laws in many countries, including the United States, offer safeguards against unreasonable or incomprehensible terms in contracts like EULAs, especially for consumers such as teenagers. Courts may interpret unclear terms in favor of the consumer or even throw out overly complex or hidden terms. Answer A is incorrect because EULA violations are typically civil matters, not criminal. Answer B is wrong because EULAs are contracts, not laws, and their enforceability can be limited by consumer protection regulations. Answer D is inaccurate as no state offers blanket protection against all EULA violations, and moving wouldn't change the fundamental principles of contract law and consumer protection."

The User acknowledges and agrees that by making the above requests he loses the right (if any) to withdraw from the Agreement and, where applicable, the right to withdraw from the Service Plan(s) in question.\n> \n> \n> The User further requests that the Features to be authorised under any future Service Plan he may obtain be made available to him immediately upon the Service Plan's commencement. The User acknowledges and agrees that by requesting this (and the respective Features becoming available to him) he loses the right, if any, to withdraw from the Service Plan.\n\nIt sounds like they are saying that if I sign up for the service then I am agreeing to never end it. However, there is also a section about Termination that apparently says I can end it:\n\n> 19. Termination\n> 19\\.1\\. In this article, the term \"Agreement\" means the Agreement referenced in subsection 2\\.1(a) and words such as \"herein\", \"hereto\", \"hereof\" and \"hereunder\" refer to that Agreement, unless otherwise specified.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.2\\. The Agreement between the Supplier and a Customer can only be terminated by closing the Customer's User Account. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Customer has more than one User Account, closing an account will only terminate the Agreement pertaining to that account.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.3\\. The Agreement between the Supplier and a User other than a Customer can be terminated by notice to the other Party or, if giving notice to the User is impracticable or would result in unreasonable delay or expense, then by the Supplier's ceasing all activities hereunder, except those which are necessary for providing the Service to another User, the protection or enforcement of the Supplier's or other parties' rights, freedoms or legitimate interests, the exercise of the Supplier's statutory rights or freedoms, or to comply with a legal obligation.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.4\\. To close his User Account, the Customer must log in to the account, choose \"close account\" under \"profile settings\" and confirm that he wishes the account to be closed. However, it should be appreciated that Features (including the appearance, titles and location of menus, tabs, fields, buttons, icons and other objects displayed on the Service) are subject to change, meaning that the steps required of the Customer to close his User Account may vary from time to time. The Supplier will endeavour to keep this procedure as straightforward as possible and will update the Documentation if any changes are made thereto. If the Customer has difficulties closing his User Account, he should contact the Supplier and follow its instructions.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.5\\. Either Party may close the Customer's User Account and shall by so doing be deemed to have terminated the Agreement (which, in the civil law context, means 'cancellation', not 'withdrawal'), effective upon the closure of the account, provided that: (a) if the User Account is closed by the Supplier, the Customer must be given at least a month's notice thereof (unless section 19\\.6 or 20\\.5 applies or the User Account is closed at the Customer's request); and (b) where the User Account is closed by a Party entitled to withdraw from the Agreement, such Party has failed to notify the other that by closing the User Account he is exercising his right to withdraw (which notice must be served prior to or concurrently with closing the User Account and shall result in the Agreement being deemed to have been terminated by withdrawal).\n> \n> \n> 19\\.6\\. Upon a Party's material breach of Agreement the other Party may terminate the Agreement forthwith. Without prejudice to any statutory provision as to what constitutes a material breach, such a breach hereof shall be deemed to have occurred if a Party, having breached any of his principal obligations hereunder or under the Agreement referenced in subsection 2\\.1(b), fails to discontinue or remedy such breach within 14 days (or, where exceptional circumstances render this period unreasonably short, such longer time as reasonably required) after notice from the other Party specifying the breach and requiring it to be discontinued or remedied.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.7\\. Any termination hereof will terminate all Agreements that the User may have under subsection 2\\.1(b), except that, if the User is a Customer with more than one User Account, the termination will not affect his Agreements under subsection 2\\.1(b) in relation to Service Plans whose benefits he is entitled to enjoy by reason of a User Account other than the one being closed.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.8\\. The termination of a Service Plan terminates the related Agreement under subsection 2\\.1(b).\n> \n> \n> 19\\.9\\. The Agreement under subsection 2\\.1(c) will only terminate as described in subsection 2\\.3(c) (with automatic re\\-establishment of contract) or upon the relevant Organization being closed, and is incapable of being terminated otherwise. Instructions on how to close an Organization are provided in the Documentation.\n\nWith this context, what is the plain English meaning of the Forfeiture of the right to withdrawal section?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Section 20 \\- Consumer withdrawal](https://toggl.com/track/legal/terms/) has more information.\n\nThe '[right to withdraw](https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/online-marketing/online-sales/right-of-withdrawal/)' refers to a consumers ability to ask for their money to be returned, for say faulty goods, and there is usually a time limit.\n\nThe toggl clause 4 states that if the customer requests that the features of a product are *activated immediately*, then the right to withdraw is forfeited, as the customer has already received the benefits from the product.",

Are there examples of such behavior?\n\nWhat are the mechanisms in place in US law to prevent people from creating a company to attract investors with the intent of filing for bankruptcy as a strategy to not repay their debt?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can bankruptcy be used as strategy to avoid paying back investors? Are\n> there examples of such behavior?\n\nIn the United States, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is frequently used as a way to cancel equity investments and to reduce or eliminate long term bond debt (especially subordinated bond investments) by senior management, in an effort to keep the business operating as a going concern and keep their elite senior executive jobs, and the jobs of many subordinate employees and contractors of the business.\n\nPretty much every single business bankruptcy reduces the amount of return that investors in the company can receive from it (although there are rare cases when investors can be compensated in full in an orderly disposition of a company's assets but bankruptcy is filed to prevent a fire sale of assets in a disorderly fashion that would hurt investors, or hurt them more than the alternative outcome).\n\nA key factor here is the segregation of ownership and management in most big businesses. A large equity owner in a company is in a poor position to defraud other equity owners in bankruptcy, however, and equity owners are behind debt investors in priority in bankruptcy, so it is also hard for the equity owner to use bankruptcy to defraud debt investors without hurting the large equity owner.\n\nIn some ways, this is a variant on a [leveraged buy\\-out by management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp), because usually, in a big business bankruptcy, a key step is for management to secure a third\\-party lender to the bankruptcy debtor (G.E. Capital was the dominant lender in this market for many years), to finance the continued operations of the business until a plan could be put in the place to reorganize the company with less debt and none of its old equity investors.\n\nThis is almost never a strategy of the company at the outset. It is one that is chosen once it becomes clear that its business model has ceased to be viable with the amount of leverage that the business has. Often, in such a plan, some long term debt that is not subordinated is converted to equity, although that equity is usually worth less than the original equity investment of the investors in the firm.\n\nTypically, this strategy is used when a company with a large initial capital investment is in a market where it can still make a profit relative to its variable operating costs from the revenues it can secure in current market conditions, but can no longer afford to service its long term debt that was used to make that large initial capital investment (e.g. in a building or factory) that has decreased in value because the products made with that investment are no longer as valuable as they used to be, or because, for example, patents expired but the long term debt wasn't paid off during the terms of the patents.\n\nFor example, many U.S. coal mining companies in the U.S. have recently had Chapter 11 bankruptcies. These companies made large investments in coal mining operations that were economically sensible when coal was worth more and alternatives to coal were not economically viable. But, when renewable energy became cheaper with changes in technology, and environmental requirements made coal fired power plants more expensive, the market price for coal collapsed and those companies could no longer support the debt that made it possible to conduct the mining operations that these companies had incurred. In a reorganized fashion, some of these companies could continue to be viable with lower sales volume and lower coal prices since they now only had to pay current operating costs and not obligations to investors in those companies.\n\n> What are the mechanisms in place in US law to prevent people from\n> creating a company to attract investors with the intent of filing for\n> bankruptcy as a strategy to not repay their debt?\n\nThis strategy doesn't really make sense as a plan from the issuing company's point of view, it only makes sense if the person promoting the scheme has some way to extract value from the investment made by the investors.\n\nThe company itself that issued the securities (typically stock or corporate bonds) in which the investor invested also isn't a suitable target of litigation because the company that issued the securities simply doesn't have the assets to pay damages to the investors.\n\nIf one can show that the company incurred debt with an intent not to repay it, and is followed by transfers out of the company without receiving substantially equivalent value in exchange to some third party behind the scheme, this can be regulated by [fraudulent transfer laws](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=992ea8e4-9d59-a6f9-acf2-210781e76a14&forceDialog=0). *See* Section 4(a)(2\\) in the Uniform Act numbering although individual states adopting the act as state law invariably number the sections differently).\n\nThis conduct can also be used to seek securities fraud liability or common law fraud liability from the persons other than the company itself (such as its officers or brokers or promoters of some other kind) involved in promoting the company.\n\n**Footnote Re Importance Of A Formal Bankruptcy**\n\nThe bankruptcy code component of this analysis isn't a particularly important part of the strategy.\n\nA limited liability entity can dissolve itself, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors of all of its assets, or be placed in a receivership, outside of bankruptcy, with similar effect, since the discharge of debts is not relief associated with a Chapter 7 liquidation of a limited liability entity (although debts can be reduced or eliminated as part of a Chapter 11 plan so long as the creditors are at least as well off as they would be in a Chapter 7 liquidation or otherwise consent to the plan).",
