            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose there is a private business whose business model is based on the *trust* of its customers that it has not been served with a secret government subpoena. That is, if the customers knew (or could infer) that such a subpoena has been served, they will likely be customers no longer.\n\nThe business regularly updates its [warrant canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) to maintain the customers' trust.\n\nNow, suppose the business has actually *been* served with a secret government subpoena, but elects to falsely maintain the warrant canary anyway. Or, rather, continuing to maintain the canary is actually part of the government order.\n\nShould the breach of trust be unveiled by the customers and the damage be quantifiable, would the customers have a case, possibly class action?\n\nMy doubt is that the business could possibly have this defense that it was acting at the orders of the government (which cannot be liable). Will that defense shield the business from any liability?\n\nEssentially, what the question drives at is whether there is any sense in a warrant canary in principle. If a business is *never* liable for lying in its warrant canary, then how can one possibly trust a warrant canary at all?\n\nRelated: [What is the legal status of \"warrant canaries\"?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/268/what-is-the-legal-status-of-warrant-canaries)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warrant canary has always been a somewhat legally questionable technique. Australia, for one, has made them illegal in certain kinds of cases, passing laws that forbid disclosing the \"existence or non\\-existence\" of certain types of warrants issued to a subject. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary#Usage).)\n\nHowever, in the US, an order to falsely update an existing canary would probably fall afoul of the prohibition on compelled speech stated in *West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette* (the 2nd flag salute case) and *Wooley v. Maynard* (state cannot mandate a motto on a license plate that some find offensive). The case of *New York Times Co. v. United States* (the Pentagon papers case) might also be relevant.\n\nHowever, before asking if a government order would shield a business from liability for falsely updating a canary, one must fist ask if they would have any liability in any case. It is generally not a crime, or even a tort, to make a false statement unless it is under circumstances where the statement constitutes fraud.\n\nTo prevail, a plaintiff A would need to show that it reasonably relied on the statement from B, and suffered measurable damage from that reliance. It would also need to show that the person or firm B falsely updating the canary knew or should have known that the statement was likely to be relied on, and possibly that B intended A to rely on the false statement to A's detriment.\n\nIt is hard to see what actionable damage to A this might include, as being discovered in unlawful acts is not actionable.\n\nIf a court did rule that A was damaged by B's false statement, then the question of a government order might be raised. In general it is a defense against a civil lawsuit that one was complying with a valid law or government regulation or order. Of course, this could raise the further question of whether such an order was valid, which might have different results in different jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn short, this is a situation untested in any actual court case that I know of, and not highly likely to be tested any tiem soon. It involves several debatable issues, and any firm answer at this point must be speculation.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A technology company uses a warrant canary to assure customers it has not received any secret government subpoenas. The company is served with such a subpoena and ordered by the government to continue updating its warrant canary as if nothing had changed. Some customers later discover the deception and sue the company. Which of the following is most likely to be a successful legal argument for the company's defense?\n\nA) The company was complying with a government order and cannot be held liable for following the law.\nB) Updating the warrant canary is protected free speech under the First Amendment.\nC) The customers cannot prove they suffered measurable damages from relying on the false warrant canary.\nD) Warrant canaries are legally questionable and therefore not binding on the company.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options touch on relevant legal concepts, option C is likely the strongest defense. To succeed in a lawsuit, plaintiffs typically need to demonstrate they suffered quantifiable damages as a result of reasonably relying on the false statement. It would be challenging for customers to prove concrete harm from the company's deception about the warrant canary.\n\nOption A could be a potential defense, but its success would depend on the court's view of the order's validity, which is uncertain. Option B misapplies First Amendment principles, as the issue isn't about protected speech but rather potential fraud. Option D, while noting the ambiguous legal status of warrant canaries, doesn't directly address the company's liability in this specific case."

Nanoblocks are about one\\-quarter of the size of LEGO blocks.\n\nIs it true that Nanoblock is not in violation of LEGO's patents because their copycat product is incompatible with and is not the same size as LEGO's product?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two very different laws in play here. Patent rights and trademarks.\n\n**One cannot violate a patent on Lego bricks, because they have all run out a long time ago.**\n\nThe [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Group#Trademark_and_patents) has a relevant section on this. Therefore it is very legal from a patent point of view to produce compatible bricks (and there are several companies that do).\n\nMore complicated is the trademark aspect. Lego tries to sue everyone that attempts to sell its bricks with the statement \"lego compatible\" or something similar, and the use of the name \"Lego\" as a name for the bricks in general is contested (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so), even though that is quite common in colloquial speech.\n\nThe [Canadian supreme court ruled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mega-bloks-wins-scoc-ruling-on-lego-trademark-1.555292)\n\n> \"Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now\\-expired patents\"\n\nBottom line: You may produce lego\\-compatible bricks, but you must not name them like that.

LEGO's patents on their brick design have expired, so it's legal to produce compatible bricks from a patent perspective. However, LEGO still holds trademarks on their name and branding. The company can produce LEGO-compatible bricks but must be careful not to infringe on LEGO's trademarks by using the LEGO name or implying official compatibility in their marketing or packaging. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while patent concerns are not an issue, trademark concerns still exist. Option B is incorrect because incompatibility is not necessary to avoid patent infringement, as the patents have expired. Option D is incorrect because the expiration of LEGO's patents means other companies can indeed produce similar interlocking brick toys."

I would like also to use the image in a commercial talk I am to give. I searched online and the suggestion is to read the individual license. In this case [https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive\\-distrib/1\\.0/license.html](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html) says only:\n\n* I grant arXiv.org a perpetual, non\\-exclusive license to distribute this article.\n* I certify that I have the right to grant this license.\n* I understand that submissions cannot be completely removed once accepted.\n* I understand that arXiv.org reserves the right to reclassify or reject any submission.\n\nWhat is the situation with using an image from a paper licensed in this way in a commercial setting (with suitable attribution)?\n\n(I have emailed one of the authors to ask them directly but they have left their previous employer.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me give some nuance, if not a definitive answer, since I'm not a lawyer. \n\nFirst, ArXiv holds only a license, not the underlying copyright. You need to contact the copyright holder to get permission (and a license). That may be the authors themselves, or a journal if they have assigned the copyright to it.\n\nHowever, it might be more complicated, especially for commercial use. Since the authors of papers frequently use images created by others, sometimes correctly and sometimes not, you should explore a bit more. Perhaps the paper itself will have a citation of the figure and an indication of its source, and hence of its copyright holder. In that case, the authors may not be able to help you, since, at best, they probably also hold just a license. \n\nHowever, for some *academic* purposes and in some jurisdictions an academic work can be permitted to use a figure (or other things) without regard to copyright. This is called *fair use* and it varies around the world. But a commercial work won't be able (probably) to depend on the same exception to copyright law and you still have to find the copyright holder. \n\nMoreover, even if the authors have a proper license (explicitly), that license (a) may not be transferrable and (b) might be for non\\-commercial use only. \n\nAcademic copyright holders often (not universally) issue their work under a fairly permissive license but that is restricted to non\\-commercial use. Since they hold the copyright they can also issue additional licenses against it if they like, but need to do so explicitly. \n\nUltimately, to use the work of others you have to deal with the copyright question. It is further complicated by the fact that a figure may be considered under the law as a \"complete work\" even if it appears within another work. So, replicating it is less likely to fall under fair use rules \\- though they vary. \n\n---\n\nAnd, there is one other question you should ask yourself. Is your talk really a commercial use? If you are an academic, it may be a subtle question, or not.",

This is because:\n\n1. ArXiv.org only holds a non-exclusive license to distribute the article, not the underlying copyright. They cannot grant permission for commercial use.\n\n2. The image is not in the public domain simply because it's published on arXiv.org (ruling out option A).\n\n3.

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 and subsequent Federal Reserve rules apply to gift cards and similar stored value products.\n\n2.

The business should carefully evaluate whether their system falls under gift card regulations or qualifies for exemptions based on its specific features.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even if withdrawals are allowed at any time, the system may still be subject to some regulations.

I'd like to be able to register it as a normal roadworthy vehicle when the project is complete, but the following circumstances are unusual.\n\nThe previous owner (hereafter Owner B) purchased the car at auction from the estate of the original owner (Owner A) upon Owner A's decease. **Owner B obtained the title (signed by executor of the estate, but never by Owner B), bill of sale, and a death certificate.**\n\nUpon purchasing the vehicle, which had transmission issues and was not drivable, *Owner B did not register the car or sign a title*. It has essentially been in storage since the purchase, and has not been taken off Owner B's property.\n\n**If I purchase the vehicle from Owner B with the paperwork mentioned, is it possible to register the vehicle?**\n\nTo my knowledge, the car has lived its entire life in the state of Missouri, which is where all future work and titling would be done.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Normally, in addition to the documentation required one would need either \"Letters Testamentary\" or \"Letters of Administration\" to establish that the executor had the authority to transfer the car (unless the car was originally titled in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or with a transfer on death title, with the executor listed). \n\nMerely being listed in a Will as an executor without having a court with probate jurisdiction issuing Letters does not give the executor the authority to transfer the car. Also, the Letters must often be certified by the clerk of the court reasonably close in time to the date of the transfer as Letters expire when the estate is closed.",

Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration are crucial because they establish that the executor had the legal authority to transfer the car from the deceased owner's estate. Without these documents, the executor's signature on the title may not be considered valid for transferring ownership.\nD) While the title signed by the executor is necessary, it's not sufficient without proof of the executor's authority to sign it.\n\nThe question tests the understanding that in complex title transfer situations, especially involving deceased owners and estate executors, additional legal documentation is required beyond just the vehicle title and standard sale documents."

As explained in the documentation, police involvement typically indicates a potential criminal matter. In this scenario, the actions of the host family could potentially be seen as criminal negligence or child abandonment. However, the police themselves do not make this determination. Instead, they would likely refer the case to Child Protective Services (CPS) and/or the prosecutor's office for a thorough investigation. These agencies would then determine if there are grounds for criminal charges or other interventions to protect the minor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate arrest without investigation is unlikely in such a complex situation. Option B is incorrect because deportation is not an immediate police action and would involve immigration authorities. Option D is incorrect because the potential abandonment of a minor is not purely a civil matter and warrants investigation by appropriate authorities."

He does not need the easements to access it.\n\nWould it be possible to have the easements removed without his consent?\n\nSome extra details I thought might be helpful are below.\n\nBoth easements are in a revocable living trust.\n\nThe description of the easements, found in the corrective trustees deed, is extremely vague as far as what it's purpose is.

An easement is a property interest that cannot be extinguished unilaterally by the property owner, even if it's rarely used or the beneficiary has alternative access. To remove the easements, the property owner must obtain the agreement of the beneficiary (the party holding the easement rights). This often involves negotiation and potentially financial compensation, as people typically don't give up property rights for free. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest unilateral actions by the property owner, which is not legally permissible for removing easements. Option B is incorrect because the trust status doesn't affect the fundamental nature of easement rights or allow for their unilateral removal."

The Shard later took out a private prosecution against him.\n\nI am confused though. Why was it a private prosecution, yet in the video he says it was a civil case, which resulted in him getting sentenced to six months, yet he never received a criminal record for his actions. I thought it was impossible to go to prison for a civil offence, and much less end up in a criminal court! I guess there is some trick that is only possible with private prosecutions?\n\nI was also under the impression that there was not a Law against what he did, especially as it was a simple trespass, he left without a struggle when the police came to avoid a breech of the peace etc... Especially when other YouTubers, such as Ally Law, frequently do similar actions and never get arrested.\n\nLastly, how can one be given a caution and then punished again through a private prosecution, outside of a Civil court? Surely there is a Double Jeopardy protection against this?\n\nI thought I had a grip on the basics of Law before this video came to my attention!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He was jailed for breaching an injunction imposed on the Shard in 2018 which was intended to prevent anyone from climbing it, according to [a news report from the Guardian at the time](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/21/shard-freeclimber-jailed-for-24-weeks-for-breaching-injunction-george-king). The actual offence he committed was contempt of court which is a criminal offence.\n\nDouble jeopardy does not apply here because the crime he was cautioned for was not the same crime he was prosecuted for.\n\nIt appears there was no precedent set, prior to this private prosecution, about whether or not someone could be jailed for breaching an injunction in this manner, as opposed to merely being fined, etc. Obviously, since he has been jailed, people in the future will be reluctant to copy his behaviour and a deterrent has been set.",

The climber was indeed jailed, but not for trespassing. He was prosecuted for breaching an injunction that had been imposed on The Shard in 2018 to prevent such climbs. This breach constituted contempt of court, which is a criminal offense. The Shard pursued this as a private prosecution, resulting in a 24-week jail sentence. This case did not involve double jeopardy, as the initial police caution and the subsequent prosecution were for different offenses. The case was criminal in nature, not civil, which is why a prison sentence was possible. This prosecution also set a precedent for how such injunction breaches could be punished in the future."

Similar to a finders fee for a lawyer bringing a case to a larger more capable firm but for a nonlawyer, so a legally viable alternative or options within the the extent of law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is unclear, but only minimally. There is a [trio of cases](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/epic-systems-corp-v-lewis/) now being considered by SCOTUS, pertaining to the [Federal Arbitration Act](http://www.legisworks.org/congress/68/publaw-401.pdf) and its interaction with the National Labor Relations Act. Since the federal government doesn't get to totally write the law for everything, the FAA applies only to transactions covered by the Commerce Clause. As a result of [Allied\\-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/513/265/), that would include a state\\-internal suit against a local exterminator.\n\nIn general, the FAA states that an award can be vacated in US courts if the arbitration itself is corrupt (e.d. fraudulent), but not if the subject matter if the dispute is about fraud. Federal law preempts state law ([Southland Corp. v. Keating](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/465/1/case.html), 465 U.S. 1\\), so mandatory arbitration clauses are enforceable (unless the contract itself is invalid, e.g. duress, unconscionability). A state may not, however, declare that mandatory arbitration clauses render a contract unconscionable ([AT\\&T Mobility v. Concepcion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/333/opinion.html), 563 U.S. 333\\), as California had done in [Discover Bank. Laster v.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the consumer's options?\n\nA) The consumer can easily bypass the arbitration clause by proving the company engaged in fraud, as this nullifies any arbitration agreement.\n\nB) State laws can be enacted to declare mandatory arbitration clauses unconscionable, allowing the class action to proceed in court.\n\nC) The consumer is likely bound by the arbitration clause, but can still pursue individual arbitration against the company for the deceptive practices.\n\nD) The Federal Arbitration Act doesn't apply to this situation because it's a purely state-level consumer dispute with no interstate commerce involved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, mandatory arbitration clauses are generally enforceable due to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which preempts state law. The Supreme Court has ruled that states cannot declare such clauses unconscionable (ruling out option B). While fraud in the arbitration process itself can be grounds for vacating an arbitration award, the subject matter of the dispute being about fraud does not invalidate the arbitration clause (ruling out option A). The FAA likely applies even to local disputes due to the broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause (ruling out option D). Therefore, the consumer is likely bound by the arbitration clause but can still pursue their claim through individual arbitration."

For example, think the [muppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets), a famous set of characters which are famous, representative of personalities, but are **not real living human beings**.\n\nIf a muppet were to be subjected to scrutiny, is the muppet responsible? Is the ventriloquist responsible? Who answers to a muppet if a muppet may not be the work or being of one person?\n\nAlas, what are laws that subject famous characters/personalities/etc. which are not immediate, living humans? Some people run super famous Twitter/social media accounts that represent some visage, likeness or purported being, that of which may not actually be subjected to a real, specific human. As an example, think of a social media account of someone like Elmo, The Annoying Orange, or etc.\n\nMany people can run the account and as such their image or likeness can vary to the public.\n\nWho is responsible though? Assuming we already established that a non\\-human can still be a public figure or celebrity, who is ultimately responsible for the actions of a fictional or semi\\-fictional person?\n\nAlso, what about a smart agent or robot that does machine learning and threatens to kill a major figure, like an official? The programmer didn't do this \\-\\- the program \"learned\" words and made that threat via social media/etc. In short, the program COULD in theory be wholly responsible.\n\nThis same analogy can apply to a semi\\-fictional figure that may not be wholly dictated by the control or means of a human being, or the likeness of one human being either.\n\nBy \"semi\" I mean someone who can partially represent themselves in the form of another likeness/entity they may have made up, but do not fully represent their real personality to such likeness? For example, I could pretend to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and use part of my personality to do so, but do not consider myself to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and do not associate my real image with this fictional, famous character. Am I fully responsible for \"Joe Shaqqa\" if I do not consider myself to be Joe Shaqqa, and do not use my complete likeness to represent them, nor only do so myself?\n\nHow does the law work with legal issues directed toward fictional or semi\\-fictional figures?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fictional characters are the creation of a person or persons (either natural or legal persons).

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An individual purchases a server from their former employer, complete with receipts. The ex-employer claims they need time to remove their data from the server, but after a month, they're still requesting more time. The buyer wants to regain possession of the server. Which legal action would be most appropriate in this situation, assuming there's no superseding contractual agreement?\n\nA) File a lawsuit for breach of contract\nB) Pursue criminal charges for theft\nC) File for relief under detinue or replevin in small claims court\nD) Submit a formal complaint to the Better Business Bureau\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action in this scenario is to file for relief under the common law principles of detinue or replevin, likely in small claims court. This is because:\n\n1. Detinue and replevin are legal remedies specifically designed for recovering wrongfully detained property.\n2. Small claims court is suitable for this type of dispute, as it typically involves a lower monetary value and can be resolved more quickly than in higher courts.\n3. There's no mention of a specific contract being breached, so option A is not the best choice.\n4. Criminal charges (option B) would be excessive, as this appears to be a civil matter.\n5. The Better Business Bureau (option D) doesn't have legal authority to resolve property disputes.\n\nBefore taking legal action, the buyer should make a clear demand for the server's return. If the ex-employer continues to withhold the server without a valid legal basis, pursuing relief through detinue or replevin in small claims court is the most appropriate course of action."

According to the documentation, once the book author is aware that the text was used without a valid license or permission, they no longer have the right to use it. Continuing to publish would be knowingly infringing on copyright. The book author cannot claim \"innocent infringement\" as they are now on notice about the invalid license. The most appropriate action is to immediately withdraw the book and remove the cited text to avoid potential legal consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the book author would still be liable for copyright infringement, regardless of the article author's actions. Option B is not advisable, as ignoring the confession could lead to continued infringement. Option D, while showing due diligence, still involves continued publication of potentially infringing material during the investigation, which could lead to legal issues."

He obviously needs to appeal, but on what grounds? The trial was conducted properly (we presume), the evidence that would clear his name simply hadn't been uncovered.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can be tried again for the same offence; double jeopardy only applies if you are found \"not guilty\". It is not uncommon for appeals courts to invalidate a guilty verdict *and* require a retrial. Similarly a mistrial can result in a new trial at the prosecution's discretion. In addition, some jurisdictions have abolished double jeopardy for crimes like murder (e.g. New South Wales, Australia). \n\nNew evidence coming to light can be grounds for appeal \\- in the case of the Fugitive where there have been no appeals this is one avenue open to Kimble.\n\nWhere appeals have been exhausted; this is more problematic. One of the principles of justice is that there should be finality to the verdict. Kimble has gone from presumed innocent to presumed guilty \\- enough evidence would need to be gathered to demonstrate a clear and unambiguous miscarriage of justice. This may not be within the purview of the judicial branch of government \\- he may need a pardon from the executive. In real life (as opposed to Hollywood) Dr. Kimble is still in serious trouble.\n\nIn some jurisdictions there may be some \"innocence\" laws that can allow review of convictions outside the appeal process.\n\nNotwithstanding, Dr. Kimble is going away for a long time for \"escaping lawful custody\" anyway.",

Dr. Kimble can appeal his conviction based on new evidence coming to light, which is a valid ground for appeal. However, if appeals have been exhausted, the situation becomes more complex.

If you are in doubt of something being CI, ask your client. Technically you should consider any information provided for the scope of your consulting work \"de\\-facto\" CI.\n\nBut they can't arbitrarily say something is confidential. For example if Bob was provided information about the hamburgers being a beef product, that is public knowledge. McDonalds couldn't later say that it was CI and seek relief under the agreement. Technically anything that is known to the general public or publicly disclosed by the company is no longer considered CI.\n\nBut your first example may have some caveats. Bob could probably *not represent himself as having been employed by McDonalds*, since he was actually employed by the staffing agency as a consultant.

Brady Disclosure gets its name from the landmark SCOTUS case *Brady v.

And because a conviction should only happen when the truth is so compelling that it is beyond a reasonable doubt, the prosecution's evidence is scrutinized much more rigorously than the defendant's.

Under the America Invents Act (AIA), the U.S. switched to a first-to-file system. This means that even if Company X developed the technology independently and simultaneously, Company Y's earlier filing gives them patent rights. However, the AIA introduced a narrow provision called Prior User Rights. This allows a company that was using a process before another company patented it to retain limited rights to continue using that process. These rights are restricted \u2013 the company cannot expand or transfer them. Options A and C are incorrect because they reflect pre-AIA rules.

It seems that taking the \u00a3100 would be foolish, knowing how strict the GDPR rules could be, but I am somewhat out of my depth on next step. Could I write to the company pointing out that they still haven't answered my query as the first step and force them to concede specifically that it was not necessarily held? Is further compensation unlikely and should I simply accept the offer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first thing to notice is that the \u00a3100 offer appears to be a legit offer. That is to say, accepting it will create a binding agreement between you and the company. There is no reason yet for the company to believe that you have suffered more damages, and you do have reasonable options to prevent them (ask bank for a new card \\- that's not going to cost you \u00a3100\\).\n\nThe second observation is that the GDPR does not really affect the first observation. The GDPR itself does not give rise to additional civil claims or special damages. Yes, the GDPR states that the company is in the wrong, but parties can make agreements how a wrongful deed is made right again. And their offer appears to do so.\n\nNote that accepting the offer does not take away your continuing GDPR rights. It just affects their past error. You can still ask them whether they have your card data on file today.",

After a formal inquiry, the company offers a \u00a3100 compensation with a settlement agreement. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation under GDPR?\n\nA) Accepting the \u00a3100 offer would prevent the individual from exercising any future GDPR rights against the company.\n\nB) The GDPR automatically entitles the individual to significant additional compensation beyond the \u00a3100 offer.\n\nC) The \u00a3100 offer, if accepted, would only settle past issues related to the breach but would not affect ongoing GDPR rights.\n\nD) The company's failure to explain why they retained credit card information invalidates their \u00a3100 compensation offer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, accepting the \u00a3100 offer would create a binding agreement to settle the past issues related to the data breach. However, this does not affect the individual's ongoing GDPR rights. They can still inquire about current data practices and exercise their rights under GDPR going forward. The offer is meant to address the specific incident of the breach and unauthorized data retention, not to limit future GDPR-related actions or inquiries. Options A and D are incorrect as they misinterpret the scope and implications of the offer. Option B is also incorrect because GDPR itself does not automatically entitle individuals to additional compensation beyond what's offered, especially if no further damages are demonstrated."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My brother and I inherited a house from my mother. She was sick for about a year and a half before her death and he managed her care and finances during that time. He is local and I live about 300 miles away. He has been mostly unemployed and she supported him for more than 20 years, paying his rent and most of his expenses. I have been independent for more than 30 years. A week before her death, he moved in with her expecting to take care of her for awhile. I visited as often a I could but I have a family to take care of. When Mom died she left her estate to us 50/50 including her house. My brother and uncle were co\\-executors. It's been a year, he still lives there (I don't have a problem with that) and we are both on the title of the house now. He wants to continue living there and pay off the mortgage (about $10,000\\) with his share of the inheritance (which isn't much). While the will is being settled, (long story) I have loaned him 2 mortgage payments. Recently he told me that Mom \"WANTED\" him to have the house but that isn't in writing and doesn't match with conversations I had with her. Now that we both own the house, he is hinting that I owe half the expenses. I can't and won't do that. He doesn't want to sell and can't afford to buy me out. I don't want this to come between us because we've always been close but he has always been \"entitled\" and I don't want to be taken advantage of. What are my liabilities and responsibilities concerning my share of the house? If we sell the house, can he claim more than half of the proceeds and how does that work? Can he deduct expenses and mortgage payments from my share? MANY THANKS\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Of course you have to pay half the cost. Just as your brother has to pay rent at the market rate. \n\nIf rent at market rate is $1,000 and the monthly cost (taxes, maintenance etc.) is $400, then your brother should pay $1,000 a month, the $400 is paid from rental income, and the $600 profit shared, so you get $300 and he gets $300\\. In total he would pay $700, $400 going to the cost, $300 in your pocket. \n\nInstead you have been nice to him and let him live there for paying the cost ($400\\). If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can pay more. Remind him that he isn\u2019t paying rent, so if he wants all cost precisely shared then he must pay rent. \n\nIf you have no problem with him living there (he\u2019s your brother after all) then you should also take into account that he is paying off the mortgage, once the house is sold.",

This approach recognizes that both siblings equally own the property, while also accounting for the financial contributions made by the resident sibling.

Brain death is considered the legal and medical standard for determining when organ donation can proceed. This is because brain death represents the \"total and irreversible loss of all brain function\" and is the circumstance under which vital organ donation most commonly occurs. Clinical death alone is not sufficient, as it can potentially be reversed with prompt medical intervention.

My parents and I immigrated to the US when was a small child. My parents were naturalized before I became an adult, and thus I gained US citizenship automatically through derived citizenship (INA 320\\). I've since obtained a US passport, and have traveled back to China using the US passport several times, applying for and receiving a Chinese visa. I've always read that since China doesn't recognize dual citizenship, once I become a US citizen, I lose my Chinese citizenship.\n\nRecently, I was reading the actual wording of the Chinese Nationality Law, and realized that maybe under the actual wording of the law, I may technically still be a Chinese national under Chinese law. Specifically, Article 9 says:\n\n> Any Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality.\n\nSince I acquired US citizenship automatically through derived citizenship when my parents naturalized, I myself did not technically go through the process of naturalization, nor was my acquisition of US citizenship done of my own free will.\n\nI also know that Article 3 of the Chinese Nationality Law says:\n\n> The People's Republic of China does not recognize dual nationality for any Chinese national.\n\nI assume that just means that if I am in China, they will not recognize that I am also a US national, but does not actually mean I lose my Chinese nationality.\n\nI have heard that practically, China treats people who have entered on foreign passports as having given up the Chinese nationality, but in this case, the text of the law seems to imply that I haven't actually lost my Chinese nationality.\n\nDoes that mean that maybe I get a Chinese passport? I know mine from when I was a child expired a long time ago, but can I just go to the consulate and apply for a new one?\n\nI did some searching online, and I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this as a path to holding both US and Chinese citizenship, as I'm sure Chinese national children gaining derived US citizenship from their parents after they move to the US as a minor is pretty common.

The consulates or immigration authorities only issue a travel document to such persons, until they reach 18 years of age. Once they become adult, a passport would only be issued upon the presentation of the renunciation of the other nationality (unless no renunciation process is available).\n\nNow, if this person is living in China when they become adult and they do not want to travel abroad, they do not have to renounce the other citizenship to e.g. renew their national ID card, register for social insurance or seek employment.\n\nEven if you obtained another nationality voluntarily, resumption of Chinese nationality is also an option available that in practice is routinely granted (barring criminal histories etc.).\n\nThe Chinese consulate would not issue you a passport, but may issue you a travel document if you present a renunciation of your U.S. citizenship. They may process it as if you never lost the Chinese nationality, or they may consider it a case of resumption.",

For adults who may have retained Chinese nationality despite acquiring U.S. citizenship as minors, the Chinese consulate would not issue a passport outright. Instead, they might issue a travel document, but only if the individual presents proof of renunciation of their U.S. citizenship. This approach aligns with China's general policy of not recognizing dual nationality while also acknowledging the complexities of cases where citizenship was acquired automatically or as a minor."

Since it only implies that the notice of alibi requirement is constitutional, but the notice only says the court MAY exclude the alibi if it has not been disclosed.\n\nThe goal of the statue as read seems to be more expediency and efficiency of proceedings though and the argument being that alibis can be easily falsified, here assuming that witnesses can be coerced/bought/or just sympathetic (mom in one case where this was raised) but there is evidence that is quiet hard to falsify such as public video recordings or witness testimony from large amounts of unrelated people.\n\nIs it realistic that a court would exclude such testimony due to it not being disclosed timely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, this happens with some regularity.\n\nIn the absence of timely notice, courts should generally permit the alibi testimony, assuming that prosecution will not be surprised or prejudiced by the late notice and that the lack of notice was not the result of bad faith.\n\nBut when that's not the case, courts can and definitely do exclude alibi testimony:\n\n* [*State v. Reed*, 155 Ohio App.3d 435 (2003\\)](https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2003/2003-Ohio-6536.pdf) (\"The record demonstrates that the prosecution was unaware of Reed\u2019s alibi, and it had no opportunity to investigate the claim. Thus, the state would have been prejudiced by Reed\u2019s unanticipated alibi testimony, and Reed has made no showing of excusable neglect or good cause for his delay in providing notice. In light of Manns\u2019s failure to appear at trial and Reed\u2019s last\\-minute change in trial strategy, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the alibi evidence.\"\n* [*United States v. Davis*, 40 F.3d 1069, 1076 (10th Cir. 1994\\)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-davis-608) (\"The better practice is generally to hear an alibi witness.

LEXIS 3356 (Apr. 25, 2006\\)\n\nAssuming the government is subject to reciprocal discovery obligations, a defendant's due\\-process rights do not preclude the exclusion of alibi witnesses as a sanction for failing to give timely notice.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant in a criminal trial failed to provide timely notice of an alibi defense as required by state law. On the day of the trial, the defendant attempts to introduce testimony from his mother, who claims he was at home with her at the time of the alleged crime. The prosecution objects, citing lack of notice. Under which circumstances is the court MOST likely to allow the alibi testimony?\n\nA) If the defendant can prove the alibi evidence was only recently discovered\nB) If the mother's testimony is corroborated by video evidence from a home security system\nC) If the defendant argues that excluding the testimony violates his constitutional rights\nD) If the prosecution admits they would not be prejudiced by the late introduction of the alibi evidence\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. Courts generally consider several factors when deciding whether to allow late alibi testimony, with a key consideration being whether the prosecution would be prejudiced by its introduction. If the prosecution admits they would not be prejudiced by the late alibi evidence, the court is most likely to allow it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while newly discovered evidence might be a factor, it's not the most compelling reason for a court to allow late testimony.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, although video evidence might be more reliable, the strength of the evidence itself doesn't overcome the procedural issue of late notice.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as noted in the passage, excluding alibi testimony for failure to provide timely notice is generally considered constitutional, provided there are reciprocal discovery obligations for the prosecution.\n\nOption D aligns with the principle stated in the passage that \"courts should generally permit the alibi testimony, assuming that prosecution will not be surprised or prejudiced by the late notice.\" This option directly addresses one of the main concerns courts have when deciding whether to allow late alibi evidence."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is a bit embarrassing. A couple years ago I had been seeing a specialist doctor. I had been a victim of a crime, so the city/police department was paying for my treatment. It had been my understanding that the city/police would fully pay for a set number of visits, but it appeared that was based on the assumption the doctor's office was charging a lower rate (i.e. normally it was $200/hr but for low income or people who were victims of a crime it was $125/hr).\n\nAnyway, I had stopped seeing the doctor and I'm better now, but the office sent me an email reading:\n\n\"Could we please get your police case number, so we can bill them for a outstanding visits?\" \n\n* First, I don't know how I missed payments, as I always paid in person before I left.\n* Second, I noticed they had been inconsistent in the amount they were charging me per session (sometimes $200, sometimes $125\\). I pointed this out and said I think that they may owe me money back. They never responded.\n* Third, I do not know how it could have gone on for months with only at the end asking me for the police case number.\n\nThis was such a long time ago, I can't remember all the details clearly. Is there any point in pursuing this? Could it be I have a large bill incurring interest that will come back to haunt me?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Is It Too Late To Collect The Bill?\n===================================\n\nProbably not.\n\nThere is a statute of limitations for collecting unpaid medical bills that varies in length in different jurisdictions, and the age of the bill in the question is approximate, so it is hard to know for sure if this one is too old.\n\nThe relevant statutes of limitations in most U.S. states would be at least three years and in some it could be as much as ten or twelve years. If I recall correctly, in Canada, the relevant statute of limitations would be determined at the provincial level. Given that this was \"a couple of years ago\" realistically, it is probably not barred by the statute of limitations yet.\n\nAre Interest Charges Allowed.\n=============================\n\nGenerally yes.\n\nMost jurisdictions allow for pre\\-judgment interest at a statutory rate from the date due in the absence of a contrary agreement and if the provider's paperwork with you provided for another interest rate, that would apply instead. So charging interest is allowed.\n\nThe existence of a dispute wouldn't change this result, although it would, of course, mean that if some portion of the bill was disallowed in a later lawsuit that interest would be owed only on the portion that the court found was actually owed.\n\nThe Provider's Remedies\n=======================\n\n*A Lawsuit*\n\nIf these bills are not paid, they can sue.\n\nStatute of limitations, or errors in billing, or failure to seek reimbursement from the police as arranged with them, would all be legitimate defenses in lawsuit brought by the provider.\n\nGiven the modest amount allegedly owed and the existence of defenses, this might not be a very attractive one for the provider to choose to bring suit to collect.\n\n*Credit Reporting*\n\nOn the other hand, in lieu of suing, the provider could simply report it as a bad debt with a credit reporting agency through their collections company.\n\nThis would look bad on your credit (for up to seven years in the U.S., although you could insist on filing a rebuttal statement as part of your credit report, I don't know how disputes about credit reporting work in Canada).\n\nPaying them would almost admit that there was a late payment for credit reporting purposes, but also might prevent the incident from entering the credit reporting system at all.",

The doctor's office recently contacted the patient about outstanding payments. Which of the following statements is most likely correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The statute of limitations has definitely passed, so the doctor's office can no longer collect on any unpaid bills.\n\nB) The doctor's office can only pursue payment through a lawsuit and cannot report the debt to credit agencies.\n\nC) If the patient pays the outstanding amount now, it will prevent the incident from appearing on their credit report.\n\nD) The doctor's office can still pursue payment through various means, including lawsuits and credit reporting, but the patient may have valid defenses.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Answer D is the most accurate based on the information provided. The documentation indicates that:\n\n1. The statute of limitations for medical bills in most jurisdictions is likely not expired after only two years.\n2. The provider has multiple options for pursuing payment, including lawsuits and credit reporting.\n3. The patient may have valid defenses, such as billing errors or the provider's failure to seek reimbursement from the police.\n4. Paying now might prevent credit reporting, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the statute of limitations is likely still in effect. Answer B is wrong because the provider can use both lawsuits and credit reporting. Answer C is not necessarily true, as paying now doesn't guarantee prevention of credit reporting, though it might help."

She then carries the child to term, against Bob's wishes. Can she then compel Bob to pay child support? Compared to the linked question, here Bob did not consent to sex.\n\nohwilleke's answer to the linked question says that if Bob rapes Alice and Alice carries the child to term, then she is required to care for the child. On the other hand, presumably Alice can choose to abort the child if she doesn't want to care for the child. In the case where Alice rapes Bob, Bob presumably can't compel Alice to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nSome Googling led me to [Hermesmann v. Seyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer), which asserts that in Kansas, \"a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman\". However, the text of the article seems to say that although Seyer (the man in the relationship) was underage and therefore incapable of providing consent under statutory rape law, he had actually given consent to the acts under civil law since he didn't complain to his parents. In the hypothetical scenario described above, Bob did not consent to the acts since he was raped.\n\nI'm interested in all jurisdictions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThe treatment of how paternity is handled in cases of rape, from which child support and child custody determinations flow, varies by U.S. state in the United States as a result of an ongoing and recent wave of legislative innovation, prompted by cases in which convicted male rapists sought child custody in connection with children conceived in acts of rape for which they were convicted. A state by state summary of the applicable laws as of January 2020 (which oversimplifies the situation in which there are additional distinctions not noted, some of which are differences in wording that could be relevant to how these statutes apply in the OP case) can be found [here](https://www.mylifetime.com/movies/you-cant-take-my-daughter/articles/how-parental-rights-for-rapists-vary-by-state).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)\n\nAll of these laws are targeted at the case of a woman raped by a man who becomes pregnant, which is factually predominant, something that happens many thousands of times each year in the United States as a whole, and not at the case of a man who, in the course of being raped by a female, causes the female to become pregnant as a result.\n\nCases of men being raped that are handled by the legal system, and do not involve statutory rape, predominantly involve sexual interaction that is not reproductive, i.e. something other than a man involuntarily having vaginal sex with a woman, often prison rape by a same sex inmate or rape with an object, and also, as in other cases of rape, often doesn't result in a conception of a child due to random chance. Likewise, many women convicted of rape are convicted as co\\-participants in a crime that involves physical penetration of a victim by a man or an object, rather than sexual intercourse with the woman convicted of the crime. So, the number of cases that could potentially be litigated with respect to this issue is much smaller.\n\nIt is also worth noting that under U.S. criminal law, sexual intercourse procured by deception (other than deception regarding the person with whom one is having sex, for example, because of a blindfold or darkness, or deception regarding one's status as a medical practitioner making a medical examination, or as a law enforcement officer making a legally authorized cavity search) is not a crime and does not constitute rape.\n\nAlso, generally speaking, having sex consensually in a manner not intended to lead to conception, which, in fact, does result in conception with consent to the sex giving rise to conception (e.g. where there is an agreement to \"pull out\" that isn't performed due to the acts of one or both parties involved), will almost never be prosecuted criminally as rape, whether or not a jury with perfect knowledge of the facts of the interaction could convict under the law of the minority of U.S. states where this might be possible.\n\nAs @user6726 notes, the primary fact pattern related to the OP historically has involved instances of intercourse that are consensual in fact, but constitute statutory rape due to the age of the father which makes it impossible for him to legally consent, and in those cases, the default rule that the biological father of a child is recognized as the father for custody and child support purposes has been the predominant rule.\n\nBut much of that case law predates modern rapist\\-paternity statutes and there is an equal protection argument that those statutes should have a parallel construction, although to the best of my knowledge, there are no reported appellate cases that have tested that issue. It remains an open issue of first impression in most, if not all, jurisdictions that have adopted rape\\-paternity statutes.\n\nIn Minnesota, which had not adopted such a statute as of January 2020, being raped would not be a defense to a paternity, child custody, or child support claim.",

As the information provided indicates, laws regarding paternity and child support in rape cases differ from state to state in the US. Most existing laws focus on cases where men rape women, not the reverse scenario. Some states have adopted rape-paternity statutes that may potentially be applied to male victims through equal protection arguments, but this remains largely untested in courts. In states without such statutes (like Minnesota as of 2020), being raped might not be a defense against paternity or child support claims. Given this variability, the man's obligations would most likely depend on the specific laws of the state where the incident occurred (option B). Options A and C are incorrect because there is no uniform federal or nationwide approach. Option D is misleading, as terminating parental rights and financial obligations is typically not a simple process, especially in this unusual scenario."

It's going to the moon!\" without disclosing any financial interest in the company.\n\nC) A licensed financial advisor posts detailed analysis of a company's financials, recommending users buy the stock, without disclosing their professional status.\n\nD) A user posts fabricated screenshots showing massive gains from a penny stock, then deletes their account after the stock price rises.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is the least likely to result in legal action because it involves posting verifiable proof of actual gains. While extreme, if true and verifiable, this does not constitute fraud or misrepresentation.\n\nB) While this might be considered market manipulation, the anonymity and lack of false statements make it difficult to prosecute. However, if the user has undisclosed financial interests, it could still be problematic.\n\nC) This could violate SEC rules requiring financial advisors to disclose their status and follow certain guidelines when giving investment advice, even on social media platforms.\n\nD) This is a clear example of a \"pump and dump\" scheme, which is a form of securities fraud. Creating false information to artificially inflate a stock's price is illegal and likely to attract SEC attention."

Anyone who receives a copy of some GPL licensed software will be able to use it under that license forever, as well as doing anything the license allows, such as distributing it to anyone else they choose.\n\nThe GNU GPL cannot be modified\n==============================\n\nWell to be precise you cannot modify it and call it the GPL or claim any association with the GNU project, but you can borrow some of its clauses to use in a license called something else. From the GPL FAQ:\n\n> [**Can I modify the GPL and make a modified license?**](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL)\n> \n> \n> It is possible to make modified versions of the GPL, but it tends to have practical consequences.\n> \n> \n> You can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license provided that you call your license by another name and do not include the GPL preamble, and provided you modify the instructions\\-for\\-use at the end enough to make it clearly different in wording and not mention GNU (though the actual procedure you describe may be similar).\n> \n> \n> If you want to use our preamble in a modified license, please write to \\< licensing@gnu.org \\> for permission. For this purpose we would want to check the actual license requirements to see if we approve of them.\n> \n> \n> Although we will not raise legal objections to your making a modified license in this way, we hope you will think twice and not do it. Such a modified license is almost certainly [incompatible with the GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatIsCompatible), and that incompatibility blocks useful combinations of modules. The mere proliferation of different free software licenses is a burden in and of itself.\n> \n> \n> Rather than modifying the GPL, please use the exception mechanism offered by GPL version 3\\.\n\nThe GPL3 exception mechanism allows you to add certain additional exceptions to the license, but you could not add one which would allow you to make the license revocable.\n\nCopyright holders can always change how they publish their works\n================================================================\n\nNow while a Free/Open license is irrevocable for those who have already received a copy of the work, copyright holders can always change how they publish their own works. You don't need to add anything to the GPL to do this! You can begin by publishing it under the GPL, and then later start publishing it under an additional license, including a non\\-Free/Open license. You can stop publishing it under old licenses if you want. But none of those changes affect the people who already have your software under a Free/Open license.\n\nNote that if you are not the sole copyright owner for your software (if you have accepted contributions from others), you will need to get everyone's approval before changing the license, unless they have signed a [contributor license agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) with you.",

Copyright holders can change how they publish their works in the future, but this doesn't affect those who already received the software under the GPL. \nOption D is incorrect because Free/Open licenses like the GPL are irrevocable for those who have already received the software under that license."

According to this rule, an acceptance is considered effective as soon as it is posted, not when it is received. This means that a binding contract between Kumaran and Bobby was formed as soon as Bobby mailed his acceptance letter, which was before the May 14 deadline.\n\nOption B is incorrect because under the posting rule, Kumaran's attempt to revoke the offer after Bobby had already posted his acceptance would be ineffective.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the contract formation does not depend on when Kumaran received the acceptance, but rather when it was posted.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although the letter arrived after May 14, the acceptance was effective when posted, which was before the deadline.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract formation principles, particularly the posting rule and its implications for offer and acceptance in contract law."

The Judge, Mr. Justice Horridge, was evidently not persuaded that this was an apology at all.\n\nMy question is about where to place the blame for how Hayes conducted the case. If we assume he was following instructions from Harris, was he obliged to do so to the letter, or might he have decided, seeing how Horridge was inclined, to have interpreted his instructions in such a way that he apologised completely and unreservedly? Or was he absolutely obliged to follow his client's instructions as literally as possible, even if they were very unwise?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barristers *must* represent their client as [*they*](https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/for-the-public/finding-and-using-a-barrister/what-to-expect.html) see best\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> A barrister who is working for you must always think about what is best for you and do their job in a way that reflects that. **This does not mean that a barrister can lie on your behalf, or that they must do everything you tell them.** Their duty to the court comes above even their duty to you as their client and barristers must act with independence, honesty and integrity. This means, for example, that they cannot do anything for you that would go against their duty to the court.\n\nThe barrister, not the client, is in charge of strategy and tactics.\n\nFor the example you give, it\u2019s quite likely that the barrister might have preferred to be more apologetic but they have a duty to the court that supervenes their duty to their client.

Barristers have a duty to represent their clients to the best of their ability, but this duty is superseded by their duty to the court. They must act with independence, honesty, and integrity. While they cannot lie on behalf of their client or go against their duty to the court, they also cannot simply ignore their client's wishes.

Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From comments, **Which laws allow the European Council to order ISPs to violate net neutrality?** is a more legally answerable question than \"Why does the European Council think it has the right to force ISPs to censor websites?\".\n\nEU law on net neutrality is contained in the \"Open Internet regulation\", [2015/2120](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120), principally its Article 3, in which we read (clause 3\\):\n\n> Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services, without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used.\n\nThis goes on to add, with irrelevant words omitted:\n\n> Providers of internet access services ... shall not block ... specific content ... except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public authorities vested with relevant powers.\n\nThis is a long\\-winded way of saying that other provisions of national or EU law *can* require content to be blocked. Paragraph 13 of the preamble explains it in more normal language \\- the net neutrality provision is not intended to give carte blanche to the publication of material which would otherwise be unlawful.\n\nIn the case of RT and Sputnik, [Regulation 2022/350](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0350) is an example of such a law, saying:\n\n> It shall be prohibited for operators to broadcast or to enable, facilitate or otherwise contribute to broadcast, any content by the legal persons, entities or bodies listed in Annex XV, including through transmission or distribution by any means such as cable, satellite, IP\\-TV, internet service providers, internet video\\-sharing platforms or applications, whether new or pre\\-installed.\n\nand also \"This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\" The Council is allowed to make such regulations by virtue of Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on \"restrictive measures\" against \"natural or legal persons and groups or non\\-State entities\", with certain procedural prior conditions too lengthy to discuss in detail.\n\nTherefore, if your country is a party to that treaty and has arranged for its direct effect in domestic law, then Regulation 2022/350 is binding and supersedes the general rules of Regulation 2015/2120\\.\n\nBy general principles of the primacy of EU law, the ban also overrides any contrary provisions of national law, including perhaps even a national Constitution. Since you are in Germany: under the \"Solange\" principle accepted by the Bundesverfassungsgericht, domestic courts would not review EU law by the standards of the human rights provisions in the Grundgesetz, since the EU institutions are held to be capable of providing their own parallel safeguard of essentially the same rights. This Regulation could therefore be challenged on the grounds of Charter/Convention rights, or compatibility with the Treaties, but not because of conflict with a national law on net neutrality (if there was one).\n\nThe preamble of the recent Regulations does acknowledge the human rights angle and claims to be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. While the ban does interfere with the freedom of expression, that right is subject to certain limits; and ECHR Article 16 explicitly reserves \"imposing restrictions on the\npolitical activity of aliens\".",

They must follow EU regulations and can only block content under specific circumstances.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. While net neutrality is a principle in EU law, there are exceptions that allow for content blocking under certain conditions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the European Council alone cannot order content blocking without proper legislative basis. The blocking must be in compliance with Union legislative acts or national legislation that complies with Union law.\n\nThe case of banning RT and Sputnik demonstrates how this works in practice. Regulation 2022/350 provides the legal basis for ISPs to block these specific content providers, overriding the general net neutrality rules."

However,\n\nArticle 82 child protection law says the following:\n\n> Every one who deliberately commits violence, or threat of violence,\n> forces, does tricks, tells a series of lies, or *persuades* a child to\n> do, or let obscene acts be done, is subject to penalty of 15 (fifteen)\n> years at most and 3 (three) years at least and fine of Rp. 300\\.000\\.000\n> (three hundreds millions) at most and Rp.\n> 60\\.000\\.000 at least.\n\n[https://www2\\.congreso.gob.pe/sicr/cendocbib/con4\\_uibd.nsf/E67F49F7CC441622052580330075862B/$FILE/ANNEX\\-3\\-Laws\\-of\\-child\\_protection.pdf](https://www2.congreso.gob.pe/sicr/cendocbib/con4_uibd.nsf/E67F49F7CC441622052580330075862B/$FILE/ANNEX-3-Laws-of-child_protection.pdf)\n\nI found the law a bit weird.\n\nIt prohibits some nonconsensual stuffs like \"deliberately commits violence, or threat of violence, forces, does tricks, tells a series of lies\", however, later it adds a phrase 'persuade'. Persuading someone is not necessarily nonconsensual. All the words describe nonconsensual activity except 'persuade'.\n\nAlso, one interpretation of this article is that all sex with girls under 18 is illegal. However, if that's the case, why not just make it simple and\n\n> don't have sex with girls under 18\n\n?\n\nIf all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nIf some obscene acts are legal, why does it say \"coerce, trick, bla bla bla, persuade\" girls to have sex with you if she is under 18?\n\nWhy does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nOf course the law says do obscene acts instead of having sex. I am not even sure what obscene acts include.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nActually, due to this, is age of consent in Indonesia 18 or 15?\n\nAny actual court cases will be great.\n\nIn the forum I sent someone actually asked this:\n\n> \"The exploitation\" and \"persuasion\" angle is not very clear to me. So\n> sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\"\n> her to do so. Can anyone shows actual court cases?\n> \n> \n> It seems that actual court cases for this sort of thing is very few.\n\nSo if the law is to be read literally, it looks like having sex with a girl above 15 is legal unless you \"exploit\" or \"persuade\". Which is absurd.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Content Warning**: this post mentions rape / non\\-consensual sex and discusses (in some non\\-explicit detail) coercion of minors.\n\n---\n\nAs of Tuesday, March 1st, 2016, according to the [Indonesian Penal Code](https://www.ageofconsent.net/world/indonesia) (translated version; I cannot read Indonesian), Indonesia's age of consent is 16 years old (18 for homosexual acts). Indonesia also does not have close\\-in\\-age exemptions (for example, in Canada, the age of consent is 16 years old, but a 14\\-year\\-old can consent to a partner less than 5 years older, and a 12\\-year\\-old can consent within 2 years).\n\nI cannot verify this source but according to Wikipedia, which cites [this PDF](https://repositoryfh.unla.ac.id/browse/previews/1412), the age of consent could be raised to 18 years under the Child Protection Act arguing that sexual acts can cause bodily or mental harm and \"child\" is defined as anyone under 18 years of age. As an example, according to Wikipedia, a court case in 2009 ([Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/world/australian-gets-eight-years-in-bali-jail-for-underage-sex-20090226-8jaf.html)) saw this used to convict an Australian man.\n\n---\n\nThere is nothing weird about this law. I left this as a comment, but let me elaborate in an answer. Your misconception is that persuasion is an innocent and ethical thing. The harsh reality is that children are, on average, more ignorant than adults and lack judgement, foresight, and rationality at times, and there are disgusting individuals that will exploit this fact to get children to do things they otherwise wouldn't such as sex, or drugs. Additionally, age comes with a power imbalance \\- think a teacher using their power over a student to convince or coerce them into having sex with them. That is not strictly *violence*, nor telling lies, or \"forcing\" in the strict sense, nor trickery, but a reasonable individual would still consider that to be not real consent.\n\nThe fact is that children can only consent if it is entirely of their own accord and judgement and there is no extrinsic pressure forcing or persuading them to. In fact, I argue that *adults* are subject to this too and persuading or coercing an adult into having sex is also disgusting (but doing this to children is far more abhorrent). But since children are considered by law to lack the judgement to protect themselves against coercion and realize they should reject and get away from their persuader, the law instead protects them.\n\n> Persuading someone is not necessarily non\\-consensual.\n\nIt holds a high chance of being non\\-consensual, and consent is only considered real when it is a) not coerced, and b) the subject is *legally capable*; that is, not intoxicated, not a minor (by whatever the age of cosnent is), etc.\n\n> If all obscene acts with a girl under 18 are illegal, why doesn't the law simply say don't do obscene acts with a girl under 18?\n\nBecause sex with people between 16 and 18 is legal (in Indonesia) under the right conditions. Although I must say, since you word it as \"obscene acts\", then of course they're illegal. Obscene acts are, by definition, morally reprehensible and/or legally incriminating, so illegal things are illegal, is basically what you're saying. Just say \"having sex\" if you mean \"having sex\".\n\n> Why does the law prohibit persuading girls to do obscene acts but does not prohibit the actual doing of the obscene act itself? Kind of weird.\n\nThis makes no sense at all, and hopefully after reading my answer you understand why this makes absolutely no sense.\n\n> How in the earth anyone can have sex with someone without persuading? He walks the street and accidentally plug his penis in?\n\n... Rape? There are many ways to have sex with someone without persuading them that I don't think I have to list. Your main mistake is still conflating persuaded / coerced consent as real consent.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, persuasion is not some innocent matter of convincing someone in a friendly manner to have sex. It includes coercion, abusing one's power, exploiting a child's ignorance and limited judgement or foresight, and other reprehensible factors. Consent cannot be given if the individual is too young, impaired, unable to legally give consent, or coerced into it.",

However, it also mentions that the age could potentially be raised to 18 under interpretations of the Child Protection Act. The other options are incorrect - 15 is not stated as the age of consent, there are no close-in-age exemptions mentioned, and persuading/coercing 16-18 year olds is not described as universally legal. Option C most accurately reflects the nuanced legal situation described."

An application is considered filed when it is officially received by USCIS, not when it is mailed. (Of course, they wouldn't know the date it was officially received, until they receive the I\\-485 receipt, there will be uncertainty about when exactly it was filed. But when they do receive their I\\-485 receipts, it will be retroactively clarified.)\n\nIf their I\\-485s are received on or before May 15 (if that is the expiration date of their I\\-94s), they were not deportable at any point. If their I\\-485s are received after May 15, there will be a period of time (from after their I\\-94 expires until their I\\-485 is received) when they will be technically deportable, but it is extremely unlikely that they would be caught and put into deportation proceedings during a short overstay.

Although being out of status at the time of filing makes one ineligible for Adjustment of Status in most categories (see [7 USCIS\\-PM B.3](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-3)), it does not apply in the Immediate Relative category (spouse, parent, or unmarried under\\-21 child of US citizen), as is the case with the applicants here. See also [7 USCIS\\-PM B.8(B)](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-8#S-B):\n\n> Certain adjustment bars do not apply to an immediate relative,\n> including the spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years old) of a\n> U.S. citizen, and the parent of a U.S. citizen older than 21\\.\\[2]\n> \n> \n> An adjustment applicant applying as an immediate relative may be\n> eligible to adjust status even if:\n> \n> \n> * The applicant is not in lawful immigration status on the date he or she files the adjustment application;\n> * The applicant has ever failed to continuously maintain a lawful status since entry into the United States;\n\nThis applies no matter how long the person was out of status.

My fellow gang members want to help me get off, but not so much that their willing to do anything that could lead to their going to jail instead.\n\nIt's possible for one of the gang members to claim to be the murderer to sow reasonable doubt in theory ( [What prevents someone from claiming to be the murderer in order to get the real murderer off?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42810/what-prevents-someone-from-claiming-to-be-the-murderer-in-order-to-get-the-real?noredirect=1&lq=1)) However, they would then be guilty of purjury and other crimes which my fellow gangbangers likely don't want to go to jail for.\n\nHowever, instead of one person coming forward and explicitly saying they committed a crime what if multiple gang members all came forward and *implied* they committed the crime. For instance saying things like \"I was planning to kill that man for being on our territory, but I won't say I did it\" or \"I 'took care of' some of the rival gang members that day\" something along the line. Could a half dozen individuals come forward to intentionally sow confusion as to who the murderer was without risking purjury and thus help the actual murder get free?\n\nIf the inability to plead the fifth when giving testimony makes it too hard to imply guilt of yourself could they instead intentionally point the finger at other gang members (with those member's approval), thus allowing them to imply guilt of another without being put in a position where they had to explicitly say yes they did or didn't commit the murder if asked directly, since they can't definitively know what another person did.\n\nHas any situation like this actually occurred in real criminal cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, as you say, these witnesses who try to help their buddy out may be committing perjury. Also, D himself, by lining this up, is probably on the hook for conspiracy to commit perjury and being complicit in perjury.\n\nAside from that, I think your question is: would getting people to testify in a way that implies *they* did the crime lead to an acquittal for the murderer? The answer is: maybe.\n\nThe jury will either vote to acquit or to convict. If the jury votes to acquit, then it's over. Double jeopardy protects D from being tried for murder again. But, if the jury votes to convict, the fact that D had his friends testifying in the way you suggest isn't going to get the conviction overturned on appeal because \"a reviewing court resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts.\" *People v. Young*, 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1181 (Cal. 2005\\).\n\nI haven't done a trial yet, but it strikes me that that might not be the greatest trial strategy. I think generally defense lawyers would prefer to make their client look the furthest thing from gang affiliated as possible.\n\nDon't lie to a court or ask anyone to lie to a court for you.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal consequences and effectiveness of this strategy?\n\nA) This strategy is likely to result in an automatic acquittal due to reasonable doubt, with no legal risks for the participating gang members.\n\nB) The gang members can avoid perjury charges by carefully wording their statements to imply guilt without making direct false claims.\n\nC) This approach could potentially lead to an acquittal, but also risks perjury and conspiracy charges for both the defendant and the participating gang members.\n\nD) The strategy is guaranteed to result in a mistrial, forcing the prosecution to start over with a new case against the defendant.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. While this strategy could potentially create reasonable doubt and lead to an acquittal, it comes with significant legal risks. The gang members implying their guilt, even without directly claiming responsibility, may still be committing perjury if their statements are intentionally misleading. The defendant could be charged with conspiracy to commit perjury for orchestrating this plan. Even if an acquittal is achieved, it's not guaranteed, as the jury might still convict despite the conflicting testimonies. Options A and B are incorrect because they understate the legal risks involved. Option D is incorrect because this strategy doesn't automatically result in a mistrial; the trial would likely proceed to a verdict unless other factors intervene."

Let's assume that someone marks the box for such a free trial, but never makes use of the service. The vendor uses the credit\\-card info provided for the 1\\-time purchase to debit the credit account for multiple months of service before the consumer notices. The vendor then refuses to issue a credit for any but the last debit.\n\nWould it be reasonable to consider those recurring charges \"False Claims\" or fraudulent?\n\nIn this context, I'm not referring to the federal *qui tam* statute, but the idea that presenting or causing the presentment of a bill for services that were never rendered is dishonest.\n\nThe initial charge on my credit card was fine, as it was for a fixed duration of services (10 years in my case.) What gives me heartburn is that they continued to charge my card without a meeting of the minds on that.\n\nReviewing an example of the vendor's website, it says in big print **\"Monthly Plan $0\\.00/mo\"** and in fine gray print it says \"Renews at $5\\.88/month.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In all such offers that I have seen, there is an agreement explicitly saying that if the service is not cancelled by the end date of the trial, a recurring charge for the price of the service will be made, and the customer authorizes this. If there was such an agreement, the charges would be authorized, not fraudulent.\n\nThe question does not say what agreement accompanied the free trial. But any reasonable person would know that credit card info is only provided when a charge is at least possible.\n\n**Addition**:\n\nThe question now says:\n\n> Reviewing an example of the vendor's website, it says in big print \"Monthly Plan $0\\.00/mo\" and in fine gray print it says \"Renews at $5\\.88/month.\"\n\nIn that case it seems to me that the customer agreed to the recurring charge. What was purchased was **access** to the service, and whether the service was in fact used is not relevant. Unless there is a consumer protection law specifically requiring such terms to be \"prominent\" or otherwise making this deal unlawful, it seem to me that the customer has agreed, and the charge nis in no way a false claim. But it is possible that a court would rule otherwise.\n\nIt is my experiences that in such cases the credit card company can and sometimes will act as an agent for the customer, and can often obtain refunds for multiple past charges. No doubt they have mush stronger negotiating power. But such refunds are not a matter of law, I think, rather of business practice and good will.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A consumer makes a one-time purchase from an online service provider and unknowingly agrees to a free trial that automatically renews at $5.88/month. The renewal terms are written in small, gray text beneath a more prominent \"$0.00/mo\" offer. The consumer doesn't use the service but is charged for several months before noticing. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of these charges?\n\nA) The charges are fraudulent and illegal because the consumer didn't explicitly agree to them.\nB) The charges are legal and binding because the terms were disclosed, even if in small print.\nC) The charges are only legal for the first month after the free trial, as the consumer should have been notified before subsequent charges.\nD) The charges are automatically void if the consumer can prove they never used the service.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While the presentation of the terms may be ethically questionable, legally, the charges are likely to be considered valid and binding. The question states that the renewal terms were disclosed, even if in fine print. In most jurisdictions, this disclosure, combined with the consumer's action of signing up (even if just for a \"free\" trial), creates a legally binding agreement. The size of the print or prominence of the disclosure typically doesn't invalidate the agreement unless specific consumer protection laws state otherwise. The consumer's non-use of the service doesn't usually affect the validity of the charges, as they're paying for access to the service, not actual usage. However, it's worth noting that in practice, many companies might offer refunds in such situations to maintain customer goodwill, and credit card companies may be able to assist in obtaining refunds, but this is generally a matter of business practice rather than legal requirement."

It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.\n\nHowever, fast\\-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!\n\nI having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2\\-months away. I am certain that in any normal situation (e.g. sans corona) they would be pleased to have me back early. After all, there was a reluctance to let me go in the first place. When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P\\&L.\n\nHowever, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.\n\nEither way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.\n\nTherefore my questions are as such:\n\n1. Can my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc? Alternatively, there is a mechanism in place that can allow me to return to work earlier?\n2.

But then, you wouldn't want to be coming back early.\n\nYour employment status is that you are employed and on leave. Subject to the details of your employment contract; there is nothing stopping you taking another job \\- there is a huge demand for logistics workers particularly in the health sector at the moment; much of it unskilled work. dIf you want to be unemployed, you can always resign.",

It generally covers a large\\-ish area; the name comes from the fact that back in the days of horseback travel, judges would literally ride around a circuit to hold court. The exact meaning depends on the court system.\n\nAt the federal level, the circuit courts are the main federal appeals courts. Each one covers multiple states (except the DC Circuit which just covers DC and the Federal Circuit which has subject\\-based jurisdiction). A circuit court normally hears cases before a 3\\-judge panel; that panel's decision is normally binding precedent in federal courts throughout the circuit, including on future panels of the same circuit. Panel decisions can be overturned by SCOTUS or by the circuit court sitting *en banc* (i.e. all the judges hear the case, not just 3 of them). Outside the circuit, a circuit court's decision is only persuasive precedent.\n\nAt the state level, what circuit courts do depends on the state. In many states that have them, they're the most important trial courts, handling large civil cases and felony criminal cases. Some states have lower\\-tier courts to handle minor issues, in which case they might allow an appeal from the lower courts to the circuit court. This appeal might be like a normal appeal (where the higher court looks at the record from the lower court and only considers whether the lower court got the law wrong), or might be a trial *de novo* (where the higher court throws out the lower court's decision entirely and tries the case itself from scratch). It really depends on the state. If a state's circuit courts are trial courts, they generally don't set much of a precedent.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a person, A, was hired by an employer, B, and then got fired a week later. Suppose that B mailed A a laptop while A was employed by B. Once A had been fired, B emailed A asking for the laptop back and sent a box for it to be returned. Suppose that A was fired on Tuesday, got the email Wednesday, and was charged with theft ([GS 14\\-74](https://law.justia.com/codes/north-carolina/2005/chapter_14/gs_14-74.html)) on the following Monday. Suppose that B called the local police and made a complaint, and a warrant was issued for A's arrest on Tuesday. The laptop has already been mailed back by then.\n\nIs such an arrest lawful? What options does A have?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are facing felony charges, you need to hire a criminal defense lawyer, not ask for legal advice on the Internet. Do not talk to the police without your lawyer present. **Do not attempt to represent yourself in any kind of hearing.** Ignore any advice based on what seems fair or reasonable to someone on the Internet unless it is based on a real case in North Carolina or written by a real lawyer.\n\nThat said, it appears to me that you have at least two strong defenses. First, if you you returned the laptop (It will help if you sent it by registered mail or otherwise kept a receipt, although, remember, they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you kept it), that shows you had no \u201cintent to steal\u201d or \u201cpurpose to steal\u201d it, which is a necessary element of the crime. Second, according to [the University of North Carolina criminal law blog,](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/embezzlement-vs-larceny-by-employee/) you appear to have been charged with the wrong offense (although I don\u2019t think that will actually help you if the prosecutor decides to bring the charge that matches what your former employer alleges you to have done). It cites a relevant North Carolina Supreme Court ruling on the difference between larceny and embezzlement, State v. McDonald, 45 S.E. 582 (N.C. 1903\\).\n\nI would focus on getting yourself cleared of these charges first. You can ask your lawyer if there is any recourse you might have against your former employer. I\u2019m skeptical that suing them would be worth it, but I don\u2019t know the circumstances. If you have proof of what they said to you and about you, hang on to it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, what is the most critical immediate action that A should take?\n\nA) Mail the laptop back to B as soon as possible\nB) Call the local police to explain the situation\nC) File a lawsuit against B for wrongful termination\nD) Hire a criminal defense lawyer immediately\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most critical immediate action for A is to hire a criminal defense lawyer. The documentation strongly emphasizes this point, stating \"If you are facing felony charges, you need to hire a criminal defense lawyer, not ask for legal advice on the Internet.\" It also advises against talking to the police without a lawyer present and attempting self-representation. \n\nWhile returning the laptop (option A) is important, it has already been done according to the scenario. Calling the police (option B) is discouraged without legal representation. Filing a lawsuit (option C) is not the immediate priority when facing criminal charges.\n\nThe correct course of action is to secure legal representation (option D) to navigate the criminal charges, build a defense, and protect A's rights. This aligns with the documentation's emphasis on professional legal counsel in such situations."

Which of the following actions would be legally permissible without obtaining a license from Blizzard?\n\nA) Selling hand-drawn character portraits of Overwatch heroes\nB) Creating and selling keychains featuring the Overwatch logo\nC) Offering custom-made buttons with Overwatch character catchphrases\nD) None of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. Even hand-drawn portraits of copyrighted characters are considered derivative works and require permission from the copyright holder (Blizzard).\n\nB) Incorrect. The Overwatch logo is a trademark of Blizzard, and using it on merchandise without permission is a violation of trademark law.\n\nC) Incorrect. Using character catchphrases on merchandise is likely to be considered copyright infringement, as these are part of Blizzard's intellectual property.\n\nD) Correct. None of the actions described would be legally permissible without obtaining a license from Blizzard. IP law, including copyright and trademark protections, gives Blizzard the right to control and benefit from derivatives of their game, including fan-made merchandise. While there are some exceptions to copyright law (such as fair use), creating and selling merchandise like prints, buttons, and keychains typically does not fall under these exceptions."

Unfortunately, there was a malfunctioning sprinkler head that you didn't know about. It's dark so you couldn't see it, and since the sprinkler wasn't working and wasn't spraying water, you had no other way to know it was there.\n\nAs a result you step on it, it breaks, and begins gushing out water.

That could include the sprinkler, plus the wasted water. The question that the court would ask is whether a person using ordinary caution would have avoided the sprinkler head, and the main consideration would be, how visible was the head?",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: A jogger accidentally steps on and breaks a hidden sprinkler head while avoiding visible sprinklers on a dark morning. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the jogger's legal liability?\n\nA) The jogger has no liability because the sprinkler head was not visible and they were exercising reasonable caution.\n\nB) The jogger is fully liable for all damages, including the broken sprinkler head and wasted water, regardless of visibility or caution exercised.\n\nC) The jogger's liability depends on whether a person using ordinary caution would have avoided the sprinkler head, primarily based on its visibility.\n\nD) The jogger is only liable for the broken sprinkler head but not for any wasted water, as water waste was an unforeseeable consequence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, according to the legal principle described, liability in such cases is determined by whether a person using ordinary caution would have avoided the damage. The main consideration in this scenario would be the visibility of the sprinkler head. If the sprinkler head was not reasonably visible to someone exercising ordinary caution, the jogger might not be held liable. However, if it was visible enough that a reasonably cautious person would have avoided it, the jogger could be held liable for both the broken sprinkler and the resulting water waste. This approach balances the jogger's duty to exercise caution with the reality of the situation, including factors like lighting and the unexpected location of the sprinkler head."

You especially need to hire an attorney, if you are concerned over thing that you've heard being a bad idea.\n\nIt may be that you're getting stuck because of your third desideratume: \"Allow *myself* to sell the software but not others\". Copyright *means* that as the author, you have the exclusive right to sell, distribute, modify and to *authorize* the same. You can always sell your own software: it's the *others* who need permission (a license). You can strike your third item from the list, because it's implicit in copyright law. Perhaps you could discuss this with an attorney and bring along the person who said that CC\\-BY\\-NC\\-SA is a bad idea, who might explain his concerns to the attorney.\n\nThere's no way to stop people from saying \"copycat\", but registering the copyright legally establishes who got there first.",

This is because:\n\n1. The developer has specific requirements that don't align with common open-source licenses.\n2. The question of allowing oneself to sell the software while restricting others from doing so requires careful legal consideration.\n3. An attorney can address concerns about potential misuse or \"copycat\" accusations.\n4. Custom licenses can be tailored to specific needs that pre-existing licenses don't cover.\n5. The documentation explicitly states that for tailored software licenses, hiring an attorney is necessary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation mentions that using Creative Commons licenses for software is generally not recommended. Option B doesn't fully address the developer's specific needs. Option D leaves the software vulnerable and doesn't achieve the developer's goals for distribution and collaboration."

If John sells a fifth car within the 12-month period, he would meet this threshold and need to obtain a license.
