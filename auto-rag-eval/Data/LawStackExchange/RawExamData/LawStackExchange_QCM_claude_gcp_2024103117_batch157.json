If this is true, how would that work for an item like keys, whose extrinsic value I'd assume is somehow related to what it unlocks? If a person stole:\n\n1. keys to an empty house\n2. keys to a safe containing 1MM USD\n3. keys to a new car\n4. keys to a recognized sensitive area (police evidence locker)\n\nwould these be considered the same 'levels' of crime or is there some consideration of the value attached to what the key secures? Or would there be additional charges layered on that differentiates the value of what's being protected?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Although I don't think there's a *general* principle that stealing a key is equivalent to stealing what it unlocks, some jurisdictions may certainly have laws that punish the theft of a key more severely.\n\nFor instance, see the [North Dakota Criminal Code](http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1.html), section 12\\.1\\-23\\-05, which grades theft offenses. Paragraph 3i provides that:\n\n> Theft under this chapter is a class C felony if: \\[...] The property stolen consists of a key or other implement uniquely suited to\n>  provide access to property the theft of which would be a felony and it was stolen\n>  to gain such access.\n\nSo if you steal $50,001 in cash, you are guilty of a class A felony, punishable by 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $20,000 (see Chapter 12\\.1\\-32\\).\n\nIf you steal a key that unlocks a safe containing $50,001 in cash, and it can be shown that you stole the key in order to gain access to the cash, you are guilty of a class C felony, punishable by 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $10,000\\.\n\nIf you steal a key blank that doesn't unlock anything, but has similar intrinsic value to a key (say, a couple of dollars), then you are guilty only of a class B misdemeanor, punishable by 30 days imprisonment and/or a fine of $1,500\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In North Dakota, John steals a key that he knows unlocks a safe containing $100,000 in cash. His intention is to use the key to access the safe later. Under North Dakota law, what crime has John committed?\n\nA) A class B misdemeanor, as the key itself has minimal intrinsic value\nB) A class A felony, as the value of the contents of the safe exceeds $50,000\nC) A class C felony, as he stole a key uniquely suited to provide access to property worth over $50,000\nD) No crime, as he hasn't actually stolen the cash yet\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to North Dakota Criminal Code section 12.1-23-05, paragraph 3i, theft of a key or other implement uniquely suited to provide access to property, the theft of which would be a felony, is considered a class C felony if it was stolen to gain such access. In this case, John stole a key to access a safe containing $100,000, which would be a felony-level theft. His intention to use the key for accessing the safe later meets the requirement of stealing it to gain access. Therefore, even though he hasn't stolen the cash yet, the theft of the key itself is a class C felony. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the law considers the potential access the key provides, not just its intrinsic value. Option B is incorrect because John hasn't actually stolen the cash yet, only the key. Option D is incorrect because stealing the key with the intention to use it for accessing valuable property is indeed a crime under this specific law."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42793/work-for-hire-as-a-contractor-without-payment-can-you-withhold-ip", "docs_id": 42793, "title": "Work for hire as a contractor without payment, can you withhold IP?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Context: Canadian law; contract work; software IP\n\nIf a contractor signs a work for hire agreement at the outset of a project and agrees that all work done for a company is the company's IP, can the contractor withhold the property if the company is unable to pay for it (insufficient funds)?\n\nOr is it that because the IP was initially signed away the company can demand the property without making a single payment for it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the company does not pay the agreed sums, they have materially breached the contract.

I cannot find a description of \"personal\" that seems to apply here, [this one](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Personal) would seem to include activity that an individual performed as part of their role in a company. [The google answer](https://www.google.com/search?q=personal%20meaning) would seem to include any activity that was not concerning my career or public life.\n\nIf I personally feel strongly about an issue, I may want to post multiple politicians' views on the issue on the web. This could include the politician's name and some sort of publicly available contact details such as twitter handle or official email address. If I were a company, GDPR would apply. However, as this is being done by a natural person, as part of an activity that has no commercial component, which could be described as \"of or concerning my private life, relationships, and emotions rather than my career or public life\", would the GDPR apply?\n\n[This question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28582/is-it-possible-for-a-publicly-accessible-personal-blog-to-make-use-of-the-perso) broaches this issue, but is focused on the personal data of the web site users.

[This question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29052/do-web-applications-as-hobby-projects-need-to-comply-with-the-gdpr) is more applicable, and it seems to say that \"what matters is whether your activity is professional/commercial\", which would apply in this case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR is not intended to only regulate commercial processing of personal data, but is aiming for comprehensive data protection. This does also cover non\\-profit and political activity.\n\nThe exception for \u201cpurely personal or household activities\u201d has to be interpreted somewhat narrowly. It does not apply to *all* personal activities, but to *purely* personal activities. The intention is clearly to exempt normal family and social life from GDPR compliance obligations. The GDPR explicitly mentions address books, social networking, and related online activities as examples of exempt activities.\n\nThe scenario you describe can be argued either way. It may or may not fall under the GDPR exception. However, I believe that this would have little consequence.\n\nPersonally, I think the exception will not apply if your web postings will be accessible to a wider circle than friends and family. Political activity such as participating in the shaping of public opinion is inherently public and outside of purely personal and household activities. So is making a website publicly accessible. Case law from the [Lindqvist case](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01) confirms this:\n\n> 47\\. That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\n\nIn C\\-101/01, the ECJ had to decide whether a personal website that was created in the context of a church fell under data protection laws. This case related to the GDPR's predecessor, the Data Protection Directive. As an EU directive and not an EU regulation the legal situation was a bit different, but the old directive included the same exception as the GDPR. [This answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/29056/20476) contains a bit more background.\n\nYou have mentioned various steps that could be taken to limit collection or processing of personal data through such a website. However, this data minimization does not determine whether the website is limited to purely personal or household activities: If GDPR does not apply to the processing activity, then any processing of personal data would be fine. If GDPR does apply, then any collection must be lawful and comply with the various provisions.\n\nWhat would it mean if you had to comply? You are proposing two somewhat distinct activities that have to be analyzed separately:\n\n* offering a website\n* listing personal data of a politician, such as name and their professional contact details\n\nThe case of offering a website has been discussed elsewhere in abundance. It is important to recognize that even a static website is unlikely to work without processing of personal data, since IP addresses are typically personal data. There are many steps that can be taken to minimize and avoid the collection and processing of data, but those are decisions taken by the data controller, who should still offer a privacy notice in line with the GDPR transparency principle and Art 13\\.\n\nPublishing personal data about a politician is more interesting. Here, it is extremely important to note that the GDPR is not absolute. Instead, the GDPR rights and obligations MUST be balanced against other rights. Such other rights include in particular the right to freedom of expression which could be exhibited by political or journalistic activity. Any interpretation of GDPR that would make such activities impossible is likely incorrect. In fact, the GDPR explicitly asks member states to implement additional exemptions where necessary to safeguard freedom of expression (Art 85\\). The [UK has implemented such exemptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/#ex16). Where you publish a politician's professional contact details in the course of normal political or journalistic activities \u2013 but not e.g. to harass them \u2013 your EU/EEA/UK state will likely have an exemption for that.\n\nEven if there wasn't an explicit exemption, your right to freedom of expression would almost certainly count as a legitimate interest that would be a legal basis for this processing under Art 6(1\\)(f).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A private individual decides to create a public website listing various politicians' views on climate change, including their names and official Twitter handles.

While GDPR likely applies to this scenario as it's a public website processing personal data, there are provisions in GDPR (Article 85) that require member states to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression. Many countries have implemented exemptions for journalistic or political expression that would likely cover this activity.\n\nC is incorrect because the public availability of information doesn't automatically exempt it from GDPR. The processing of publicly available personal data still falls under GDPR's scope.\n\nD is incorrect because while GDPR could apply, it doesn't necessarily require consent in all cases, especially for information processed for journalistic or political purposes.

I am creating a tool for players and DMs of D\\&D. The reason i've been trying to understand the copyright law in regards to this issue is that upon using any information from the books created by WotC you'd violate their copyright. Luckily, WotC has a \"Open Gaming License\" that you can use, to have much of the rules, items and monsters in your book, program, etc. for free (Link to the link of the SRD\\-OGL: [http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems\\-reference\\-document\\-srd](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd))\n\nMy issue is that WotC has intentionally left out some of the unique monsters that they themselves has created over the years. Which in itself is fine, but i have no idea if i would violate their copyright for these unique monsters if i were to create a module in my program where the enduser would be able to build a custom monster from a blank template (name: input here, armor class: input here etc. \\- you can look at an example on, say, page 279 with the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here name would be Tyrannosaurus Rex and Armor class would be 13 (natural armor))\n\nIf the enduser were to create a totally custom, madeup creature i'd imagine that tool would be fine, but i can also see the scenario where a enduser could copy letter for letter the information of a copyrighted monster into my custom monster template and essentially adding a copyright\\-violating item into the program.\n\nSo. I guess in essence what i am asking is: By making a tool in my program that can enable the user to create their own monsters, will i then be in trouble because i've also, if the user is malicious, by extension enabled the user to violate the copyright of WotC?\n\nI am from Denmark if that makes any difference, which i'd guess it doesn't. \nI have no real legal experience which is why i thought it'd be a good place to ask such a question.

Your program is a tool, just like a word processor is. If I copy a Harry Potter book into a word processor that does not make the word processor maker liable.\n\nThere is a concept of \"contributory infringement\", which I think is what you are concerned about. I don't know about Danish law in particular, but most countries would require evidence that you had reasonable knowledge that actual copyright violation was occuring, rather than just being aware that it might happen in theory. This is normally applied to file sharing services who have to have \"notice and takedown\" measures, file filters and the like. This isn't your concern as you never have any access to the files created by your users. \n\nYou can also be found liable if you induce anyone to commit copyright violations. Don't draw your customers attention to the custom monster feature as a workaround for those copyrighted monsters, as that could be considered to be inducement. Also don't provide any \"wizards\" or similar tools which make it noticeably easier to duplicate the custom monsters (e.g. if you notice that the copyrighted custom dragon stats are all on a linear scale with dragon size, don't create a \"dragon creation wizard\" embodying that fact.)\n\nThis assumes that your program runs entirely on the end user computer.

A lot of biological samples are shared for research with a caveat in the MTA that they are \"not for commercial use\". What exactly does this cover?

That would depend on the definition, if any, included in each contrast or license, and on the interpretation of that term under the governing law form each contract. In many cases that would be the law of the source country of the sample.\n\nAt a minimum, where the sample is used solely in scientific investigations, leading to scientific papers published in standard ways, that is not going to be considered to be \"commercial use\". Where the sample is directly used to manufacture a commercial product, that would, clearly be \"commercial use\". If the sample is used directly to **develop** a commercial product, that is probably \"commercial use\". Between those points there is a grey area, and in that grey area the result would depend on the factual details, the language of the contract, and the specific governing law.\n\nI suspect that much of the prevalence of this language is a result of the case of the [HeLa cell line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa) . This line is derisive from a sample of cells taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge or consent, ostensibly for her individual medical treatment. These cells have been widely used commercially, with no compensation or right of approval granted to the heirs or family of Lacks.

What if the officers are ordered not to comply? How could it realistically play out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: @Dale M is basically correct, but fudges a bit on the process.\n\nThe court issuing the order would issue an order to show cause to a government official who is alleged by the person who sought the order to have violated the order after having received legal notice (i.e. service) of the order.\n\nIf that individual fails to appear at the appointed time and place in the order to show cause, a warrant issues for that individual's arrest. If that individual does appear, the allegedly contemptuous individual is read their rights and a hearing date is set. \n\nAt the hearing, if the person appears, the person seeking the contempt finding (or some other attorney appointed by the court) prosecutes the case and if the person is found in contempt, then contempt sanctions issue. If they do not appear, a warrant issues for their arrest and a hearing is held on the merits promptly following that arrest.\n\nAn individual can also be ordered to show cause in an official capacity in which case the contempt sanctions would be imposed against the organization rather than the individual.\n\nUsually, in federal court, the U.S. Marshal's office has primary responsibility for arresting people on contempt warrants. The [U.S. Marshal's office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service) primarily reports to the judicial branch, although strictly speaking, it is part of the Justice Department, and ultimately reports to the Attorney\\-General.\n\nThere are actually two kinds of contempt \\- remedial and punitive. Remedial contempt sanction can include indefinite incarceration or a fine (often a per day fine) until the violation of the order of the court ceases and is allowed only when it is possible to comply with the order going forward. Punitive contempt has a sanction comparable to a misdemeanor conviction and applies in cases where the goal is to punish someone for a past violation of a court order whether or not it is possible to comply going forward.\n\n(Both of these are examples of \"indirect contempt\", i.e. violations of court orders that take place outside the courtroom. A different summary process called \"direct contempt\" applies when someone misbehaves in the presence of the court \\- this is summary incarceration or fine without a trial on the spot for disrespecting the dignity of the court in the courtroom.)\n\nEstablished practice is to direct a contempt order at the lowest level official necessary to remedy the violation of the order. There are a few examples in living memory of cabinet members being held in contempt, however (e.g. the Secretary of Interior, with regard to Indian Trust fund litigation), and keep in mind that in the case of remedial contempt an official can purge the contempt and be released from any sanction by resigning from office, after which the official no longer has the ability to comply. \n\nI am not aware of any instance in which the President of the United States has personally been held in contempt of court, but I am also not aware of any authority that specifically prohibits a court from holding the President in contempt of court.\n\nWhile contempt is the only \"hard\" remedy for a violation of a court order, the bureaucratic structure of the federal government is also set up in a manner that once a court order definitively resolves a legal issue, the higher ups in a federal agency are supposed to take all reasonable actions to insure that their subordinates follow that order (and they are themselves subject to contempt sanctions if they fail to do so). And, keep in mind that most of the people in the chain of command are civil servants with legal protections from unlawful employment actions hired on a merit basis, not political appointees, and that lots of the people in the chain of command are also members of unions that provide individual employees with the ability to fight wrongful employment action from a superior for violating a court order. \n\nIn particular, the top lawyers in the executive branch would in ordinary times direct government employees to follow a clear court order and to cease and desist from explicitly disobeying one. Among other things, the courts could probably deny lawyers who refused to do so the right to practice law in federal court. But, usually things never reach this point. Then again, we are living in interesting times.\n\nThere are about 670 political appointee positions in the executive branch, many of which are currently vacant and less than a dozen of which would be relevant to any given dispute in any case. There are about a million, civilian, non\\-defense department, non\\-postal service employees in the United States government, of which perhaps 100,000 or so are in the Department of Homeland Security and fewer are in the CBP. As far as I know, the CBP political appointees from the Obama administration have resigned and a replacement has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate yet (there has been a Department of Homeland Security appointee confirmed if I recall correctly), and there are only a few people in the agency that political appointees can hire without either receiving Senate confirmation or using the merit based hiring process for civil servants (which takes a while, especially given an executive order imposing a hiring freeze). So, realistically, we have a case where the acting head of the CBP is probably a GS\\-15 or Senior Executive Service grade civil servant, rather than a political appointee, at the moment, who was hired as a civil servant many years ago, who is doing his (or her) best to follow the less than clear guidance he is receiving from his superiors and government lawyers (perhaps errantly).\n\nThere could also be remedies in the form of declaratory judgment. The Court could declare as a matter of law on a case by case basis that, for example, Fatima Jones is not deportable and is lawfully within the United States and is entitled to be released from custody. This specific finding as to an individual would be very hard for the administration to escape sanction for. \n\nAnd, the Court could also declare that the entire executive order, at least as applied, is invalid (e.g. for failure to comply with the administrative procedures act, or for failing to include an exception for contrary court orders) or is unconstitutional.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where a federal court issues a clear ruling that border officials must not turn back refugees, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) explicitly refuses to comply, which of the following sequences of events is most likely to occur according to established legal procedures?\n\nA) The President would be immediately held in contempt of court and arrested by U.S. Marshals.\n\nB) The court would issue an order to show cause to a relevant government official, potentially leading to contempt proceedings and sanctions against the individual or organization.\n\nC) U.S. Marshals would immediately arrest all CBP officers at the border without any further legal proceedings.\n\nD) The court would have no recourse and would be forced to abandon its ruling due to lack of enforcement power.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, the typical process would involve the court issuing an order to show cause to a government official alleged to have violated the court order. This could lead to contempt proceedings, which may result in sanctions against the individual or the organization they represent. The process involves several steps, including potential hearings and opportunities for the accused to respond, rather than immediate arrest or inaction.

Any court cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every country has its own copyright laws. In the US, the first thing it depends on is the Department of Justice, which decides whether to prosecute. This is the [prosecution policy of the DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-71000-copyright-law) (having said that, there are also state laws against copyright infringement, so it is possible that some state attorney general will pursue a case... you need to look into the matter on a state\\-by\\-state basis: usually, the matter has to be prosecuted at the federal level). The relevant US law is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/506). One of three things must be true, for criminal prosecution. One is that the action was \"for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain\"; or, \n\"by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180\u2013day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000\"; or \"by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution\".\n\nThe stipulation that this is \"for personal use\" precludes re\\-distribution cases, but leaves open the possibility of jail time for \"massive\" personal infringement. It is highly likely that many infringers do in fact download more than $1,000 worth of content in a 180 day period. [This article](https://www.mediainstitute.org/2011/05/25/will-you-go-to-jail-for-copyright-infringement/) addresses the \"will you go to jail\" question. The author notes that it is \"highly unlikely\", and \"there were fewer than two hundred criminal intellectual property convictions in 2010\" which included trademark cases... also, not every conviction results in imprisonment (fines are also possible). [This report](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/ipt02.txt) from the Bureau of Justice Statistics notes that\n\n> Of the 134 IP theft defendants sentenced in 2002, 58 (43%) received\n>  some imprisonment with a term ranging from 1 to 46 months and a median\n>  of 15 months. In 1998, 34% of defendants were sentenced to prison with\n>  a range of 1 to 30 months and median of 10 months.\n\nHowever, this does not narrowly report just \"personal use infringement\" imprisonments. One can speculate as to why the federal government is not more aggressive with prosecuting personal\\-use downloaders. The first reason (in the long list of reasons) is that personal\\-use downloaders are least likely to get caught. The last reason (on my list) is that under sentencing guidelines, a personal\\-use infringer is least likely to trigger imprisonment. [This manual](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/about/overview/Overview_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines.pdf) explains sentencing guidelines and the 43 levels of seriousness, and [this](https://www.whitecollarcrimeresources.com/federal-sentencing-guidelines-for-criminal-copyright-cases.html) explains the factors that go into computing the seriousness of infringement.

See the other question [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76413/how-to-ignore-lawyers-and-how-to-not-ignore-lawyers).\n\nTypically, I find that when speaking with an attorney, the attorney's \\#1 priority is protecting you which could set an intimidating tone with the other party and change how relationship proceeds from there. So speaking with an attorney or bringing them into the picture is always a big step as the attorney also has to do their best to keep you in mind which without oversight and good judgement on your part could lead to uncomfortable interactions with the other party.\n\nSometimes its not only about protecting you, its also about finding a win\\-win while still maintaining your rights, educating you how the law applies to your case, what actions you as an informed individual can take and how to negotiate the different enumerable interactions with the other party.\n\nSo let's say someone is interested in hiring an attorney but hasn't understood exactly how to interact with attorneys yet.\n\n* How do you explain your case to the attorney? What facts do you bring up? What documents do you provide, etc.?\n* How do you set the tone with your attorney? How to get the attorney to understand so that you are represented satisfactorily?\n\n(Note that in case of criminal cases, clearly win\\-win is a strange concept so I'm not considering criminal case types in my question, but specifically dealing with other party's in which the end goal is to find a win\\-win while still being represented to your satisfaction.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So for your first two questions, you want to look for attorneys that specialize in your area of Law. For example, if you're facing a murder trial, best not to look at lawyers specializing in contract law. Yeah, they could represent you... but they'd be out of their depth as they don't do this normally. Similarly one wouldn't want to have a criminal defense attorney help them through a suit against the cops for a violation of civil rights.\n\nEven in specializations, Lawyers might further specialize. There are Criminal Defense Attorneys who specialize in traffic court cases and would be out of place in a murder trial. There are prosecutors who are good at prosecuting white collar crimes with huge money and paper trails. Others focus on drug crimes, or what have you.\n\nOften if attorneys aren't right for you, they will refer you to an attorney who would be better.\n\nAs for questions regarding what to tell them, really, you should absolutely honest with an attorney. Attorney\\-client privilege exists to for this reason, as the attorney can only best advise you in your legal disputes. If you did the thing you're accused of, let the attorney know in detail. It could be a case of the cops are right for the wrong reasons and if they don't have the right reasons, that evidence could be attacked (suppose you're accused of murdering someone by stabbing them. Which is not entirely true. You did try to murder them... but you poisoned them. If the cops aren't bringing up poison, negotiating that difference would get you off since it introduces doubt to stab being COD.).\n\nAnd yes, Win\\-Win is completely viable in U.S. criminal law, depending on your definition of win. If you could be charged with a capital offense, coming to a plea agreement of life without parole is a win\\-win because you don't get executed, while the state gets to say the punished a bad guy (not to mention, saves money on the expensive process that is going to trial). In a similar vein, they may have you dead to rights on \"Drug possession\" but are wobbly on \"Possession with intent to sell.\" They might offer the lesser offense (Drug possession) in exchange for not having to prove what you intended to do with the amount you had, which might cause them to lose as it's harder to prove.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An individual is seeking legal representation for a complex civil rights case against law enforcement.

When modifying an existing lease agreement, such as adding a new tenant, both parties are essentially negotiating a change to the contract. The landlord has the right to set terms for this modification, including fees. The tenant can then choose to accept these terms or decline to make the change. There's no legal requirement forcing the landlord to modify the lease without compensation, nor is there a set limit on such fees in Washington State.

The example of Russia's annexation of Crimea illustrates that even unilateral actions can create complex situations where legal and practical control may differ.

On February 22, when 328 deputies voted to remove Yanukovich from the office (with 116 absent and 6 abstaining), the normal impeachment procedures weren't followed. That is, Yanukovich was not formally charged with a crime and the charge was not reviewed by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. Instead, the legal basis for the vote to dismiss Yanukovich and to appoint early election was claimed to be the fact that Yanukovich \"withdrew from his duties in an unconstitutional manner\" \\- in other words, his whereabouts were unknown, and it was later reported that he fled the country bypassing normal clearance procedures.\n\nI don't have the precise timeline, but on the same February 22 as the vote to dismiss Yanukovich (presumably, before the vote happened), the Euromaidan activists arrived at the president's Mezhyhirya Residence and found Yanukovich gone, with plenty documentation and other evidence of multiple crimes left behind.

The vote received 328 out of 450 deputies' support, which falls short of the constitutionally required 3/4 majority (338 votes) for impeachment.

For instance, a cinema may have a newsletter announcing which movies will run on which date, with short descriptions of them. It's just not reasonable to expect that they put out a \"marketing\\-free\" newsletter stating the dates on which the cinema is open, omitting the actual movies! That's just silly. Permission for the newsletter includes permission for the embedded marketing of the movies. Still, that newsletter is independent from the actual cinema service itself. \n\nIn your case, it appears that there is no relation between the marketing and the actual service.

The practical tool for translating statutory language to human\\-decidable question is the jury instruction. There is no single jury instruction for all federal computer access laws. The Dept. of Justice has some draft [jury instructions here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ccmanual.pdf) starting p. 157, with no explanation of their authority.

The law also says that an earnings statement may be in any form determined by the employer. Second, there is no law requiring there to be a single earnings statement or a combined statement, in case a person is paid at different rates, the requirement is simply that the information must be provided. It is legal to hire a person to work at different rates, as long as they have some mechanism for tracking what a person is doing.

However, the law does not specify that this information must be presented in a single statement or format. The employer has the flexibility to determine the form of the earnings statement, as long as all required information is provided.

I will give an opinion on both aspects, but first I have to give you a word of warning:\n\n*This case is not clear in the sense that the law can be immediately apply. For a full answer you need the services of a practicing lawyer who does the necessary research. I have a degree in German Law and I have had some practice in IT law, so I know what I am talking about, but I am currently not practicing it and I have done no research for this case. So please, pretty please, don't base any important decision on my opinion. It is a mere guidance, not more.*\n\n**Criminal Law**\n\nThe German Criminal Code (StGB) specifies two cyber crimes explicitly:\n\n1. Computer Fraud (Computerbetrug, [\u00a7 263a StGB](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/263a.html)), which you violate when you gain some illegal monetary advantage using a computer, for example a hacker using your stolen credit card data to transfer funds to his account.\n2. Computer Sabotage (Computersabotage, [\u00a7 303b StGB](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/303b.html)), which applies when you cause damage with a computer, for example a hacker attacking the power grid.\n\nThe second option clearly does not apply here, but the first one could. That would depend on the answer to a couple of questions, most importantly if a user would gain some monetary advantage at your expense and if that advantage would be illegal.\n\nThe first of these questions (advantage at your expense) already does not have a clear and universal answer. As it is quite common with fraud, this criminal law question has a civil law aspect (more on that on part two of the answer). The two ways how this could create an advantage to an attacker world be...\n\n1. A contract would not be enacted between you and the attacker, but he would take advantage of you believing in the contract's validity. This option would though probably not apply here, judging from the (spoiler alert) civil law part of the question.\n2. A valid contract would be created, but the terms and conditions would not apply and that would cause an illegal financial advantage for the attacker at your cost. Since the base contract would still be in effect and that comes with the obligation to pay, that advantage would have to be in the terms and conditions not applying. You can construct such a case, but that would depend on the terms in question, so there can not be an answer here. There is though a good chance that the terms would still apply (see below), so there will probably be no damage.\n\nThe other aspect is if this advantage would be through *illegal* use of the system, which is an interesting question in your case, since the link is publicly accessible. But, then again you can also fake a POST, so you can argue that it is always possible to make the terms not appear.\n\nAn aspect to be considered though, is that merely *attempting* computer fraud is already an offense. An attacker who thinks he can gain a monetary advantage from such an attack could be still punished, even if it is not even possible to commit the crime due to the circumstances (this by itself is an interesting question in criminal law).\n\nThe bigger danger that I see is that your solution makes it easy for an attacker to make their own site and then use your public link to book on your site (in a man in the middle attack). That would clearly be an offense, but it would be the attacker's not your client's. But since your success depends on the trustworthiness of your site, I would recommend to look for a safer solution (such as POST with https).\n\nTo summarize that part: There is a possibility that accessing the site in the described way is a crime, but I would say it is rather not due to the lack of damage. It is though possible that an attacker still commits a crime by attempting such an attack. You should in any case make your site safer to make it harder to commit MITM attacks. \n\n**Civil Law**\n\nThe civil law side is whether the terms can be accepted in the described way. This is a case for the law of general terms and conditions (Allgemeine Gesch\u00e4ftsbedingungen or AGB). In a few words, for AGB to apply, the have to be notified to the client and he has to accept them. If your site is used how it is supposed to be, both conditions are met.\n\nIn the (invalid) way you have described, the first condition is in question. Since the user knows that using the described URL means accepting the terms, I would consider the second condition to be satisfied. So how can the terms apply if the user has not seen them?\n\nIn case you provide no shortcut to the accepted link and you also prevent that it can be found in another way (e.g. through a search engine), the direct link would be equivalent to someone signing terms and conditions without reading them, although he has had a chance to do so. That would still make the terms apply, because the client would have been given the chance to read them, which is the only thing the seller needs to do. So chances are that your terms would still apply (thus negating the financial advantage necessary for a crime).\n\nHowever, AGB law is a complex subject that is generally handled by specialists. Any opinion of someone who is not such a specialist has to be handled with care. That includes my opinion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal analysis provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the civil law implications of a user bypassing the agreement window and directly initiating a download?\n\nA) The terms and conditions would automatically be void, as the user did not explicitly see or agree to them.\n\nB) The terms and conditions would likely still apply, as long as the user knew that using the download link implied acceptance.\n\nC) The user would be committing a clear case of computer fraud under German criminal law.\n\nD) The website owner would be liable for any misuse of their system due to the insecure implementation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The analysis suggests that from a civil law perspective, the terms and conditions would likely still apply even if the user bypassed the agreement window. This is based on the principle that if the user knows that using the download link implies acceptance of the terms, it would be similar to signing a contract without reading it, which is generally still considered binding.

Additionally, other 3rd party libraries, such as AddThis, store tracking cookies which cannot be disabled. To prevent the storage of these cookies, AddThis and some other functionality would need to not be included on the site at all if the user hadn't opted in, which could affect functionality.

The application of GDPR to cookies seems to be based on independent interpretation.\n\n**Does GDPR actually require a change to cookie banner functionality, or are current implementations sufficient?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR only mentions cookies once ([Recital 30](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-30/)). (It says that cookies are personal data if they are associated with natural persons.) \n\nAs far as cookies go, nothing has really changed since [2002](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058&from=EN), and the exception granted in the EU cookie directive Article 5(3\\) is still valid:\n\n> This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\n\nIf your site complies with the 2002 directive today, it will be GDPR compliant. All the \"EU Cookie Law Compliance\" plugins I've checked out let the admin *configure* the site to comply with the 2002 directive, and most let you choose between implicit consent (which is, and still will be, OK if you or third party services do not use cookies for profiling or to collect personal data), soft consent, or hard consent. The latter is however *mandatory* if you or third party services use cookies to for profiling or to collect personal data.\n\n**However**, if at least one of your cookies are used for profiling (and if you use Google analytics, you are), or if they are used to collect personal data, the exception from explicit consent quoted above does *not* apply and implicit consent (i.e.: \"continued use of the site amounts to implicit consent to the use of cookies\") has *never* been legal for the site.\n\nSo while nothing has changed since 2002, there is a lot of misinformation about cookies floating on the Internet, and a lot of sites have their cookie banners set up wrong.

The information provided indicates that while GDPR itself doesn't significantly change cookie regulations from the 2002 EU directive, it does reinforce the requirement for explicit consent when cookies are used for profiling or collecting personal data. Many websites use services like Google Analytics, which falls into this category. In such cases, implicit consent (such as assuming consent through continued use of the site) is not legally sufficient. The answer also highlights that this requirement isn't new with GDPR, but has been often misunderstood or incorrectly implemented.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GDPR didn't introduce new, stricter requirements specifically for cookies; it largely maintained the status quo from previous directives.\n\nOption B is incorrect because implicit consent is not always sufficient, especially when cookies are used for profiling or collecting personal data.\n\nOption D is incorrect because GDPR did not eliminate the need for cookie consent banners.

The murder committed in 2024 would be considered a new and separate offense, unrelated to the previous wrongful conviction. Double jeopardy laws prevent multiple prosecutions or punishments for the same specific crime, not for similar crimes committed at different times. Even though Person X was wrongfully convicted and served time for a crime they didn't commit in 2010, this does not grant them immunity from prosecution for actual crimes committed later.

The office was [renamed in 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/schedule/5/enacted)\nand [again in 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/part/I/crossheading/the-information-commissioner-and-the-information-tribunal/enacted), and the functions have changed along the way. The current governing legislation is the [Data Protection Act 2018, schedule 12](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/schedule/12). There have been many suggestions of changing the structure \\- such as the ICO's [Triennal Review](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/minutes-and-papers/2017/2013730/mb-triennial-review-report-20170206.pdf) of 2015, and the [Leveson Inquiry Report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270942/0780_iii.pdf) (see sections 4\\.8 and 4\\.9, p1109 of volume 3\\) of 2012 \\- but that has not happened.\n\nSo your sense that the \"corporation sole\" model is a bit unusual is shared by many distinguished minds, and even in 1984 it was probably anomalous, judging by a quick scan of contemporaneous legislation. For example, the \"Cable Authority\" [established in the same year](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/46/schedule/1/enacted) was created as a statutory corporate body, to regulate cable television. Ultimately, the Data Protection Registrar and the Cable Authority could do the same sorts of things, as far as employing people, acquiring property, entering into contracts, and so forth. There were special rules for how the Registrar and the Authority members would be appointed \\- these are *different* rules from one another, but they are both set up by primary legislation. The differences therefore fall to be explained as a matter of policy preference, since they are both legally viable ways to establish a body performing public functions \"at arm's length\" from ministers.\n\nThe main difference is at the leadership level, since as far as doing the job, people employed in the ICO are in the same position regardless of whether they work for a corporation sole or aggregate.\nIf there is one person in charge, then you have a single \"head\" salary to pay, a single selection process to run to find them, and a single point of accountability to government and to Parliament. If there is a board of directors then they all have to get chosen somehow, and responsibility can be more diffuse. But having several people can lead to better decision\\-making, and could make the organization appear less biased by having balanced representation.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Act of 1984, the creation of a Data Protection Authority (rather than a sole registrar) had been proposed many times, most notably by the [Lindop Committee](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9125) which reported on the matter in 1978\\. The idea of a registrar was developed in the Government's 1982 paper, *Data Protection: The Government's Proposals for Legislation* (Cmnd 8539\\), which led up to the Act. That recommended that there be a single independent official who would be accountable for the work, but that he would be assisted by an expert committee. Additionally, a Data Protection Tribunal would take care of the resulting legal disputes. In the actual legislation, the expert committee was not made statutory, because the government felt that it would be too difficult to define what it ought to do in a way that would stand the test of time (see [HL Deb 19 July 1983, vol 443 col 1084](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/1983-07-19/debates/b4fd8717-7224-4ca4-8fb5-3a3dae74cfc9/DataProtectionBillHl) for a Lords committee debate on this topic).

This assumes that the party reasonably believes that they have permission. This happened to the US Postal Service, which is now being sued for 4 billion infringements of an artist's copyright, apparently because somebody didn't correctly distinguish between a picture of the Statue of Liberty and a modern version.\n\n(There is apparently some confusion over Davidson's lawsuit against USPS. USPS distributed stamps reproducing Davidson's sculpture, without his permission, on the mistaken belief that the image was of the actual Statue of Liberty. Sculptural works are protected by copyright, and permission is required to create and distribute a derivative work. For a very similar post stamp infringement case involving a different sculpture, see [Gaylord v. United States](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/2625), 595 F.3d 1364\\). In that case as well, USPS did not get permission from the copyright holder. The photographer received permission from a partner in the firm that constructed the memorial in question, but the firm did not hold copyright in the infringed sculpture. USPS was then referred to the partner for permission to use the underlying work. The USPS's unsuccessful defense was based on fair use, not innocent infringement. Substantial damages were awarded to Gaylord. The outcome of Davidson has not been determined, and again, will not hinge on innocent infringement, but might hinge on fair use, or on a classification of the sculpture as part of an architectural work.

However, the court has the discretion to reduce the statutory damages to as low as $200 per infringement in cases of innocent infringement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because innocent infringement does not provide complete exemption from liability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while Party C's liability might be limited, they are not automatically free from all liability simply because they obtained the copy from a seemingly legitimate source.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the concept of innocent infringement and the court's ability to reduce statutory damages in such cases.

The restriction on purchasing Japanese e-books without a valid Japanese address is primarily due to copyright and licensing issues. Publishers typically sell rights to books on a country-by-country basis. Japanese publishers may have exclusive rights to sell certain books within Japan, while other publishers have rights in different regions. By requiring a Japanese address, online stores ensure they comply with these regional licensing agreements and avoid potential copyright infringement. This practice allows publishers to maintain control over the distribution of their content in different geographic markets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the restriction has a legal basis in copyright law and licensing agreements, not just bureaucracy. Option C is incorrect as there's no specific Japanese law prohibiting e-book sales to non-residents; it's more about complying with international copyright agreements.

Or is Australia the only country to have implemented this new taxation scheme?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This answer is limited to the United States.\n\nThere are several counterparts to this in U.S. law.\n\nThe AMIT regime is essentially the law that applies to partnerships (especially limited partnership) under Subchapter K of the U.S. tax code and to owners of S corporations. It is also similar to the tax rules that applies to regulated investment companies (RICs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and publicly held partnerships. When all income must be distributed currently under a trust to the present beneficiaries, a trust is a \"simple trust\" under U.S. law and taxed in a similar manner.\n\nThe allocation between income and principle on a means other than non\\-tax trust law allocations resembles that of \"unitrusts\" in which the current income beneficiary gets a certain percentage of the fair market value of the trust each year and the balance goes to a remainder beneficiary, rather than allocating the tax attributes of a trust between income and principle according to trust law principles.\n\n(In contrast, C\\-corporations and \"complex trusts\" under U.S. tax law, are taxed very differently than under the AMIT regime for certain trusts in Australia.)\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. law lacks \"franking credits\" in its corporate tax law system in almost all cases. Also, under U.S. law, there is not a \"potential for double taxation that may arise for members where there are mismatches between the amount distributed and the taxable income of the AMIT\\[.]\"\n\nOne feature which is novel compared to U.S. law is that:\n\n> If a variance is discovered between the amounts actually attributed to\n> members for an income year, and the amounts that should have been\n> attributed, the variance can be attributed in the income year in which\n> it is discovered by the responsible entity, rather than amending\n> previous years' tax returns and notifying members of those amendments.\n\nThis is only very rarely allowed under U.S. tax law, and the doctrines involved when it is allowed justify this kind of treatment differently in terms of tax law theory.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between Australia's AMIT regime and similar tax structures in the United States?\n\nA) The AMIT regime is unique to Australia and has no comparable counterpart in U.S. tax law.\n\nB) The AMIT regime closely mirrors the tax treatment of C-corporations in the United States.\n\nC) The AMIT regime shares similarities with the tax treatment of partnerships, S corporations, and certain investment trusts in the U.S., but has some distinct features.\n\nD) The AMIT regime is identical to the U.S. tax treatment of regulated investment companies (RICs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The AMIT regime in Australia shares several similarities with certain U.S. tax structures, particularly the treatment of partnerships under Subchapter K, S corporations, regulated investment companies (RICs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and publicly held partnerships.

[Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) suggests that you shouldn't attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence. \n\nAssuming that you have talked to the agent and they are insisting that the unit on the lease is the unit you rented. On the face of it, you signed a lease to rent unit B, the fact that you saw and were given information about unit A is irrelevant.\n\nFrom a strict contract law position, the [parol evidence rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parol_evidence_rule#Specific_jurisdictions), which is [good law](https://law.justia.com/cases/maryland/court-of-special-appeals/1980/270-september-term-1980-0.html) in Maryland, means that when a contract is reduced to writing then that is the entire agreement between the parties and you cannot turn to prior discussions or correspondence. The justification for this rule is that parties may adopt many positions during negotiations and that they may be modified or abandoned many times during those negotiations but when the final agreement is reduced to writing then it says what the parties mean it to say. \n\nHowever, where there are allegations of fraud, accident or mistake, you can consider matters circumstantial to the execution of the contract.\n\nI really think that you will have a hard time proving fraud and, to be honest, I don't know what Glass v Doctors Hospital, Inc. 213 Md. 44, 56 (1957\\) meant when they uised the term \"accident\". \n\nWhat you have here is a unilateral mistake i.e. a mistake made by one party (you). Unfortunately:\n\n> It is the rule in general that a contract will not be reformed for a unilateral mistake, nor does such a mistake, of itself render the transaction voidable. However, equitable relief by way of rescission1 may be given if the mistake relates to a material feature of the contract, if it is of such grave consequence that enforcement of the contract as made will be unconscionable, if it occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary diligence by the party making the mistake, and if the other party can be put in statu quo.\n\nOf the four elements, you are good to go on 1, 2 \\& 4\\. No 3 is where the trouble is \\- \"it occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary diligence by the party making the mistake\". Without knowing all the surrounding details (e.g. were you shown multiple dwellings, where addresses sent in correspondence etc.) I can't really comment on if you showed \"ordinary dilligence\" or not.\n\n1 Rescission means the contract never happened \\- everyone goes back to the status quo. this remedy is not available where third\\-parties would suffer damage from this.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, where a tenant signed a lease for an apartment that turned out to be different from the one they viewed, which of the following is the most accurate legal assessment?\n\nA) The parol evidence rule definitively prevents the tenant from using any prior discussions or correspondence to challenge the lease.\n\nB) The tenant can easily prove fraud and void the contract based on the switch in apartment units.\n\nC) The tenant may have a case for rescission based on unilateral mistake, but it depends on whether they exercised \"ordinary diligence\".\n\nD) Consumer protection laws in Maryland automatically void any lease where the property differs from what was initially shown.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. While the parol evidence rule generally prevents consideration of prior discussions in contract interpretation (ruling out A), there are exceptions for fraud, accident, or mistake. Proving fraud would be difficult in this case (ruling out B), and there's no mention of specific consumer protection laws that would automatically void the lease (ruling out D). \n\nThe situation best fits a case of unilateral mistake. For the tenant to get relief through rescission, they must show the mistake relates to a material feature, has grave consequences, occurred despite ordinary diligence, and the other party can be returned to their original position. The key factor here is whether the tenant exercised \"ordinary diligence,\" which would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the lease signing."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13839/can-i-make-gallery-apps-of-famous-celebrity-like-justin-and-michel-jackson", "docs_id": 13839, "title": "Can I make gallery apps of famous celebrity like Justin and michel Jackson?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Not sure this is the right place to ask this question here or not?

Personality rights of the depicted person\n2. Copyright of the photographer\n\nThe first is the right of the person in the image. Laws on this vary widely around the world. In some countries, people can forbid the distribution of images which depict them under some circumstances. However, celebrities and other \"people of public interest\" usually have fewer rights than private people. \n\nThe second is the right of the photographer who took the picture. Thanks to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), this situation is far more homogeneous around the world: In most places around the world, a photograph is considered an artistic work by the photographer, regardless of what is depicted in the photo.

The developer risks violating both the personality rights of the musician and the copyrights of the photographers who took the images. While personality rights laws vary by country, many places protect celebrities' images to some degree. More importantly, thanks to the Berne Convention, photographs are generally protected by copyright law in most countries around the world, regardless of the subject matter. The photographer, not the subject, holds the copyright to the image. Using these images without permission, especially for commercial purposes (like an ad-supported app), would likely violate copyright law.

The one video I tried had the music with no accompanying video or images. The channel's about page says that then operator does not own the copyrights to the music and cannot grant others permission to play it.\n\nIt is possible that the channel operator has obtained permission from the artists and is thus operating under a valid license. It is possible that the channel is committing copyright infringement, but the various copyright owners have not noticed the channel, or have noticed it but decided not to take action. There is no easy way for an outsider to tell which of these is correct.\n\nIf the operator has not obtained proper permission, then it seems that this would be copyright infringement. If so, any copyright owner could send a takedown notice, use YouTube's own copyright complaint mechanism, or could file a copyright infringement suit.

In the US at least the owner could also obtain a court order (injunction) requiring the operator to stop using the owner's copyrighted music.\n\nIf the owner complained to YouTube, the site could add a \"copyright strike\" against the operator's account. After a few strikes (I think three) YouTube will cancel the account, according to its posted policies.\n\nSimilar outcomes could face anyone else who posted or made available for streaming copyrighted content (such as music) without permission from the copyright owner.

Often times you can just go down to the courthouse and obtain a Temporary Restraining Order ***ex parte*** (without notice to the restrained party) and ***pro se*** (without counsel) on the same day.\n\nYou just need to fill out some forms and swear a statement before the commissioner in my jurisdiction. There are even people at the courthouse who will help guide you through the procedure (mostly volunteers for Domestic Violence prevention). A permanent restraining order can come later. But this should at least address the issue of the counterparty showing up at your door. If he does so after you get a restraining order (and have him ***served*** with it), you can call the police and have him arrested for violating the restraining order even if he does nothing else wrong.\n\n### Evidence\n\nSecondly, I would build a legal case. [If you search google for the term ***decibel meter*** you will see that you can purchase one for about $70\\-$80](https://www.google.com/search?q=decibel%20meter). (Or there are probably some phone apps you can download too.) You might want to get one, then measure the decibel levels next time your neighbor complains or just in general.\n\nRecord on video the measurement in various rooms of the apartment then compare that to what the law says.

Obtaining a temporary restraining order provides immediate legal protection against the neighbor's aggressive behavior. Using a decibel meter to measure and record noise levels provides objective evidence that can be used to counter the neighbor's complaints and demonstrate compliance with local noise ordinances and lease terms. This two-pronged approach aligns with the advice given in the documentation to prioritize safety first and then gather evidence.\n\nOption A is premature without sufficient evidence.
