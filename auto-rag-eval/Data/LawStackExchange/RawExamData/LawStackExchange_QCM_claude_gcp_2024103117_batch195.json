Ohio as:\n\n> whether at \\[the moment of arrest] the facts and circumstances within \\[an officer's] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information \\[are] sufficient to warrant a prudent \\[person] in believing that \\[a suspect] had committed or was committing an offense\n\nIn the context of warrants, the Oxford Companion to American Law defines probable cause as:\n\n> information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)\n\nIn Brinegar v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court defines probable cause as:\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nIn the scenario that you describe the testimony of the child almost certainly gives rise to probable cause.

According to the provided information, the testimony of a minor reporting sexual messages would likely be sufficient to establish probable cause for a warrant. The Supreme Court has defined probable cause as information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that evidence of a crime would be found in a search. If granted, such a warrant would typically be broad enough to allow investigators to follow leads, including examining related accounts and IP addresses, even if the initial account shows no evidence due to deletion.

For example, Murder is illegal because a law prohibits killing someone for any reason but self\\-defense.\n\nUnconstitutional is a law that contradicts the constitution\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is more easily shown with an example:\n\nLet's assume that the constitution of Borovia contains a provision that enshrines equality of humans:\n\n> Article 1: Every human is to be treated the same way by any law.

It's unconstitutional because it violates the principle of equal treatment under the law, which is typically enshrined in most constitutions (similar to the example of Borovia's constitution in the given text). It discriminates against people based on a physical characteristic (hair color), which goes against the concept of equality before the law. \n\nIt's also illegal because all unconstitutional laws are, by definition, illegal.

This ordinance would likely violate both constitutional principles and specific anti-discrimination laws that exist in most jurisdictions.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they misunderstand the relationship between illegality and unconstitutionality.

I'll try to answer as much as I can. For clarity, I split your post into multiple simpler questions.\n\nAs to jurisdiction: I'll try to keep my answer general for most European jurisdictions, additionally citing UK law.\n\nIs \"hitting back\" self\\-defence?\n--------------------------------\n\n*It depends.*\n\nTo quote the definition of self\\-defence:\n\n> A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the \n>  prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of \n>  offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.\n\n*[Criminal Law Act 1967, section 3 (1\\)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/3)*\n\nAs you can see, violence is only self\\-defence if it is a) to prevent a crime, or b) to assist with a lawful arrest.\n\nSo if you just hit back to retaliate, it is not self\\-defence. However, if you believe the attacker will hit you again, and hit them to prevent this, it *is* self\\-defence. Of course, which case applies is something a judge/jury would have to decide, thus the answer \"it depends\".\n\nDoes it make a difference if violence was preceded by provocative actions?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Yes, but only for the person provoking.*\n\nIn your second example, the violence was preceded by a \"heated discussion\", possibly involving threats. Self defence is only permissible, as the term implies, to actually defend against a threat. Hitting someone because they annoyed you does not count.\n\nThat said, if you are accused of a violent act, the fact that you were provoked will probably count as a mitigating circumstance. However, this will at best reduce your sentence, it will not make something count as self\\-defence.\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, if Jill provokes Jack, and Jack then proceeds to hit her, this will (somewhat simplifying) make it more difficult for Jill to later claim self\\-defence if she hits back. Since she provoked the attack, she is only allowed to defend herself, but not to attack preventively (which would normally be considered self\\-defence). The idea is that you cannot provoke someone into attacking you, then attack back claiming self\\-defence.\n\nDoes it matter whether the people involved are adults or minors?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Probably not.*\n\nAs far as I can tell, the right to self\\-defence does not make distinctions based on age, so with respect to determining whether an act was in self\\-defence, it would not matter.

If Sam believes Alex will hit again and uses reasonable force to prevent this, it could be considered self-defense. This aligns with the explanation that hitting back to prevent another attack, rather than just to retaliate, may qualify as self-defense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because hitting back is not automatically self-defense; it depends on the circumstances and intent. Option B is wrong because verbal provocation does not justify physical violence as self-defense.

It must be emphasized that each decision point represents an unsettled area of law. Nobody knows which path through that flowchart the law will take, or even if different forms or implementations of AI might take different paths. The short and disappointing answer to your question is that **nobody knows what is or isn't legal yet.**\n\nTo further elaborate on each decision point:\n\n* The first point is asking whether the training process requires a license at all. There are two possible reasons to think that it does not:\n\t+ AI training is protected by fair use (see [17 USC 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107)). This is a case\\-by\\-case inquiry that would have to be decided by a judge.\n\t+ AI training is nothing more than the collection of statistical information relating to a work, and does not involve \"copying\" the work within the meaning of [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) (except for a *de minimis* period which is similar to the caching done by a web browser, and therefore subject to a fair use defense).\n* The second point is, I think, asking whether the model is subject to copyright protection under [*Feist v. Rural*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990/89-1909) and related caselaw. Because the model is trained by a purely automated process, there's a case to be made that the model is not the product of human creativity, and is therefore unprotected by copyright altogether.\n\t+ Dicta in *Feist* suggest that the person or entity directing the training might be able to obtain a \"thin\" copyright in the \"selection or organization\" of training data, but no court has ever addressed this to my knowledge.\n\t+ This branch can also be read as asking whether the output of the model is copyrightable, when the model is run with some prompt or input. The Copyright Office [seems to think](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence) the answer to that question is \"no, because a human didn't create it.\"\n* The third decision point is, uniquely, not a legal question, but a practical question: Do you intend to distribute anything, or are you just using it for your own private entertainment? This determines whether you need to consult the rest of the flowchart or not.\n* The final decision point is whether the \"output\" (i.e. either the model itself, or its output) is a derivative work of the training input.\n\t+ This would likely be decided on the basis of [substantial similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity), which is a rather complicated area of law.

Other formal requirements can have a similar effect (requirement for a contract to be in writing, in certain domains, for example).\n\nHe argues that the requirement for consideration provides a useful \"channelling\" function, in that it assists in carving out as a class those promises which people will be held to be bound to. Most of the article is devoted to explaining the ways in which this channelling function produces a worthwhile categorization.\n\nAs for your specific question about peppercorn or \"nominal\" consideration, Fuller writes:\n\n> The proper ground for upholding these decisions would seem to be that the desiderata underlying\n> the use of formalities are here satisfied by the fact that the parties have\n> taken the trouble to cast their transaction in the form of an exchange.\n> The promise supported by nominal consideration then becomes enforceable for reasons similar to those which justify the enforcement of the\n> promise under seal.\n\n---\n\nIn your example though, I actually don't see the contract issue. You ask, \"what's the point of not enforcing a contract where Alice gives Bob the plane with no consideration from Bob?\" But Alice can absolutely choose to gift an airplane to Bob. For a gift, there merely needs to be transfer, donative intent, and acceptance. That does not involve a contract law issue. The transfer would be complete and there would be no further obligation either side could be in breach of.

Can any of their lawyers speak at the trial? For example, if an objection is made to questioning of a witness, can any of the attorneys make the objection, or does the objection have to come from a specific designated attorney?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Almost none of this is written down anywhere in official court rules but there are some widely adopted standards for this practice.\n\nMost courts require that only one lawyer be in charge of speaking at any given stage of the trial. But, it wouldn't be unusual, for example, for one lawyer to question most of the witnesses and for a different lawyer who is more familiar with the specialized subject matter in question (e.g. electrical specifications), usually a junior lawyer, to question the expert witnesses in a case.\n\nAlso, if the usually designated lawyer is absent for some reason (stuck in traffic, sick, etc.), the \"second chair\" lawyer can (and is often required to) take over the case for the client until the \"first chair\" lawyer is available again.\n\nMostly, second chair lawyers (I've spent plenty of time over the years in this role) do the following (a non\\-exclusive list):\n\n* take notes,\n* pay attention to how the judge and jury are reacting to testimony,\n* provide input into jury selection decisions,\n* reminds the primary lawyer of points that still need to be covered in the examination of a witness,\n* reminds the primary lawyer of exhibits that still need to be formally offered into evidence,\n* scrambles to find rebuttal or impeachment evidence for unanticipated testimony,\n* prompts the primary lawyer to make objections if the primary lawyer was paying attention to something else,\n* identifies and has at the ready exhibits needs to present (or to follow the other side's examination),\n* looks up points of law that are relevant or will need to be referenced that come up during trial,\n* handles logistics for witnesses who are not on the stand (keeping them in the hallway if the witness is sequestered, trying to obtain the appearance of no show witnesses or reshuffling their order, saying thank you to witnesses who are no longer on the stand, etc.),\n* carries some of the litigation team's stuff into and out of the court room,\n* provides informed commentary and suggestions during breaks and working lunches, etc.\n\nAlso, in addition to the usual \"first chair\" and \"second chair\" roles, often supplemented by a paralegal or legal assistant, there is a different kind of arrangement in which different lawyers for the same person can fully participate. This far less common arrangement happens when the person showing up in court is wearing \"more than one hat\" and has a different lawyer in different capacities. \n\nFor example, suppose that someone is the President of a corporation and both the corporation and the President individually are both sued.

According to the information provided, most courts require that only one lawyer be in charge of speaking at any given stage of the trial. This doesn't mean it's always the same lawyer throughout the entire proceedings. Different lawyers may take the lead for different parts of the trial based on their expertise or specific circumstances. For example, one lawyer might handle most witness questioning, while another with specialized knowledge might examine expert witnesses. The \"second chair\" lawyer can also take over if the primary lawyer is unavailable. While multiple lawyers may be present, they typically don't all speak freely during the trial.

As you'll probably be aware (from cases like EU vs Microsoft and EU vs Google) European countries and culture tend to have much stronger protection laws for consumer and employee rights than the US does. \n\nIn the UK you could make a strong case, although such cases are not often undertaken. The current legislation is Part 2 of the\u00a0Consumer Rights Act 2015, but the unfair contract terms clause goes back to at least the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999\\. Basically the law protects a person in a situation where disparity of size and bargaining power have led to unfair terms in a contract (typically a large company offering \"take it or leave it\" standard terms) \\- and specifically if they create a significant disparity in the parties rights and obligations. In such a situation the company which drafted the terms alleged to be unfair must show they are reasonable. A list of common terms likely to be seen as unfair is provided. (Employment terms are covered by other laws but also aim to prevent abuses due to inequality of contracting power)\n\nA company which sold a product like Windows 7/8/8\\.1 and then later said \"we are changing our terms of support and forcing you to upgrade\" (especially to a different product the user may not want, or a product that is maintained in a different way),would almost certainly be at substantial risk of falling foul of this. \n\nIt wouldn't matter if it was done by not providing the support/patches as originally implied (by custom or normal expectation) or as agreed in an explicit statement of support life cycle, or by saying \"we have the right under the contract to do this\", or by forcing what is essentially a change of product to get the updates. It also wouldnt matter how big they are, nor whether or not the user had *already* agreed \"because I felt I had no choice\".

The information provided suggests that under UK consumer protection laws, particularly the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and earlier regulations, Microsoft's forced Windows 10 upgrades could potentially violate unfair contract terms clauses. The law protects consumers against situations where large companies use their bargaining power to impose unfair terms, especially when significantly changing the rights and obligations of parties. Forcing users to upgrade to a different product they may not want, or changing how the product is maintained, could fall under this protection.

As explained in the provided information, when faced with parallel civil and criminal proceedings, defendants typically seek to stay the civil litigation until the criminal trial is completed. This strategy serves multiple purposes:\n\n1.

Testimony given in a civil court can be used as evidence against you in a criminal case, if the statute of limitations on the alleged crime has not expired.\n\nAlso, what he is doing is probably within the definition of the crimes of blackmail or extortion. In theory, if this is reported to the police, they could ask the local prosecutor to prosecute him for this serious felony, while choosing not to prosecute what is probably a minor misdemeanor or petty offense, if it is a crime at all (which your questions suggests that it is), and upon which the statute of limitations may have run as to many, if not all, of the alleged offenses.\n\nBut, the prosecutor could also decide to do nothing even if there is strong evidence of blackmail and as a practical matter there is little or nothing you could do about that choice.\n\nThe contract or loan papers would also be unenforceable in most U.S. jurisdictions if the consideration for that contract was revealed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An individual who previously worked as an escort is being sued in civil court for breach of contract.

While the civil court judge cannot directly initiate criminal proceedings (eliminating D), any testimony given under oath in civil court could potentially be used as evidence in a future criminal case if relevant crimes are within the statute of limitations.

Maybin*, 2012 SCC 24](https://canlii.ca/t/frczg#par38)).\n\nForeseeability does not require that the intervening action be *probable*; it only requires that it would not be brushed aside as \"far\\-fetched.\"\n\n> The degree of probability that would satisfy the reasonable foreseeability requirement was described in *The Wagon Mound (No. 2\\)* as a \"real risk\", i.e. \"one which would occur to the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the defendan\\[t] ... and which **he would not brush aside as far\\-fetched**\"\n> \n> \n> ([*Mustapha v. Culligan of Canada Ltd.*, 2008 SCC 27, paragraph 13](https://canlii.ca/t/1wz6f#par13)).\n\nExamples of intervening acts held to be reasonably foreseeable:\n\n* *Haynes v. Harwood* \\[1935] 1 K.B. 146\\. A carriage owner had left a two\\-horse carriage unattended on a busy street. The judge accepted evidence from an independent observer that two boys had come along and one of them threw a stone at the horses and the horses bolted along the street (these boys were not before the court as co\\-defendants; nothing more is said of them). A constable managed to stop the horses, but was injured in the process. The carriage owner was liable in negligence: a reasonable person should have foreseen that the horses might get loose and someone be injured while trying to stop them. The court said, \"**it is not necessary to show that this particular accident and this particular damage were probable**; it is sufficient if the accident is of a class that might well be anticipated as one of the reasonable and probable results of the wrongful act.\"\n\n### Foreseeability here does not have its colloquial meaning\n\n[Greendrake's answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92946/46948) says that \"whereas Bob's shock is foreseeable, I pretty much doubt that him breaking the TV is.\" In my view, this takes too colloquial a view of foreseeability. As Hart and Honor\u00e9 say in *Causation in the Law*, 2nd Ed. (1985\\):\n\n> ... in one sense everything is foreseeable, in another nothing. The consequences of negligence are almost invariably surprises. All depends on the detail with which the harm is described. ... there will always be some details of the recoverable harm which are not foreseeable.\n> \n> \n> ... the fact that harm described by reference to certain details is not foreseeable does not render the harm, *more broadly described*, unforeseeable. ... If we have learned from experience to expect a 'rainstorm' on seeing dark clouds, then the rainstorm was foreseeable even if, when it occurs, it has other characteristics (e.g. lasted two hours, covered an area of 40 sq. miles) which we could not foresee but which might appear, *ex post facto*, in a more specific description of it.\n\nOf course, foreseeability is a question of fact, and I acknowledge that a finder of fact might very well conclude that swinging a vacuum is not within a class of actions that might be anticipated by a reasonable person. While I disagree with Greendrake's analysis and conclusion, the contrast with my answer helps highlight precisely where the issue would be if this were to be litigated.\n\n---\n\n1\\.

Alice? Rob? Both?\n\nWould the answer change if Rob was a close relative to Alice e.g. her adult son?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Rob is responsible. No Bull!**\n\nAround the world, the law of wandering cattle depends on the details. New Zealand is no different.\n\nThis case is covered by s 26 of the *Impounding Act of 1955*, [*Damages for Trespass*](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0108/latest/whole.html#DLM294171). As you said, S 26(1\\)(d) says Bob is entitled to damages whenever his \"land (*whether fenced or unfenced*) is situated in a city.\" This is different to the rest of the country, where *animals must be fenced out.*\n\nS 26(2\\) of the *Impounding Act* says the damage is owed by Rob, as the *owner* of the stock:\n\n> (2\\) *In any case* where damages are payable under this section the amount of any damage *shall be recoverable* by action from the *owner of the stock*.\n\nIt may be that Rob and Alice have some arrangement that Alice will indemnify Rob against any trespass damages. But that agreement does not change the underlying law; it only allows him to recoup his loses (by suing his mother, if necessary!).\n\n**Added: Something fun to read**\n\nLaw professor Robert Ellickson studied how people actually resolve disputes over wandering cattle in Shasta county in northern California. There's a readable summary of what he found [here](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&context=fss_papers#page=35). (The title of his book, \"[Order without law](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674641693),\" sums up his main finding \\-\\- there are rules that are enforced, but those rules have little to do with the formal law or law enforcement.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, if Bob decides to take legal action for the damages caused by the bull, who would be the primary defendant according to New Zealand law?\n\nA) Alice, as the owner of the land where the bull was grazing\nB) Rob, as the owner of the bull\nC) Both Alice and Rob equally\nD) The local city council for not enforcing proper fencing regulations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the Impounding Act of 1955, specifically Section 26(2), the damages are recoverable from the owner of the stock, which in this case is Rob. The act states that \"In any case where damages are payable under this section the amount of any damage shall be recoverable by action from the owner of the stock.\" This holds true regardless of any arrangement between Rob and Alice, or their relationship. Alice's ownership of the land does not make her primarily responsible for the damages caused by Rob's bull. The local council is not involved in this specific dispute between private landowners. Therefore, Rob, as the owner of the bull, would be the primary defendant in any legal action for damages."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84954/verbal-advice-trumping-standing-corporate-policy-which-contract-prevails", "docs_id": 84954, "title": "Verbal advice trumping standing corporate policy: which contract prevails?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Meet Alice. Alice entered a branch of a corporate retail chain and had a verbal dialogue with the cashier before making a purchase. She asks the cashier at the till what the return policy is, and is advised that with the receipt and in saleable condition she can get a full refund within 15 days. She asks the cashier one more time just to double check and then proceeds with making her purchase.\n\nThe next day she brings her item back in pristine identical condition together with the receipt and is told by the customer service desk that the cashier whom she spoke with had been mistaken and shows her a printed copy of the company's standing return policies which states that items must be defective for a return to be granted.\n\nAlice is understandably a bit frustrated as she had even double checked with the cashier and everything to avoid any misunderstanding. Let us suppose just for evidentiary simplicity's sake, that Alice had even recorded the dialogue, or had subject access requested the audio\\-bearing CCTV footage to demonstrate her point.\n\nYet it would seem that the online and printed policy notwithstanding, she had actually entered into a verbal contract with the cashier as an official representative of the company.\n\nWhich \"contract\" would legally prevail, and why?\n\nEngland and Wales specified, all jurisdictions welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This hypothetical case will be highly fact\\-specific and ultimately, only really answerable by the decision of a court as it will depend on the persuasiveness of arguments advanced by both sides. However, an attempt to address the question in terms of existing, known statutory and case law has been made.\n\nThe default position of in\\-person non\\-defective returns in law\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default position in law for the return of non\\-defective purchases made in person is that the retailer is not obliged to accept the return. The retailer is only required to accept the return if:\n\n1. It was made online or the customer did not have a chance to inspect the item before purchasing it. The customer has up to 14 days to return the item for any or no reason under [Part 3 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3134/part/3)\n2. The customer has the right to return the item according to [Section 20 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/20/enacted)\n\nThe retailer may choose to have a more generous, extensive returns policy but that is not required by law.\n\n### Does Alice have a statutory right to return the item?\n\nNo. She did not purchase it online and she was able to inspect it as she made the purchase in\\-store. The item appears to conform to the contract in terms of quality, being as described, non\\-defective, etc. Therefore Part 3 of the Regulations does not apply and she does not seem to have the right to return under Section 20 of the Act.\n\nWhat was the contract?\n----------------------\n\nThe contract appears to be the following:\n\n1. The price set out as part of the invitation to treat\n2. All of the implied terms as required by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (such as the item to be of sufficient quality, fit for purpose, and so on)\n\n### Does the verbal dialogue amount to a term or representation?\n\nThe verbal dialogue is unlikely to amount to a term. This is because a term is a promise as to the truth of a statement. When considering whether the verbal dialogue amounts to a term, the Court will consider the following non\\-exhaustive factors:\n\n1. Whether the term was in writing\n2. Is there any specialist skill or knowledge from one party?\n3. Is there reliance or importance placed on the statement?\n4. How long was the lapse of time between the statement and the contract being made?\n5. Could the party relying on the statement have verified it?\n\nTaking each factor in turn:\n\n1. The term was not in writing. It was an oral exchange. The Court will examine the conduct of the parties from start to end of the contract formation. The parol evidence rule (the rule that excludes other documents and oral agreements, instead preferring to focus solely on the written agreement) can be circumvented on this basis per *J. Evans \\& Son (Portsmouth) Ltd v Andrea Merzario* \\[1976] 1 WLR 1078\\.\n2. There may be some specialist knowledge involved. Alice could argue that the cashier would be expected to be familiar with the store's return policy whereas Alice wouldn't. The store could try and rely on *Oscar Whell Ltd v Williams* \\[1957] 1 WLR 370 which held that the seller had no specialist knowledge and so the statement did not form a contractual term. In contrast, Alice could try and rely on *Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd* \\[1965] 1 WLR 623 which held that the position one party (being a car dealer) was in conveyed specialist knowledge that the other party lacked. On the basis that the returns policy was available at the customer service desk and readable by anyone without any specialist knowledge or training, it seems likely that the Court would hold that no specialist knowledge was possessed.\n3. There may be some reliance or importance placed on the statement. This is a two\\-part test: is the statement so important that Alice would not have entered the contract if the statement had never been made, and separately, is the importance of the statement clear to the cashier at the time the statement was made, either expressly or by conduct? Part 1 will be up for Alice to demonstrate, while part 2 will probably be \"no\" because the cashier is not taking personal responsibility for the statement, arguably simply relaying (mistakenly) what they believed the policy was (per *Pritchard v Cook \\& Red Ltd* unreported, 4 June 1998\\).\n4. There would only have been a few seconds or minutes between the cashier making the statement and the conclusion of the contract. While the presumption is that the greater the time between the statement and the conclusion of the contract, the less likely it is held to be a term, per *Inntrepreneur Pub Co v East Crown Ltd* \\[2000] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 611, it is not clear on the facts that the statement necessarily became a term.\n5. It is arguable that Alice could have verified the statement by checking the returns policy herself or double\\-checking with another member of staff or the customer service desk.\n\nOn consideration of the factors above, it is unlikely that the statement would form a term of the contract. It is possible that the Court would hold the statement is a representation, but it is fact\\-specific.\n\n### What is the effect of the statement being a representation?\n\nThe statement does not form a contractual term, so it is not possible for Alice to bring a claim for breach of contract. It may be possible for Alice to claim for misrepresentation.\n\nShe might be able to claim for:\n\n1. Negligent misstatement or\n2. Negligent misrepresentation contrary to [S2(1\\) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7/section/2)\n3. Fraudulent misrepresentation\n\n#### Negligent misstatement\n\nThis claim would require the existence of a \"special relationship\" between the cashier and Alice, per *Hedley Byrne \\& Co Ltd v Heller \\& Partners Ltd* \\[1964] AC 465\\. In this case, it is unlikely Alice will be able to establish the existence of a \"special relationship\" as she is transacting with a general cashier rather than, e.g. a specialist expert. Since there is no \"special relationship\", this claim would fail.\n\n#### Negligent misrepresentation\n\nThis claim would be likely to succeed, provided Alice can demonstrate some form of loss (e.g. the loss of the right to return the item), unless the cashier can prove on the balance of probabilities that they had reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe (up until the contract was made) that the facts represented were true.\n\n#### Fraudulent misrepresentation\n\nThis would require clear evidence of fraud per *Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd* \\[1996] UKHL 3\\. There is no evidence of fraud on the facts, so this claim is unlikely to succeed.\n\n### Likelihood of success and available remedies\n\nIt is likely that Alice would prevail by making the case that the statement was a misrepresentation contrary to S2(1\\) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967\\.\n\nIf the item was worth more than \u00a3100 and less than \u00a330,000 and she paid for it on a credit card, the most expedient way would be to do a Section 75 (Consumer Credit Act 1975\\) chargeback against the credit card provider.\n\nAlternatively, if she proceeded with her S2(1\\) Misrepresentation Act 1967 claim, she is likely to get damages rather than recission under S2(2\\) of the Act, which would operate to put her back into the position she was in prior to buying the item. In other words, she would get a full refund.\n\nWhether it is *worth* her pursuing all this is another matter entirely. Upon reflection around actual/apparent authority, I have decided that is an interesting tangent but the answer can be best tackled by reference to existing contract law (and the question of actual/apparent authority is likely to be answered in the negative).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Alice and the retail store, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of the cashier's verbal statement about the return policy?\n\nA) The cashier's statement automatically becomes a binding term of the contract, overriding the store's official policy.\n\nB) Alice has a strong case for fraudulent misrepresentation against the store.\n\nC) Alice likely has a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, but may only be entitled to damages rather than rescission of the contract.\n\nD) Alice has no legal recourse because the store's official written policy always takes precedence over verbal statements made by employees.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the given information. The cashier's statement about the return policy is unlikely to be considered a binding term of the contract due to factors such as lack of specialist knowledge and the ability to verify the information. However, Alice may have a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation under Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. If successful, she would likely be awarded damages to put her back in the position she was in before the purchase, rather than rescission of the contract.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the court's likely approach to in-house counsel vs. external counsel in this situation?\n\nA) The court will grant equal access to confidential documents for both in-house and external counsel, as long as a confidentiality agreement is signed.\n\nB) The court will be more inclined to grant access to confidential documents to external counsel than to in-house counsel, due to concerns about potential misuse of sensitive information.\n\nC) The court will only allow in-house counsel to review confidential documents, as they have a better understanding of the company's operations.\n\nD) The court will deny access to confidential documents to both in-house and external counsel to protect trade secrets.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The court is likely to be more cautious about granting access to confidential documents to in-house counsel compared to external counsel. This is because in-house counsel, as employees of the company, are presumed to be more intimately familiar with the day-to-day operations and long-term strategic planning of the business. There's a higher risk that sensitive information could be (even unintentionally) misused or influence business decisions beyond the scope of the litigation. External counsel, who are not directly involved in the company's operations, present less of a risk in this regard. Therefore, courts are generally more willing to grant access to confidential documents to external counsel, while being more restrictive with in-house counsel to protect sensitive business information."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94490/which-law-rules-polygraphs-inadmissible-in-uk", "docs_id": 94490, "title": "Which law rules polygraphs inadmissible in UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Where does it say that polygraph tests (lie detector tests) are inadmissible under law in England and Wales?\n\nI am mostly interested in their usage being disallowed for criminal (both Magistrates' Court and Crown Court) and civil matters.

All of the considerations upon which the rule is based are as applicable to polygraph evidence as to other statements. The repetition of statements by another witness adds nothing to their weight and reliability. The ultimate decision as to the truth or falsity of the evidence of a witness must rest upon the exercise of the judgment of the trier of fact. This is as true of evidence of polygraph tests as of any other evidence.

It wouldn't be the focus of the video, but it would be a passing part of the video. I'm wondering about the ability to monetize such content.\n\nAs for why I'm curious about this, I've recently been thinking about starting a youtube channel. I have no delusions of grandeur, and I don't want to be presumptuous, but it serves to be prepared. I tend to whistle, and without trying to sound cocky, I'm quite good at whistling music. The channel would be man\\-cave workshop type content, among other things, and I would like to include bits where you can hear me whistling or singing along with the music that I'm listening to (the video music would be non\\-copyrighted, but I would quiet it to hear the whistling or singing).

It also seems like the 4th Amendment could be used to secure your DNA but [the ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_v._King) mentioned there states \n\n> \"your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.\"\n\nOtherwise, not much has come up aside from third\\-party gene testers. The results on [this site](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7461/can-someone-use-dna-samples-that-were-scattered-by-their-owners-for-commercial-p) seem to say (at least, to my uneducated eye) that you can't \"protect\" your DNA by copyright or patent if you abandon it (cuz trash is public property). \n\nDoes that mean that police can go through your trash once it's out of your curtilage ? [This](http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2013/05/can-police-search-through-your-trash.html) site says you can file a motion to suppress any trash evidence (if within your right of privacy ?) but is there a case where the police can't get a warrant to obtain your DNA directly but can instead wait for your trash and then get it from there ? Or is every case where a warrant isn't obtainable *also* a case where trash evidence isn't allowed ?\n\nAnd what about anyone ? I can think of a few queasy things someone can do with your DNA like finding out details about you that you don't want them to know. In 2006, the UK made it illegal to sequence another person's DNA without permission. But it says [here](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/05/11/the-dna-your-garbage-for-grabs/sU12MtVLkoypL1qu2iF6IL/story.html) that it should be a felony theft in USA but isn't ? Yet ? Are there any other countries like the UK ?\n Does it instead matter much more *what* I do with the DNA I collect or is simply intentionally owning it enough to constitute a crime ? Let's say I follow someone into a barber shop and leave with some clippings of their hair, am I doing something illegal ? I'd expect this to vary from state to state, right ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't know what you mean by \"own a person's DNA\", but analogous to owning a car or picture, you can't own a person, which is what would be required to have complete ownership of all of a person's DNA. You can legally own a sample of a person's DNA, for example by buying or bartering tissue, or if you are given tissue. If you grab a handful of hair from a person and pull it out, it is not legally yours, and you can be required to return it. If you lose, misplace or abandon tissue (or a knife), then the finder could end up owning it, depending on the circumstances. Tissue in the trash is more complicated since there may be municipal laws preventing dumpster\\-diving. Setting aside any such municipal codes, if you abandon your property, someone else can claim it. Hair on the floor of a barbershop, or in the trash, is a good example abandonment: it could also be an example of trespassing, in case the barber objects to you gathering samples from his floor.\n\nThe 4th Amendment cannot be used to secure your DNA: it could be used to *prevent* securing DNA, if the intended application is compelled blood drawing. The ruling in [Maryland v. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_v._King) did *not* say that \"your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason\", since that was an objection to the majority ruling given in the dissent, not part of the actual ruling. Maybe that will end up being true, but that hasn't been determined to be the law yet. With a warrant, the police can take a tissue sample, and not wait for you to throw a tissue sample in the trash. They can *also* take a cheek swab from an arrestee just like they can take a photo or fingerprints (that's what Maryland v. King says).\n\nOnce we've settled the matter of obtaining a DNA sample, the concept of ownership might be relevant if a party could restrict others from using that DNA pattern. But DNA is not subject to patent or copyright, so once I know your DNA pattern, you cannot legally prevent me from using that information. However, you *might*, if I gave you a sample as part of a contract, and there is a clause in that contract that prevents the other party from ever using that information.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John suspects his neighbor, Sarah, of having a genetic predisposition to a rare disease.

However, I've now come across the following [Texas Bar statement](https://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/LawyersGivingBack/LegalAccessDivision/ProBonoPolicyFAQ2009.pdf#page=2), which seems to **allow** public attorneys to engage in *pro bono* practice.

I'll restate the analysis in a different way in this answer in the hope of providing greater clarity.\n\nThe key to understanding that question is that the question presented there was: \"Are DAs and other prosecutors prohibited from being defense attorneys, such as in a pro bono fashion?\" Having a prosecutor do criminal defense work presents conflicts that other types of *pro bono* work frequently would not.\n\n> Does this mean that public attorneys can engage in pro bono work in\n> Texas? If so, are there strings attached? For example, would a public\n> attorney be able to represent their friends and family so long as they\n> don't charge for the work?\n\nThese questions don't have a single global answer and must be analyzed on a case by case basis. It depends upon whether the *pro bono* work constitutes a conflict of interest with the public attorneys' regular work (i.e. what kind of legal work is done *pro bono* and for whom) and it depends upon the policies of the lawyer's particular employer.\n\nThere are two distinct questions presented, neither of which are materially different in Texas than they were in the previous question.\n\nOne is when doing so would violate the professional ethical obligations of a lawyer, which is what the Texas Bar Association statement is talking about.\n\nThe other is whether it is permissible in a manner consistent with the contractual employer\\-employee relationship of any particular Texas attorney working on a full time salaried basis for a particular employer. This is a subject upon which the Texas Bar Association statement is silent.\n\n**Professional Ethics Considerations**\n\nAs noted above, one question is whether *pro bono* work by a prosecutor in the specific subject matter of criminal defense would constitute a conflict of interest. The answer to that question is \"usually yes\" for the reasons explained in the linked question.\n\nOne can also easily imagine other circumstances where *pro bono* work could pit a salaried government lawyer against his employer, such as a state attorney general's office lawyer doing *pro bono* civil rights litigation against the state government.\n\nBut, not all *pro bono* legal work constitutes a conflict of interest.\n\nFor example, a prosecutor doing *pro bono* work helping low income people prepare documents naming legal guardians for their children in the event that they predecease their children (the very first *pro bono* case I took on as a Colorado attorney) would be very unlikely to be conflict of interest for the prosecutor, even though a *pro bono* criminal defense case in the county where the prosecutor practices would be an obvious and direct unethical conflict of interest.\n\nSimilarly, judges frequently do *pro bono* work, where authorized to do so by the court systems in which they work, in the areas of legal education for non\\-lawyers (like High School Mock Trial competitions or lectures to school students) and by providing mediation services to indigent parties outside the judicial district where they practice, that are specifically calculated to avoid conflicts of interests, or appearance of bias or impropriety.\n\n**Employment Relationship Considerations**\n\nThe second issue is whether \"public attorneys can engage in *pro bono* work in Texas?\" in a case with a subject matter that does not otherwise present a conflict of interest.\n\nPublic sector attorneys are not prohibited from doing so as a matter of professional ethics. But, that isn't the only consideration. The other consideration is whether doing that *pro bono* work violates the employment policies of a public sector employer of a lawyer in the usual case when a public sector lawyer is employed on a salaried basis for the *full efforts* or something similar, of the lawyer. This is basically an issue of contract law, not of professional ethics.\n\nThe way this is usually dealt with in private law practice when a salaried attorney works for a law firm is that the private salaried lawyer needs to obtain law firm permission to do *pro bono* work and that *pro bono* work is often structured so that the *pro bono* client's lawyer is the law firm itself and the lawyer in that firm doing the actual *pro bono* work is often just one agent of the firm as a whole that actual represents the *pro bono* client. Frequently, salaried lawyers in private law firms have quotas of billable hours which they have to meet as a condition of employment each year at the law firm, and frequently a private law firm's *pro bono* program allows the salaried lawyer to count hours working for the law firm's *pro bono* clients towards that annual billable hour quota.\n\nIncidentally, there is nothing magic in the absence of a conflict of interest, about limiting \"moonlighting work\" to unpaid *pro bono* work.\n\nFor example, many U.S. law schools expressly authorize salaried full time law professors who are admitted to the practice of law to have a paid private practice up to a certain number of hours per year as a fringe benefit in addition to the salary, akin to the common practice of allowing professors to retain for themselves textbook royalties for textbooks written while the professors were being paid a salary to do scholarly work including writing textbooks.\n\nThe *pro bono* program structure used in private law firms for their salaried employers isn't as workable for a salaried attorney working full time for a governmental employer. This is because allowing a government salaried employee to work for free for a private citizen on something that doesn't involve public business of the government would functionally be an indirect appropriation of legal salary funds from the governmental entity to the *pro bono* client without receiving authorization from the elected representatives of the government in question.\n\nSo, in the public sector, a more common arrangement would be to provide that every salaried public sector lawyer working for that government is permitted to do up to X billable hours of *pro bono* work per year for their own, personal moonlighting private practice clients as a fringe benefit of employment, much like paid time off, if it is permitted at all. And, other public sector employers, which are not so generous, simply prohibit their salaried attorney employees from doing *pro bono* work at all in order to avoid having to deal with and think about the issue.\n\nThis doesn't arise very often in the case of lawyers hired by small local governments or on a contract basis by a larger government for a particular specialized task, as they have their own practices and have not agreed to provide substantially all of their professional legal work to their employer the way that a salaried lawyer would. So they are more akin to private sector law firm lawyers who simply have an additional set of conflict of interest considerations as a result of having a particular local government as an employer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A full-time salaried prosecutor in Texas wants to engage in pro bono work.

Would there be\n>  civil or criminal penalties if, some but not all, documents (like bank\n>  statements or property assessments) were accidentally lost?\n\nThere isn't enough context in this question to know.\n\nAn executor is a fiduciary who has a duty to account, so if the fiduciary can not provide a report that tells where all of the assets of the estate went, the fiduciary is deemed to have converted the assets unaccounted for and this could even give rise to theft charges.\n\nBut, losing supporting documents for an accounting, particularly documents like bank statements and property assessments which can be recreated from third\\-party sources is neither a crime nor a tort. No one is harmed because they are lost.\n\nA fiduciary has a duty to keep beneficiaries informed of what happened in an estate, not to preserve records supporting those communications *per se*. \n\nAlso, in the probate process, it isn't uncommon for interim accountings to be filed quarterly or annually before the estate is officially closed. And, in many states, when an executor files an interim accounting it can often be contested for only a short time period after it is filed (frequently a matter of weeks or a few months). So, a lack of supporting documentation would only be legally relevant to the time period since the last interim accounting in many cases.\n\nFurther, frequently in a probate estate, to receive a distribution without a court order, a beneficiary will sign a waiver of all liability of the executor and the estate arising prior to the distribution. So, if there are multiple distributions made in a probate estate, only acts since the last waiver was signed could be contested.\n\nSimilarly, if losing documents that help prove that the executor is innocent of improper action makes it harder for the executor to defend himself or herself or itself against claims that the executor acted improperly, the executor may have a harder time defending against those claims.\n\nBut, losing relevant documents during the course of a contested litigation or in anticipation of contested litigation is only sanctionable as spoliation of evidence if the impact on the litigation is material because there is no other source of the evidence, and is intentional.\n\nAlso, with narrow exceptions, usually involving physical injury, accidents don't give rise to criminal liability (which is usually based on reckless or intentional acts).\n\nCivil liability almost never arises unless someone is actually economically or physically harmed by an act.\n\nNow, if the executor lost a \"real\" document like a live check that for some reason can't be reissued due, or a bearer bond that is subsequently sold by a unknown person who finds it to a bona fide purchaser for value, resulting in an economic loss to the estate, and this loss is due to negligence, the executor is legally responsible for indemnifying the estate from this harm. \n\nBut, this would not apply in a case where the document is mere evidence of a legal obligation rather than embodying the legal obligation, or having intrinsic value (e.g. if the document was an original copy of the Declaration of Independence), unless the loss of the document was negligent and losing it causes physical or economic harm (which would rarely be the case).\n\nAs a concluding caveat, it bears mentioning that the relevant parts of the criminal law are predominantly a matter of state law, and that probate law is almost entirely state law, so the law is not perfectly uniform within the United States on this issue.

The executor has a fiduciary duty to account for the estate's assets, and if they cannot provide a complete report due to lost documentation, they may be held responsible.
