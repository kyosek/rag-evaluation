Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear functions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field and the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix groups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but not fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to generate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for memoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed very fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear function.

In typical sensor networks, data collection and processing are separated. A sink collects data from all nodes sequentially, which is very time consuming. Over-the-air computation, as a new diagram of sensor networks, integrates data collection and processing in one slot: all nodes transmit their signals simultaneously in the analog wave and the processing is done in the air. This method, although efficient, requires that signals from all nodes arrive at the sink, aligned in signal magnitude so as to enable an unbiased estimation. For nodes far away from the sink with a low channel gain, misalignment in signal magnitude is unavoidable. To solve this problem, in this paper, we investigate the amplify-and-forward based relay, in which a relay node amplifies signals from many nodes at the same time. We first discuss the general relay model and a simple relay policy. Then, a coherent relay policy is proposed to reduce relay transmission power. Directly minimizing the computation error tends to over-increase node transmission power. Therefore, the two relay policies are further refined with a new metric, and the transmission power is reduced while the computation error is kept low.

We consider the problem of parameter estimation for a system of ordinary differential equations from noisy observations on a solution of the system. In case the system is nonlinear, as it typically is in practical applications, an analytic solution to it usually does not exist. Consequently, straightforward estimation methods like the ordinary least squares method depend on repetitive use of numerical integration in order to determine the solution of the system for each of the parameter values considered, and to find subsequently the parameter estimate that minimises the objective function. This induces a huge computational load to such estimation methods.

Point cloud has been widely used in the field of autonomous driving since it can provide a more comprehensive three-dimensional representation of the environment than 2D images. Point-wise prediction based on point cloud sequence (PCS) is an essential part of environment understanding, which can assist in the decision-making and motion-planning of autonomous vehicles. However, PCS prediction has not been deeply researched in the literature. This paper proposes a brief review of the sequential point cloud prediction methods, focusing on interactive scenarios. Firstly, we define the PCS prediction problem and introduce commonly-used frameworks. Secondly, by reviewing non-predictive problems, we analyze and summarize the spatio-temporal feature extraction methods based on PCS.

A geographic feature has ht-index h if the pattern of far more small things than large ones recurs (h-1) times at different scales. The higher the ht-index, the more complex the geographic feature. We conduct three case studies to illustrate how the computed ht-indices capture the complexity of different geographic features. We further discuss how the ht-index is complementary to fractal dimension, and elaborate on a dynamic view behind the ht-index that enables better understanding of geographic forms and processes.

Competition is a main tenet of economics, and the reason is that a perfectly competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient in the absence of externalities and public goods. Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to its competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of competition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model by Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the {\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select seller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$ is the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce stochasticity. If $T$ decreases below a critical point $T_c$, the system undergoes a transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric one, in which only one of the two sellers is selected. In this work, we extend the model by incorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to control how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an oscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the $(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field approximations.

Deliberate deceptiveness intended to gain an advantage is commonplace in human and animal societies.

With this as motivation, we study a simple variant of the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game entailing deceitful defectors and conditional cooperators that lifts the veil on the impact of such two-faced behavior. Defectors are able to hide their true intentions at a personal cost, while conditional cooperators are probabilistically successful at identifying defectors and act accordingly.

Recent advances in laser technology allow us to follow electronic motion at its natural time-scale with ultra-fast time resolution, leading the way towards attosecond physics experiments of extreme precision. In this work, we assess the use of tailored pumps in order to enhance (or reduce) some given features of the probe absorption (for example, absorption in the visible range of otherwise transparent samples). This type of manipulation of the system response could be helpful for its full characterization, since it would allow us to visualize transitions that are dark when using unshaped pulses. In order to investigate these possibilities, we perform first a theoretical analysis of the non-equilibrium response function in this context, aided by one simple numerical model of the Hydrogen atom. Then, we proceed to investigate the feasibility of using time-dependent density-functional theory as a means to implement, theoretically, this absorption-optimization idea, for more complex atoms or molecules. We conclude that the proposed idea could in principle be brought to the laboratory: tailored pump pulses can excite systems into light-absorbing states.

Topological insulator (TI) thin films with surface magnetism are expected to exhibit a quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) when the magnetizations on the top and bottom surfaces are parallel, and a quantized topological magnetoelectric (QTME) response when the magnetizations have opposing orientations (axion insulator phase) and the films are sufficiently thick. We present a unified picture of both effects that associates deviations from exact quantization of the QTME caused by finite thickness with non-locality in the side-wall current response function. Using realistic tight-binding model calculations, we show that in $Bi_2Se_3$ TI thin films deviations from quantization in the axion insulator-phase are reduced in size when the exchange coupling of tight-binding model basis states to the local magnetization near the surface is strengthened.
