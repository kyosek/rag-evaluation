Experimental search of the magnetically induced current in QCD in heavy ion collisions above a pseudocritical temperature hints, though not yet conclusive, that the induced current is either small or vanishing.

The t copula is often used in risk management as it allows for modelling tail dependence between risks and it is simple to simulate and calibrate. However, the use of a standard t copula is often criticized due to its restriction of having a single parameter for the degrees of freedom (dof) that may limit its capability to model the tail dependence structure in a multivariate case. To overcome this problem, grouped t copula was proposed recently, where risks are grouped a priori in such a way that each group has a standard t copula with its specific dof parameter. In this paper we propose the use of a grouped t copula, where each group consists of one risk factor only, so that a priori grouping is not required. The copula characteristics in the bivariate case are studied. We explain simulation and calibration procedures, including a simulation study on finite sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and Kendall's tau approximation.

The grouped t copula, as described in the document, allows each risk factor to have its own degrees of freedom parameter. This approach overcomes the limitation of the standard t copula, which uses a single parameter for degrees of freedom across all risk factors. By allowing individual degrees of freedom for each risk factor, the grouped t copula can potentially model tail dependence more accurately in multivariate cases without requiring a priori grouping of risks.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it describes the standard t copula, not the grouped t copula.
