Appearing in different format, Gupta\\,(1967), Goldberg\\,(1973), Andersen\\,(1977), and Seymour\\,(1979) conjectured that if $G$ is an edge-$k$-critical graph with $k \\ge \\Delta +1$, then $|V(G)|$ is odd and, for every edge $e$, $E(G-e)$ is a union of disjoint near-perfect matchings, where $\\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. Tashkinov tree method shows that critical graphs contain a subgraph with two important properties named closed and elementary. Recently, efforts have been made in extending graphs beyond Tashkinov trees. However, these results can only keep one of the two essential properties.

In particular, as the energy at which the GRB's $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra is a maximum ($E_{pk}$) decays through the four BATSE channels, the photon flux peak in each individual channel will inevitably be offset producing what we measure as lag. We test this hypothesis by measuring the rate of $E_{pk}$ decay ($\\Phi_{o}$) for a sample of clean single peaked bursts with measured lag. We find a direct correlation between the decay timescale and the spectral lag, demonstrating the relationship between time delay of the low energy photons and the decay of $E_{pk}$.

In this paper, we address the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise graphical model from samples in a high-dimensional setting. Our first main result studies the sparsistency, or consistency in sparsity pattern recovery, properties of a forward-backward greedy algorithm as applied to general statistical models. As a special case, we then apply this algorithm to learn the structure of a discrete graphical model via neighborhood estimation. As a corollary of our general result, we derive sufficient conditions on the number of samples n, the maximum node-degree d and the problem size p, as well as other conditions on the model parameters, so that the algorithm recovers all the edges with high probability. Our result guarantees graph selection for samples scaling as n = Omega(d^2 log(p)), in contrast to existing convex-optimization based algorithms that require a sample complexity of \\Omega(d^3 log(p)). Further, the greedy algorithm only requires a restricted strong convexity condition which is typically milder than irrepresentability assumptions. We corroborate these results using numerical simulations at the end."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the forward-backward greedy algorithm for learning discrete graphical models, as described in the paper, is correct?\n\nA) It requires a sample complexity of \u03a9(d^3 log(p)) to guarantee graph selection.\nB) It outperforms convex-optimization based algorithms in terms of sample complexity, requiring \u03a9(d^2 log(p)) samples.\nC) It relies on strong irrepresentability assumptions for its performance guarantees.\nD) It is primarily designed for continuous graphical models rather than discrete ones.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B.

Many time series problems feature epidemic changes - segments where a parameter deviates from a background baseline. The number and location of such changes can be estimated in a principled way by existing detection methods, providing that the background level is stable and known. However, practical data often contains nuisance changes in background level, which interfere with standard estimation techniques. Furthermore, such changes often differ from the target segments only in duration, and appear as false alarms in the detection results. To solve these issues, we propose a two-level detector that models and separates nuisance and signal changes. As part of this method, we developed a new, efficient approach to simultaneously estimate unknown, but fixed, background level and detect epidemic changes. The analytic and computational properties of the proposed methods are established, including consistency and convergence. We demonstrate via simulations that our two-level detector provides accurate estimation of changepoints under a nuisance process, while other state-of-the-art detectors fail.
