To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the phase-problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom derivative crystals and concomitantly the determination of the heavy atom substructure. This is customarily done by direct methods or Patterson-based approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative crystals are available, as often the case for e.g. membrane proteins. Here we present an approach for heavy atom site identification based on a Molecular Replacement Parameter Matrix (MRPM) search. It involves an n-dimensional search to test a wide spectrum of molecular replacement parameters, such as clusters of different conformations. The result is scored by the ability to identify heavy-atom positions, from anomalous difference Fourier maps, that allow meaningful phases to be determined. The strategy was successfully applied in the determination of a membrane protein structure, the CopA Cu+-ATPase, when other methods had failed to resolve the heavy atom substructure.

Using a novel laboratory experiment, we create a working environment in which first movers can (or cannot) observe second mover's monitoring at the end of a round. Our framework consists of a standard repeated sequential Prisoner's Dilemma, where the second mover can observe the choices made by first movers either exogenously or endogenously. We show that mutual cooperation occurs significantly more frequently when monitoring is made transparent. Additionally, our results highlight the key role of conditional cooperators (who are more likely to monitor) in promoting teamwork. Overall, the observed cooperation enhancing effects are due to monitoring actions that carry information about first movers who use it to better screen the type of their co-player and thereby reduce the risk of being exploited."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the study on transparency in monitoring and its effects on cooperation in teams, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the findings of the experiment?\n\nA) Transparent monitoring led to decreased cooperation due to employees feeling overly scrutinized.\n\nB) Exogenous monitoring was more effective than endogenous monitoring in promoting teamwork.\n\nC) Transparency in monitoring significantly increased the frequency of mutual cooperation, with conditional cooperators playing a crucial role.\n\nD) The study found no significant difference between transparent and non-transparent monitoring in terms of cooperative behavior.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance between positive effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and autonomy) and its downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work life). Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of workers, such as women.

We introduce a data-driven approach to automatic pitch correction of solo singing performances. The proposed approach predicts note-wise pitch shifts from the relationship between the respective spectrograms of the singing and accompaniment. This approach differs from commercial systems, where vocal track notes are usually shifted to be centered around pitches in a user-defined score, or mapped to the closest pitch among the twelve equal-tempered scale degrees. The proposed system treats pitch as a continuous value rather than relying on a set of discretized notes found in musical scores, thus allowing for improvisation and harmonization in the singing performance. We train our neural network model using a dataset of 4,702 amateur karaoke performances selected for good intonation. Our model is trained on both incorrect intonation, for which it learns a correction, and intentional pitch variation, which it learns to preserve. The proposed deep neural network with gated recurrent units on top of convolutional layers shows promising performance on the real-world score-free singing pitch correction task of autotuning."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation of the Deep Autotuner approach to pitch correction, as compared to traditional commercial systems?\n\nA) It uses a larger dataset of professional singing performances for training.\nB) It applies pitch correction based on a user-defined musical score.\nC) It treats pitch as a continuous value and learns from the spectrogram relationship between singing and accompaniment.\nD) It only corrects obvious pitch errors while completely ignoring intentional pitch variations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Deep Autotuner approach introduces several innovations compared to traditional pitch correction systems. The key difference is that it treats pitch as a continuous value and predicts note-wise pitch shifts based on the relationship between the spectrograms of the singing and accompaniment. This is in contrast to commercial systems that typically shift notes to predefined pitches in a score or to the nearest semitone.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the system uses 4,702 amateur karaoke performances, not professional ones.\nOption B describes the approach of traditional systems, not the Deep Autotuner.\nOption D is incorrect because the system is designed to learn and preserve intentional pitch variations while correcting inaccurate intonation.\n\nThe correct answer, C, captures the essence of the Deep Autotuner's innovative approach, allowing for more nuanced and context-aware pitch correction that can accommodate improvisation and harmonization in singing performances."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Evolution of perturbations in distinct classes of canonical scalar field\n  models of dark energy", "source": "H.

Dark energy must cluster in order to be consistent with the equivalence principle. The background evolution can be effectively modelled by either a scalar field or by a barotropic fluid.The fluid model can be used to emulate perturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks down at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy perturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and freezing models.The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes.In freezing models, the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times.For thawing models, the dark energy equation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times and begins to deviate from it only at late times.Since the dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes,the dark energy perturbations too evolve differently. In freezing models, since the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant difference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological constant model.In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ from the cosmological constant only at late times. This difference provides an additional handle to distinguish between these classes of models and this difference should manifest itself in the ISW effect."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the differences between freezing and thawing models of dark energy perturbations?\n\nA) Freezing models show significant deviation from the cosmological constant model in matter perturbations at late times, while thawing models show differences only at early times.\n\nB) In freezing models, the dark energy equation of state remains close to that of a cosmological constant at early times, while in thawing models it deviates from the cosmological constant at early times.\n\nC) Thawing models exhibit a greater impact on the ISW effect compared to freezing models due to their early deviation from the cosmological constant.\n\nD) Freezing models show deviation from the cosmological constant in the dark energy equation of state at early times, leading to significant differences in matter perturbations, while thawing models primarily differ at late times.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the passage, freezing models of dark energy show deviation from the cosmological constant in their equation of state at early times. This early deviation leads to significant differences in the evolution of matter perturbations compared to the cosmological constant model. In contrast, thawing models maintain an equation of state similar to the cosmological constant at early times and only begin to deviate at late times. This difference in behavior between freezing and thawing models is expected to be observable through the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, providing a means to distinguish between these classes of models.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as they reverse the characteristics of freezing and thawing models. Option C is incorrect because the passage doesn't specify which model has a greater impact on the ISW effect, only that the difference between the models should be observable through this effect."}}
