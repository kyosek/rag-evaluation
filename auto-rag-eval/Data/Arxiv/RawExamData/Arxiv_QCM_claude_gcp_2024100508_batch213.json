Using BP-based DC model we propose a fast real-time state estimator for the power system SE. The proposed estimator is easy to distribute and parallelize, thus alleviating computational limitations and allowing for processing measurements in real time. The presented algorithm may run as a continuous process. Using insights from the DC model, we use two different approaches to derive the BP algorithm for the non-linear model. The first method directly applies BP methodology, however, providing only approximate BP solution for the non-linear model. In the second approach, we make a key further step by providing the solution in which the BP is applied sequentially over the non-linear model, akin to what is done by the Gauss-Newton method.

The capability of color encoding the continuous sequence of views from a scene was demonstrated previously by the author (1990). In the present work, the scheme for this process is shown where white light from a black and white object is diffracted at a diffraction grating and then photographed on colour film. Two rays of different wavelengths reaching the plane of the color photographic film determine the stereo representation of an object point. Since the wavelength may have any value within the continuous visible spectrum, this case constitutes a new situation of continuous stereo photography. A natural process of decoding is represented where a diffusing white light source was added from the side of the developed photographic film. One white light ray that matches the former position of an incident ray receives the spectral characteristics of the registered point when traversing the photographic slide.

Secondary access policies are designed that determine the secondary access probability in each state of the network so as to maximize the average long-term SU throughput by opportunistically leveraging IC, while causing bounded average long-term PU throughput degradation and SU power expenditure. It is proved that the optimal policy prescribes that the SU prioritizes its access in the states where SUrx knows the PU message, thus enabling IC.
