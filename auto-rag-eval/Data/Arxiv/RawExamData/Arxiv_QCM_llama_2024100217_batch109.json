For non-linear neuron models, however, explicit correlation functions are difficult to compute analytically, and perturbative methods work only for weak shared input. In order to treat strong correlations, we suggest here an alternative non-perturbative method. Specifically, we study the case of two leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with strong shared input.

This is because the system rewards buyers for leaving high-quality reviews, which in turn encourages sellers to improve their listings.\n\n**B)** Incentivized reviews have no effect on transaction quality, and this is because the design of the reputation system is flawed, allowing low-quality sellers to masquerade as high-quality sellers. The system's reliance on voluntary reviews from buyers fails to provide an accurate assessment of seller quality.\n\n**C)** Incentivized reviews lead to a decrease in transaction quality, which is a result of the selection bias in reviewing.

This bias undermines the reputation system's ability to accurately assess seller quality, leading to a decrease in transaction quality.

Big data has become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model.

We introduce multi-spectral perception algorithms and aerial and ground-based systems developed for monitoring crop density, weed pressure, crop nitrogen nutrition status, and to accurately classify and locate weeds. We then introduce the navigation and mapping systems tailored to our robots in the agricultural environment, as well as the modules for collaborative mapping. We finally present the ground intervention hardware, software solutions, and interfaces we implemented and tested in different field conditions and with different crops. We describe a real use case in which a UAV collaborates with a UGV to monitor the field and to perform selective spraying without human intervention."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary objective of the Flourish research project, and how does it aim to contribute to the field of precision farming?\n\nA) To develop autonomous robots for crop monitoring and harvesting, with a focus on increasing crop yields and reducing labor costs.\nB) To create a hybrid system that combines the aerial survey capabilities of small UAVs with targeted intervention by multi-purpose UGVs, with the goal of optimizing crop management and reducing chemical treatments.\nC) To design and implement a fully autonomous farming system that can operate without human intervention, using advanced machine learning algorithms and sensor technologies.\nD) To develop a precision farming system that uses satellite imaging and machine learning to predict crop yields and optimize irrigation systems.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) To create a hybrid system that combines the aerial survey capabilities of small UAVs with targeted intervention by multi-purpose UGVs, with the goal of optimizing crop management and reducing chemical treatments.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the Flourish research project aims to develop an adaptable robotic solution for precision farming that combines the aerial survey capabilities of small UAVs with targeted intervention performed by multi-purpose UGVs. This hybrid system is designed to optimize crop management and reduce chemical treatments, which is the primary objective of the project. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the primary objective of the project. Option A is too narrow in scope, option C is too ambitious, and option D is not mentioned in the documentation as a goal of the project."}}
