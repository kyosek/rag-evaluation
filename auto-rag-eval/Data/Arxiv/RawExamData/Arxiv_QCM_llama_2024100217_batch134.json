Unmeasured or latent variables are often the cause of correlations between multivariate measurements and are studied in a variety of fields such as psychology, ecology, and medicine. For Gaussian measurements, there are classical tools such as factor analysis or principal component analysis with a well-established theory and fast algorithms. Generalized Linear Latent Variable models (GLLVM) generalize such factor models to non-Gaussian responses. However, current algorithms for estimating model parameters in GLLVMs require intensive computation and do not scale to large datasets with thousands of observational units or responses. In this article, we propose a new approach for fitting GLLVMs to such high-volume, high-dimensional datasets. We approximate the likelihood using penalized quasi-likelihood and use a Newton method and Fisher scoring to learn the model parameters. Our method greatly reduces the computation time and can be easily parallelized, enabling factorization at unprecedented scale using commodity hardware.

Through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, we show that softmax cross-entropy can estimate mutual information approximately. When applied to image classification, this relation helps approximate the point-wise mutual information between an input image and a label without modifying the network structure.

Massive co-located devices require new paradigms to allow proper network connectivity. Internet of things (IoT) is the paradigm that offers a solution for the inter-connectivity of devices, but in dense IoT networks time synchronization is a critical aspect. Further, the scalability is another crucial aspect. This paper focuses on synchronization for uncoordinated dense networks without any external timing reference. Two synchronization methods are proposed and compared: i) conventional synchronization that copes with the high density of nodes by frame collision-avoidance methods (e.g., CSMA/CA) to avoid the superimposition (or collision) of synchronization signals; and ii) distributed synchronization that exploits the frames' collision to drive the network to a global synchronization. The distributed synchronization algorithm allows the network to reach a timing synchronization status based on a common beacon with the same signature broadcasted by every device. The superimposition of beacons from all the other devices enables the network synchronization, rather than preventing it.

Specifically, we formulate the problem as that of sequential TOA-based source localization and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to it to generate the position estimates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem and elucidate its estimation and geometric properties. In particular, under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the paper \"Local Strong Convexity of Source Localization and Error Bound for Target Tracking under Time-of-Arrival Measurements\", what is the primary contribution of the authors regarding the tracking performance of Online Gradient Descent (OGD) for target tracking?\n\n**A)** The authors establish a bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD, which is a direct consequence of the local strong convexity of the loss function.\n\n**B)** The authors show that the loss function in the formulation is locally strongly convex at its global minima, which implies that OGD can effectively track the target.\n\n**C)** The authors demonstrate that the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position is bounded by a constant, which is a key property of the TOA-based source localization problem.\n\n**D)** The authors establish a new bound on the distance between the optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position, which is a fundamental result in the field of source localization.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) The authors establish a new bound on the distance between the optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position, which is a fundamental result in the field of source localization.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is D) because the authors establish a new bound on the distance between the optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position, which is a fundamental result in the field of source localization. This bound is crucial in understanding the tracking performance of OGD and is a key contribution of the paper. The other options are incorrect because they either partially summarize the authors' results or are not the primary contribution of the paper."}}
