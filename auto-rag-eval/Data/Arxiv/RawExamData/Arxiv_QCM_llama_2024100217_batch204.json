Recent clinical evidence suggests a unifying mechanism based on sustained re-entrant circuits in the complex atrial architecture. Here, we present a simple computational model showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a theoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation.

Conventional machine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-target relationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, and revision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable, heterogeneous patterns such as trader behavior is challenging. Deep learning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations of the data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncovers generative features that determine the target (e.g., trader's profitability), avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g. dynamic market conditions).

Photonic metamaterials with properties unattainable in base materials are already beginning to revolutionize optical component design. However, their exceptional characteristics are often static, as artificially engineered into the material during the fabrication process. This limits their application for in-operando adjustable optical devices and active optics in general. Here, for a hybrid material consisting of a liquid crystal-infused nanoporous solid, we demonstrate active and dynamic control of its meta-optics by applying alternating electric fields parallel to the long axes of its cylindrical pores. First-harmonic Pockels and second-harmonic Kerr birefringence responses, strongly depending on the excitation frequency- and temperature, are observed in a frequency range from 50 Hz to 50 kHz. This peculiar behavior is quantitatively traced by a Landau-De Gennes free energy analysis to an order-disorder orientational transition of the rod-like mesogens and intimately related changes in the molecular mobilities and polar anchoring at the solid walls on the single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Thus, our study evidences that liquid crystal-infused nanopores exhibit integrated multi-physical couplings and reversible phase changes that make them particularly promising for the design of photonic metamaterials with thermo-electrically tunable birefringence in the emerging field of spacetime metamaterials aiming at a full spatio-temporal control of light."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism underlying the dynamic control of meta-optics in liquid crystal-infused nanopores, as demonstrated in the study on Dynamic Kerr and Pockels Electro-Optics of Liquid Crystals in Nanopores?\n\n**A)** The liquid crystal molecules undergo a phase transition due to changes in temperature, leading to a change in their molecular mobilities and polar anchoring at the solid walls.\n\n**B)** The alternating electric fields applied parallel to the long axes of the cylindrical pores induce an order-disorder orientational transition of the rod-like mesogens, resulting in reversible phase changes.\n\n**C)** The liquid crystal-infused nanopores exhibit a unique property of thermal expansion, which causes the pores to change shape and refractive index in response to temperature changes.\n\n**D)** The study reveals that the liquid crystal molecules in the nanopores are strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, leading to a dynamic control of meta-optics through a complex interplay of thermal and electrical effects.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The alternating electric fields applied parallel to the long axes of the cylindrical pores induce an order-disorder orientational transition of the rod-like mesogens, resulting in reversible phase changes.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the study demonstrates that the alternating electric fields applied parallel to the long axes of the cylindrical pores induce an order-disorder orientational transition of the rod-like mesogens, resulting in reversible phase changes.

Diversity is a central concept in many fields. Despite its importance, there is no unified methodological framework to measure diversity and its three components of variety, balance and disparity. Current approaches take into account disparity of the types by considering their pairwise similarities. Pairwise similarities between types do not adequately capture total disparity, since they fail to take into account in which way pairs are similar. Hence, pairwise similarities do not discriminate between similarity of types in terms of the same feature and similarity of types in terms of different features. This paper presents an alternative approach which is based similarities of features between types over the whole set. The proposed measure of diversity properly takes into account the aspects of variety, balance and disparity, and without having to set an arbitrary weight for each aspect of diversity. Based on this measure, the 'ABC decomposition' is introduced, which provides separate measures for the variety, balance and disparity, allowing them to enter analysis separately.

The system consists of a combination of Clear-Line-Of-Sight (CLOS) and diffractive Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) links. The cost of deploying a traditional CLOS system is estimated to be $100,000 per km, while the cost of deploying a diffractive NLOS system is estimated to be $80,000 per km. However, the diffractive NLOS system requires additional infrastructure investment to support the 3D techno-economic assessment framework.

Let's assume that the additional infrastructure investment is $10,000 per km. Therefore, the estimated cost per km of the hybrid system is:\n\nCost per km (hybrid) = $72,500 per km + $10,000 per km\n= $82,500 per km\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer options.
