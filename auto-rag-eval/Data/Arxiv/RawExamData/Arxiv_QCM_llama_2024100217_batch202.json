Clustering cancer patients into subgroups and identifying cancer subtypes is an important task in cancer genomics. Clustering based on comprehensive multi-omic molecular profiling can often achieve better results than those using a single data type, since each omic data type (representing one view of patients) may contain complementary information. However, it is challenging to integrate heterogeneous omic data types directly. Based on one popular method -- Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we presented Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) in this paper, an \"upgrade\" of SNF with several advantages. Similar to SNF, ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity (transition) matrix for clustering. We applied ANF to a carefully processed harmonized cancer dataset downloaded from GDC data portals consisting of 2193 patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct disease types. Our experimental results also demonstrated the power of feature selection and transformation combined with using ANF in patient clustering. Moreover, eigengap analysis suggests that the learned affinity matrices of four cancer types using our proposed framework may have successfully captured patient group structure and can be used for discovering unknown cancer subtypes."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat are the key advantages of Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) over Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) in integrating multi-omic data for cancer patient clustering?\n\nA) ANF is more computationally expensive than SNF, requiring more processing power.\nB) ANF is more sensitive to noise in the data, resulting in less accurate clustering results.\nC) ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity (transition) matrix for clustering, which is an advantage over SNF.\nD) ANF only works with datasets of 1000 patients or less, while SNF can handle larger datasets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity (transition) matrix for clustering, which is an advantage over SNF.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) because the documentation states that ANF is an \"upgrade\" of SNF with several advantages, and one of those advantages is that ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity (transition) matrix for clustering, which is a key feature of ANF.

Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states).

In this work, it is suggested that the genome information plays a role of a \"barcode\". The DNA structure presents a pseudo-random number(PRN)with classification tags, so organisms are characterized by DNA as library books are characterized by catalogue numbers. Elaboration of the \"barcode\" interpretation of DNA implicates the infrastructure of the physical Universe as a seat of biological information processing. Thanks to the PRNs provided by DNA, biological objects can share these facilities in the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mode, similarly to cellular phone communications. Figuratively speaking, populations of biological objects in the physical Universe can be seen as a community of users on the Internet with a wireless CDMA connection. The phenomenon of Life as a collective information processing activity has little to do with physics and is to be treated with the methodology of engineering design.

The authors of the paper argue that the Liquid Drop Models (LDM) provide a complementary duality that solves this problem, providing a fundamental picture of the nucleus that is consistent with the IPM."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Structure and mechanical characterization of DNA i-motif nanowires by\n  molecular dynamics simulation", "source": "Raghvendra Pratap Singh, Ralf Blossey, and Fabrizio Cleri", "docs_id": "1307.0275", "section": ["physics.bio-ph", "q-bio.BM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Structure and mechanical characterization of DNA i-motif nanowires by\n  molecular dynamics simulation. We studied the structure and mechanical properties of DNA i-motif nanowires by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations. We built up to 230 nm long nanowires, based on a repeated TC5 sequence from crystallographic data, fully relaxed and equilibrated in water. The unusual stacked C*C+ stacked structure, formed by four ssDNA strands arranged in an intercalated tetramer, is here fully characterized both statically and dynamically. By applying stretching, compression and bending deformation with the steered molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling methods, we extract the apparent Young's and bending moduli of the nanowire, as wel as estimates for the tensile strength and persistence length. According to our results, the i-motif nanowire shares similarities with structural proteins, as far as its tensile stiffness, but is closer to nucleic acids and flexible proteins, as far as its bending rigidity is concerned. Furthermore, thanks to its very thin cross section, the apparent tensile toughness is close to that of a metal. Besides their yet to be clarified biological significance, i-motif nanowires may qualify as interesting candidates for nanotechnology templates, due to such outstanding mechanical properties."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What can be inferred about the mechanical properties of DNA i-motif nanowires based on the results of the molecular dynamics simulation study?\n\nA) They exhibit high tensile strength and stiffness, similar to metals.\nB) They have a high bending rigidity, similar to structural proteins.\nC) They have a high apparent tensile toughness, similar to metals, due to their thin cross-section.\nD) They exhibit a unique combination of tensile stiffness and bending rigidity, similar to nucleic acids and flexible proteins.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) They exhibit a unique combination of tensile stiffness and bending rigidity, similar to nucleic acids and flexible proteins.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe study found that the i-motif nanowire shares similarities with structural proteins in terms of its tensile stiffness, but is closer to nucleic acids and flexible proteins in terms of its bending rigidity. This suggests that the nanowire has a unique combination of mechanical properties, making it an interesting candidate for nanotechnology templates. The correct answer, D, reflects this combination of properties.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA) The study does not mention that the nanowire has high tensile strength and stiffness, similar to metals.\n\nB) The study actually finds that the nanowire has a lower bending rigidity than structural proteins.\n\nC) While the nanowire does have a high apparent tensile toughness due to its thin cross-section, this is not the main point of the study, and the correct answer is more focused on the combination of tensile stiffness and bending rigidity."}}
