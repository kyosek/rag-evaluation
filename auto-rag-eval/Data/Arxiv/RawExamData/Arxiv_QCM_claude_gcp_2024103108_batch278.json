Dark matter is one of the deepest mystery of the universe. So far there is no natural explanation why the dark matter should exist and even dominate the universe. In this paper, we begin with a 3+1D topological gravity theory which is super renormalizable with vanishing beta functions, then we argue that Einstein gravity can emerge by condensing loop-like excitation from the underlying topological gravity theory. In the meanwhile, the uncondensed loop-like excitations serves as a natural candidate of dark matter and a generalized Einstein equation can be derived in the presence of loop-source(dark matter) background. Surprisingly, we find that such kind of dark matter will not contribute to scalar curvature, however, it will become a source of torsion. Finally, we derive the generalized Einstein equation in the presence of Dirac field. Very different from the usual Einstein-Carton theory, our theory further predicts that any type of normal matter, including Dirac field will not produce torsion. All these unique predictions can be tested by future experiments. Our framework suggests that topological invariant principle might play a more profound role than the well-known general covariance principle, especially towards understanding the nature of dark matter and quantum gravity in 3+1D."}, "answer": "Here's a challenging multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the proposed topological gravity theory in 3+1D, which of the following statements is correct regarding the nature and effects of dark matter?\n\nA) Dark matter contributes significantly to scalar curvature but does not affect torsion in spacetime.\n\nB) Dark matter is composed of condensed loop-like excitations and produces both scalar curvature and torsion.\n\nC) Dark matter consists of uncondensed loop-like excitations, does not contribute to scalar curvature, but acts as a source of torsion.\n\nD) Dark matter emerges from the condensation of loop-like excitations and behaves identically to normal matter in its gravitational effects.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Prior studies explored various deep learning models for time-frequency mask estimation, followed by a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter to improve the automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. The performance of these methods is fundamentally upper-bounded by MVDR's spatial selectivity. Recently, the all deep learning MVDR (ADL-MVDR) model was proposed for neural beamforming and demonstrated superior performance in a target speech extraction task using pre-segmented input. In this paper, we further adapt ADL-MVDR to the CSS task with several enhancements to enable end-to-end neural beamforming. The proposed system achieves significant word error rate reduction over a baseline spectral masking system on the LibriCSS dataset. Moreover, the proposed neural beamformer is shown to be comparable to a state-of-the-art MVDR-based system in real meeting transcription tasks, including AMI, while showing potentials to further simplify the runtime implementation and reduce the system latency with frame-wise processing."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of the proposed all-neural beamformer for continuous speech separation (CSS) compared to traditional MVDR-based methods?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for time-frequency mask estimation in CSS tasks\nB) It achieves perfect speech recognition accuracy in meeting transcription scenarios\nC) It overcomes the spatial selectivity limitations of MVDR while enabling end-to-end processing\nD) It requires pre-segmented input for optimal performance in target speech extraction\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C.

Decades of deindustrialization have led to economic decline and population loss throughout the U.S. Midwest, with the highest national poverty rates found in Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo. This poverty is often confined to core cities themselves, however, as many of their surrounding suburbs continue to prosper. Poverty can therefore be highly concentrated at the MSA level, but more evenly distributed within the borders of the city proper. One result of this disparity is that if suburbanites consider poverty to be confined to the central city, they might be less willing to devote resources to alleviate it. But due to recent increases in suburban poverty, particularly since the 2008 recession, such urban-suburban gaps might be shrinking. Using Census tract-level data, this study quantifies poverty concentrations for four \"Rust Belt\" MSAs, comparing core-city and suburban concentrations in 2000, 2010, and 2015.

Unfortunately, one of the main limitations of the cycleGAN approach is that it requires two deep neural network generators at the training phase, although only one of them is used at the inference phase.
