Recently, a class of interaction round the face (IRF) solvable lattice models were introduced, based on any rational conformal field theory (RCFT). We investigate here the connection between the general solvable IRF models and the fusion ones. To this end, we introduce an associative algebra associated to any graph, as the algebra of products of the eigenvalues of the incidence matrix. If a model is based on an RCFT, its associated graph algebra is the fusion ring of the RCFT. A number of examples are studied. The Gordon--generalized IRF models are studied, and are shown to come from RCFT, by the graph algebra construction. The IRF models based on the Dynkin diagrams of A-D-E are studied. While the $A$ case stems from an RCFT, it is shown that the $D-E$ cases do not. The graph algebras are constructed, and it is speculated that a natural isomorphism relating these to RCFT exists.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network Mid-LSTM for midterm stock prediction, which incorporates the market trend as hidden states.

We are suggesting a lossless memory requirement compression method for text data compression.

In many collective decision making situations, agents vote to choose an alternative that best represents the preferences of the group. Agents may manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people often do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can be computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their expected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote truthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being truthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner approval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and makes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a behavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations and prioritize high utility candidates in others.

This approach is likely to perform well in various scenarios without requiring complete information about other voters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while truthful voting is mentioned as a common heuristic, the research indicates it's not always the most effective strategy.

We compute two million consecutive eigenvalues for six representative cases of triangular billiards, three with generic angles with irrational ratios with $\\pi$, whose classical dynamics is presumably mixing, and three with exactly one angle rational with $\\pi$, which are presumably only weakly mixing or even only non-ergodic in case of right-triangles. We find excellent agreement of short and long range spectral statistics with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrix theory for the most irrational generic triangle, while the other cases show small but significant deviations which are attributed either to scarring or super-scarring mechanism.

One problem that occurs is that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences.

A general mathematical framework has been introduced in~arXiv:2010.08195. In this paper we develop and investigate a scaling approach of these models based on several biological assumptions.

The documentation states that \"On real data we find that, although not all decays are the same, the latency itself will determine most of the decays.\" This indicates that while latency is the primary factor influencing decay rates, there is still some variation among them.

Option B is too absolute, as it states all decay rates are identical, which contradicts the given information. Option D is incorrect because the documentation shows that latency affects the decay rates throughout the process, not just at initialization."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Symmetries of $\\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supergravity backgrounds in six\n  dimensions", "source": "Sergei M.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that dynein motor exhibits catch bonding behaviour, in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with increasing force, for a certain range of force. Motivated by these experiments, we propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond deformation (TFBD) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical applied load force. We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional transport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within the framework of this model. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic changes in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin driven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict that, under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can actually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport properties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor. This phase plot yields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable modifications of motor transport and binding properties.
