Machine learning (ML) has attracted a great research interest for physical layer design problems, such as channel estimation, thanks to its low complexity and robustness.

In previous works, model training is mostly done via centralized learning (CL), where the whole training dataset is collected from the users at the base station (BS). This approach introduces huge communication overhead for data collection. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for channel estimation.

We develop FL-based channel estimation schemes for both conventional and RIS (intelligent reflecting surface) assisted massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, where a single CNN is trained for two different datasets for both scenarios.

Practical problems with missing data are common, and statistical methods have been developed concerning the validity and/or efficiency of statistical procedures. On a central focus, there have been longstanding interests on the mechanism governing data missingness, and correctly deciding the appropriate mechanism is crucially relevant for conducting proper practical investigations. The conventional notions include the three common potential classes -- missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. In this paper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between missing at random and missing not at random. Since the potential alternatives of missing at random are broad, we focus our investigation on a general class of models with instrumental variables for data missing not at random. Our setting is broadly applicable, thanks to that the model concerning the missing data is nonparametric, requiring no explicit model specification for the data missingness. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy measures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when missing at random does not hold. We show that our new hypothesis testing approach achieves an objective data oriented choice between missing at random or not.

We apply this method to the simplest versions of the expOU, the OU and the Heston stochastic volatility models and we study their performance in terms of the log-price probability, the volatility probability, and its Mean First-Passage Time. The approach has some predictive power on the future returns amplitude by only knowing current volatility.

In this paper, we show that the energy-domain correlation and anatomical consistency between standard DECT images can be harnessed by a deep learning model to provide high-performance DECT imaging from fully-sampled low-energy data together with single-view high-energy data, which can be obtained by using a scout-view high-energy image. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with contrast-enhanced DECT scans from 5,753 slices of images of twenty-two patients and show its superior performance on DECT applications. The deep learning-based approach could be useful to further significantly reduce the radiation dose of current premium DECT scanners and has the potential to simplify the hardware of DECT imaging systems and to enable DECT imaging using standard SECT scanners."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary advantage of the proposed deep learning-based approach for dual-energy CT imaging, and how does it address the limitations of traditional DECT scanners?\n\nA) The approach reduces the computational complexity of DECT imaging, making it more accessible to undeveloped regions.

We introduce the concept of forward rank-dependent performance processes, extending the original notion to forward criteria that incorporate probability distortions. A fundamental challenge is how to reconcile the time-consistent nature of forward performance criteria with the time-inconsistency stemming from probability distortions. For this, we first propose two distinct definitions, one based on the preservation of performance value and the other on the time-consistency of policies and, in turn, establish their equivalence. We then fully characterize the viable class of probability distortion processes, providing a bifurcation-type result. Specifically, it is either the case that the probability distortions are degenerate in the sense that the investor would never invest in the risky assets, or the marginal probability distortion equals to a normalized power of the quantile function of the pricing kernel. We also characterize the optimal wealth process, whose structure motivates the introduction of a new, distorted measure and a related market. We then build a striking correspondence between the forward rank-dependent criteria in the original market and forward criteria without probability distortions in the auxiliary market.

These measures may serve as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics and Cover's universal portfolio, and induce distribution-valued random variables via optimal transport. The random concave functions are constructed on the unit simplex by taking a suitably scaled (mollified, or soft) minimum of random hyperplanes. Depending on the regime of the parameters, we show that as the number of hyperplanes tends to infinity there are several possible limiting behaviors. In particular, there is a transition from a deterministic almost sure limit to a non-trivial limiting distribution that can be characterized using convex duality and Poisson point processes."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the paper \"Random concave functions\", what is the limiting behavior of the constructed probability measures supported on spaces of concave functions as the number of random hyperplanes tends to infinity?\n\n**A)** The measures converge to a deterministic almost sure limit, which is a single point on the unit simplex.\n\n**B)** The measures converge to a non-trivial limiting distribution, which can be characterized using convex duality and Poisson point processes.\n\n**C)** The measures converge to a uniform distribution on the unit simplex, which is independent of the number of hyperplanes.\n\n**D)** The measures converge to a discrete distribution, where each point on the unit simplex has a probability mass proportional to the number of hyperplanes.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The measures converge to a non-trivial limiting distribution, which can be characterized using convex duality and Poisson point processes.\n\n**Explanation:** The paper states that as the number of hyperplanes tends to infinity, there are several possible limiting behaviors.

Researchers often face data fusion problems, where multiple data sources are available, each capturing a distinct subset of variables.

In this paper, we aim to estimate any functional of a probabilistic model (e.g., a causal effect) as efficiently as possible, by deciding, at each time, which data source to query. We propose online moment selection (OMS), a framework in which structural assumptions are encoded as moment conditions. The optimal action at each step depends, in part, on the very moments that identify the functional of interest. Our algorithms balance exploration with choosing the best action as suggested by current estimates of the moments. We propose two selection strategies: (1) explore-then-commit (OMS-ETC) and (2) explore-then-greedy (OMS-ETG), proving that both achieve zero asymptotic regret as assessed by MSE.

The current research pursues to understand the underlying mechanisms of such coexistence. Applying network dynamics and information theory, we discover that a certain amount of information, determined by the selectivity of networks to the input information, frequently survives from random distortion. Other information will inevitably experience distortion or dissipation, whose speeds are shaped by the diversity of information selectivity in networks.
