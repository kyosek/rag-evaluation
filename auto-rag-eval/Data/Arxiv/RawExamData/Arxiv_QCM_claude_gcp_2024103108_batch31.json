Meta-analysis methods have been widely used to combine results from multiple clinical or genomic studies to increase statistical power and ensure robust and accurate conclusion. Adaptively weighted Fisher's method (AW-Fisher) is an effective approach to combine p-values from $K$ independent studies and to provide better biological interpretation by characterizing which studies contribute to meta-analysis. Currently, AW-Fisher suffers from lack of fast, accurate p-value computation and variability estimate of AW weights. When the number of studies $K$ is large, the $3^K - 1$ possible differential expression pattern categories can become intractable. In this paper, we apply an importance sampling technique with spline interpolation to increase accuracy and speed of p-value calculation. Using resampling techniques, we propose a variability index for the AW weight estimator and a co-membership matrix to characterize pattern similarities between genes. The co-membership matrix is further used to categorize differentially expressed genes based on their meta-patterns for further biological investigation. The superior performance of the proposed methods is shown in simulations.

Research on polar codes has been constantly gaining attention over the last decade, by academia and industry alike, thanks to their capacity-achieving error-correction performance and low-complexity decoding algorithms. Recently, they have been selected as one of the coding schemes in the $5^{th}$ generation wireless standard (5G). Over the years various polar code decoding algorithms, like SC-list (SCL), have been proposed to improve the mediocre performance of the successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm for finite code lengths; however, like SC, they suffer from long decoding latency. Fast decoding of polar codes tries to overcome this problem by identifying particular subcodes in the polar code and decoding them with efficient decoders. In this work, we introduce a generalized approach to fast decoding of polar codes to further reduce SC-based decoding latency. We propose three multi-node polar code subcodes whose identification patterns include most of the existing subcodes, extending them to SCL decoding, and allow to apply fast decoding to larger subsets of bits.

Points of interest (POI) recommendation has been drawn much attention recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, e.g., Foursquare and Yelp. Among the existing approaches to POI recommendation, Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective. However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems: (1) Expensive computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and potentially huge low rank matrices. (2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g., cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the computation and storage issue.

The influence of Landau level broadening and spin-dependent scattering rates on the observation of beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations is investigated by simulations of the magnetoconductance. Data with non-zero beat node amplitudes are accompanied by asymmetric peaks in the Fourier transform, which are successfully reproduced by introducing a spin-dependent broadening in the simulations.

Additionally, the text mentions that asymmetric peaks in the Fourier transform of the data with non-zero beat node amplitudes are successfully reproduced by introducing spin-dependent broadening in simulations.

Such low levels of engagement are particularly prominent with younger employees, referred to as Generation Y (GenY), who are the least engaged of all groups at work.

Gathering and annotating that sheer amount of data in the real world is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Those problems limit scale and quality. Synthetic data generation has become increasingly popular since it is faster to generate and automatic to annotate. However, most of the current datasets and environments lack realism, interactions, and details from the real world. UnrealROX is an environment built over Unreal Engine 4 which aims to reduce that reality gap by leveraging hyperrealistic indoor scenes that are explored by robot agents which also interact with objects in a visually realistic manner in that simulated world. Photorealistic scenes and robots are rendered by Unreal Engine into a virtual reality headset which captures gaze so that a human operator can move the robot and use controllers for the robotic hands; scene information is dumped on a per-frame basis so that it can be reproduced offline to generate raw data and ground truth annotations.

Essentially, the only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the degree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient temperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer.

Traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods do not perform sufficiently well for such problems, since the hyperspectral data is very expensive to be largely collected in a trade-off between time and efficiency, compared to the multispectral data.
