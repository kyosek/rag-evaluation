The majority of ML research concerns slow, statistical learning of i.i.d. samples from large, labelled datasets. Animals do not learn this way. An enviable characteristic of animal learning is `episodic' learning - the ability to memorise a specific experience as a composition of existing concepts, after just one experience, without provided labels. The new knowledge can then be used to distinguish between similar experiences, to generalise between classes, and to selectively consolidate to long-term memory. The Hippocampus is known to be vital to these abilities. AHA is a biologically-plausible computational model of the Hippocampus. Unlike most machine learning models, AHA is trained without external labels and uses only local credit assignment. We demonstrate AHA in a superset of the Omniglot one-shot classification benchmark. The extended benchmark covers a wider range of known hippocampal functions by testing pattern separation, completion, and recall of original input. These functions are all performed within a single configuration of the computational model. Despite these constraints, image classification results are comparable to conventional deep convolutional ANNs."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about AHA (Artificial Hippocampal Algorithm), here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a new AI system for rapid visual recognition in autonomous drones.

Which of the following scenarios would best leverage AHA's unique capabilities?\n\nA) Training the system on millions of labeled images to achieve high accuracy in object classification\nB) Enabling the drone to quickly learn and remember new objects it encounters during a single flight\nC) Implementing a deep convolutional neural network for real-time object detection\nD) Using reinforcement learning to optimize the drone's flight path based on visual inputs\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the AHA concept in a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer, B, best leverages AHA's unique capabilities for several reasons:\n\n1. Episodic learning: AHA is designed for \"episodic learning,\" which allows for memorization of specific experiences after just one encounter. This aligns perfectly with the drone quickly learning new objects during a single flight.\n\n2. No external labels: AHA can learn without external labels, which is advantageous in a real-world scenario where the drone encounters unknown objects.\n\n3. Pattern separation and completion: AHA's ability to distinguish between similar experiences (pattern separation) and recall original inputs (pattern completion) would be valuable for a drone identifying and remembering new objects in various contexts.\n\n4.

Leighton & Acrivos (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 181, 1987, pp. 415-439) introduced the idea of shear-induced diffusion that arises due to the hydrodynamic interactions between solid particles. This work considers the Hunt diffusion equation incorporating the concept of shear-induced diffusion and reinvestigates the vertical sediment concentration profile. Analytical solution is derived using a non-perturbation approach, namely Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM), and is verified with numerical solution as well as compared with available experimental data. The behaviour of the shear-induced diffusion coefficient with vertical distance and varying particle diameters have been interpreted physically. In addition, the effects of important turbulent factors such as inverse of Schmidt number, hindered settling velocity on concentration profile, have been investigated considering relevant sets of experimental data."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An environmental engineer is studying sediment transport in an open channel flow.

The correct answer (B) is based on the key finding of the study that turbulent diffusivity alone may not be sufficient to explain sediment transport, especially near the bed where its coefficient is very small or zero. The study introduces the concept of shear-induced diffusion, arising from hydrodynamic interactions between solid particles, to complement turbulent diffusivity in explaining sediment transport from the bed-load layer to the suspension region.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that turbulent diffusivity alone may not be enough to diffuse particles from the bed-load layer to the suspension region. \n\nOption C represents a common misconception.

A Probabilistic Model for Causal Motion Segmentation in\n  Moving Camera Videos. The human ability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple objects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer, and even camouflage. In addition to all of this, the ability to detect motion is nearly instantaneous. While there has been much recent progress in motion segmentation, it still appears we are far from human capabilities. In this work, we derive from first principles a new likelihood function for assessing the probability of an optical flow vector given the 3D motion direction of an object. This likelihood uses a novel combination of the angle and magnitude of the optical flow to maximize the information about the true motions of objects.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but their excessive computation results in long inference time.

Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in each layer for pruning. The limitations of these algorithms reduce the level of achievable sparsity. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without having to pre-train a dense model. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous works by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning them back to sparse after some training. Experiments show that the models pruned using the proposed methods match or beat the quality of the highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object part segmentation, and translation.

As a result, estimates of the star formation rate (from the GRB rate) at high redshifts may be diminished if this effect is not taken into account. In this paper, we estimate the star formation rate (SFR) using the observed GRB rate, accounting for an evolving jet opening angle. We find that the SFR in the early universe (z > 3) can be up to an order of magnitude higher than the canonical estimates, depending on the severity of beaming angle evolution and the fraction of stars that make long gamma-ray bursts. Additionally, we find an excess in the SFR at low redshifts, although this lessens when accounting for evolution of the beaming angle. Finally, under the assumption that GRBs do in fact trace canonical forms of the cosmic SFR, we constrain the resulting fraction of stars that must produce GRBs, again accounting for jet beaming-angle evolution.

The question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the CGC framework and running coupling corrections.\n\nThe documentation states that including running coupling corrections in the gluon production cross section calculations brings in collinear singularities due to final state splittings. These singularities are not affected by the CGC resummations, which is counterintuitive given that CGC dynamics are typically associated with taming infrared divergences.\n\nThis result has several important implications:\n\n1. Despite saturation/CGC dynamics, the gluon production cross section is not infrared-safe. This is a crucial insight that challenges the naive expectation that CGC effects would regulate all infrared behavior.\n\n2. An infrared cutoff (Lambda_coll) is required to regularize these singularities, defining a resolution scale for gluons. This cutoff appears in the argument of the strong coupling constant alpha_s(Lambda_coll^2).\n\n3.

Merger trees harvested from cosmological $N$-body simulations encode the assembly histories of dark matter halos over cosmic time, and are a fundamental component of semi-analytical models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. The ability to compare the tools used to construct merger trees, namely halo finders and tree building algorithms, in an unbiased and systematic manner is critical to assess the quality of merger trees. In this paper, we present the dendogram, a novel method to visualise merger trees, which provides a comprehensive characterisation of a halo's assembly history - tracking subhalo orbits, halo merger events, and the general evolution of halo properties.

When we encounter a new person or place, we may easily encode it into our memories, or we may quickly forget it. Recent work finds that this likelihood of encoding a given entity - memorability - is highly consistent across viewers and intrinsic to an image; people tend to remember and forget the same images. However, several forces influence our memories beyond the memorability of the stimulus itself - for example, how attention-grabbing the stimulus is, how much attentional resources we dedicate to the task, or how primed we are for that stimulus.

This study uses five psychophysical experiments to explore the link between memorability and three attention-related phenomena: 1) bottom-up attention (through testing spatial cueing and visual search), 2) top-down attention (through testing cognitive control and depth of encoding), and 3) priming. These experiments find that memorability remains resilient to all of these phenomena - none are able to explain memorability effects or overcome the strong effects memorability has on determining memory performance.

One popular technique is the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree for all points and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local equivalent points around each octree box, and completes the kernel sum with $O(N)$ cost, using these equivalent points. Simpler kernels can be used between these equivalent points to improve the efficiency of KIFMM. Here we present further extensions and applications to this idea, to enable efficient summations and flexible boundary conditions for various kernels. We call our method the Kernel Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), because it uses different kernel functions at different stages of octree traversal.
