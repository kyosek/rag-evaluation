Deliberate deceptiveness intended to gain an advantage is commonplace in human and animal societies. In a social dilemma, an individual may only pretend to be a cooperator to elicit cooperation from others, while in reality he is a defector. With this as motivation, we study a simple variant of the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game entailing deceitful defectors and conditional cooperators that lifts the veil on the impact of such two-faced behavior. Defectors are able to hide their true intentions at a personal cost, while conditional cooperators are probabilistically successful at identifying defectors and act accordingly. By focusing on the evolutionary outcomes in structured populations, we observe a number of unexpected and counterintuitive phenomena. We show that deceitful behavior may fare better if it is costly, and that a higher success rate of identifying defectors does not necessarily favor cooperative behavior. These results are rooted in the spontaneous emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns that give rise to fascinating phase transitions, which in turn reveal the hidden complexity behind the evolution of deception."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with deceitful defectors and conditional cooperators, what is the unexpected consequence of deceit in a social dilemma, and how does it relate to the emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns?\n\n**A)** Deceitful behavior always leads to a decrease in cooperation and an increase in defection, resulting in a stable state of mutual defection.\n\n**B)** The cost of deceitful behavior is offset by the increased success rate of identifying defectors, leading to a stable state of mutual cooperation.\n\n**C)** The emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns reveals that deceitful behavior can fare better if it is costly, and that a higher success rate of identifying defectors can lead to a stable state of mixed cooperation and defection.\n\n**D)** The study shows that deceitful behavior is always more beneficial than cooperative behavior, and that the emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns is a result of the increased success rate of identifying defectors.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) The emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns reveals that deceitful behavior can fare better if it is costly, and that a higher success rate of identifying defectors can lead to a stable state of mixed cooperation and defection.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the idea that the study reveals unexpected consequences of deceit in a social dilemma, including the emergence of cycling dominance and spatial patterns.

Many ion channels spontaneously switch between different levels of activity. Although this behaviour known as modal gating has been observed for a long time it is currently not well understood. Despite the fact that appropriately representing activity changes is essential for accurately capturing time course data from ion channels, systematic approaches for modelling modal gating are currently not available. In this paper, we develop a modular approach for building such a model in an iterative process. First, stochastic switching between modes and stochastic opening and closing within modes are represented in separate aggregated Markov models. Second, the continuous-time hierarchical Markov model, a new modelling framework proposed here, then enables us to combine these components so that in the integrated model both mode switching as well as the kinetics within modes are appropriately represented. A mathematical analysis reveals that the behaviour of the hierarchical Markov model naturally depends on the properties of its components. We also demonstrate how a hierarchical Markov model can be parameterised using experimental data and show that it provides a better representation than a previous model of the same data set.

Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with synthetic and real-world maps.

A field known as Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently emerged to help address the growing challenges of capturing and processing high-dimensional signals and data sets.

Strong theoretical guarantees have been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent results concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement space, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in $\\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy compressive measurements.
