A growing number of generative statistical models do not permit the numerical evaluation of their likelihood functions. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order statistics within ABC to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale to realistic data sizes, and propose a new distance based on the Hilbert space-filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed method, describing consistency as the threshold goes to zero while the observations are kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows.

Punctuated equilibrium has been originally proposed within the framework of paleobiology, to explain the lack of transitional forms that is typical of the fossil record. Theoretically, punctuated equilibrium has been linked to self-organized criticality (SOC), a model in which the size of avalanches in an evolving system is power-law distributed, resulting in increasing rarity of major events.

We present an equilibrium model of such adhesion, incorporating heterogeneity in target cell epitope density and epitope immobility. We compare with experiments on the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to bilayers containing the relevant natural killer cell receptor, with adhesion mediated by the drug alefacept. We show that a model in which all target cell epitopes are mobile and available is inconsistent with the data, suggesting that more complex mechanisms are at work. We hypothesize that the immobile epitope fraction may change with cell adhesion, and we find that such a model is more consistent with the data. We also quantitatively describe the parameter space in which binding occurs.

The study found that a model assuming all target cell epitopes are mobile and available was inconsistent with experimental data. Instead, the researchers hypothesized that the immobile epitope fraction may change with cell adhesion, and this model was more consistent with the data.

Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) have become widely popular in recent times.

This suggests the possibility of reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a continuous transition.

An inverse cascade - energy transfer to progressively larger scales - is a salient feature of two-dimensional turbulence.

In a doubly periodic rectangle, the mean flow with zero total momentum was therefore believed to be unidirectional, with two jets along the short side; while for an aspect ratio close to unity, a vortex dipole was expected. Using direct numerical simulations, we show that in fact neither the box symmetry is respected nor the largest scale is realized: the flow is never purely unidirectional since the inverse cascade produces coherent vortices, whose number and relative motion are determined by the aspect ratio. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is closely related to the hierarchy of averaging times.

The passage states that the transition at 7.9 K is identified as a second-order phase transition by specific heat measurements.
