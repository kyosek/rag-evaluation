In the scenario of the narrow escape problem (NEP) a particle diffuses in a finite container and eventually leaves it through a small \"escape window\" in the otherwise impermeable boundary, once it arrives to this window and over-passes an entropic barrier at the entrance to it. This generic problem is mathematically identical to that of a diffusion-mediated reaction with a partially-reactive site on the container's boundary. Considerable knowledge is available on the dependence of the mean first-reaction time (FRT) on the pertinent parameters. We here go a distinct step further and derive the full FRT distribution for the NEP. We demonstrate that typical FRTs may be orders of magnitude shorter than the mean one, thus resulting in a strong defocusing of characteristic temporal scales. We unveil the geometry-control of the typical times, emphasising the role of the initial distance to the target as a decisive parameter. A crucial finding is the further FRT defocusing due to the barrier, necessitating repeated escape or reaction attempts interspersed with bulk excursions.

Twin signal recycling features the narrow-band sensitivity gain of conventional detuned signal recycling but furthermore facilitates the injection of squeezed states of light, increases the detector sensitivity over a wide frequency band and requires a less complex detection scheme for optimal signal readout.

Classical topology is an attribute of only certain quantum observables for these axioms, the spatial slice emergent from quantum physics getting progressively less differentiable with increasingly higher excitations of energy and eventually altogether ceasing to exist.

The sets of all their self-adjoint operators are also therefore unitarily equivalent.\" This means that the mathematical structures used in standard quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces and self-adjoint operators) are essentially the same for different topological spaces. Therefore, a quantum physicist working only with these structures and the standard axioms would not be able to distinguish between different topologies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that the Hilbert spaces are isomorphic.\n\nOption B is partially true, but it's not the fundamental reason given in the passage. The issue is the isomorphism between Hilbert spaces, not a limitation of self-adjoint operators themselves.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage doesn't claim quantum mechanics lacks a notion of spatial topology altogether. Instead, it argues that additional axioms are needed to reconstruct spatial topology from quantum observables.\n\nThe correct answer, C, directly reflects the key point made in the passage about the unitary isomorphism between infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which is the root cause of the indistinguishability problem described."}, "23": {"documentation": {"title": "Split-step solitons", "source": "Rodislav Driben and Boris A.

Numerical iterations of the map reveal that, at values of the system's stepsize (cell's size) L comparable to the pulse's dispersion length, SSM supports stable pulses which almost exactly coincide with fundamental solitons of the averaged NLS equation. However, in contrast with the NLS equation, the SSM soliton is a strong attractor, i.e., a perturbed soliton rapidly relaxes to it, emitting some radiation. A pulse whose initial amplitude is too large splits into two solitons; splitting can be suppressed by appropriately chirping the initial pulse. If the initial amplitude is too small, the pulse turns into a breather, and, below a certain threshold, it quickly decays into radiation. If L is essentially larger than the soliton's dispersion length, the soliton rapidly rearranges itself into another soliton, with nearly the same area but essentially smaller energy.

Basically, the modeling methodology is predominantly deterministic and differential equation based while selecting clinical and biological features that seem to be important.

In the traditional approach, the advanced controller (AC) is treated as a black box; when the decision module switches control to the baseline controller (BC), the BC remains in control forever. There is relatively little work on switching control back to the AC, and there are no techniques for correcting the AC's behavior after it generates a potentially unsafe control input that causes a failover to the BC. Our NSA addresses both of these limitations. NSA not only provides safety assurances in the presence of a possibly unsafe neural controller, but can also improve the safety of such a controller in an online setting via retraining, without overly degrading its performance.

Proliferation of grid resources on the distribution network along with the inability to forecast them accurately will render the existing methodology of grid operation and control untenable in the future. Instead, a more distributed yet coordinated approach for grid operation and control will emerge that models and analyzes the grid with a larger footprint and deeper hierarchy to unify control of disparate T&D grid resources under a common framework. Such approach will require AC state-estimation (ACSE) of joint T&D networks. Today, no practical method for realizing combined T&D ACSE exists. This paper addresses that gap from circuit-theoretic perspective through realizing a combined T&D ACSE solution methodology that is fast, convex and robust against bad-data. To address daunting challenges of problem size (million+ variables) and data-privacy, the approach is distributed both in memory and computing resources. To ensure timely convergence, the approach constructs a distributed circuit model for combined T&D networks and utilizes node-tearing techniques for efficient parallelism.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in face recognition, which can be partially attributed to the availability of large-scale labeled face datasets. However, since the faces in these datasets usually contain limited degree and types of variation, the resulting trained models generalize poorly to more realistic unconstrained face datasets. While collecting labeled faces with larger variations could be helpful, it is practically infeasible due to privacy and labor cost. In comparison, it is easier to acquire a large number of unlabeled faces from different domains, which could be used to regularize the learning of face representations. We present an approach to use such unlabeled faces to learn generalizable face representations, where we assume neither the access to identity labels nor domain labels for unlabeled images. Experimental results on unconstrained datasets show that a small amount of unlabeled data with sufficient diversity can (i) lead to an appreciable gain in recognition performance and (ii) outperform the supervised baseline when combined with less than half of the labeled data.
