In ultra-pure materials electrons may exhibit a collective motion similar to the hydrodynamic flow of a viscous fluid, the phenomenon with far reaching consequences in a wide range of many body systems from black holes to high-temperature superconductivity. Yet the definitive detection of this intriguing behavior remains elusive. Until recently, experimental techniques for observing hydrodynamic behavior in solids were based on measuring macroscopic transport properties, such as the \"nonlocal\" (or \"vicinity\") resistance, which may allow alternative interpretation. Earlier this year two breakthrough experiments demonstrated two distinct imaging techniques making it possible to \"observe\" the electronic flow directly.

The effects of weather on agriculture in recent years have become a major global concern. Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool (i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather uncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders are unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the presence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing models. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble technique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and weather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather variable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A mean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal mean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was then proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for different but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models, pricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for cumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented.

Available approaches to control strategy identification usually focus either on attractor or phenotype control, and are unable to deal with more complex control problems, for instance phenotype avoidance. They also fail to capture, in many situations, all possible minimal strategies, finding instead only sub-optimal solutions. In order to fill these gaps, we present a novel approach to control strategy identification in Boolean networks based on model checking. The method is guaranteed to identify all minimal control strategies, and provides maximal flexibility in the definition of the control target.

Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) There exists a Q where the set of numbers Q-normal of all orders in S but not Q-normal of all orders not in S always has Hausdorff dimension 0.\n\nB) If a number is Q-normal of order k, it must also be Q-normal of all orders between 1 and k-1, similar to b-ary expansions.\n\nC) There exists a computable Q where the set of numbers normal of all even orders and not normal of all odd orders has full Hausdorff dimension.\n\nD) For any Q, the block frequencies sampled along non-trivial arithmetic progressions always converge to the expected value for Q-normal numbers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The document states that \"If the function k \u21a6 1_S(k) is computable, then there exist computable examples. For example, there exists a computable basic sequence Q where the set of numbers normal of all even orders and not normal of all odd orders has full Hausdorff dimension.\"\n\nA is incorrect because the document proves the existence of a Q where this set has full Hausdorff dimension, not dimension 0.\n\nB is incorrect because the document explicitly states that this property of b-ary expansions does not hold for these Cantor series expansions.\n\nD is incorrect because the document mentions that the numbers constructed satisfy the unusual condition that block frequencies sampled along non-trivial arithmetic progressions don't converge to the expected value."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "The Straw Tracking Detector for the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ Experiment", "source": "B.

The Muon $g-2$ Experiment at Fermilab uses a gaseous straw tracking detector to make detailed measurements of the stored muon beam profile, which are essential for the experiment to achieve its uncertainty goals. Positrons from muon decays spiral inward and pass through the tracking detector before striking an electromagnetic calorimeter. The tracking detector is therefore located inside the vacuum chamber in a region where the magnetic field is large and non-uniform. As such, the tracking detector must have a low leak rate to maintain a high-quality vacuum, must be non-magnetic so as not to perturb the magnetic field and, to minimize energy loss, must have a low radiation length. The performance of the tracking detector has met or surpassed the design requirements, with adequate electronic noise levels, an average straw hit resolution of $(110 \\pm 20)$ $\\mu$m, a detection efficiency of 97\\% or higher, and no performance degradation or signs of aging. The tracking detector's measurements result in an otherwise unachievable understanding of the muon's beam motion, particularly at early times in the experiment's measurement period when there are a significantly greater number of muons decaying. This is vital to the statistical power of the experiment, as well as facilitating the precise extraction of several systematic corrections and uncertainties.

In this work, we propose the first large scale study of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit, with an emphasis on the impact of unit selection in Sanskrit ASR. In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR dataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic characteristics expressed by the language. We investigate the role of different acoustic model and language model units in ASR systems for Sanskrit.

The agent can experiment with different actions and observe their effects. More specifically, we hypothesize that some of these factors correspond to aspects of the environment which are independently controllable, i.e., that there exists a policy and a learnable feature for each such aspect of the environment, such that this policy can yield changes in that feature with minimal changes to other features that explain the statistical variations in the observed data.

However, large fees reduce the accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to deviate from desirable asset compositions.
