In this paper we present a new way to understand the timing of branching events in phylogenetic trees. Our method explicitly considers the relative timing of diversification events between sister clades; as such it is complimentary to existing methods using lineages-through-time plots which consider diversification in aggregate. The method looks for evidence of diversification happening in lineage-specific ``bursts'', or the opposite, where diversification between two clades happens in an unusually regular fashion. In order to be able to distinguish interesting events from stochasticity, we propose two classes of neutral models on trees with timing information and develop a statistical framework for testing these models. Our models substantially generalize both the coalescent with ancestral population size variation and the global-rate speciation-extinction models. We end the paper with several example applications: first, we show that the evolution of the Hepatitis C virus appears to proceed in a lineage-specific bursting fashion. Second, we analyze a large tree of ants, demonstrating that a period of elevated diversification rates does not appear to occurred in a bursting manner."

The documentation states that \"the radio lobes lie just inside the centroids of the emission-line arcs,\" and that \"These arcs probably arise from an interaction between the ISM and the radio plasma from the active nucleus.\" This relationship suggests that the radio plasma ejected from the AGN is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, creating the observed arc-like structures in the emission-line images. This interaction provides evidence for the influence of the AGN on its host galaxy's environment and supports models of AGN feedback. The presence of multiple emission-line components and the suggestion of \"episodic ejection of radio plasma\" further reinforces the complex and dynamic nature of the AGN's influence on its surroundings."

Our sample consists of 34 galaxies at 3.0<zspec<3.8 between 9.0<log(M_star)<11.0. We find that galaxies with log(M_star) > 10.2 at z > 3 have 56 +/- 21 km/s lower integrated velocity dispersion compared to galaxies at z ~ 2 of similar stellar mass. Massive galaxies at z > 3 have either a flat or declining star formation history (SFH), whereas similar stellar mass galaxies at z~2.0 exhibit a slight peak in the past 500 Myrs. Comparing with the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we find that (i) the dynamical mass of massive galaxies in simulations (log(M_star) > 10.0) increases by ~0.1 dex at a fixed stellar mass between z=2.0-3.0, and (ii) dynamical mass growth is coupled with a rapid rise in the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (stars accreted from other galaxies) for massive galaxies at z < 3.5.

Among the interesting features of those models was the presence of D5-branes behaving like small instantons, and the appearance of extra tensor multiplets. These are both non-perturbative phenomena from the point of view of heterotic string theory. Although the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study these non-perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructive to explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M-theory and F-theory, and consider the relations between them. In particular, we consider models of M-theory compactified on K3 x S^1/Z_2 with fivebranes present on the interval. There is a family of such models which yields the same spectra as a subfamily of the orientifold models. By further compactifying on T^2 to four dimensions we relate them to Heterotic string spectra. We then use Heterotic/Type IIA duality to deduce the existence of Calabi-Yau 3-folds which should yield the original six dimensional orientifold spectra if we use them to compactify F-theory.

In both cases, extreme events arise in the form of discrete rogue waves as a result of nonlinear interaction and rapid coalescence between mobile discrete breathers. In the former model, we find power-law dependence of the wave amplitude distribution and significant probability for the appearance of extreme events close to the integrable limit. In the latter model, more importantly, we find a transition in the the return time probability of extreme events from exponential to power-law regime.

They find applications in almost all areas of physics, from condensed matter and particle physics to cosmology and astrophysics. Scalar fields, in particular, can give rise to confined structures, such as boson stars, oscillatons or Q-balls. These objects are interesting hypothetical new \"dark matter stars\", but also good descriptions of dark matter cores when the fields are ultralight. In this thesis, we study the dynamical response of such confined bosonic structures when excited by external matter (stars, planets or black holes) in their vicinities. Such perturbers can either be piercing through the bosonic configuration or undergoing periodic motion at its center (e.g., binaries). Our setup can also efficiently describe the interaction between a moving massive black hole and the surrounding environment. It also depicts dark matter depletion as a reaction to an inspiralling binary within a dark matter core. Our results provide a complete picture of the interaction between black holes or stars and the ultralight dark matter core environment where they may live in. This thesis also deals with several classical field environmental effects on the motion (or, ultimately, the survival) of compact objects, like black holes."

Complex network theory provides an elegant and powerful framework to statistically investigate different types of systems such as society, brain or the structure of local and long-range dynamical interrelationships in the climate system. Network links in climate networks typically imply information, mass or energy exchange. However, the specific connection between oceanic or atmospheric flows and the climate network's structure is still unclear. We propose a theoretical approach for verifying relations between the correlation matrix and the climate network measures, generalizing previous studies and overcoming the restriction to stationary flows. Our methods are developed for correlations of a scalar quantity (temperature, for example) which satisfies an advection-diffusion dynamics in the presence of forcing and dissipation. Our approach reveals that correlation networks are not sensitive to steady sources and sinks and the profound impact of the signal decay rate on the network topology. We illustrate our results with calculations of degree and clustering for a meandering flow resembling a geophysical ocean jet."

B[e] supergiants are luminous, massive post-main sequence stars exhibiting non-spherical winds, forbidden lines, and hot dust in a disc-like structure. The physical properties of their rich and complex circumstellar environment (CSE) are not well understood, partly because these CSE cannot be easily resolved at the large distances found for B[e] supergiants (typically $\\ga 1$~kpc).

For a physical interpretation of the observables (visibilities and spectrum) we use our ray-tracing radiative transfer code (FRACS), which is optimised for thermal spectro-interferometric observations.

We show how a sufficiently clustered network of simple model neurons can be instantly induced into metastable states capable of retaining information for a short time (a few seconds). The mechanism is robust to different network topologies and kinds of neural model. This could constitute a viable means available to the brain for sensory and/or short-term memory with no need of synaptic learning.

Though prior arts reported on the validation with real human subjects, there is no thorough/rigorous benchmark to quantify the sensitivities and boundary conditions of motion-based core respiratory algorithms that measure sub-pixel displacement between video frames.

Statistical analysis of evolutionary-related protein sequences provides insights about their structure, function, and history. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), designed to learn complex high-dimensional data and their statistical features, can efficiently model protein families from sequence information. We here apply RBM to twenty protein families, and present detailed results for two short protein domains, Kunitz and WW, one long chaperone protein, Hsp70, and synthetic lattice proteins for benchmarking. The features inferred by the RBM are biologically interpretable: they are related to structure (such as residue-residue tertiary contacts, extended secondary motifs ($\\alpha$-helix and $\\beta$-sheet) and intrinsically disordered regions), to function (such as activity and ligand specificity), or to phylogenetic identity. In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and turning up or down the different modes at will. Our work therefore shows that RBM are a versatile and practical tool to unveil and exploit the genotype-phenotype relationship for protein families."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the capabilities and applications of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) in protein analysis, as presented in the research?\n\nA) RBMs can only identify structural features of proteins, such as secondary motifs and tertiary contacts.\n\nB) RBMs are primarily used for phylogenetic analysis and cannot infer functional properties of proteins.\n\nC) RBMs can model protein families, infer various biological features, and be used to design new protein sequences with desired properties.\n\nD) RBMs are limited to analyzing short protein domains and cannot be applied to long proteins or synthetic proteins.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation states that RBMs can efficiently model protein families from sequence information, infer biologically interpretable features related to structure, function, and phylogenetic identity, and can be used to design new protein sequences with putative properties. The research demonstrates that RBMs were applied to various protein types, including short domains (Kunitz and WW), long proteins (Hsp70), and synthetic lattice proteins. Moreover, the inferred features span structural elements (tertiary contacts, secondary motifs, disordered regions), functional aspects (activity and ligand specificity), and phylogenetic information. The ability to design new sequences by manipulating these features further supports the versatility of RBMs in protein analysis and engineering."

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) improves traffic management and reduce the amount of road accidents by providing safety applications. However, VANETs are vulnerable to variety of security attacks from malicious entities. An authentication is an integral a neighborhood of trust establishment and secure communications between vehicles. The Road-side Unit (RSU) evaluates trust-value and the Agent Trusted Authority (ATA) helps in computing the trust-value of auto supported its reward-points. The communication between nodes is enhanced, this can reduce 50% of road accidents. The security of the VANET is improved. We propose the utilization of Elliptic Curve Cryptography in the design of an efficient data encryption/decryption system for sensor nodes in a wireless network. Elliptic Curve Cryptography can provide impressive levels of security standards while keeping down the cost of certain issues, primarily storage space. Sensors will benefit from having to store relatively smaller keys coupled with increased computational capability and this will be a stronger design as the bit-level security is improved. Thus, reducing the time delay between the nodes and to provide better results between them we have made use of this method. The implementation of this work is done with NS2 software."

In contrast, controller and power hardware-in-the-loop simulations are methodologies which ask for real-time execution of simulation models with well-defined simulation sampling rates.

The first assumes that the intracluster gas resides in a static external potential, and includes the effects of optically thin radiative cooling and mass deposition. This corresponds to previous steady-state cooling flow models calculated by White & Sarazin (1987). Detailed agreement is found between steady-state models and time-dependent models at fixed times in the simulations. The mass accretion rate is found either to increase or remain nearly constant once flows reach a steady state. The time rate of change of the accretion rate is strongly sensitive to the value of the mass deposition parameter q, but only mildly sensitive to the ratio beta of gravitational binding energy to gas temperature. We show that previous scaling arguments presented by Bertschinger (1988) and White (1988) are valid only for mature cooling flows with weak mass deposition (q ~< 1). The second set of models includes the effects of a secularly deepening cluster potential and secondary infall of gas from the Hubble flow.

These lecture notes are addressed to PhD student and/or researchers who want a general overview of microscopic approaches based on mean-field and applied to nuclear dynamics. Our goal is to provide a good description of low energy heavy-ion collisions. We present both formal aspects and practical applications of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. The TDHF approach gives a mean field dynamics of the system under the assumption that particles evolve independently in their self-consistent average field. As an example, we study the fusion of both spherical and deformed nuclei with TDHF. We also focus on nucleon transfer which may occur between nuclei below the barrier. These studies allow us to specify the range of applications of TDHF in one hand, and, on the other hand, its intrinsic limitations: absence of tunneling below the Coulomb barrier, missing dissipative effects and/or quantum fluctuations. Time-dependent mean-field theories should be improved to properly account for these effects. Several approaches, generically named \"beyond TDHF\" are presented which account for instance for pairing and/or direct nucleon-nucleon collisions. Finally we discuss recent progresses in exact ab-initio methods based on the stochastic mean-field concept."

The authors belong to the latter group. This document was written as a long introduction to further development of geometric tools in financial applications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio analysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian assumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to estimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate, Mantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show that this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use clustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical covariance matrices from the estimate correlation coefficients.

We develop a theory of covariant influences both when there is a purely deterministic evolution and when randomness is involved. Subsequently, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the transition between states under deterministic covariant influences and necessary conditions in the presence of stochastic covariant influences, predicting which transitions between states are forbidden. Our approach, for the first time, employs the framework of resource theories, borrowed from quantum information theory, for the study of discrete dynamical systems.

In this paper we study long distance modifications of gravity obtained by considering actions that are singular in the limit of vanishing curvature. In particular, we showed in a previous publication that models that include inverse powers of curvature invariants that diverge for r->0 in the Schwarzschild geometry, recover an acceptable weak field limit at short distances from sources. We study then the linearisation of generic actions of the form L=F[R,P,Q] where P=R_{ab}R^{ab} and Q=R_{abcd}R^{abcd}. We show that for the case in which F[R,P,Q]=F[R,Q-4P], the theory is ghost free. Assuming this is the case, in the models that can explain the acceleration of the Universe without recourse to Dark Energy there is still an extra scalar field in the spectrum besides the massless spin two graviton. The mass of this extra excitation is of the order of the Hubble scale in vacuum. We nevertheless recover Einstein gravity at short distances because the mass of this scalar field depends on the background in such a way that it effectively decouples when one gets close to any source. Remarkably, for the values of the parameters necessary to explain the cosmic acceleration the induced modifications of gravity are suppressed at the Solar System level but can be important for systems like a galaxy."

The data scarcity of user preferences and the cold-start problem often appear in real-world applications and limit the recommendation accuracy of collaborative filtering strategies. Leveraging the selections of social friends and foes can efficiently face both problems. In this study, we propose a strategy that performs social deep pairwise learning. Firstly, we design a ranking loss function incorporating multiple ranking criteria based on the choice in users, and the choice in their friends and foes to improve the accuracy in the top-k recommendation task. We capture the nonlinear correlations between user preferences and the social information of trust and distrust relationships via a deep learning strategy. In each backpropagation step, we follow a social negative sampling strategy to meet the multiple ranking criteria of our ranking loss function. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a benchmark dataset from Epinions, among the largest publicly available that has been reported in the relevant literature. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model beats other state-of-the art methods, attaining an 11.49% average improvement over the most competitive model.

This system can significantly compress data with a small percent deviation between the compressed and the original data. At the same time, when the compressed data is used for classification, it still achieves high testing accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that the extracted features of the proposed system can be approximated to uncorrelated Gaussian random variables. Hence, classical theory in estimation and detection can be applied for classification. This motivates us to propose using a MAP (maximum a posteriori) based classification method.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is an important phenomenon observed in various fields including physics and biology. In this connection, we here show that the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings can induce spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators. With a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we demonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase synchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in inducing out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) oscillations compete with each other and give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states and interesting multistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and anti-synchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death (OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter (${\\lambda}$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system, the attractive coupling favours the emergence of an anti-symmetric OD state via a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favours the emergence of a similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation.

The efficacies of pesticide treatments are often evaluated by analyzing the average treatment effects and risks. The stochastic efficiency with respect to a function is often employed in such evaluations through ranking the certainty equivalents of each treatment. The main challenge of using this method is gathering an adequate number of observations to produce results with statistical power. However, in many cases, only a limited number of trials are replicated in field experiments, leaving an inadequate number of observations. In addition, this method focuses only on the farmer's profit without incorporating the impact of disease pressure on yield and profit. The objective of our study is to propose a methodology to address the issue of an insufficient number of observations using simulations and take into account the effect of disease pressure on yield through a quantile regression model.

Three main contributions have been made: a de-aliasing reconstruction model was proposed to accelerate parallel MR imaging with deep learning exploring both spatial redundancy and multi-coil correlations; a split Bregman iteration algorithm was developed to solve the model efficiently; and unlike most existing parallel imaging methods which rely on the accuracy of the estimated multi-coil sensitivity, the proposed method can perform parallel reconstruction from undersampled data without explicit sensitivity calculation. Evaluations were conducted on \\emph{in vivo} brain dataset with a variety of undersampling patterns and different acceleration factors.

This is particularly true for RNA- seq data, since coverage information cannot be used to flag repeated sequences, of which transposable elements are one of the main examples. Most transcriptome assemblers are based on de Bruijn graphs and have no clear and explicit model for repeats in RNA-seq data, relying instead on heuristics to deal with them. The results of this work are twofold. First, we introduce a formal model for repre- senting high copy number repeats in RNA-seq data and exploit its properties for inferring a combinatorial characteristic of repeat-associated subgraphs. We show that the problem of identifying in a de Bruijn graph a subgraph with this charac- teristic is NP-complete. In a second step, we show that in the specific case of a local assembly of alternative splicing (AS) events, we can implicitly avoid such subgraphs. In particular, we designed and implemented an algorithm to efficiently identify AS events that are not included in repeated regions. Finally, we validate our results using synthetic data.

Under algorithmic triage, a predictive model does not predict all instances but instead defers some of them to human experts. However, the interplay between the prediction accuracy of the model and the human experts under algorithmic triage is not well understood. In this work, we start by formally characterizing under which circumstances a predictive model may benefit from algorithmic triage. In doing so, we also demonstrate that models trained for full automation may be suboptimal under triage. Then, given any model and desired level of triage, we show that the optimal triage policy is a deterministic threshold rule in which triage decisions are derived deterministically by thresholding the difference between the model and human errors on a per-instance level. Building upon these results, we introduce a practical gradient-based algorithm that is guaranteed to find a sequence of triage policies and predictive models of increasing performance. Experiments on a wide variety of supervised learning tasks using synthetic and real data from two important applications -- content moderation and scientific discovery -- illustrate our theoretical results and show that the models and triage policies provided by our gradient-based algorithm outperform those provided by several competitive baselines."

Here we claim that Philosophy can be also considered as a source of inspiration.

ODM is instrumental in assembling evolvable mathematical tools to analyze multispectral images. In the case study described in this paper, multispectral images are composed of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images. The results are compared to ground-truth images produced by polynomial networks using a morphological similarity index. The classification results are used to improve the usual analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient map.

Consequently, the wave equation becomes equivalent to a three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction in the basis. Finding solutions of the recursion relation is equivalent to solving the original problem. This method gives a larger class of solvable potentials. The usual diagonal representation constraint results in a reduction to the conventional class of solvable potentials.

Transition path sampling (TPS) is a powerful technique for investigating rare transitions, especially when the mechanism is unknown and one does not have access to the reaction coordinate. Straightforward application of TPS does not directly provide the free energy landscape nor the kinetics, which motivated the development of path sampling extensions, such as transition interface sampling (TIS), and the reweighted paths ensemble (RPE), that are able to simultaneously access both kinetics and thermodynamics. However, performing TIS is more involved than TPS, and still requires (some) insight in the reaction to define interfaces. While packages that can efficiently compute path ensembles for TIS are now available, it would be useful to directly compute the free energy from a single TPS simulation. To achieve this, we developed an approximate method, denoted Virtual Interface Exchange, that makes use of the rejected pathways in a form of waste recycling. The method yields an approximate reweighted path ensemble that allows an immediate view of the free energy landscape from a single TPS, as well as enables a full committor analysis."

FRI signals appear in many engineering applications such as magnetic resonance spectrum, ultra wide-band communication and electrocardiogram. For an FRI signal, we introduce an undirected graph to describe its topological structure. We establish the equivalence between the graph connectivity and phase retrievability of FRI signals, and we apply the graph connected component decomposition to find all FRI signals that have the same magnitude measurements as the original FRI signal has. We construct discrete sets with finite density explicitly so that magnitude measurements of FRI signals on the whole domain are determined by their samples taken on those discrete subsets.

The spin-orbit Mott insulator Sr${}_2$IrO${}_4$ has attracted a lot of interest in recent years from theory and experiment due to its close connection to isostructural high-temperature copper oxide superconductors. Despite of not being superconducting its spectral features closely resemble those of the cuprates, including Fermi surface and pseudogap properties. In this article, we review and extend recent work in the theoretical description of the spectral function of pure and electron-doped Sr${}_2$IrO${}_4$ based on a cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (\"oriented-cluster DMFT\") and compare it to available angle-resolved photoemission data. Current theories provide surprisingly good agreement for pure and electron-doped Sr${}_2$IrO${}_4$, both in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Most notably, one obtains simple explanations for the experimentally observed steep feature around the $M$ point and the pseudo-gap-like spectral feature in electron-doped Sr${}_2$IrO${}_4$."

Accessible epidemiological data are of great value for emergency preparedness and response, understanding disease progression through a population, and building statistical and mechanistic disease models that enable forecasting. The status quo, however, renders acquiring and using such data difficult in practice. In many cases, a primary way of obtaining epidemiological data is through the internet, but the methods by which the data are presented to the public often differ drastically among institutions. As a result, there is a strong need for better data sharing practices. This paper identifies, in detail and with examples, the three key challenges one encounters when attempting to acquire and use epidemiological data: 1) interfaces, 2) data formatting, and 3) reporting. These challenges are used to provide suggestions and guidance for improvement as these systems evolve in the future. If these suggested data and interface recommendations were adhered to, epidemiological and public health analysis, modeling, and informatics work would be significantly streamlined, which can in turn yield better public health decision-making capabilities."

Optical methods for magnetism manipulation have been considered as a promising strategy for ultralow-power and ultrahigh-speed spin switches, which becomes a hot spot in the field of spintronics.

Here, the strongly correlated electron material VO2 is introduced to realize phase-transition based optical control of the magnetism in NiFe. The NiFe/VO2 bilayer heterostructure features appreciable modulations in electrical conductivity (55%), coercivity (60%), and magnetic anisotropy (33.5%). Further analyses indicate that interfacial strain coupling plays a crucial role in this modulation. Utilizing this optically controlled magnetism modulation feature, programmable Boolean logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, NXOR and NOT) for high-speed and low-power data processing are demonstrated based on this engineered heterostructure.

It is known a vector linear solution may exist if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to a certain set of primes. But, can increasing the message dimension make a network vector linearly solvable over a larger set of characteristics? To the best of our knowledge, there exists no network in the literature which has a vector linear solution for some message dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to a set $P$, and for some other message dimension it has a vector linear solution over some finite field whose characteristic does not belong to $P$. We have found that by \\textit{increasing} the message dimension just by $1$, the set of characteristics over which a vector linear solution exists may get arbitrarily larger. However, somewhat surprisingly, we have also found that by \\textit{decreasing} the message dimension just by $1$, the set of characteristics over which a vector linear solution exists may get arbitrarily larger. As a consequence of these finding, we prove two more results: (i) rings may be superior to finite fields in terms of achieving a scalar linear solution over a lesser sized alphabet, (ii) existences of $m_1$ and $m_2$ dimensional vector linear solutions guarantees the existence of an $(m_1 + m_2)$-dimensional vector linear solution only if the $m_1$ and $m_2$ dimensional vector linear solutions exist over the same finite field."

Ben-Sasson and Sudan (RSA 2006) showed that repeated tensor products of linear codes with a very large distance are locally testable. Due to the requirement of a very large distance the associated tensor products could be applied only over sufficiently large fields. Then Meir (SICOMP 2009) used this result (as a black box) to present a combinatorial construction of locally testable codes that match best known parameters. As a consequence, this construction was obtained over sufficiently large fields. In this paper we improve the result of Ben-Sasson and Sudan and show that for \\emph{any} linear codes the associated tensor products are locally testable. Consequently, the construction of Meir can be taken over any field, including the binary field. Moreover, a combination of our result with the result of Spielman (IEEE IT, 1996) implies a construction of linear codes (over any field) that combine the following properties: have constant rate and constant relative distance; have blocklength $n$ and testable with $n^{\\epsilon}$ queries, for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$; linear time encodable and linear-time decodable from a constant fraction of errors.

If the goal is estimation of the average treatment effect or the treatment at more than one score value, the statistical benefits of using a TBD over an RDD are apparent. If the goal is estimation of the average treatment effect at merely one score value, which is typically done by fitting local linear regressions, about 2.8 times more subjects are needed for an RDD in order to achieve the same asymptotic mean squared error.

We propose a new model-based functional mixture discriminant analysis approach based on a specific hidden process regression model that governs the regime changes over time. Our approach is particularly adapted to handle the problem of complex-shaped classes of curves, where each class is potentially composed of several sub-classes, and to deal with the regime changes within each homogeneous sub-class. The proposed model explicitly integrates the heterogeneity of each class of curves via a mixture model formulation, and the regime changes within each sub-class through a hidden logistic process. Each class of complex-shaped curves is modeled by a finite number of homogeneous clusters, each of them being decomposed into several regimes. The model parameters of each class are learned by maximizing the observed-data log-likelihood by using a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons are performed with alternative curve classification approaches, including functional linear discriminant analysis and functional mixture discriminant analysis with polynomial regression mixtures and spline regression mixtures.

We compare the predictions of the stationary Kyle model, a microfounded multi-step linear price impact model in which market prices forecast fundamentals through information encoded in the order flow, with those of the propagator model, a purely data-driven model in which trades mechanically impact prices with a time-decaying kernel. We find that, remarkably, both models predict the exact same price dynamics at high frequency, due to the emergence of universality at small time scales. On the other hand, we find those models to disagree on the overall strength of the impact function by a quantity that we are able to relate to the amount of excess-volatility in the market. We reveal a crossover between a high-frequency regime in which the market reacts sub-linearly to the signed order flow, to a low-frequency regime in which prices respond linearly to order flow imbalances. Overall, we reconcile results from the literature on market microstructure (sub-linearity in the price response to traded volumes) with those relating to macroeconomically relevant timescales (in which a linear relation is typically assumed)."

The hydrograph provides critical information such as the start time, peak level, and volume. Particularly, dam management requires a 6-h lead time of the dam inflow forecast based on a future hydrograph. The authors propose novel target inflow weights to create an ocean feature vector extracted from the analyzed images of the sea surface. We extracted 4,096 elements of the dimension vector in the fc6 layer of the pre-trained VGG16 network. Subsequently, we reduced it to three dimensions of t-SNE. Furthermore, we created the principal component of the sea temperature weights using PCA. We found that these weights contribute to the stability of predictor importance by numerical experiments. As base regression models, we calibrate the least squares with kernel expansion, the quantile random forest minimized out-of bag error, and the support vector regression with a polynomial kernel. When we compute the predictor importance, we visualize the stability of each variable importance introduced by our proposed weights, compared with other results without weights. We apply our method to a dam at Kanto region in Japan and focus on the trained term from 2007 to 2018, with a limited flood term from June to October. We test the accuracy over the 2019 flood term.

The parent compounds Co$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ and Ni$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ undergo a complex sequence of first- and second-order magnetic phase transitions. The low-temperature ($T<40$ K) magnetic entropy evolves monotonously with the doping content $x$, from the full S=1 Ni$^{2+}$ magnetic entropy in Ni$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ to half of the S=3/2 Co$^{2+}$ magnetic entropy in Co$_3$V$_2$O$_8$.

In this work we propose the use of an attention mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non fixed length speech utterances.

The attention model that we propose produces multiple alignments from different subsegments of the CNN encoded states over the sequence. Hence this mechanism works as a pooling layer which decides the most discriminative features over the sequence to obtain an utterance level representation. We have tested this approach for the verification task for the VoxCeleb1 dataset. The results show that self multi-head attention outperforms both temporal and statistical pooling methods with a 18\\% of relative EER.

In the present mainstream cosmology, matter and spacetime emerged from a singularity and evolved through four distinct periods: early inflation, radiation, dark matter and late-time inflation (driven by dark energy). During the radiation and dark matter dominated stages, the universe is decelerating while the early and late-time inflations are accelerating stages. A possible connection between the accelerating periods remains unknown, and, even more intriguing, the best dark energy candidate powering the present accelerating stage (Lambda-vacuum) is plagued with the cosmological constant and coincidence puzzles. Here we propose an alternative solution for such problems based on a large class of time-dependent vacuum energy density models in the form of power series of the Hubble rate, Lambda=Lambda(H). The proposed class of Lambda(H)-decaying vacuum model provides: i) a new mechanism for inflation (different from the usual inflaton models), (ii) a natural mechanism for a graceful exit, which is universal for the whole class of models; iii) the currently accelerated expansion of the universe, iv) a mild dynamical dark energy at present; and v) a final de Sitter stage. Remarkably, the late-time cosmic expansion history of our class of models is very close to the concordance LambdaCDM model, but above all it furnishes the necessary smooth link between the initial and final de Sitter stages through the radiation- and matter-dominated epochs."

However, the current direct-ink-write (DIW) printing-based fabrication of hmSAM parts and structures only permits programmable magnetic direction with a constant magnetic density. Also, the existing designs rely on the brute-force approach to generate the assignment of magnetization direction distribution, which can only produce intuitional deformations. These two factors greatly limit the design space and the application potentials of hmSAMs. In this work, we introduce a voxel-encoding DIW printing method to program both the magnetic density and direction distributions during the hmSAM printing. The voxel-encoding DIW printing is then integrated with an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based design strategy to achieve the desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry variations and curvature distributions. With the new EA-guided voxel-encoding DIW printing technique, we demonstrate the functional hmSAMs that produce complicated shape morphing with desired curvature distributions for advanced applications such as biomimetic motions. These demonstrations indicate that the proposed EA-guided voxel-encoding DIW printing method can significantly broaden the application potentials of the hmSAMs."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary advantage of the evolutionary algorithm (EA)-guided voxel-encoding direct-ink-write (DIW) printing method for hard-magnetic soft active materials (hmSAMs) over traditional DIW printing methods?\n\nA) It allows for faster printing speeds and reduced material waste during fabrication.\n\nB) It enables the programming of both magnetic density and direction distributions, leading to more complex and functional designs.\n\nC) It eliminates the need for external magnetic fields during the printing process.\n\nD) It increases the mechanical strength of the printed hmSAM structures.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The key advantage of the EA-guided voxel-encoding DIW printing method is that it allows for programming both the magnetic density and direction distributions during the hmSAM printing process. This is in contrast to traditional DIW printing methods, which only permit programmable magnetic direction with a constant magnetic density.\n\nThis new method significantly expands the design space and application potential of hmSAMs by enabling the creation of more complex and functional designs. It allows for the achievement of desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry variations and curvature distributions, which was not possible with previous methods that relied on brute-force approaches to generate magnetization direction distribution.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the method may improve design capabilities, the text doesn't mention improvements in printing speed or material efficiency. Answer C is incorrect as the text doesn't discuss the elimination of external magnetic fields. Answer D is incorrect because the focus is on improving magnetic programmability and actuation, not mechanical strength."

We have performed a systematic study of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ production in $p-p$ collisions at different LHC energies and at different rapidities using the leading order (LO) non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) model of heavy quarkonium production. We have included the contributions from $\\chi_{cJ}$ ($J$ = 0, 1, 2) and $\\psi(2S)$ decays to $J/\\psi$. The calculated values have been compared with the available data from the four experiments at LHC namely, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. In case of ALICE, inclusive $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ cross-sections have been calculated by including the feed-down from $B$ meson using Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) formalism. It is found that all the experimental cross-sections are well reproduced for $p_T >$ 4 GeV within the theoretical uncertainties arising due to the choice of the factorization scale. We also predict the transverse momentum distributions of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ both for the direct and feed-down processes at the upcoming LHC energies of $\\sqrt{s} =$ 5.1 TeV and 13 TeV for the year 2015."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the systematic study of charmonium production at LHC energies, which of the following statements is NOT correct regarding the methodology and findings of the research?\n\nA) The study utilized the leading order (LO) non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) model to analyze J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) production in p-p collisions.\n\nB) Contributions from \u03c7_cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) and \u03c8(2S) decays to J/\u03c8 were included in the calculations.\n\nC) For ALICE data, the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) formalism was used to account for feed-down from B mesons in inclusive J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) cross-sections.\n\nD) The study found that experimental cross-sections were well reproduced for all transverse momentum (p_T) values, including those below 4 GeV.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the documentation specifically states that \"all the experimental cross-sections are well reproduced for p_T > 4 GeV within the theoretical uncertainties.\" This implies that the reproduction of cross-sections for p_T values below 4 GeV may not be as accurate or well-matched to experimental data. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are all correct statements based on the information provided in the documentation. The study did use the LO NRQCD model, included contributions from \u03c7_cJ and \u03c8(2S) decays, and employed the FONLL formalism for ALICE data to account for B meson feed-down."
