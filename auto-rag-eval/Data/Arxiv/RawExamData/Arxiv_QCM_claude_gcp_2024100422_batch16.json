An important statistical test on the pseudo-random number generators is called the spectral test. The test is aimed at answering the question of distribution of the generated pseudo-random vectors in dimensions $d$ that are larger than the genuine dimension of a generator $N$. In particular, the default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher. Therefore the spectral test is important to perform in dimensions $d > 8$ for $N=8$ generator, $d> 17$ for $N=17$ and $d> 240$ for $N=240$ generator. These tests have been performed by L'Ecuyer and collaborators. When $d > N$ the vectors of the generated numbers fall into the parallel hyperplanes and the distances between them can be larger than the genuine \"resolution\" of the MIXMAX generators, which is $ l=2^{-61}$. The aim of this article is to further study the spectral properties of the MIXMAX generators, to investigate the dependence of the spectral properties of the MIXMAX generators as a function of their internal parameters and in particular their dependence on the parameter $m$. We found that the best spectral properties are realized when $m$ is between $2^{24}$ and $2^{36}$, a range which is inclusive of the value of the $N=17$ generator. We also provide the alternative parameters for the generators, $N=8$ and $N=240$ with $m$ in this optimised range."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The spectral test is an important statistical test for pseudo-random number generators.

For a MIXMAX generator with N=17, the test becomes crucial for dimensions d > 17. This is because when d > N, the generated vectors fall into parallel hyperplanes, and the distances between them can exceed the generator's genuine resolution of 2^-61. The question specifically asks for the range where the test is most crucial, which is d > 17 for the N=17 generator.\n\nOption A is incorrect because dimensions smaller than the generator's dimension are not the focus of the spectral test.\nOption B is not the best answer because the test becomes more important for dimensions exceeding the generator's dimension.\nOption C, while including some relevant dimensions, is not the most accurate range for the N=17 generator.\nOption D correctly identifies that for the N=17 generator, the spectral test is most crucial for dimensions greater than 17."}, "44": {"documentation": {"title": "Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Entrepreneurship: A New Era Has\n  Begun", "source": "Martin Obschonka, David B.

Companies consider marketing costs as a type of investment and expect this investment to be returned to the company in the form of profit.

To do so, data related to four Arabic emerging markets during the period 2010-2019 are considered, and firm share price and beta share are considered to measure firm value and systematic risk, respectively. Since a firm's ownership concentration is a determinant factor in firm value and systematic risk, this variable is considered a moderated variable in the relationship between marketing investment and firm value and systematic risk. The findings of the study, using panel data regression, indicate that increasing investment in marketing has a positive effect on the firm value valuation model. It is also found that the ownership concentration variable has a reinforcing role in the relationship between marketing investment and firm value.
