The HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) galaxy catalogue is cross-correlated with known low redshift, low column density (N_HI <10^15 cm^-2) Lyman-alpha absorbers from the literature. The redshift-space correlation is found to be similar in strength to HIPASS galaxy self-clustering (correlation length s_0,ag=6+/-4 and s_0,gg=3.1+/-0.5 h^-1 Mpc respectively). In real-space the cross-correlation is stronger than the galaxy auto-correlation (correlation length r_0,ag=7.2+/-1.4 and r_0,gg=3.5+/-0.7 h^-1 Mpc respectively) on scales from 1-10 h^-1 Mpc, ruling out the mini-halo model for the confinement Lyman-alpha absorbers at the 99 percent confidence level.

We present a series of quantum states that are characterized by dark solitons of the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (i.e. the Gross-Pitaevskii equation) for the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas interacting through the repulsive delta-function potentials. The classical solutions satisfy the periodic boundary conditions and we call them periodic dark solitons. Through exact solutions we show corresponding aspects between the states and the solitons in the weak coupling case: the quantum and classical density profiles completely overlap with each other not only at an initial time but also at later times over a long period of time, and they move together with the same speed in time; the matrix element of the bosonic field operator between the quantum states has exactly the same profiles of the square amplitude and the phase as the classical complex scalar field of a periodic dark soliton not only at the initial time but also at later times, and the corresponding profiles move together for a long period of time. We suggest that the corresponding properties hold rigorously in the weak coupling limit. Furthermore, we argue that the lifetime of the dark soliton-like density profile in the quantum state becomes infinitely long as the coupling constant approaches zero, by comparing it with the quantum speed limit time. Thus, we call the quantum states quantum dark soliton states."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between the quantum states of dark solitons in the 1D Bose gas and the classical solutions, as described in the paper \"Quantum states of dark solitons in the 1D Bose gas\"?\n\nA) The quantum states are identical to the classical solutions, but with a different phase.\nB) The quantum states are similar to the classical solutions, but with a different amplitude and phase.\nC) The quantum states are completely different from the classical solutions, with no overlap in density profiles or movement in time.\nD) The quantum states are equivalent to the classical solutions, with the same density profiles and movement in time, and the matrix element of the bosonic field operator has the same profiles as the classical complex scalar field.\n\nCorrect Answer: D) The quantum states are equivalent to the classical solutions, with the same density profiles and movement in time, and the matrix element of the bosonic field operator has the same profiles as the classical complex scalar field.\n\nExplanation: The paper states that the quantum states \"completely overlap with each other not only at an initial time but also at later times over a long period of time, and they move together with the same speed in time\".

With this method, a vision system is involved in both the task demonstration and reproduction stages. An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a task, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The demonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a reference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned model, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task performance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply increasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this end, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between the robot and vision system. More importantly, the sampling rates of the reference trajectory and the robot speed are optimised adaptively according to the learned motion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing two tasks: a trajectory reproduction task and a bimanual sewing task.

We study a mean-field model of a Kondo alloy using numerical techniques and analytic approximations.

Additionally, the Kondo scale TK is defined as TK^0, which implies that TK = 0 at the quantum critical point."}}
