The model consists of a large population of phase oscillators with all-to-all sinusoidal coupling. The oscillators' intrinsic frequencies are randomly distributed across the population according to a prescribed probability density, here taken to be unimodal and symmetric about its mean. As the coupling between the oscillators is increased, the system spontaneously synchronizes: the oscillators near the center of the frequency distribution lock their phases together and run at the same frequency, while those in the tails remain unlocked and drift at different frequencies.

Deciphering the links between amino acid sequence and amyloid fibril formation is key for understanding protein misfolding diseases. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study aggregation of short peptides in a coarse-grained model with hydrophobic-polar (HP) amino acid sequences and correlated side chain orientations for hydrophobic contacts. A significant heterogeneity is observed in the aggregate structures and in the thermodynamics of aggregation for systems of different HP sequences and different number of peptides. Fibril-like ordered aggregates are found for several sequences that contain the common HPH pattern while other sequences may form helix bundles or disordered aggregates. A wide variation of the aggregation transition temperatures among sequences, even among those of the same hydrophobic fraction, indicates that not all sequences undergo aggregation at a presumable physiological temperature. The transition is found to be the most cooperative for sequences forming fibril-like structures. For a fibril-prone sequence, it is shown that fibril formation follows the nucleation and growth mechanism. Interestingly, a binary mixture of peptides of an aggregation-prone and a non-aggregation-prone sequence shows association and conversion of the latter to the fibrillar structure. Our study highlights the role of sequence in selecting fibril-like aggregates and also the impact of structural template on fibril formation by peptides of unrelated sequences."}, "answer": "Here is the difficult multi-form question:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism of fibril formation observed in the study on sequence-dependent aggregation of peptides and fibril formation?\n\nA) Nucleation and growth mechanism\nB) Helix bundle formation\nC) Disordered aggregate formation\nD) Hydrophobic contact-mediated aggregation\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) Nucleation and growth mechanism\n\n**Explanation:** The study highlights that for a fibril-prone sequence, fibril formation follows the nucleation and growth mechanism.

Expanding evolutionary ecology with learning\n  theory. Understanding how the structure of community interactions is modified by coevolution is vital for understanding system responses to change at all scales. However, in absence of a group selection process, collective community behaviours cannot be organised or adapted in a Darwinian sense. An open question thus persists: are there alternative organising principles that enable us to understand how coevolution of component species creates complex collective behaviours exhibited at the community level? We address this issue using principles from connectionist learning, a discipline with well-developed theories of emergent behaviours in simple networks. We identify conditions where selection on ecological interactions is equivalent to 'unsupervised learning' (a simple type of connectionist learning) and observe that this enables communities to self organize without community-level selection.

Far from the centre of any regularised stokeslet we show that the flow can be written in terms of an infinite number of singularity solutions provided the blob decays sufficiently rapidly. This infinite number of singularities reduces to a point force and source dipole for spherically symmetric blobs. Slowly-decaying blobs induce additional flow resulting from the non-zero body forces acting on the fluid.

It is a multiplicative parameter used to convert radial velocities into pulsational velocities. As the BW distances are linearly proportional to the p-factor, its accurate calibration for Cepheids is of critical importance for the reliability of their distance scale. We focus on the observational determination of the p-factor of the long-period Cepheid RS Pup (P = 41.5 days).

The other options are incorrect because the primary purpose of the parameter sensitivity analysis was not to evaluate the effect of learning rates on convergence (A), transition probability functions (C), or predefined functional forms (D)."}}
