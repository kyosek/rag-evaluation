We show that persuasion effectiveness depends on Receiver's material stakes: persuasion is more effective when it is aimed at encouraging behavior that is risky but can potentially yield very high returns and less effective when it is aimed at encouraging more cautious behavior. We illustrate this insight in economically relevant applications showing how financial advisors might take advantage of their clients overoptimistic beliefs and why informational interventions are often inefficient in inducing more investment in preventive health treatments.

The problem of detecting whether a test sample is from in-distribution (i.e., training distribution by a classifier) or out-of-distribution sufficiently different from it arises in many real-world machine learning applications. However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in- and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one.

Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops.

Deep learning within the context of point clouds has gained much research interest in recent years mostly due to the promising results that have been achieved on a number of challenging benchmarks, such as 3D shape recognition and scene semantic segmentation. In many realistic settings however, snapshots of the environment are often taken from a single view, which only contains a partial set of the scene due to the field of view restriction of commodity cameras. 3D scene semantic understanding on partial point clouds is considered as a challenging task. In this work, we propose a processing approach for 3D point cloud data based on a multiview representation of the existing 360{\\deg} point clouds. By fusing the original 360{\\deg} point clouds and their corresponding 3D multiview representations as input data, a neural network is able to recognize partial point sets while improving the general performance on complete point sets, resulting in an overall increase of 31.9% and 4.3% in segmentation accuracy for partial and complete scene semantic understanding, respectively.

Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity named human capacity.

The sum of annual spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form stabilizing feedback loops.

Among other things, it depends on the planned rolling stock circulation and the maintenance activities that need to be performed.
