A two-time-scale function captures the non-exponential character of backbone structural relaxations. One is attributed to the collective segmental motions and the other to local relaxations. The former is well-defined by a single-exponential, nanosecond decay, operative at all temperatures. The latter is described by a set of processes that display a distribution of time-scales.

The collective motions are shown to impose bounds on time-scales spanned by local dynamical processes. The piecewise stationary character below the transition implicates the presence of a collection of sub-states whose interactions are restricted.

This paper studies information freshness in information update systems operated with TDMA and FDMA. Information freshness is characterized by a recently introduced metric, age of information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the last successfully received update. In an update system with multiple users sharing the same wireless channel to send updates to a common receiver, how to divide the channel among users affects information freshness. We investigate the AoI performances of two fundamental multiple access schemes, TDMA and FDMA. We first derive the time-averaged AoI by estimating the packet error rate of short update packets based on Gallager's random coding bound. For time-critical systems, we further define a new AoI metric, termed bounded AoI, which corresponds to an AoI threshold for the instantaneous AoI. Specifically, the instantaneous AoI is below the bounded AoI a large percentage of the time. We give a theoretical upper bound for bounded AoI. Our simulation results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. Although TDMA outperforms FDMA in terms of average AoI, FDMA is more robust against varying channel conditions since it gives a more stable bounded AoI across different received powers. Overall, our findings give insight to the design of practical multiple access systems with AoI requirements."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a multi-user information update system, which of the following statements is true regarding the comparison between TDMA and FDMA in terms of Age of Information (AoI) performance?\n\nA) TDMA consistently outperforms FDMA in both average AoI and bounded AoI metrics across all channel conditions.\n\nB) FDMA provides better average AoI performance but is less stable in terms of bounded AoI across different received powers.\n\nC) TDMA offers superior average AoI performance, while FDMA provides more stable bounded AoI across varying channel conditions.\n\nD) FDMA outperforms TDMA in both average AoI and bounded AoI metrics, especially in time-critical systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the paper, TDMA outperforms FDMA in terms of average AoI, which addresses the first part of the statement.

A central model in theoretical ecology considers the competition of a range of species for a broad spectrum of resources. Recent studies have shown that essentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum, or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space. Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel, which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard competition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped species distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary mechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model.

In this paper, we extend graph-based identification methods by allowing background knowledge in the form of non-zero parameter values. Such information could be obtained, for example, from a previously conducted randomized experiment, from substantive understanding of the domain, or even an identification technique. To incorporate such information systematically, we propose the addition of auxiliary variables to the model, which are constructed so that certain paths will be conveniently cancelled. This cancellation allows the auxiliary variables to help conventional methods of identification (e.g., single-door criterion, instrumental variables, half-trek criterion), as well as model testing (e.g., d-separation, over-identification). Moreover, by iteratively alternating steps of identification and adding auxiliary variables, we can improve the power of existing identification methods via a bootstrapping approach that does not require external knowledge. We operationalize this method for simple instrumental sets (a generalization of instrumental variables) and show that the resulting method is able to identify at least as many models as the most general identification method for linear systems known to date.
