Perceived Community Abidance and Private Compliance\n  to COVID-19 Norms in India. Compliance with measures like social distancing, hand-washing and wearing masks have emerged as the dominant strategy to combat health risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using self-reported data across India (n=934) through online survey, we assess if changes in perceived community compliance can predict changes in individual compliance behavior, controlling for the potential confounders. We observe statistically significant and positive relationship between the two, even after accounting for omitted variable bias, plausibly allowing us to view the results from a plausible causal lens.

A simplistic principle founded upon regular variation theory is that the backoff time has a truncated Pareto-type tail distribution with an exponent of $(\\log \\gamma)/\\log m$ ($m$ is the multiplicative factor and $\\gamma$ is the collision probability). This reveals that the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for $\\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result. The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed processes is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate backoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scale on which we view the backoff processes.

Incident spectra from parent star flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are modeled and compared to energetic particles in importance.

The all-loop resummation of SU$(N)$ gauge theory amplitudes is known to factorize into an IR-divergent (soft and collinear) factor and a finite (hard) piece. The divergent factor is universal, whereas the hard function is a process-dependent quantity. We prove that this factorization persists for the corresponding celestial amplitudes. Moreover, the soft/collinear factor becomes a scalar correlator of the product of renormalized Wilson lines defined in terms of celestial data. Their effect on the hard amplitude is a shift in the scaling dimensions by an infinite amount, proportional to the cusp anomalous dimension. This leads us to conclude that the celestial-IR-safe gluon amplitude corresponds to a expectation value of operators dressed with Wilson line primaries. These results hold for finite $N$. In the large $N$ limit, we show that the soft/collinear correlator can be described in terms of vertex operators in a Coulomb gas of colored scalar primaries with nearest neighbor interactions. In the particular cases of four and five gluons in planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, where the hard factor is known to exponentiate, we establish that the Mellin transform converges in the UV thanks to the fact that the cusp anomalous dimension is a positive quantity.

This paper presents first results on the line profile shapes from a circumstellar envelope in bulk motion as modified by a microlensing event. Only geometrically and optically thin spherical shells in uniform expansion or rotation are considered here so as to emphasise the information content available in the profile shapes. In particular it is demonstrated that for the case of expansion, the line emission can increase by significant factors and the time variation of the profile shape is symmetric about line centre. For uniform rotation the line emission also increases significantly, but the time evolution of the profile shape is distinctly asymmetric. Thus, microlensing is seen to yield information about the velocity field in the extended envelope. We elaborate on (a) the observational advantages of tailoring microlensing programs toward detecting extended circumstellar envelopes, (b) the use of multiline observations to infer other properties of the envelopes, such as the ionization stratification, (c) the use of the continuum excess emission at infrared wavelengths as a means of probing the envelope structure, and (d) the use of polarisation for constraining the properties of ``clumpy'' winds."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A microlensing event is observed for a star with a circumstellar envelope.
