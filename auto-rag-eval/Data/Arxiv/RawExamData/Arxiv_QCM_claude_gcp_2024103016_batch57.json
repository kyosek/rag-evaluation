The linear response of synchronized time-delayed chaotic systems to small external perturbations, i.e., the phenomenon of chaos pass filter, is investigated for iterated maps.

Depending on the model parameters this distribution has power law tails in the region of synchronization leading to diverging moments of distances.

We propose a new approach to solving this problem for a subset of pulsars with a high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum from the Pushchino catalogue (the \"Pushchino\" sample). We provide a theoretical explanation of the observed dependence of the high-frequency cutoff from the pulsar period. The dependence of the cutoff position from the magnetic field is predicted.

In this case acceleration of electrons passes through a maximum and goes to zero when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light.

This trade-off can be hypothesized as being evident in the behaviour of plankton, which inhabit a dilute 3D environment with few refuges or orienting landmarks. We present an analysis of the swimming path geometries based on a volumetric Monte Carlo sampling approach, which is particularly adept at revealing such trade-offs by measuring the self-overlap of the trajectories.

The evolution of a two-dimensional driven lattice-gas model is studied on an L_x X L_y lattice.
