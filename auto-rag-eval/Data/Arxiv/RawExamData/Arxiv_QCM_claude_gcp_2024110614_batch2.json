Contextual bandit algorithms are sensitive to the estimation method of the outcome model as well as the exploration method used, particularly in the presence of rich heterogeneity or complex outcome models, which can lead to difficult estimation problems along the path of learning.

We develop parametric and non-parametric contextual bandits that integrate balancing methods from the causal inference literature in their estimation to make it less prone to problems of estimation bias. We provide the first regret bound analyses for contextual bandits with balancing in the domain of linear contextual bandits that match the state of the art regret bounds. We demonstrate the strong practical advantage of balanced contextual bandits on a large number of supervised learning datasets and on a synthetic example that simulates model mis-specification and prejudice in the initial training data.

The principal rank-one (RO) components of an image represent the self-similarity of the image, which is an important property for image restoration.

We suggest that the RO property should be utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks, extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information. Experimental results on four tasks, i.e., noise-free image super-resolution (SR), realistic image SR, gray-scale image denoising, and color image denoising, show that the method is effective and efficient for image restoration, and it delivers superior performance for realistic image SR and color image denoising."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the Rank-One Network framework for image restoration, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A computer vision researcher is developing an advanced image restoration system for satellite imagery.

This aligns with the core principles of the Rank-One Network framework described in the documentation.\n\nThe framework comprises two key modules: RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition separates a corrupted image into RO components (representing self-similarity) and residual.

This strategy directly addresses the challenges presented in the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. It leverages the physics-based understanding of CBCT image formation, as mentioned in the text: \"Scatter artifacts and noise were extracted from week 1 CBCTs using power law adaptive histogram equalization method and induced to the corresponding pCT followed by reconstruction using CBCT reconstruction parameters.\"\n\n2.

In typical sensor networks, data collection and processing are separated. A sink collects data from all nodes sequentially, which is very time consuming. Over-the-air computation, as a new diagram of sensor networks, integrates data collection and processing in one slot: all nodes transmit their signals simultaneously in the analog wave and the processing is done in the air. This method, although efficient, requires that signals from all nodes arrive at the sink, aligned in signal magnitude so as to enable an unbiased estimation. For nodes far away from the sink with a low channel gain, misalignment in signal magnitude is unavoidable. To solve this problem, in this paper, we investigate the amplify-and-forward based relay, in which a relay node amplifies signals from many nodes at the same time. We first discuss the general relay model and a simple relay policy. Then, a coherent relay policy is proposed to reduce relay transmission power. Directly minimizing the computation error tends to over-increase node transmission power. Therefore, the two relay policies are further refined with a new metric, and the transmission power is reduced while the computation error is kept low.

In the Soft Wall model, the spectrum remains unchanged under this new description. This suggests that the traditional approach and the new approach are equivalent for this model.\n\n2. In the Hard Wall model, however, this new approach leads to \"a much better phenomenological spectrum of vector radial excitations than the traditional description.\" This indicates a significant improvement in predictive power for this particular model.\n\nOption B correctly captures both of these key points: the nature of the innovation (using zero KK modes of massive 5D fields dual to higher-dimensional QCD operators) and its differing impacts on the Soft Wall and Hard Wall models.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they either misrepresent the approach or its implications:\n- A is wrong because the approach doesn't use the full spectrum of massive KK states on AdS\u2085\u00d7S\u2075, and the results aren't new for all models.\n- C is incorrect as it overstates the role of supergravity and incorrectly claims significant alterations to both models.\n- D is inaccurate as it doesn't involve directly applying N=4 super Yang-Mills theory to QCD.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the ability to analyze the implications of a new theoretical approach in different contexts, aligning with higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "$\\sqrt{n}$-consistent parameter estimation for systems of ordinary\n  differential equations: bypassing numerical integration via smoothing", "source": "Shota Gugushvili, Chris A.

We consider the problem of parameter estimation for a system of ordinary differential equations from noisy observations on a solution of the system. In case the system is nonlinear, as it typically is in practical applications, an analytic solution to it usually does not exist. Consequently, straightforward estimation methods like the ordinary least squares method depend on repetitive use of numerical integration in order to determine the solution of the system for each of the parameter values considered, and to find subsequently the parameter estimate that minimises the objective function. This induces a huge computational load to such estimation methods. We study the consistency of an alternative estimator that is defined as a minimiser of an appropriate distance between a nonparametrically estimated derivative of the solution and the right-hand side of the system applied to a nonparametrically estimated solution.

Option C (human evaluation) could be effective but is subjective and not scalable for large datasets. Option D (focusing on the discriminator) doesn't address the evaluation metric issue and might lead to overfitting.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about GAN evaluation methods rather than simple memorization."}, "28": {"documentation": {"title": "An Interactive Control Approach to 3D Shape Reconstruction", "source": "Bipul Islam, Ji Liu, Anthony Yezzi, Romeil Sandhu", "docs_id": "1910.02738", "section": ["cs.CV", "cs.RO", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "An Interactive Control Approach to 3D Shape Reconstruction. The ability to accurately reconstruct the 3D facets of a scene is one of the key problems in robotic vision.

Simply put, there always remains an information gap due to the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios. To this end, we demonstrate a feedback control framework which invokes operator inputs (also prone to errors) in order to augment existing reconstruction schemes. For proof-of-concept, we choose a classical region-based stereoscopic reconstruction approach and show how an ill-posed model can be augmented with operator input to be much more robust to scene artifacts. We provide necessary conditions for stability via Lyapunov analysis and perhaps more importantly, we show that the stability depends on a notion of absolute curvature.

Although geographic features, such as mountains and coastlines, are fractal, some studies have claimed that the fractal property is not universal. This claim, which is false, is mainly attributed to the strict definition of fractal dimension as a measure or index for characterizing the complexity of fractals. In this paper, we propose an alternative, the ht-index, to quantify the fractal or scaling structure of geographic features. A geographic feature has ht-index h if the pattern of far more small things than large ones recurs (h-1) times at different scales. The higher the ht-index, the more complex the geographic feature. We conduct three case studies to illustrate how the computed ht-indices capture the complexity of different geographic features.

Competition is a main tenet of economics, and the reason is that a perfectly competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient in the absence of externalities and public goods. Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to its competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of competition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model by Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the {\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select seller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$ is the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce stochasticity.

In this work, we extend the model by incorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to control how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an oscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the $(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field approximations.

The robustness of optical flow networks to adversarial attacks, however, has not been studied so far. In this paper, we extend adversarial patch attacks to optical flow networks and show that such attacks can compromise their performance.

Our attacks lead to noisy flow estimates that extend significantly beyond the region of the attack, in many cases even completely erasing the motion of objects in the scene. While networks using an encoder-decoder architecture are very sensitive to these attacks, we found that networks using a spatial pyramid architecture are less affected.

Based on a simple theoretical prey-predator model, here, we show that an optimality criterion for the survival can be established on the interaction range of preys.
