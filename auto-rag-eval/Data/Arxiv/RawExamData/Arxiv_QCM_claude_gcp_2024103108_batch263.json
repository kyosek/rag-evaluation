Similar power laws are found not only in income distribution of company's income, but also in the distributions of capital, sales and number of employees. From the data we find an important time evolutionary property that the growth rate of income is approximately independent of the value of income, namely, small companies and large ones have similar statistical chances of growth. This observational fact suggests the applicability of the theory of multiplicative stochastic processes developed in statistical physics. We introduce a discrete version of Langevin equation with additive and multiplicative noises as a simple time evolution model of company's income. We test the validity of the Takayasu-Sato-Takayasu condition [Takayasu, Sato and Takayasu 1997] for having an asymptotic power law distribution as a unique statistically steady solution.

This significant improvement is primarily due to the reformulation of the mean-squared error metric, which allows it to be calculated from the diffraction field rather than requiring a forward transform step. This reduces the iteration cost from O(NxNy) to O(1), resulting in an overall algorithmic performance of O(NxNy) instead of O(Nx^2Ny^2). The question specifically asks about the comparison to traditional direct search methods, not the naive algorithm with O((NxNy)!) complexity. Additionally, the improvement is not due to a reduced number of iterations or a guaranteed global minimum, but rather the reformulated error metric calculation."}, "11": {"documentation": {"title": "A Tale of Two Distributions: From Few To Many Vortices In\n  Quasi-Two-Dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensates", "source": "T.

(Abridged) We present a simple framework for the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the hierarchical structure formation paradigm. In our model, black hole accretion is triggered during major mergers (mass ratio>~0.3) between host dark matter halos. The successive evolution of quasar luminosities follows a universal light curve form: an initial exponential growth at constant Eddington ratio of order unity until it reaches the peak luminosity, followed by a power-law decay. Assuming that the peak luminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the light curve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasar luminosity function (LF). Our model reproduces the observed LF at 0.5<z<4.5 for the full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and X-ray surveys. Our model reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependence of the linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering. Due to the scatter between instantaneous luminosity and halo mass, quasar/AGN clustering weakly depends on luminosity at low to intermediate luminosities; but the linear bias rises rapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift. In our model, the Eddington ratio distribution is roughly log-normal, which broadens and shifts to lower mean values from high luminosity quasars (L_bol>~10^46 erg s^-1) to low luminosity AGNs (L_bol<~ 10^45 erg s^-1), in good agreement with observations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the model described in the paper, which of the following statements is NOT correct regarding the evolution of quasar luminosities and their relationship to dark matter halos?\n\nA) Quasar activity is triggered by major mergers between dark matter halos with a mass ratio greater than approximately 0.3.\n\nB) The quasar luminosity follows a universal light curve with an initial exponential growth phase followed by a power-law decay.\n\nC) The peak luminosity of a quasar is directly proportional to the mass of the post-merger dark matter halo, with no scatter in the relationship.\n\nD) The model successfully reproduces the observed quasar luminosity function for a wide range of redshifts and luminosities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it incorrectly states that there is no scatter in the relationship between peak luminosity and post-merger halo mass.

We propose a unified dynamic model based on the adaptation of niche relations that gives rise to both structural features.

Modularity and nestedness emerge concurrently through the accumulated local advantages in the structural and demographic distribution.

We demonstrate that mutualism can exhibit either a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the evolved network, which undergoes a drastic transition with the overall competition level. Most strikingly, the adaptive network may exhibit a profound nature of history-dependency in response to environmental changes, allowing it to be found in alternative stable structures.

It has been empirically observed that the flatness of minima obtained from training deep networks seems to correlate with better generalization. However, for deep networks with positively homogeneous activations, most measures of sharpness/flatness are not invariant to rescaling of the network parameters, corresponding to the same function. This means that the measure of flatness/sharpness can be made as small or as large as possible through rescaling, rendering the quantitative measures meaningless. In this paper we show that for deep networks with positively homogenous activations, these rescalings constitute equivalence relations, and that these equivalence relations induce a quotient manifold structure in the parameter space. Using this manifold structure and an appropriate metric, we propose a Hessian-based measure for flatness that is invariant to rescaling.

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that is widespread in many regions of the world.

In addition, the screening of individuals with the largely asymptomatic condition of sickle cell trait (SCT) is necessary to curtail the genetic propagation of the disease. However, the cost and complexity of conventional diagnostic methods limit the feasibility of early diagnosis of SCD and SCT in resource-limited areas worldwide.
