We define discounted differential privacy, as an alternative to (conventional) differential privacy, to investigate privacy of evolving datasets, containing time series over an unbounded horizon. We use privacy loss as a measure of the amount of information leaked by the reports at a certain fixed time. We observe that privacy losses are weighted equally across time in the definition of differential privacy, and therefore the magnitude of privacy-preserving additive noise must grow without bound to ensure differential privacy over an infinite horizon. Motivated by the discounted utility theory within the economics literature, we use exponential and hyperbolic discounting of privacy losses across time to relax the definition of differential privacy under continual observations. This implies that privacy losses in distant past are less important than the current ones to an individual. We use discounted differential privacy to investigate privacy of evolving datasets using additive Laplace noise and show that the magnitude of the additive noise can remain bounded under discounted differential privacy. We illustrate the quality of privacy-preserving mechanisms satisfying discounted differential privacy on smart-meter measurement time-series of real households, made publicly available by Ausgrid (an Australian electricity distribution company)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary motivation for introducing discounted differential privacy, and how does it address the limitations of conventional differential privacy for evolving datasets?\n\nA) It allows for stronger privacy guarantees by increasing noise over time\nB) It enables the use of smaller datasets while maintaining privacy\nC) It permits bounded noise for infinite time horizons by weighing recent privacy losses more heavily\nD) It eliminates the need for additive noise in privacy-preserving mechanisms\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation introduces discounted differential privacy as an alternative to conventional differential privacy specifically to address the challenge of dealing with evolving datasets over an infinite time horizon. \n\nThe key limitation of conventional differential privacy in this context is that it weighs privacy losses equally across all time periods. This means that to maintain privacy over an infinite horizon, the magnitude of privacy-preserving additive noise would need to grow without bound.\n\nDiscounted differential privacy addresses this by using exponential and hyperbolic discounting of privacy losses across time. This approach gives more weight to recent privacy losses and less weight to those in the distant past. As a result, it allows for the use of bounded additive noise even over an infinite time horizon, which is not possible with conventional differential privacy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because discounted differential privacy actually allows for potentially smaller noise over time compared to conventional methods. Option B is not mentioned in the text and doesn't address the time horizon issue. Option D is incorrect because discounted differential privacy still uses additive noise, just potentially with bounded magnitude."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Automating Cluster Management with Weave", "source": "Lalith Suresh, Joao Loff, Faria Kalim, Nina Narodytska, Leonid Ryzhyk,\n  Sahan Gamage, Brian Oki, Zeeshan Lokhandwala, Mukesh Hira, Mooly Sagiv", "docs_id": "1909.03130", "section": ["cs.DC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Automating Cluster Management with Weave.

This paper studies a penalized statistical decision rule for the treatment assignment problem. Consider the setting of a utilitarian policy maker who must use sample data to allocate a binary treatment to members of a population, based on their observable characteristics. We model this problem as a statistical decision problem where the policy maker must choose a subset of the covariate space to assign to treatment, out of a class of potential subsets.

A new topological excitation called skyrmion has been observed experimentally in chiral magnets without spatial inversion symmetry. The dynamics of a skyrmion is equivalent to an electron moving in a strong magnetic field. As a skyrmion involves large number of spins, it is not clear whether there exist observable quantum effects. In this work, we study the quantum dynamics of a skyrmion in a pinning potential. Without a pinning potential, the skyrmion performs cyclotron motion due to the strong emergent magnetic field originating from the Berry phase of spins, and all skyrmions occupy the lowest Landau level. Their wave functions are strongly localized in a region with radius less than $1\\ \\AA$ when no driving force is applied. Thus in most circumstances, the quantum effects of a skyrmion are weak. In the presence of a pinning potential, the lowest Landau level for skyrmions is split into quantized levels, characterized by the orbital moments.

Multi-contrast MRI protocols increase the level of morphological information available for diagnosis. Yet, the number and quality of contrasts is limited in practice by various factors including scan time and patient motion. Synthesis of missing or corrupted contrasts can alleviate this limitation to improve clinical utility. Common approaches for multi-contrast MRI involve either one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis methods. One-to-one methods take as input a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive to common features across sources. For enhanced image synthesis, here we propose a multi-stream approach that aggregates information across multiple source images via a mixture of multiple one-to-one streams and a joint many-to-one stream. The shared feature maps generated in the many-to-one stream and the complementary feature maps generated in the one-to-one streams are combined with a fusion block.

One of the most common learning techniques in game theory is fictitious play. However fictitious play is founded on an implicit assumption that opponents' strategies are stationary. We present a novel variation of fictitious play that allows the use of a more realistic model of opponent strategy. It uses a heuristic approach, from the online streaming data literature, to adaptively update the weights assigned to recently observed actions.

We cross-match the 60-um selected Revised IRAS Faint Source Survey Redshift (RIFSCz) catalogue and the 150-MHz selected LOFAR value-added source catalogue in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring Field.

Microbiology is the science of microbes, particularly bacteria. Many bacteria are motile: they are capable of self-propulsion. Among these, a significant class execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight path for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating the process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is diffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically, motility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local environment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady state is reached, this is not generally invariant under time-reversal: the principle of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal symmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile bacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy that drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller.
