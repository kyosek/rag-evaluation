In the limits of strong and weak inter-layer couplings multiplex diffusion has been linked to the spectrum of the supra-Laplacian associated to the system.

They tend to utilize the iterative processes, optimizing the parameters of the molecular generative models at each iteration to produce promising molecules for further validation. Assessments are exploited to evaluate the generated molecules at each iteration, providing direction for model optimization. However, most previous works require a massive number of expensive and time-consuming assessments, e.g., wet experiments and molecular dynamic simulations, leading to the lack of practicability. To reduce the assessments in the iterative process, we propose a cost-effective evolution strategy in latent space, which optimizes the molecular latent representation vectors instead.

Therefore, this provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability.

The sudden area enlargement causes rapid lateral divergence of gases in the reaction zone, which attenuates the leading shock. If the initial channel width is sufficiently small, this process can cause the detonation to decay to a deflagration.

Some bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotic A but susceptible to antibiotic B, while others show the opposite pattern. A third group shows moderate resistance to both antibiotics.

This strategy involves population-wise diversification, which is exactly what we observe in the described bacterial population. Different subgroups within the population are specialized for different environmental conditions (different antibiotic exposures), while some maintain a generalist phenotype. This diversity allows the population as a whole to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions where the presence and type of antibiotics may be unpredictable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because specialization would involve the entire population adapting to one specific condition, which is not the case here.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a generalist phenotype would involve all individuals having moderate resistance to both antibiotics, which only describes one subgroup in this population.\n\nAnswer D is plausible but less likely in this scenario.

In multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) LANs, the achievable throughput of a client depends on who are transmitting concurrently with it.

Such a contention-based protocol not only wastes lots of channel time on multiple rounds of contention, but also fails to maximally deliver the gain of MU-MIMO because users randomly join concurrent transmissions without considering their channel characteristics. To address such inefficiency, this paper introduces MIMOMate, a leader-contention-based MU-MIMO MAC protocol that matches clients as concurrent transmitters according to their channel characteristics to maximally deliver the MU-MIMO gain, while ensuring all users to fairly share concurrent transmission opportunities. Furthermore, MIMOMate elects the leader of the matched users to contend for transmission opportunities using traditional 802.11 CSMA/CA. It hence requires only a single contention overhead for concurrent streams, and can be compatible with legacy 802.11 devices.

The documentation states that V2301 Oph joins seven other systems that do not show a distinct soft X-ray component in their spectra. The authors suggest that systems which are asynchronous, have low mass transfer rates, or have accretion occurring over a relatively large fraction of the white dwarf are more likely to show this effect.

Additionally, the absence of a soft X-ray component is associated with low, not high, mass transfer rates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that V2301 Oph joins seven other systems in not showing this component, so it is not unique to this system.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the explanation for the absence of a soft X-ray component suggests asynchronicity as a possible factor, not synchronicity.

Modern statistics provides an ever-expanding toolkit for estimating unknown parameters. Consequently, applied statisticians frequently face a difficult decision: retain a parameter estimate from a familiar method or replace it with an estimate from a newer or complex one. While it is traditional to compare estimators using risk, such comparisons are rarely conclusive in realistic settings. In response, we propose the \"c-value\" as a measure of confidence that a new estimate achieves smaller loss than an old estimate on a given dataset. We show that it is unlikely that a computed c-value is large and that the new estimate has larger loss than the old. Therefore, just as a small p-value provides evidence to reject a null hypothesis, a large c-value provides evidence to use a new estimate in place of the old. For a wide class of problems and estimators, we show how to compute a c-value by first constructing a data-dependent high-probability lower bound on the difference in loss.
