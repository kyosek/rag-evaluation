Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method for controlling robotic systems, particularly autonomous aerial vehicles such as quadcopters. However, application of MPC can be computationally demanding, and typically requires estimating the state of the system, which can be challenging in complex, unstructured environments. Reinforcement learning can in principle forego the need for explicit state estimation and acquire a policy that directly maps sensor readings to actions, but is difficult to apply to unstable systems that are liable to fail catastrophically during training before an effective policy has been found. We propose to combine MPC with reinforcement learning in the framework of guided policy search, where MPC is used to generate data at training time, under full state observations provided by an instrumented training environment. This data is used to train a deep neural network policy, which is allowed to access only the raw observations from the vehicle's onboard sensors. After training, the neural network policy can successfully control the robot without knowledge of the full state, and at a fraction of the computational cost of MPC. We evaluate our method by learning obstacle avoidance policies for a simulated quadrotor, using simulated onboard sensors and no explicit state estimation at test time."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the primary advantage of combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of autonomous aerial vehicle control, as proposed in the paper?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for any sensors on the aerial vehicle.\nB) It allows for real-time MPC computation during flight operations.\nC) It enables the training of a policy that can operate without full state information while avoiding catastrophic failures during learning.\nD) It completely replaces the need for MPC in autonomous aerial vehicle control.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The paper proposes combining MPC with RL in a guided policy search framework. This approach uses MPC to generate training data in a controlled environment where full state information is available. This data is then used to train a deep neural network policy that can operate using only raw sensor data, without full state information. This method addresses two key challenges:\n\n1. It avoids catastrophic failures during training, which is a common issue when applying RL directly to unstable systems like quadcopters.\n2. It allows the final policy to operate without full state estimation, which can be challenging in complex, unstructured environments.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the method still relies on onboard sensors for the final policy. Answer B is incorrect because the goal is to replace MPC during flight operations with a more computationally efficient neural network policy. Answer D is incorrect because MPC is still used, but only during the training phase to generate data."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Continuum versus Discrete: A Physically Interpretable General Rule For\n  Cellular Automata By Means of Modular Arithmetic", "source": "Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro Ozelim, Andr\\'e Lu\\'is Brasil Cavalcante\n  and Lucas Parreira de Faria Borges", "docs_id": "1206.2556", "section": ["nlin.CG"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Continuum versus Discrete: A Physically Interpretable General Rule For\n  Cellular Automata By Means of Modular Arithmetic. Describing complex phenomena by means of cellular automata (CA) has shown to be a very effective approach in pure and applied sciences. In fact, the number of published papers concerning this topic has tremendously increased over the last twenty years. Most of the applications, notwithstanding, use cellular automata to qualitatively describe the phenomena, which is surely a consequence of the way the automata rules have been defined. In the present paper a general rule which describes every of Wolfram's cellular automata is derived. The new representation is given in terms of a new function hereby defined, the iota-delta function. The latter function is further generalized in order to provide a general rule for not only Wolfram's but also to every CA rule which depends on the sum and products of the values of cells in the automaton mesh. By means of a parallel between the finite difference method and the iota-delta function, the new representation provides a straightforward physical interpretation of CA, which gives, for the first time, a quantitative interpretation of the generating rule itself.

We explore the hypothesis that the relative abundance of feedback loops in many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an inherent global directionality. Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\\gamma$ controls the degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio- technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter $\\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\\gamma$ correlates quite well with another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a novel algorithm.

The study introduces a probabilistic model with a parameter \u03b3 that controls the degree of inherent directionality in networks.

Motivated by this tension, we show that p-wave annihilating dark matter can easily accommodate both sets of observations due to the lower DM velocity dispersion in dwarf galaxies.

We outline a scenario in which the usual thermal abundance is obtained through s-wave annihilations of a metastable particle, that eventually decays into the p-wave annihilating DM of the present epoch. The couplings and lifetime of the decaying particle are constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background and direct detection, but significant regions of parameter space are viable.

The model described in the documentation uses p-wave annihilating dark matter to explain the galactic center excess while avoiding conflicts with dwarf spheroidal constraints due to lower velocity dispersion in these galaxies.

This paper proposes two kinds of time-inconsistent preferences (i.e. time flow inconsistency and critical time point inconsistency) to further advance the research on the exit decision of venture capital. Time-inconsistent preference, different from time-consistent preference, assumes that decision makers prefer recent returns rather than future returns. Based on venture capitalists' understanding of future preferences, we consider four types of venture capitalists, namely time-consistent venture capitalists, venture capitalists who only realize critical time point inconsistency, naive venture capitalists and sophisticated venture capitalists, of which the latter three are time-inconsistent.
