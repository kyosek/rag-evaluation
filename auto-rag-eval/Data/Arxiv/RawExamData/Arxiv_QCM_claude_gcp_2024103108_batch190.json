The anisotropic flow observed in heavy-ion collision experiments is mostly attributed to the hydrodynamic response to the event-by-event collision geometry and to the sub-nucleon quantum fluctuations. However, hydrodynamic fluctuations are present during the dynamical evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and are quantified by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

Bond graphs can be used to build thermodynamically-compliant hierarchical models of biomolecular systems.

The particular structure of bond graphs arising from biomolecular systems is established and used to elucidate the relation between thermodynamically closed and open systems. Block diagram representations of the dynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback structures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical methods.

From nutrient uptake, to chemoreception, to synaptic transmission, many systems in cell biology depend on molecules diffusing and binding to membrane receptors.

A key example is the celebrated formula of Berg and Purcell for the rate that cell surface receptors capture extracellular molecules. Indeed, this influential result is only valid if receptors transport molecules through the cell wall at a rate much faster than molecules arrive at receptors. From a mathematical perspective, ignoring receptor kinetics is convenient because it makes the diffusing molecules independent. In contrast, including receptor kinetics introduces correlations between the diffusing molecules since, for example, bound receptors may be temporarily blocked from binding additional molecules.
