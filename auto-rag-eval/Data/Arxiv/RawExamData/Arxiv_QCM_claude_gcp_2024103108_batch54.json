To develop and investigate detailed mathematical models of cellular metabolic processes is one of the primary challenges in systems biology. However, despite considerable advance in the topological analysis of metabolic networks, explicit kinetic modeling based on differential equations is still often severely hampered by inadequate knowledge of the enzyme-kinetic rate laws and their associated parameter values. Here we propose a method that aims to give a detailed and quantitative account of the dynamical capabilities of metabolic systems, without requiring any explicit information about the particular functional form of the rate equations. Our approach is based on constructing a local linear model at each point in parameter space, such that each element of the model is either directly experimentally accessible, or amenable to a straightforward biochemical interpretation. This ensemble of local linear models, encompassing all possible explicit kinetic models, then allows for a systematic statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space.

Electric field measurement in plasmas permits quantitative comparison between the experiment and the simulation in this study. An electro-optic (EO) sensor based on Pockels effect is demonstrated to measure wave electric fields in the laboratory magnetosphere of the RT-1 device with high frequency heating sources. This system gives the merits that electric field measurements can detect electrostatic waves separated clearly from wave magnetic fields, and that the sensor head is separated electrically from strong stray fields in circumference. The electromagnetic waves are excited at the double loop antenna for ion heating in electron cyclotron heated plasmas. In the air, the measured wave electric fields are in good absolute agreement with those predicted by the TASK/WF2 code. In inhomogeneous plasmas, the wave electric fields in the peripheral region are enhanced compared with the simulated electric fields. The potential oscillation of the antenna is one of the possible reason to explain the experimental results qualitatively."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An electro-optic (EO) sensor is used to measure wave electric fields in the RT-1 device.

This paper explores the effects of simulated moments on the performance of inference methods based on moment inequalities.

In particular, a (first-order) bias due to the simulation errors may remain in the estimated boundary of the confidence set. We demonstrate, through Monte Carlo experiments, that simulation errors can significantly reduce the coverage probabilities of confidence sets in small samples. The size distortion is particularly severe when the number of inequality restrictions is large. These results highlight the danger of ignoring the sampling variations due to the simulation errors in moment inequality models.

The other factor is an OU process driven by a pure jump L\\'evy process and models the characteristic spikes observed in such markets.
