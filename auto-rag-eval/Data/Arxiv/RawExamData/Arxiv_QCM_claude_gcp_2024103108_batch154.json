Maintaining good cardiac function for as long as possible is a major concern for healthcare systems worldwide and there is much interest in learning more about the impact of different risk factors on cardiac health.

The question of \"Justice\" still divides social research and moral philosophy.

Two approaches are widely used in the literature to fuse multiple modalities in the segmentation networks: early-fusion (which stacks multiple modalities as different input channels) and late-fusion (which fuses the segmentation results from different modalities at the very end). These fusion methods easily suffer from the cross-modal interference caused by the input modalities which have wide variations. To address the problem, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely OctopusNet, to better leverage and fuse the information contained in multi-modalities.
