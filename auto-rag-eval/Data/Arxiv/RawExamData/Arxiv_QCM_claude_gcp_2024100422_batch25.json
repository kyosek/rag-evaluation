A causal loop analysis suggested that there were risks to prematurely terminating such interventions. On the basis of this result and subsequent quantitative modelling, we found that the short-term effectiveness of a short-term pre-emptive stay-at-home request caused a resurgence in the number of positive cases, whereas an additional request provided a limited negative add-on effect for economic measures (e.g. the number of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communications and restaurant visits).

The complex organization of syntax in hierarchical structures is one of the core design features of human language. Duality of patterning refers for instance to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two distinct levels: a combinatorial level where meaningless forms are combined into meaningful forms and a compositional level where meaningful forms are composed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and compositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these observables in human natural languages. Second, we show that the theoretical predictions of a multi-agents modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, are in surprisingly good agreement with empirical data.

This paper develops two new statistical tests that can be used to investigate whether there is evidence supporting group-specific heterogeneity in the data. The first test statistic is designed for the alternative hypothesis of group-specific heterogeneity appearing in at least one pair of groups; the second is for the alternative of group-specific heterogeneity appearing in all pairs of groups.

While extensive effort has been put into optimizing web applications (both in industry and academia), not a lot of work exists in characterizing what aspects of webpage loading process truly influence human end-user's perception of the \"Speed\" of a page. In this paper we present \"SpeedPerception\", a large-scale web performance crowdsourcing framework focused on understanding the perceived loading performance of above-the-fold (ATF) webpage content.

Pareto law, which states that wealth distribution in societies have a power-law tail, has been a subject of intensive investigations in statistical physics community.

Data SV can be used together with a learning model and an evaluation metric to validate each training point's contribution to the model's performance.

Audio source separation is the process of separating a mixture (e.g. a pop band recording) into isolated sounds from individual sources (e.g. just the lead vocals).

We present a confidence measure that does not require ground truth to estimate separation quality, given a deep model and audio mixture. We use this confidence measure to automatically select the model output with the best predicted separation quality.
