In this paper, we explore the relationship between state-level household income inequality and macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States. Using a novel large-scale macroeconometric model, we shed light on regional disparities of inequality responses to a national uncertainty shock. The results suggest that income inequality decreases in most states, with a pronounced degree of heterogeneity in terms of shapes and magnitudes of the dynamic responses. By contrast, some few states, mostly located in the West and South census region, display increasing levels of income inequality over time. We find that this directional pattern in responses is mainly driven by the income composition and labor market fundamentals. In addition, forecast error variance decompositions allow for a quantitative assessment of the importance of uncertainty shocks in explaining income inequality. The findings highlight that volatility shocks account for a considerable fraction of forecast error variance for most states considered.

The evolution and distribution of species body sizes for terrestrial mammals is well-explained by a macroevolutionary tradeoff between short-term selective advantages and long-term extinction risks from increased species body size, unfolding above the 2g minimum size induced by thermoregulation in air. Here, we consider whether this same tradeoff, formalized as a constrained convection-reaction-diffusion system, can also explain the sizes of fully aquatic mammals, which have not previously been considered. By replacing the terrestrial minimum with a pelagic one, at roughly 7000g, the terrestrial mammal tradeoff model accurately predicts, with no tunable parameters, the observed body masses of all extant cetacean species, including the 175,000,000g Blue Whale. This strong agreement between theory and data suggests that a universal macroevolutionary tradeoff governs body size evolution for all mammals, regardless of their habitat. The dramatic sizes of cetaceans can thus be attributed mainly to the increased convective heat loss is water, which shifts the species size distribution upward and pushes its right tail into ranges inaccessible to terrestrial mammals.

Studying the stability of dynamic systems is critical, but analyzing the stability of time-delay systems is challenging because DDEs are infinite-dimensional. We propose a new approach to quickly generate stability charts for DDEs using continuation of characteristic roots (CCR). In our CCR method, the roots of the characteristic equation of a DDE are written as implicit functions of the parameters of interest, and the continuation equations are derived in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Numerical continuation is then employed to determine the characteristic roots at all points in a parametric space; the stability of the original DDE can then be easily determined. A key advantage of the proposed method is that a system of linearly independent ODEs is solved rather than the typical strategy of solving a large eigenvalue problem at each grid point in the domain.

Metal contacts to two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are ubiquitous in modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. Such contacts are, however, often plagued by strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect which reduces the tunability of the Schottky barrier height (SBH) and degrades the performance of 2D-semiconductor-based devices.

An exceptionally large SBH slope parameter of S=0.7 is obtained, which outperform the vast majority of other 2D semiconductors. Such surprising behavior arises from the unique morphology of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$. The outlying Si-N layer forms a native atomic layer that protects the semiconducting inner-core from the perturbance of metal contacts, thus suppressing the FLP.

Unfortunately, the availability and understanding of the methods to properly detect in-block nested partitions lie behind the empirical findings: while a precise quality function of in-block nestedness has been proposed, we lack an understanding of its possible inherent constraints.

Metamaterials are artificial composite structures designed for controlling waves or fields, and exhibit interaction phenomena that are unexpected on the basis of their chemical constituents. These phenomena are encoded in effective material parameters that can be electronic, magnetic, acoustic, or elastic, and must adequately represent the wave interaction behaviour in the composite within desired frequency ranges. In some cases -- for example, the low frequency regime -- there exist various efficient ways by which effective material parameters for wave propagation in metamaterials may be found. However, the general problem of predicting frequency-dependent dynamic effective constants has remained unsolved. Here, we obtain novel mathematical expressions for the effective parameters of two-dimensional metamaterial systems valid at higher frequencies and wavelengths than previously possible. By way of an example, random configurations of cylindrical scatterers are considered, in various physical contexts: sound waves in a compressible fluid, anti-plane elastic waves, and electromagnetic waves. Our results point towards a paradigm shift in our understanding of these effective properties, and metamaterial designs with functionalities beyond the low-frequency regime are now open for innovation."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary challenge in predicting the frequency-dependent dynamic effective constants of metamaterial systems, and how do the authors' novel mathematical expressions address this challenge?\n\nA) The primary challenge is the complexity of the wave interaction behavior in the composite, and the authors' expressions provide a simplified model that neglects this complexity.
