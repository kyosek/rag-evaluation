A new generation of experiments on dry macroscopic friction has revealed that the transition from static to dynamic friction is essentially a spatially and temporally non-uniform process, initiated by a rupture-like detachment front. We show the suitability of the Frenkel-Kontorova model for describing this transition. The model predicts the existence of two types of detachment fronts, explaining both the variability and abrupt change of velocity observed in experiments. The quantitative relation obtained between the velocity of the detachment front and the ratio of shear to normal stress is consistent with experiments. The model provides a functional dependence between slip velocity and shear stress, and predicts that slip velocity is independent of normal stress.

In this paper, we focus on reinforcement learning methods that reward an agent for arriving at a target image without any attempt to build up a 3D 'map'. We test the ability of this type of representation to support geometrically consistent spatial tasks such as interpolating between learned locations using decoding of feature vectors.
