We give no-go conditions for magnon spin to be independent of momentum. As examples of the magnon spin-momentum locking, we analyze a one-dimensional antiferromagnet with the N\\'eel order and two-dimensional kagome lattice antiferromagnets with the 120$^\\circ$ structure. We find that the magnon spin depends on its momentum even when the Hamiltonian has the $z$-axis spin rotational symmetry, which can be explained in the context of a singular band point or a $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. A spin vortex in momentum space generated in a kagome lattice antiferromagnet has the winding number $Q=-2$, while the typical one observed in topological insulator surface states is characterized by $Q=+1$. A magnonic analogue of the surface states, the Dirac magnon with $Q=+1$, is found in another kagome lattice antiferromagnet.

Derive the formula for the spin expectation value of a one-magnon state in this system, and explain why the magnon spin-momentum locking is not possible in this case.\n\nA) The spin expectation value of a one-magnon state is given by <S> = \u2211_{i} S_i, where S_i are the spin operators at each site.\n\nB) The spin expectation value of a one-magnon state is given by <S> = \u2211_{i,j} J_{ij} <S_i^+ S_j^->, where <S_i^+ S_j^-> are the expectation values of the spin creation and annihilation operators.\n\nC) The spin expectation value of a one-magnon state is given by <S> = \u2211_{i} K_i <S_i^z>, where <S_i^z> are the expectation values of the spin z-component at each site.\n\nD) The spin expectation value of a one-magnon state is given by <S> = \u2211_{i,j} J_{ij} <S_i^+ S_j^-> + \u2211_{i} K_i <S_i^z>, where <S_i^+ S_j^-> and <S_i^z> are the expectation values of the spin creation and annihilation operators, and the spin z-component at each site, respectively.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The spin expectation value of a one-magnon state is given by <S> = \u2211_{i,j} J_{ij} <S_i^+ S_j^->, where <S_i^+ S_j^-> are the expectation values of the spin creation and annihilation operators.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the spin expectation value of a one-magnon state can be calculated using the two-body spin Hamiltonian. The expectation values of the spin creation and annihilation operators can be obtained by applying the Hamiltonian to the one-magnon state, and then taking the expectation value. This leads to the formula <S> = \u2211_{i,j} J_{ij} <S_i^+ S_j^->, which is a direct consequence of the two-body spin Hamiltonian. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately represent the spin expectation value of a one-magnon state in a noncollinear antiferromagnet. Option A is incorrect because it assumes a simple sum of spin operators, which is not the case in a noncollinear antiferromagnet. Option C is incorrect because it assumes a simple sum of spin z-components, which is not the case in a noncollinear antiferromagnet. Option D is incorrect because it combines the two-body spin Hamiltonian with the external magnetic field, which is not necessary to calculate the spin expectation value of a one-magnon state."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Attractor structures of signaling networks: Consequences of different\n  conformational barcode dynamics and their relations to network-based drug\n  design", "source": "Kristof Z.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a likelihood-free approach for Bayesian inferences based on a rejection algorithm method that applies a tolerance of dissimilarity between summary statistics from observed and simulated data. Although several improvements to the algorithm have been proposed, none of these improvements avoid the following two sources of approximation: 1) lack of sufficient statistics: sampling is not from the true posterior density given data but from an approximate posterior density given summary statistics; and 2) non-zero tolerance: sampling from the posterior density given summary statistics is achieved only in the limit of zero tolerance. The first source of approximation can be improved by adding a summary statistic, but an increase in the number of summary statistics could introduce additional variance caused by the low acceptance rate. Consequently, many researchers have attempted to develop techniques to choose informative summary statistics.

As a result, it is not necessary to know or pretest whether the change point is present, or where it occurs. Our estimator of the change point achieves an oracle property in the sense that its asymptotic distribution is the same as if the unknown active sets of regression coefficients were known. Importantly, we establish this oracle property without a perfect covariate selection, thereby avoiding the need for the minimum level condition on the signals of active covariates. Dealing with high-dimensional quantile regression with an unknown change point calls for a new proof technique since the quantile loss function is non-smooth and furthermore the corresponding objective function is non-convex with respect to the change point.

In this paper, we improve the performance of MPEG-2 encoder and n-body simulation by employing the hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming paradigm on SMP clusters.

Similarly, the work load of the force calculation which accounts for upwards of 90% of the cycles in typical computations in the n-body simulation is shared among OpenMP threads after ORB domain decomposition among MPI processes. Besides, loop scheduling of OpenMP threads is adopted with appropriate chunk size to provide better load balance of work, leading to enhanced performance.
