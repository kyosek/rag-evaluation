This paper studies the fish growth trajectory tracking via reinforcement learning under a representative bioenergetic growth model. Due to the complex aquaculture condition and uncertain environmental factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, un-ionized ammonia, and strong nonlinear couplings, including multi-inputs of the fish growth model, the growth trajectory tracking problem can not be efficiently solved by the model-based control approaches in precision aquaculture. To this purpose, we formulate the growth trajectory tracking problem as sampled-data optimal control using discrete state-action pairs Markov decision process. We propose two Q-learning algorithms that learn the optimal control policy from the sampled data of the fish growth trajectories at every stage of the fish life cycle from juveniles to the desired market weight in the aquaculture environment. The Q-learning scheme learns the optimal feeding control policy to fish growth rate cultured in cages and the optimal feeding rate control policy with an optimal temperature profile for the aquaculture fish growth rate in tanks. The simulation results demonstrate that both Q-learning strategies achieve high trajectory tracking performance with less amount feeding rates."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of fish growth trajectory tracking via reinforcement learning, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the Q-learning algorithms proposed in the study?\n\nA) The Q-learning algorithms are designed to work exclusively with model-based control approaches in precision aquaculture.\n\nB) Two Q-learning algorithms are proposed: one for optimal feeding control policy in cages, and another for optimal feeding rate control policy with temperature profile in tanks.\n\nC) The Q-learning algorithms require continuous state-action pairs for the Markov decision process to function effectively.\n\nD) The proposed algorithms are primarily focused on maximizing feeding rates to achieve the desired market weight of fish.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

On the other hand, such correlation detection methods may be affected by the probability distribution function of the series. In this article, we apply the horizontal visibility graph algorithm to map stochastic time series into networks. By investigating the magnitude and sign of a multifractal time series, we show that one can detect linear as well as nonlinear correlations, even for situations that have been considered as uncorrelated noises by typical approaches like MFDFA.

In the past decade, researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group.

In the derivation of the low energy theorem for VCS that exists in the literature, the low energy limit taken for virtual initial photons does not match on that for real photons, when one approaches the initial photon's mass shell. While this problem has for a long time been attributed to the non-analyticity of the Compton amplitude with respect to the photon virtuality, I demonstrate that it is merely due to an ill-defined low energy limit for VCS, on one hand, and to a particular way of constructing the VCS amplitude, use in the literature, on the other.

The paper introduces a new sampling paradigm for multivariate functions, specifically related to polysplines.
