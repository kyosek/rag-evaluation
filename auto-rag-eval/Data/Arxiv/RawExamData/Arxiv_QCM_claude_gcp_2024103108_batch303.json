At the initial stage, the unstable gas quickly segregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM). Then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of $0.1-0.2\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}}$ is observed in which the CNM moves around in the WNM. We find that the interfacial medium (IFM) between the CNM and WNM plays an important role in sustaining the turbulence. The self-sustaining mechanism can be divided into two steps. First, thermal conduction drives fast flows streaming into concave CNM surfaces towards the WNM. The kinetic energy of the fast flows in the IFM is incorporated into that of the CNM through the phase transition. Second, turbulence inside the CNM deforms interfaces and forms other concave CNM surfaces, leading to fast flows in the IFM. This drives the first step again and a cycle is established by which turbulent motions are self-sustained."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the study of self-sustained turbulence in a bistable interstellar medium, which of the following best describes the two-step mechanism that maintains the turbulent motion?\n\nA) 1. Thermal conduction creates fast flows from convex CNM surfaces to the WNM.\n   2. Turbulence in the WNM deforms interfaces, creating new convex CNM surfaces.\n\nB) 1. Thermal conduction drives fast flows from concave CNM surfaces towards the WNM.\n   2. Turbulence inside the CNM deforms interfaces, forming other concave CNM surfaces.\n\nC) 1. Physical viscosity generates fast flows from the WNM to the CNM.\n   2. Interfacial medium turbulence creates new CNM regions through phase transition.\n\nD) 1. Periodic boundary conditions induce flows from the CNM to the WNM.\n   2. External dynamical forcing deforms the interfaces between CNM and WNM.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation describes a two-step self-sustaining mechanism for turbulence in the bistable interstellar medium. In the first step, thermal conduction drives fast flows from concave CNM (Cold Neutral Medium) surfaces towards the WNM (Warm Neutral Medium). In the second step, turbulence inside the CNM deforms interfaces and forms other concave CNM surfaces. This cycle maintains the turbulent motion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions convex surfaces instead of concave, and incorrectly states that turbulence in the WNM deforms interfaces.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it introduces physical viscosity as the cause of fast flows and misrepresents the role of the interfacial medium.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it wrongly introduces periodic boundary conditions as the cause of flows and mentions external dynamical forcing, which the documentation explicitly states is not present in this study."}}
