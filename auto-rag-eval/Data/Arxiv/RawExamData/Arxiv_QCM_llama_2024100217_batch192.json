Modelling financial time series as a time change of a simpler process has been proposed in various forms over the years. One of such recent approaches is called volatility homogenisation decomposition, and has been designed specifically to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets. The authors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a specific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this procedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time series. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the forecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them non-exhaustive. Second, the results obtained were not completely convincing, with some values falling under 50% guessing rate. Additionally, only nine Australian stocks were being investigated, which further limits the scope of this proof. In this study we propose to find the usefulness of volatility homogenisation by calculating the predictability of the decomposed time series and comparing it to the predictability of the original time series. We are applying information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify predictability, which guarantees the result is not tied to a specific method of prediction, and additionally we base our calculations on a large number of stocks from the Warsaw Stock Exchange."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The authors of the paper \"Predictability of Volatility Homogenised Financial Time Series\" propose a method to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets by decomposing time series into simpler processes. However, the results of their study have limitations. What are two potential issues with the authors' approach, and how do the proposed solution in the new study address these limitations?\n\n**A)** The authors' approach is limited by the choice of forecasting procedure, which can lead to biased results, and the small sample size of only nine Australian stocks. The proposed solution addresses these limitations by using an information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify predictability and analyzing a large number of stocks from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\n\n**B)** The authors' approach is limited by the assumption that the decomposed time series are independent, and the results are not generalizable to other financial markets. The proposed solution addresses these limitations by using a large sample size and an information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify predictability.\n\n**C)** The authors' approach is limited by the fact that the decomposed time series are not stationary, and the results are sensitive to the choice of time scale. The proposed solution addresses these limitations by using a large sample size and an information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify predictability.\n\n**D)** The authors' approach is limited by the fact that the decomposed time series are not normally distributed, and the results are not robust to outliers.

The grid covers the mass range from 0.52 to 1.0 Msun, and it is appropriate for the study of white dwarfs in metal-rich clusters. The evolutionary calculations are based on a detailed and self-consistent treatment of the energy released from these two processes, as well as on the employment of realistic carbon/oxygen profiles, of relevance for an accurate evaluation of the energy released by carbon/oxygen phase separation.

The major advantage of the proposed embedding procedure is that it incorporates both the pairwise relationships and subgroup-wise structure among nodes to capture richer network information.
