Inpainting high-resolution images with large holes challenges existing deep learning based image inpainting methods. We present a novel framework -- PyramidFill for high-resolution image inpainting task, which explicitly disentangles content completion and texture synthesis. PyramidFill attempts to complete the content of unknown regions in a lower-resolution image, and synthesis the textures of unknown regions in a higher-resolution image, progressively. Thus, our model consists of a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, wherein the content GAN is responsible for completing contents in the lowest-resolution masked image, and each texture GAN is responsible for synthesizing textures in a higher-resolution image. Since completing contents and synthesising textures demand different abilities from generators, we customize different architectures for the content GAN and texture GAN. Experiments on multiple datasets including CelebA-HQ, Places2 and a new natural scenery dataset (NSHQ) with different resolutions demonstrate that PyramidFill generates higher-quality inpainting results than the state-of-the-art methods.

The PyramidFill framework consists of two main components: Content GAN and Texture GAN.

This approach explicitly disentangles content completion and texture synthesis, allowing the model to handle high-resolution images with large holes more effectively.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions a Style GAN, which is not part of the PyramidFill framework.

Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-field results, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findings tend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player tracking data, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skill and strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditional analyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-down strategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed.

Furthermore, we study the pair-of-pants product in local Floer homology, and characterize a particular class of isolated fixed points (the symplectically degenerate maxima), which plays an important role in the proof of the Conley conjecture.

Many modern cosmological scenarios feature large volumes of spacetime in a de Sitter vacuum phase.

We argue that this worry can be straightforwardly avoided in the Many-Worlds (Everett) approach to quantum mechanics, as long as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional. In that case, de Sitter settles into a truly stationary quantum vacuum state.

Inverter based renewable generation (RG), especially at the distribution level, is supposed to trip offline during an islanding situation.

Current practice is to use the same limit throughout the year independent of the operating conditions. This could result in the tripping of RG at times when the system is already weak, thereby posing a threat to voltage security by heavily limiting the load margin (LM). Conversely, heavily relaxing these limits would result in scenarios where the generation does not go offline even during an islanding situation.
