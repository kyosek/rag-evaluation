Despite the numerous developments in object tracking, further development of current tracking algorithms is limited by small and mostly saturated datasets. As a matter of fact, data-hungry trackers based on deep-learning currently rely on object detection datasets due to the scarcity of dedicated large-scale tracking datasets. In this work, we present TrackingNet, the first large-scale dataset and benchmark for object tracking in the wild. We provide more than 30K videos with more than 14 million dense bounding box annotations. Our dataset covers a wide selection of object classes in broad and diverse context. By releasing such a large-scale dataset, we expect deep trackers to further improve and generalize. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark composed of 500 novel videos, modeled with a distribution similar to our training dataset. By sequestering the annotation of the test set and providing an online evaluation server, we provide a fair benchmark for future development of object trackers. Deep trackers fine-tuned on a fraction of our dataset improve their performance by up to 1.6% on OTB100 and up to 1.7% on TrackingNet Test.

When pre-processing observational data via matching, we seek to approximate each unit with maximally similar peers that had an alternative treatment status--essentially replicating a randomized block design. However, as one considers a growing number of continuous features, a curse of dimensionality applies making asymptotically valid inference impossible (Abadie and Imbens, 2006). The alternative of ignoring plausibly relevant features is certainly no better, and the resulting trade-off substantially limits the application of matching methods to \"wide\" datasets. Instead, Li and Fu (2017) recasts the problem of matching in a metric learning framework that maps features to a low-dimensional space that facilitates \"closer matches\" while still capturing important aspects of unit-level heterogeneity. However, that method lacks key theoretical guarantees and can produce inconsistent estimates in cases of heterogeneous treatment effects. Motivated by straightforward extension of existing results in the matching literature, we present alternative techniques that learn latent matching features through either MLPs or through siamese neural networks trained on a carefully selected loss function.

We obtain useful relations between the dissipative parameter of WI and the bounce scale parameter of LQC. We also find that the number of required e-folds of expansion from the bounce instant till the moment the observable scales crossed the Hubble radius during inflation can be smaller in WI than in CI. In particular, we find that this depends on how large is the dissipation in WI, with the amount of required e-folds decreasing with the increasing of the dissipation value.

This failure largely results as prokaryote regulatory gene networks are \"accelerating\" and have total link numbers growing faster than linearly with network size and so can exhibit transitions from stationary to nonstationary statistics and from random to scale-free to regular statistics at particular critical network sizes.

In this work, we uncover an intriguing connection between the entropy of entanglement of individual neutrinos with the rest of the ensemble, and the occurrence of spectral splits in the energy spectra of these neutrinos, which develop as a result of collective neutrino oscillations. In particular, for various types of neutrino spectra, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy is highest for the neutrinos whose locations in the energy spectrum are closest to the spectral split(s).

As a result of the analysis, in addition to economic factor variables, variables of climatic, amenity, and human factors correlated with the inflow rate, and it was shown that the model has the greatest explanatory power when multiple factors were used in addition to specific factors.

In biomedical studies it is of substantial interest to develop risk prediction scores using high-dimensional data such as gene expression data for clinical endpoints that are subject to censoring. In the presence of well-established clinical risk factors, investigators often prefer a procedure that also adjusts for these clinical variables. While accelerated failure time (AFT) models are a useful tool for the analysis of censored outcome data, it assumes that covariate effects on the logarithm of time-to-event are linear, which is often unrealistic in practice. We propose to build risk prediction scores through regularized rank estimation in partly linear AFT models, where high-dimensional data such as gene expression data are modeled linearly and important clinical variables are modeled nonlinearly using penalized regression splines.

Either cosmology enters local dynamics by affecting the vacuum, and inertia in turn, through a0; or, the same vacuum effect enters both MOND (through a0) and cosmology (e.g. through a cosmological constant). For the vacuum to serve as substratum for inertia a body must be able to read in it its non-inertial motion; this indeed it can, by detecting Unruh-type radiation.
