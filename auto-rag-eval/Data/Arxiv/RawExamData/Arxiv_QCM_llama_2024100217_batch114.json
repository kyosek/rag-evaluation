We consider a basic model of multi-period trading, which can be used to evaluate the performance of a trading strategy. We describe a framework for single-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by solving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk, transaction cost and holding cost such as the borrowing cost for shorting assets. We then describe a multi-period version of the trading method, where optimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one executed, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades are chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period methods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe the single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a clear description of the development and the approximations made. In this paper we do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm, the predictions or forecasts of future quantities.

The correct answer requires that the form $\\omega$ be non-degenerate, closed, and exact, and that its restriction to each tangent space be a positive definite inner product.

A contact structure is also a non-degenerate, closed, and exact form of degree 2, and its restriction to each tangent space is a positive definite inner product. An involutive distribution is a subbundle of the tangent bundle that is involutive, meaning that the Lie bracket of any two vector fields in the subbundle is zero. A locally conformal symplectic structure is a symplectic form that is locally conformal to a symplectic form of a certain type. The Hodge star of a form is a way of decomposing the form into its harmonic and co-harmonic parts.

The optimal content moderation strategy differs for platforms with different revenue models, advertising or subscription. We also show that a platform's content moderation strategy depends on its technical sophistication. Because of imperfect technology, a platform may optimally throw away the moderate content more than the extreme content. Therefore, one cannot judge how extreme a platform is by just looking at its content moderation strategy. Furthermore, we show that a platform under advertising does not necessarily benefit from a better technology for content moderation, but one under subscription does.

The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom by atom - with complete control over all degrees of freedom. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here, we present a \"quantum gas microscope\" that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system where atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom of each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement.

The purpose of this paper is to specify a general methodological framework that is flexible enough to cover a wide range of possibilities to design systemic risk measures via multi-dimensional acceptance sets and aggregation functions, and to study corresponding examples. Existing systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal capital needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In contrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be interpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual risks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of systemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations.

Optimal sensor placement (SP) usually minimizes an impact measure, such as the amount of contaminated water or the number of inhabitants affected before detection. The common choice is to minimize the minimum detection time (MDT) averaged over a set of contamination events, with contaminant injected at a different location. Given a SP, propagation is simulated through a hydraulic software model of the network to obtain spatio-temporal concentrations and the average MDT. Searching for an optimal SP is NP-hard: even for mid-size networks, efficient search methods are required, among which evolutionary approaches are often used. A bi-objective formalization is proposed: minimizing the average MDT and its standard deviation, that is the risk to detect some contamination event too late than the average MDT. We propose a data structure (sort of spatio-temporal heatmap) collecting simulation outcomes for every SP and particularly suitable for evolutionary optimization. Indeed, the proposed data structure enabled a convergence analysis of a population-based algorithm, leading to the identification of indicators for detecting problem-specific converge issues which could be generalized to other similar problems.
