The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a paradigmatic stochastic model for non-equilibrium physics, and has been successfully applied to describe active transport of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments. Building on this simple model, we consider a two-lane lattice-gas model that couples directed transport (TASEP) to diffusive motion in a semi-closed geometry, and simultaneously accounts for spontaneous growth and particle-induced shrinkage of the system's size. This particular extension of the TASEP is motivated by the question of how active transport and diffusion might influence length regulation in confined systems. Surprisingly, we find that the size of our intrinsically stochastic system exhibits robust temporal patterns over a broad range of growth rates. More specifically, when particle diffusion is slow relative to the shrinkage dynamics, we observe quasi-periodic changes in length. We provide an intuitive explanation for the occurrence of these self-organized temporal patterns, which is based on the imbalance between the diffusion and shrinkage speed in the confined geometry. Finally, we formulate an effective theory for the oscillatory regime, which explains the origin of the oscillations and correctly predicts the dependence of key quantities, as for instance the oscillation frequency, on the growth rate."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the extended TASEP model, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a novel experiment studying cellular length regulation, researchers observe quasi-periodic changes in the length of a confined system containing molecular motors.

The correct answer, D, is based on the key finding described in the documentation: \"when particle diffusion is slow relative to the shrinkage dynamics, we observe quasi-periodic changes in length.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the oscillations are not due to a perfect balance, but rather an imbalance between diffusion and shrinkage speeds.

Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is a GPCR that is activated by neurotensin, i.e. a 13 amino acid peptide. Binding of neurotensin induces conformational changes in the receptor that trigger the intracellular signaling processes. While recent single-molecule studies have reported a dynamic monomer - dimer equilibrium of NTSR1 in vitro, a biophysical characterization of the oligomerization status of NTSR1 in living mammalian cells is complicated. Here we report on the oligomerization state of the human NTSR1 tagged with mRuby3 by dissolving the plasma membranes of living HEK293T cells into 10 nm-sized soluble lipid nanoparticles by addition of styrene-maleic acid copolymers (SMALPs).

Specifically, we used spectrogram to represent the fine-grained time-frequency characteristics of LoRa signals. In addition, we revealed that the instantaneous carrier frequency offset (CFO) is drifting, which will result in misclassification and significantly compromise the system stability; we demonstrated CFO compensation is an effective mitigation. Finally, we designed a hybrid classifier that can adjust CNN outputs with the estimated CFO. The mean value of CFO remains relatively stable, hence it can be used to rule out CNN predictions whose estimated CFO falls out of the range. We performed experiments in real wireless environments using 20 LoRa devices under test (DUTs) and a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 receiver. By comparing with the IQ-based and FFT-based RFFI schemes, our spectrogram-based scheme can reach the best classification accuracy, i.e., 97.61% for 20 LoRa DUTs."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a LoRa-based IoT network for a smart city project.

Preventing such large-scale outages is thus key for assuring a reliable power supply.

The study of real-time algorithms addresses several major concerns, which are namely: accuracy, memory consumption, and ability to stretch assumptions and time complexity. Attaining a fast computational model providing fuzzy logic and supervised learning is one of the main challenges in the machine learning. In this research paper, we present FSL-BM algorithm as an efficient solution of supervised learning with fuzzy logic processing using binary meta-feature representation using Hamming Distance and Hash function to relax assumptions. While many studies focused on reducing time complexity and increasing accuracy during the last decade, the novel contribution of this proposed solution comes through integration of Hamming Distance, Hash function, binary meta-features, binary classification to provide real time supervised method. Hash Tables (HT) component gives a fast access to existing indices; and therefore, the generation of new indices in a constant time complexity, which supersedes existing fuzzy supervised algorithms with better or comparable results.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that when solar neutrino flux moves through the solar flare region in the preflare period, it undergoes additional resonance conversions compared to the Standard Model (SM) if there are nonzero dipole magnetic and anapole moments.

The documentation mentions that measuring relative yields of charmed hadrons can provide information on the hadronization mechanism. An unexpected pattern in the D\u207a/D\u2070 ratio would indeed offer such insights.\n\n2. Coalescence hadronization is a process where quarks combine to form hadrons in a dense medium like the QGP. An increase in the D\u207a/D\u2070 ratio at low pT could indicate that this process is enhanced in the QGP, as low-pT charm quarks have more time to interact with the medium.\n\n3.

We have used fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure, stability and elasticity of these structures. Several nanosecond long MD simulations give the microscopic details about DNA nanotubes. Based on the structural analysis of simulation data, we show that 6-helix nanotubes are stable and maintain their tubular structure; while 8-helix nanotubes are flattened to stabilize themselves.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. Stability: The documentation states that \"6-helix nanotubes are stable and maintain their tubular structure,\" while \"8-helix nanotubes are flattened to stabilize themselves.\" For a nanorobot, maintaining a stable tubular structure is crucial.\n\n2. Rigidity: The question asks for optimization of rigidity. The documentation mentions that DNA nanotubes are \"approximately four times more rigid having stretch modulus of ~4000 pN compared to the stretch modulus of 1000 pN of DNA double helix molecule.\" This high rigidity is desirable for the application.\n\n3. Small diameter: A 6-helix structure would have a smaller diameter than an 8-helix or tri-tube structure, which is preferable for a nanorobot designed for drug delivery.\n\n4. Sequence optimization: The documentation comments on \"sequence dependence,\" suggesting that optimized sequences can improve the nanotube's properties.\n\n5. Overhangs: While the effect of overhangs is mentioned, there's no indication that they improve stability or rigidity. For a small diameter and optimal properties, avoiding overhangs is likely beneficial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 8-helix nanotubes flatten, which would be undesirable for a nanorobot. Option B includes long overhangs, which may increase diameter unnecessarily. Option C introduces complexity with a tri-tube structure and variable sequences, which may not be optimal for stability and rigidity.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario (nanorobot design for drug delivery), and critically evaluate the trade-offs between different design options."}, "94": {"documentation": {"title": "The Random Walk of High Frequency Trading", "source": "Eric M.

This paper builds a model of high-frequency equity returns by separately modeling the dynamics of trade-time returns and trade arrivals. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the distributional behavior of high-frequency asset returns both in ordinary clock time and in trade time. We show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time returns of the highly liquid near-month E-mini S&P 500 futures contract are well characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second, we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns by subordinating a trade-time Gaussian distribution with a trade arrival process that is associated with a modified Markov-Switching Multifractal Duration (MSMD) model. This model provides an excellent characterization of high-frequency inter-trade durations. Over-dispersion in this distribution of inter-trade durations leads to leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in clock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we use our model to extrapolate the empirical relationship between trade rate and volatility in an effort to understand conditions of market failure.
