This paper provides a user's guide to the general theory of approximate randomization tests developed in Canay, Romano, and Shaikh (2017) when specialized to linear regressions with clustered data. An important feature of the methodology is that it applies to settings in which the number of clusters is small -- even as small as five. We provide a step-by-step algorithmic description of how to implement the test and construct confidence intervals for the parameter of interest. In doing so, we additionally present three novel results concerning the methodology: we show that the method admits an equivalent implementation based on weighted scores; we show the test and confidence intervals are invariant to whether the test statistic is studentized or not; and we prove convexity of the confidence intervals for scalar parameters. We also articulate the main requirements underlying the test, emphasizing in particular common pitfalls that researchers may encounter.

The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance between positive effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and autonomy) and its downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work life). Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of workers, such as women. The first step in understanding the implications of teleworking on women is to have timely information on the extent of teleworking by age and gender. In the absence of timely official statistics, in this paper we propose a method for nowcasting the teleworking trends by age and gender for 20 Italian regions using mobile network operators (MNO) data. The method is developed and validated using MNO data together with the Italian quarterly Labour Force Survey. Our results confirm that the MNO data have the potential to be used as a tool for monitoring gender and age differences in teleworking patterns. This tool becomes even more important today as it could support the adequate gender mainstreaming in the ``Next Generation EU'' recovery plan and help to manage related social impacts of COVID-19 through policymaking."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose and methodology of the study mentioned in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) To analyze the economic impact of COVID-19 on different age groups using official labor statistics\nB) To develop a predictive model for future pandemics using mobile network data\nC) To nowcast teleworking trends by age and gender across Italian regions using mobile network operators (MNO) data and Labour Force Survey\nD) To evaluate the effectiveness of the \"Next Generation EU\" recovery plan in addressing gender disparities\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) have been the two dominant imaging modalities deployed for improved management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to faster imaging, less radiation exposure, and being cost-effective CXR is preferred over CT. However, the interpretation of CXR images, compared to CT, is more challenging due to low image resolution and COVID-19 image features being similar to regular pneumonia. Computer-aided diagnosis via deep learning has been investigated to help mitigate these problems and help clinicians during the decision-making process.

In this work, we elucidate the role of chemical composition on the relaxation time of hot-carriers for the archetypal Aux Ag1-x thin-film system.
