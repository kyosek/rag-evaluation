Existing generative models mostly use a string- or graph-based representation, but the precise three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms are usually not encoded. First attempts in this direction have been proposed, where autoregressive or GAN-based models generate atom coordinates. Those either lack a latent space in the autoregressive setting, such that a smooth exploration of the compound space is not possible, or cannot generalize to varying chemical compositions. We propose a new approach to efficiently generate molecular structures that are not restricted to a fixed size or composition. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder which learns a translation-, rotation-, and permutation-invariant low-dimensional representation of molecules. Our experiments yield a mean reconstruction error below 0.05 Angstrom, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods by a factor of four, and which is even lower than the spatial quantization error of most chemical descriptors.

Recent molecular dynamics simulations (Herce and Garcia, PNAS, 104: 20805 (2007)) have suggested that the arginine-rich HIV Tat peptides might be able to translocate by destabilizing and inducing transient pores in phospholipid bilayers. In this pathway for peptide translocation, arginine residues play a fundamental role not only in the binding of the peptide to the surface of the membrane but also in the destabilization and nucleation of transient pores across the bilayer, despite being charged and highly hydrophilic.

We test this hypothesis experimentally by measuring ionic currents across phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes through the pores induced by Arg-9 peptides. We find that Arg-9 peptides, in the presence of an electrostatic potential gradient, induce ionic currents across planar phospholipid bilayers, as well as in cultured osteosarcoma cells and human smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from the umbilical artery.

METHODS: Using 678 subjects (2750 timepoints), differences in ventricular features were assessed between bvFTD, normal controls and other dementia cohorts. RESULTS: Ventricular antero-posterior ratio (APR) was the only feature that was significantly different and increased faster in bvFTD compared to all other cohorts. We achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 80% (77% sensitivity, 82% specificity) in differentiating bvFTD from all other cohorts with ventricular features, and 76% accuracy using only the single APR feature.

It is highly important for governments and health organizations to monitor the prevalence of breast cancer as a leading source of cancer-related death among women. However, the accurate diagnosis of this disease is expensive, especially in developing countries. This article concerns a cost-efficient method for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a comprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is utilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs some visually assessed cytological covariates, which are pertinent to determination of breast cancer, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are explored. Evidence from numerical studies is reported. The developed procedure can be substantially more efficient than its competitor in simple random sampling (SRS).

Which of the following statements best describes a key advantage of SGLASSO over GLASSO?\n\nA) SGLASSO uses the L1,1 norm instead of the L1,2 norm for regularization.\nB) SGLASSO prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of low-degree nodes in the network.\nC) SGLASSO controls for the structure of sparsity in the precision matrix \u03a9, not just the number of zeros.\nD) SGLASSO is less computationally intensive than GLASSO for large network sizes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key advantage of SGLASSO over GLASSO is that it uses the L1,2 mixed norm penalty instead of the L1,1 norm. This allows SGLASSO to control for the structure of sparsity in the precision matrix \u03a9, not just the number of zeros. The document states that \"The use of the L1,2 penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in \u03a9.\" This is in contrast to GLASSO, which only controls for the overall sparsity (number of zeros) using the L1,1 norm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SGLASSO uses the L1,2 norm, not the L1,1 norm. Option B is incorrect because the document suggests that SGLASSO prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes, not low-degree nodes.
