These applications often involve spacetimes with $D>4$ dimensions where the calculation of gravitational waves is more involved than in the four dimensional case, but has now become possible thanks to substantial progress in the theoretical study of general relativity in $D>4$. Here, we develop a numerical implementation of the formalism by Godazgar and Reall (Ref.[1]) -- based on projections of the Weyl tensor analogous to the Newman-Penrose scalars -- that allows for the calculation of gravitational waves in higher dimensional spacetimes with rotational symmetry.

Such convention has two limitations: (1) The regularization strength of a specific image pair should be associated with the content of the images, thus the ``one value fits all'' scheme is not ideal; (2) Only spatially regularizing the transformation (but overlooking the temporal consistency of different estimations) may not be the best strategy to cope with the ill-posedness.

Community detection is a well established method for studying the meso scale structure of social networks. Applying a community detection algorithm results in a division of a network into communities that is often used to inspect and reason about community membership of specific nodes. This micro level interpretation step of community structure is a crucial step in typical social science research. However, the methodological caveat in this step is that virtually all modern community detection methods are non-deterministic and based on randomization and approximated results. This needs to be explicitly taken into consideration when reasoning about community membership of individual nodes. To do so, we propose a metric of community membership consistency, that provides node-level insights in how reliable the placement of that node into a community really is. In addition, it enables us to distinguish the community core members of a community. The usefulness of the proposed metrics is demonstrated on corporate board interlock networks, in which weighted links represent shared senior level directors between firms.

Deep candidate generation (DCG) that narrows down the collection of relevant items from billions to hundreds via representation learning has become prevalent in industrial recommender systems. Standard approaches approximate maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) through sampling for better scalability and address the problem of DCG in a way similar to language modeling. However, live recommender systems face severe exposure bias and have a vocabulary several orders of magnitude larger than that of natural language, implying that MLE will preserve and even exacerbate the exposure bias in the long run in order to faithfully fit the observed samples.
