Since the introduction of zero-determinant strategies, extortionate strategies have received considerable interest. While an interesting class of strategies, the definitions of extortionate strategies are algebraically rigid, apply only to memory-one strategies, and require complete knowledge of a strategy (memory-one cooperation probabilities). We describe a method to detect extortionate behaviour from the history of play of a strategy. When applied to a corpus of 204 strategies this method detects extortionate behaviour in well-known extortionate strategies as well others that do not fit the algebraic definition. The highest performing strategies in this corpus are able to exhibit selectively extortionate behavior, cooperating with strong strategies while exploiting weaker strategies, which no memory-one strategy can do. These strategies emerged from an evolutionary selection process and their existence contradicts widely-repeated folklore in the evolutionary game theory literature: complex strategies can be extraordinarily effective, zero-determinant strategies can be outperformed by non-zero determinant strategies, and longer memory strategies are able to outperform short memory strategies. Moreover, while resistance to extortion is critical for the evolution of cooperation, the extortion of weak opponents need not prevent cooperation between stronger opponents, and this adaptability may be crucial to maintaining cooperation in the long run."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the limitations of traditional definitions of extortionate strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and how the new method addresses these limitations?\n\nA) Traditional definitions are too broad and apply to all strategy types, while the new method narrows the focus to only memory-one strategies.\n\nB) Traditional definitions require incomplete strategy knowledge, while the new method demands full information about a strategy's cooperation probabilities.\n\nC) Traditional definitions are algebraically flexible and apply to all strategy types, while the new method is more rigid and only applies to memory-one strategies.\n\nD) Traditional definitions are algebraically rigid, apply only to memory-one strategies, and require complete strategy knowledge, while the new method can detect extortionate behavior from the history of play for various strategy types.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the limitations of traditional extortionate strategy definitions and how the new method addresses these issues.

The rotational dynamics and shape evolution of fibers in shear depends upon the slenderness of the fiber and the non-dimensional \"elasto-viscous\" number that measures the ratio of the fluid's viscous forces to the fiber's elastic forces. For a small elasto-viscous number, the nearly-rigid fiber rotates in the shear, but when the elasto-viscous number reaches a threshhold, buckling occurs.

Solving long-tail large vocabulary object detection with deep learning based models is a challenging and demanding task, which is however under-explored.In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis on the underperformance of state-of-the-art models in front of long-tail distribution. We find existing detection methods are unable to model few-shot classes when the dataset is extremely skewed, which can result in classifier imbalance in terms of parameter magnitude.

It is well known that highly volatile control laws, while theoretically optimal for certain systems, are undesirable from an engineering perspective, being generally deleterious to the controlled system. In this article we are concerned with the temporal volatility of the control process of the regulator in discrete time Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQRs). Our investigation in this paper unearths a surprising connection between the cost functional which an LQR is tasked with minimizing and the temporal variations of its control laws. We first show that optimally controlling the system always implies high levels of control volatility, i.e., it is impossible to reduce volatility in the optimal control process without sacrificing cost. We also show that, akin to communication systems, every LQR has a $Capacity~Region$ associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of control volatility.

The paper establishes a fundamental connection between control volatility and system cost in LQRs. It states that \"optimally controlling the system always implies high levels of control volatility\" and that \"it is impossible to reduce volatility in the optimal control process without sacrificing cost.\" The concept of a \"Capacity Region\" is introduced, which \"dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of control volatility.\" This directly implies a trade-off between volatility and cost, where reducing one necessarily increases the other.
