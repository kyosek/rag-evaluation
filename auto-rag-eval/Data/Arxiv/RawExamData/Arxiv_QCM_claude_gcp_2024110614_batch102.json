We describe a new method which focuses only on the local region surrounding an infalling dwarf in an effort to understand how the hot baryonic halo will alter the chemodynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies. Using this method we examine how a dwarf, similar to Sextans dwarf spheroidal, evolves in the corona of a Milky Way like galaxy.

Big data has become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems.

Modeling the distribution of high dimensional data by a latent tree graphical model is a prevalent approach in multiple scientific domains.

Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which limits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common approach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two steps. First, recover the structure separately of multiple, possibly random subsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a full tree. Here, we develop Spectral Top-Down Recovery (STDR), a deterministic divide-and-conquer approach to infer large latent tree models. Unlike previous methods, STDR partitions the terminal nodes in a non random way, based on the Fiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed nodes. We prove that under certain conditions, this partitioning is consistent with the tree structure. This, in turn, leads to a significantly simpler merging procedure of the small subtrees.

Methods 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as being within normal limits.

Under phaser pumping modulation near these resonances, an unusual kind of self-organized motions in the ruby spin-phonon system was observed by me in 1984 for the first time. The original technique of optical-wavelength microwave-frequency acoustic stimulated emission (SE) detection and microwave-frequency power spectra (MFPS) analysis was used in these experiments (description of the technique see: D.N.Makovetskii, Cand.
