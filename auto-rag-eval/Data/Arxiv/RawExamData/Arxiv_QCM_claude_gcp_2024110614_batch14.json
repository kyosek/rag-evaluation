To solve the issue of video dehazing, there are two main tasks to attain: how to align adjacent frames to the reference frame; how to restore the reference frame. Some papers adopt explicit approaches (e.g., the Markov random field, optical flow, deformable convolution, 3D convolution) to align neighboring frames with the reference frame in feature space or image space, they then use various restoration methods to achieve the final dehazing results. In this paper, we propose a progressive alignment and restoration method for video dehazing. The alignment process aligns consecutive neighboring frames stage by stage without using the optical flow estimation. The restoration process is not only implemented under the alignment process but also uses a refinement network to improve the dehazing performance of the whole network. The proposed networks include four fusion networks and one refinement network. To decrease the parameters of networks, three fusion networks in the first fusion stage share the same parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed video dehazing method achieves outstanding performance against the-state-of-art methods."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Progressive Deep Video Dehazing without Explicit Alignment Estimation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a new video dehazing algorithm and wants to improve upon existing methods.

The purpose of this article is to propose a new \"theory,\" the Strategic Analysis of Financial Markets (SAFM) theory, that explains the operation of financial markets using the analytical perspective of an enlightened gambler. The gambler understands that all opportunities for superior performance arise from suboptimal decisions by humans, but understands also that knowledge of human decision making alone is not enough to understand market behavior --- one must still model how those decisions lead to market prices. Thus are there three parts to the model: gambling theory, human decision making, and strategic problem solving. A new theory is necessary because at this writing in 2017, there is no theory of financial markets acceptable to both practitioners and theorists. Theorists' efficient market theory, for example, cannot explain bubbles and crashes nor the exceptional returns of famous investors and speculators such as Warren Buffett and George Soros.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The model uses brachial blood pressure measurements as one of its inputs. In patients with severe peripheral arterial disease, there can be significant differences between central and peripheral blood pressures due to arterial stiffness and wave reflections. This could lead to inaccurate input data for the model.\n\n2. The model relies on a closed-loop multiscale (0D and 1D) representation of the cardiovascular system. Severe peripheral arterial disease alters the normal hemodynamics in ways that may not be accurately captured by the model's assumptions.\n\n3.

Existing methods for single network learning cannot solve this problem due to the domain shift across networks. Some multi-network learning methods heavily rely on the existence of cross-network connections, thus are inapplicable for this problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel network transfer learning framework AdaGCN by leveraging the techniques of adversarial domain adaptation and graph convolution.

The bifurcating nature of the process means that daughters of type 0 and type 1 can have different conditional distributions, even if the overall distribution stabilizes.\n\nOption D is incorrect and represents a common misunderstanding.

Inspired by the recent measurements of the CMS collaboration, we report a QCD study of dijet production in proton+lead collisions at the LHC involving large-transverse-momentum jets, $p_T \\gtrsim 100$ GeV. Examining the inherent uncertainties of the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and their sensitivity to the free proton parton distributions (PDFs), we observe a rather small, typically much less than 5% clearance for the shape of the dijet rapidity distribution within approximately 1.5 units around the midrapidity. Even a more stable observable is the ratio between the yields in the positive and negative dijet rapidity, for which the baseline uncertainty can be made negligible by imposing a symmetric jet rapidity acceptance. Both observables prove sensitive to the nuclear modifications of the gluon distributions, the corresponding uncertainties clearly exceeding the estimated baseline uncertainties from the free-proton PDFs and scale dependence.

Restarting a deterministic process always impedes its completion. However, it is known that restarting a random process can also lead to an opposite outcome -- expediting completion.

To quantify this heterogeneity we bring a novel approach to restart: the methodology of inequality indices, which is widely applied in economics and in the social sciences to measure income and wealth disparity. Using this approach we establish an `inequality roadmap' for the mean-performance of sharp restart: a whole new set of universal inequality criteria that determine when restart with sharp timers (i.e. with fixed deterministic timers) decreases/increases mean completion. The criteria are based on a host of inequality indices including Bonferroni, Gini, Pietra, and other Lorenz-curve indices; each index captures a different angle of the restart-inequality interplay.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the mechanism described in the documentation. \n\nThe suppression factor for dark matter density after the phase transition is given by exp(-M_\u03c7/2\u03b3\u0303T), where M_\u03c7 is the dark matter mass, \u03b3\u0303 is the Lorentz factor, and T is the temperature of the incoming fluid in the bubble wall rest frame.

Thus, evolution follows basically the same process for all characters, except that it occurs faster for some characters than others.

The correct answer (B) is based on the statement that \"The spatial distribution of these sources is highly clustered and even sub-clustered, with a tendency of stronger concentration for the younger regions.\" This clustered distribution suggests that star formation occurs in localized bursts rather than uniformly across the cluster, indicating an episodic process.\n\nThis conclusion has important implications for cluster evolution.

Deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have been successful for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification. A specific area of the application lies in digital pathology for pattern recognition in the tissue-based diagnosis of gastrointestinal(GI) diseases. This domain can utilize CNNs to translate histopathological images into precise diagnostics. This is challenging since these complex biopsies are heterogeneous and require multiple levels of assessment. This is mainly due to structural similarities in different parts of the GI tract and shared features among different gut diseases. Addressing this problem with a flat model that assumes all classes (parts of the gut and their diseases) are equally difficult to distinguish leads to an inadequate assessment of each class. Since the hierarchical model restricts classification error to each sub-class, it leads to a more informative model than a flat model. In this paper, we propose to apply the hierarchical classification of biopsy images from different parts of the GI tract and the receptive diseases within each.
