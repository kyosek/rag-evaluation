The use of a fan beam source illumination to speed up data acquisition relative to a pencil beam presents computational challenges. To facilitate the use of iterative algorithms based on a penalized Poisson log-likelihood function, efficient computational implementation of the forward and backward models are needed.

This approach is described as a way to address the computational challenges presented by fan beam illumination while maintaining its data acquisition speed advantages over pencil beam systems.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation states that fan beam illumination is used to speed up data acquisition relative to pencil beam, so reverting to pencil beam would be counterproductive.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the documentation mentions a 2D radiopaque pattern, not a 3D one.

The conformational complexity of linear polymers far exceeds that of point-like atoms and molecules. Polymers can bend, twist, even become knotted. Thus they may also display a much richer phase structure than point particles. But it is not very easy to characterize the phase of a polymer. Essentially, the only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the degree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient temperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer. Moreover, in any finite length chain there are corrections to scaling, that complicate the detailed analysis of the phase structure. Here we introduce a quantity that we call the folding angle, a novel tool to identify and scrutinize the phases of polymers. We argue for a mean-field relationship between its values and those of the scaling exponent in the radius of gyration.

Mixing patterns in large self-organizing networks, such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, social and biological networks are often characterized by degree-degree dependencies between neighbouring nodes. In this paper we propose a new way of measuring degree-degree dependencies. One of the problems with the commonly used assortativity coefficient is that in disassortative networks its magnitude decreases with the network size. We mathematically explain this phenomenon and validate the results on synthetic graphs and real-world network data. As an alternative, we suggest to use rank correlation measures such as Spearman's rho. Our experiments convincingly show that Spearman's rho produces consistent values in graphs of different sizes but similar structure, and it is able to reveal strong (positive or negative) dependencies in large graphs. In particular, we discover much stronger negative degree-degree dependencies} in Web graphs than was previously thought. {Rank correlations allow us to compare the assortativity of networks of different sizes, which is impossible with the assortativity coefficient due to its genuine dependence on the network size.

In this paper, we aim at tackling a general but interesting cross-modality feature learning question in remote sensing community --- can a limited amount of highly-discrimin-ative (e.g., hyperspectral) training data improve the performance of a classification task using a large amount of poorly-discriminative (e.g., multispectral) data? Traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods do not perform sufficiently well for such problems, since the hyperspectral data is very expensive to be largely collected in a trade-off between time and efficiency, compared to the multispectral data. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modality learning framework, called learnable manifold alignment (LeMA). LeMA learns a joint graph structure directly from the data instead of using a given fixed graph defined by a Gaussian kernel function. With the learned graph, we can further capture the data distribution by graph-based label propagation, which enables finding a more accurate decision boundary. Additionally, an optimization strategy based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is designed to solve the proposed model.

The question presents a real-world application that requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, specifically the challenge of combining limited high-quality hyperspectral data with abundant but less discriminative multispectral data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation states that \"Traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods do not perform sufficiently well for such problems,\" due to the limited availability of hyperspectral data.\n\nOption B is a common misconception.

The online adjoint algorithm we consider is similar in spirit to the pseudo-time-stepping, one-shot method which has been previously proposed.

The online adjoint algorithm relies upon a time-relaxed adjoint PDE which provides an estimate of the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm updates this estimate continuously in time, and it asymptotically converges to the exact direction of steepest descent as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. We rigorously prove that the online adjoint algorithm converges to a critical point of the objective function for optimizing the PDE.

We present an Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo search for sub-solar mass ultracompact objects in data obtained during Advanced LIGO's second observing run. In contrast to a previous search of Advanced LIGO data from the first observing run, this search includes the effects of component spin on the gravitational waveform. We identify no viable gravitational wave candidates consistent with sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries with at least one component between 0.2 - 1.0 solar masses. We use the null result to constrain the binary merger rate of (0.2 solar mass, 0.2 solar mass) binaries to be less than 3.7 x 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and the binary merger rate of (1.0 solar mass, 1.0 solar mass) binaries to be less than 5.2 x 10^3 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Sub-solar mass ultracompact objects are not expected to form via known stellar evolution channels, though it has been suggested that primordial density fluctuations or particle dark matter with cooling mechanisms and/or nuclear interactions could form black holes with sub-solar masses. Assuming a particular primordial black hole formation model, we constrain a population of merging 0.2 solar mass black holes to account for less than 16% of the dark matter density and a population of merging 1.0 solar mass black holes to account for less than 2% of the dark matter density.

With this aim, 20 young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of trunk extensor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was degraded by standing on a foam surface.

Specifically, the study states, \"this destabilizing effect was mitigated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was facilitated (Experiment 2).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study showed that degrading somatosensation from the foot and ankle (by using a foam surface) exacerbated the destabilizing effects of trunk extensor muscle fatigue, as stated: \"this destabilizing effect was exacerbated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was degraded (Experiment 1).\"\n\nOption C is a common misconception that focuses solely on the fatigued muscles without considering the study's findings about sensory re-weighting. While strengthening trunk extensors may be beneficial, the study emphasizes the importance of somatosensory inputs from the foot and ankle in compensating for trunk fatigue.\n\nOption D introduces a distractor related to visual feedback, which was not discussed in the study.

This interaction also generates many other solitary wave structures like cuspons, peakons, tipons etc. which are otherwise unattainable with linear dispersion. Various self similar solutions of these higher order nonlinear dispersive equations are also obtained using similarity transformations.

Since news providers can recommend neither opposite nor diversified opinions if unpopularity of these articles is surely predicted, they can only bet on the articles whose forecasts of click-through rate involve high variability (risks) or high estimation errors (uncertainties). We propose a novel Bayesian model of uncertainty-aware scoring and ranking for news articles. The Bayesian binary classifier models probability of success (defined as a news click) as a Beta-distributed random variable conditional on a vector of the context (user features, article features, and other contextual features). The posterior of the contextual coefficients can be computed efficiently using a low-rank version of Laplace's method via thin Singular Value Decomposition.

The conclusion reached is that Cassini's record is another example of the good quality observations made during the Maunder Minimum, showing the meticulousness of the astronomers of that epoch. This sunspot observation made by Cassini does not support the conclusions of Zolotova and Ponyavin (Astrophys. J. 800, 42, 2015) that professional astronomers in the 17th century only registered round sunspots.

In random libraries for haploid organisms, there is always a class of genes for which knockout clones have not been made, and the members of this class are either essential or nonessential.

However, the introduction of public benefits could displace informal mechanisms for risk-protection, which are especially prevalent in LMICs. If the displacement of private transfers is considerably large, the expansion of social protection programs could even lead to social welfare loss. In this paper, we critically survey the recent empirical literature on crowd-out effects in response to public policies, specifically in the context of LMICs. We review and synthesize patterns from the behavioral response to various types of social protection programs.

The gradual decrease in fusion efficiency suggests a problem with the catalytic process, similar to the issues faced in muon-catalyzed fusion (\u03bcCF).

Instead, X\u207b\u207b particles can only stick to \u2076Li nuclei, which are produced in third-stage reactions downstream of the catalytic cycle. This sticking, although occurring with a very low probability, would gradually reduce the number of free X\u207b\u207b particles available for catalyzing fusion, explaining the observed decrease in efficiency.\n\nThe solution, as mentioned in the documentation, is to develop ways of reactivating the X-particles from the Coulomb-bound (\u2076LiX) states.

Quantile is a popular performance measure for a stochastic system to evaluate its variability and risk. To reduce the risk, selecting the actions that minimize the tail quantiles of some loss distributions is typically of interest for decision makers.

In this work, we propose a multi-level metamodel (co-kriging) based algorithm to optimize quantile functions more efficiently. Utilizing non-decreasing properties of quantile functions, we first search on cheaper and informative lower quantiles which are more accurate and easier to optimize.

Geometrical properties of energy bands underlie fascinating phenomena in a wide-range of systems, including solid-state materials, ultracold gases and photonics. Most famously, local geometrical characteristics like the Berry curvature can be related to global topological invariants such as those classifying quantum Hall states or topological insulators. Regardless of the band topology, however, any non-zero Berry curvature can have important consequences, such as in the semi-classical evolution of a wave packet. Here, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that wave packet dynamics can be used to directly map out the Berry curvature.

Statistically significant results are more rewarded than insignificant ones, so researchers have the incentive to pursue statistical significance. Such p-hacking reduces the informativeness of hypothesis tests by making significant results much more common than they are supposed to be in the absence of true significance. To address this problem, we construct critical values of test statistics such that, if these values are used to determine significance, and if researchers optimally respond to these new significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency. Such incentive-compatible critical values allow for p-hacking so they are larger than classical critical values.
