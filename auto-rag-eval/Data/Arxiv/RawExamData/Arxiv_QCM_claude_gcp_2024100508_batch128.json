In the data analysis of oscillatory systems, methods based on phase reconstruction are widely used to characterize phase-locking properties and inferring the phase dynamics.

Roughly speaking, sparsity minimizes trading costs, volatility provides arbitrage opportunities, and mean-reversion property equips investors with ideal investment strategies.

Extraction of electromagnetic energy by an antenna from impinging external radiation is at the basis of wireless communications and power transfer (WPT). The maximum of transferred energy is ensured when the antenna is conjugately matched, i.e., when it is resonant and it has an equal coupling with free space and its load, which is not easily implemented in near-field WPT. Here, we introduce the concept of coherently enhanced wireless power transfer. We show that a principle similar to the one underlying the operation of coherent perfect absorbers can be employed to improve the overall performance of WPT and potentially achieve its dynamic control. The concept relies on coherent excitation of the waveguide connected to the antenna load with a backward propagating signal of specific amplitude and phase. This signal creates a suitable interference pattern at the load resulting in a modification of the local wave impedance, which in turn enables conjugate matching and a largely increased amount of energy extracted to the waveguide.

Localized states are a universal phenomenon observed in spatially distributed dissipative nonlinear systems. Known as dissipative solitons, auto-solitons, spot or pulse solutions, these states play an important role in data transmission using optical pulses, neural signal propagation, and other processes. While this phenomenon was thoroughly studied in spatially extended systems, temporally localized states are gaining attention only recently, driven primarily by applications from fiber or semiconductor lasers. Here we present a theory for temporal dissipative solitons (TDS) in systems with time-delayed feedback. In particular, we derive a system with an advanced argument, which determines the profile of the TDS. We also provide a complete classification of the spectrum of TDS into interface and pseudo-continuous spectrum. We illustrate our theory with two examples: a generic delayed phase oscillator, which is a reduced model for an injected laser with feedback, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron with delayed feedback. Finally, we discuss possible destabilization mechanisms of TDS and show an example where the TDS delocalizes and its pseudo-continuous spectrum develops a modulational instability."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between temporal dissipative solitons (TDS) in time-delay feedback systems and their spectrum?\n\nA) TDS have only a continuous spectrum, which is responsible for their stability.\nB) The spectrum of TDS consists solely of interface states, determining the soliton's shape.\nC) TDS exhibit a spectrum composed of both interface and pseudo-continuous components.\nD) The spectrum of TDS is purely discrete, with no continuous or pseudo-continuous elements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Although recent studies have shown that electricity systems with shares of wind and solar above 80% can be affordable, economists have raised concerns about market integration. Correlated generation from variable renewable sources depresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their own revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This cannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and thus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here we show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact with prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline in average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy assumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with subsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of whether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving policy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without cannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar above 80%. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means that market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market integration.

The study shows that under different policy regimes, such as carbon dioxide caps or taxes, wind and solar shares can increase to high levels (above 80%) without cannibalizing their own market revenue.

This method is particularly demonstrated for linear-quadratic-Gaussian problems with unknown gain, which has been a challenging subject in dual control for over half a century."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Clustering and Recognition of Spatiotemporal Features through\n  Interpretable Embedding of Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks", "source": "Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman", "docs_id": "1905.12176", "section": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP", "q-bio.NC", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Clustering and Recognition of Spatiotemporal Features through\n  Interpretable Embedding of Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks. Encoder-decoder recurrent neural network models (RNN Seq2Seq) have achieved great success in ubiquitous areas of computation and applications. It was shown to be successful in modeling data with both temporal and spatial dependencies for translation or prediction tasks. In this study, we propose an embedding approach to visualize and interpret the representation of data by these models. Furthermore, we show that the embedding is an effective method for unsupervised learning and can be utilized to estimate the optimality of model training. In particular, we demonstrate that embedding space projections of the decoder states of RNN Seq2Seq model trained on sequences prediction are organized in clusters capturing similarities and differences in the dynamics of these sequences. Such performance corresponds to an unsupervised clustering of any spatio-temporal features and can be employed for time-dependent problems such as temporal segmentation, clustering of dynamic activity, self-supervised classification, action recognition, failure prediction, etc. We test and demonstrate the application of the embedding methodology to time-sequences of 3D human body poses.

We consider toy cosmological models in which a classical, homogeneous, spinor field provides a dominant or sub-dominant contribution to the energy-momentum tensor of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We find that, if such a field were to exist, appropriate choices of the spinor self-interaction would generate a rich variety of behaviors, quite different from their widely studied scalar field counterparts. We first discuss solutions that incorporate a stage of cosmic inflation and estimate the primordial spectrum of density perturbations seeded during such a stage. Inflation driven by a spinor field turns out to be unappealing as it leads to a blue spectrum of perturbations and requires considerable fine-tuning of parameters. We next find that, for simple, quartic spinor self-interactions, non-singular cyclic cosmologies exist with reasonable parameter choices. These solutions might eventually be incorporated into a successful past- and future-eternal cosmological model free of singularities. In an Appendix, we discuss the classical treatment of spinors and argue that certain quantum systems might be approximated in terms of such fields."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In the context of spinor-driven cosmological models described in the text, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) Spinor-driven inflation produces a red spectrum of primordial density perturbations, making it a viable alternative to scalar field inflation models.\n\nB) Non-singular cyclic cosmologies can be achieved with spinor fields using complex, higher-order self-interactions beyond simple quartic terms.\n\nC) Spinor-driven inflation requires minimal fine-tuning of parameters and naturally leads to observationally consistent results.\n\nD) Simple quartic spinor self-interactions can potentially lead to non-singular cyclic cosmologies with reasonable parameter choices.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.
