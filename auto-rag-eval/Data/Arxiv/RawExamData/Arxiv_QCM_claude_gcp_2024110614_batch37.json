Instrumental variables (IV) estimation suffers selection bias when the analysis conditions on the treatment. Judea Pearl's early graphical definition of instrumental variables explicitly prohibited conditioning on the treatment. Nonetheless, the practice remains common. In this paper, we derive exact analytic expressions for IV selection bias across a range of data-generating models, and for various selection-inducing procedures. We present four sets of results for linear models. First, IV selection bias depends on the conditioning procedure (covariate adjustment vs. sample truncation). Second, IV selection bias due to covariate adjustment is the limiting case of IV selection bias due to sample truncation. Third, in certain models, the IV and OLS estimators under selection bound the true causal effect in large samples. Fourth, we characterize situations where IV remains preferred to OLS despite selection on the treatment. These results broaden the notion of IV selection bias beyond sample truncation, replace prior simulation findings with exact analytic formulas, and enable formal sensitivity analyses."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Instrumental Variables with Treatment-Induced Selection, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the causal effect of a job training program on future earnings using an instrumental variable approach.

Granger causality is a fundamental technique for causal inference in time series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences.

However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not hold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop variable-lag Granger causality, a generalization of Granger causality that relaxes the assumption of the fixed time delay and allows causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays.

The continuum intensity exists at (\u03c0 \u03c0) in overdoped samples, whereas it was only reported at (0 0) and (\u03c0 0) for the x=0.17 sample.\n2.

The model states that degradation of the elastin meshwork is a key factor in skin ageing. Therefore, maintaining elastin network integrity would counteract this ageing effect.\n\n2.

In particular, the default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher.

While this approach is effective for standard facial expressions, it may struggle with micro-expressions for several reasons:\n\n1. Time span: Micro-expressions occur very rapidly, typically lasting only 1/25 to 1/15 of a second. The rank pooling method used to generate CDIs might not capture such brief deformations effectively.\n\n2. Subtle changes: Micro-expressions involve very subtle muscle movements, which might not be prominently represented in the geometrical images or the resulting CDIs.\n\n3. Temporal resolution: The paper doesn't specify the temporal resolution of the 4D scans used. If it's not high enough, micro-expressions could be missed entirely.\n\n4. Focus on macro expressions: The BU-4DFE dataset used for testing likely contains more pronounced, longer-lasting expressions, not micro-expressions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the system processes geometrical images, which should be able to handle facial features like piercings or tattoos.

Option D is incorrect because the system uses 3D scans, which should be able to capture visible parts of the face even with partial coverings.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the CCDN method's capabilities and limitations, integration of concepts from facial expression recognition and the specific techniques described, and application to a real-world scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels."}, "83": {"documentation": {"title": "Instrument Validity for Heterogeneous Causal Effects", "source": "Zhenting Sun", "docs_id": "2009.01995", "section": ["econ.EM", "math.ST", "stat.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Instrument Validity for Heterogeneous Causal Effects.

The correct answer is D because the paper explicitly states that \"a valid instrument for a multivalued treatment may not remain valid if the treatment is coarsened.\" This is likely due to the masking of heterogeneous effects when the treatment is simplified into binary categories.\n\nOption A is incorrect because measurement error is not directly related to the coarsening process described in the paper.

This conclusion can be drawn from the documentation, which states: \"It is found that relatively large energy gains come from the tensor force in these isotopes and there is the blocking effect by occupied neutron orbits on the tensor correlation.\"\n\nThis effect occurs because as more neutrons are added to the oxygen nucleus (moving towards heavier isotopes like 22O, 24O, and 28O), these neutrons occupy specific orbitals.

I show that this expectation is realized for periods small compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~ 1.

The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors. These results imply that to preserve astrometric discovery space at the longest accessible orbits (which nominally have the lowest-mass sensitivity) requires supplementary observations to identify or rule out distant companions that could contribute quasi-uniform acceleration."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An exoplanet survey is being conducted using both astrometric and radial-velocity (RV) methods. The survey duration is 5 years. For which of the following scenarios would you expect the most significant difference in mass error estimation between the two methods?\n\nA) A planet with an orbital period of 6 months\nB) A planet with an orbital period of 4 years\nC) A planet in a binary star system with an orbital period of 3 years\nD) A planet with an orbital period of 7 years in a system with a distant companion\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, particularly focusing on the differences between astrometric and radial-velocity methods for planet detection at different orbital periods relative to the survey duration.\n\nThe key factors to consider are:\n1. The ratio of orbital period (P) to survey duration (T)\n2. The presence of distant companions\n3. The behavior of mass error estimation for both methods as P/T increases\n\nFor option A, with P/T = 0.1, both methods would perform similarly as this is well within the range where P/T << 1.\n\nFor option B, with P/T = 0.8, we're approaching the point where astrometric measurements begin to deteriorate, but RV measurements are still relatively stable.\n\nOption C introduces a binary star system, which adds complexity but doesn't necessarily maximize the difference between the two methods given the P/T ratio of 0.6.\n\nOption D presents the most significant difference because:\n1. P/T > 1 (7/5 = 1.4), which is beyond the point where both methods begin to deteriorate.\n2. Astrometric measurements deteriorate more rapidly and less gracefully than RV measurements as P/T increases beyond 0.8.\n3. The presence of a distant companion introduces a quasi-uniform acceleration, which particularly affects astrometric measurements at longer orbital periods.\n\nThis scenario combines the longest orbital period relative to the survey duration with the complicating factor of a distant companion, maximizing the difference in performance between astrometric and RV methods for mass error estimation. It tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts and apply them to a realistic scenario in exoplanet detection."}}
