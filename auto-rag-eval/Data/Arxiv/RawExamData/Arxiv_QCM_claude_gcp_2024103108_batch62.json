Transient amplification has been proposed as an important mechanism not only in neuroscience but in many areas modeled by dynamical systems. Despite that, there is no clear biologically plausible mechanism which fine-tunes the coupling matrix or selects signals to be amplified. In this work we quantitatively study transient dynamics in the Rajan-Abbott model of a recurrent neural network [K. Rajan and L.F. Abbot PRL 97, 188104 (2006)]. We find a second order transition between a phase of weakly or no amplified transients and a phase of strong amplification, where the average trajectory is amplified. In the latter phase the combination of Dale's principle and excitatory/inhibitory balance allows for strong weights, while maintaining the system at the edge of chaos. Moreover, we show that the amplification goes hand in hand with greater variability of the dynamics. By numerically studying the full probability density of the squared norm, we observe as the strength of weights grows, the right tail of the distribution becomes heavier, moving from the Gaussian to the exponential tail."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Rajan-Abbott model of a recurrent neural network, what phenomenon is observed as the strength of weights grows, and how does it relate to transient amplification?\n\nA) The left tail of the squared norm distribution becomes heavier, transitioning from Gaussian to exponential, indicating decreased amplification.\n\nB) The right tail of the squared norm distribution becomes heavier, transitioning from Gaussian to exponential, coinciding with increased transient amplification.\n\nC) The distribution of squared norm becomes more Gaussian, signaling a shift towards weak or no amplified transients.\n\nD) The distribution of squared norm remains unchanged, suggesting that weight strength has no impact on transient amplification.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

We present an analytical model to study the role of expectation feedbacks and overlapping portfolios on systemic stability of financial systems.

Assuming that they use adaptive expectations of risk, we show that the evolution of the system is described by a slow-fast random dynamical system, which can be studied analytically in some regimes.

The model emphasizes that risk expectations play a central role in determining the systemic stability of the financial system.

However, a DL model pre-trained using a dataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from another new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene are limited.

Then, the reconstruction model is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which makes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level features both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification, simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL strategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two public glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG.

An important statistical test on the pseudo-random number generators is called the spectral test. The test is aimed at answering the question of distribution of the generated pseudo-random vectors in dimensions $d$ that are larger than the genuine dimension of a generator $N$. In particular, the default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher. Therefore the spectral test is important to perform in dimensions $d > 8$ for $N=8$ generator, $d> 17$ for $N=17$ and $d> 240$ for $N=240$ generator.

Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy.

This forces them to be entangled, so that, consequently, the slow variables are entangled as well. The fast variables could be the vacuum fluctuations caused by unknown super heavy particles. The emerging quantum effects in the light particles are expressed by a Hamiltonian that can have almost any form.

This seemed to lead to an unsolvable paradox, which is now resolved: exactly what happens in our models if we run a quantum interference experiment in a classical computer is explained.

Gaseous detectors are widely used in high energy physics, and are attractive choices in tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography.

Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such \"breathing\" effect can be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contamination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system with 0.9 square meter area, total volume of 160 l, has been operated for 36 days with a flow of 3 l/day, confirming that the buffer volume, in this case a 50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufficient gas quality. The key effects governing the gas flow dynamics, including diffusion and gas volume change, has been studied quantitatively, leading to practical design prescriptions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a muographic tracking detector using gaseous detection medium, what is the primary factor limiting the reduction of input gas flow in outdoor applications, and how can it be mitigated?\n\nA) Contamination by outside air - mitigated by increasing gas flow rate\nB) Internal outgassing - mitigated by using inert materials for detector construction\nC) Daily temperature cycling causing gas density changes - mitigated by implementing a well-designed buffer volume\nD) Diffusion of gas molecules - mitigated by using high-pressure gas cylinders\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key challenges in reducing gas consumption for outdoor gaseous muon trackers. The correct answer is C because the document specifically states that \"particularly the gas density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow.\" This \"breathing\" effect is a major obstacle in reducing gas consumption. The mitigation strategy mentioned is \"a well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contamination.\" This buffer volume, exemplified by a \"50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube\" in the test system, helps maintain gas quality despite temperature-induced volume changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while contamination by outside air is a concern, increasing gas flow rate contradicts the goal of reducing gas consumption.

In complex manipulation scenarios (e.g. tasks requiring complex interaction of two hands or in-hand manipulation), generalization is a hard problem.

In this paradigm, controllers solving these tasks tend to be complex. We propose a paradigm of maintaining simpler controllers solving the task in a small number of specific situations. In order to generalize to novel situations, the robot transforms the environment from novel situations into a situation where the solution of the task is already known. Our solution to this problem is to play with objects and use previously trained skills (basis skills).
