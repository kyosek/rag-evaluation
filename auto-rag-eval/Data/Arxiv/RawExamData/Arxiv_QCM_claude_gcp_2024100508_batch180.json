In this paper, we explore the relationship between state-level household income inequality and macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States. Using a novel large-scale macroeconometric model, we shed light on regional disparities of inequality responses to a national uncertainty shock. The results suggest that income inequality decreases in most states, with a pronounced degree of heterogeneity in terms of shapes and magnitudes of the dynamic responses. By contrast, some few states, mostly located in the West and South census region, display increasing levels of income inequality over time. We find that this directional pattern in responses is mainly driven by the income composition and labor market fundamentals. In addition, forecast error variance decompositions allow for a quantitative assessment of the importance of uncertainty shocks in explaining income inequality. The findings highlight that volatility shocks account for a considerable fraction of forecast error variance for most states considered.

The study finds that income inequality decreases in most states following a national uncertainty shock, but there is significant heterogeneity in the responses. Some states, primarily in the West and South census regions, show increasing levels of income inequality over time. This reflects the complex relationship between macroeconomic uncertainty and income inequality, which is influenced by factors such as income composition and labor market fundamentals in different states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the study's findings that inequality decreases in most states and that increases are primarily observed in some Western and Southern states, not the Northeast.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the study explicitly mentions a \"pronounced degree of heterogeneity\" in responses across states, contradicting the idea of uniform impact.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it reverses the main finding of the study.

Here, we consider whether this same tradeoff, formalized as a constrained convection-reaction-diffusion system, can also explain the sizes of fully aquatic mammals, which have not previously been considered.

This strong agreement between theory and data suggests that a universal macroevolutionary tradeoff governs body size evolution for all mammals, regardless of their habitat. The dramatic sizes of cetaceans can thus be attributed mainly to the increased convective heat loss is water, which shifts the species size distribution upward and pushes its right tail into ranges inaccessible to terrestrial mammals.

In this letter, we apply the concept of the grain alignment by gas flow, which is called mechanical alignment, to the situation of a protoplanetary disk. We assume that grains have a certain helicity, which results in the alignment with the minor axis parallel to the grain velocity against the ambient disk gas and discuss the morphology of polarization vectors in a protoplanetary disk.

If the Stokes number is as large as unity, the polarization vectors show a leading spiral pattern since the radial and azimuthal components of the gas velocity against the dust grains are comparable.

We extract the constraints from runs of Python programs using an existing tainting library for Python, and compare our grey-box version of RALib with the existing black-box version on several benchmarks, including some data structures from Python's standard library. Our proof-of-principle implementation results in almost two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of numbers of inputs sent to the software system.

Originally a speculative pattern in ecological networks, the hybrid or compound nested-modular pattern has been confirmed, during the last decade, as a relevant structural arrangement that emerges in a variety of contexts --in ecological mutualistic system and beyond.
