The liquidity risk factor of security market plays an important role in the formulation of trading strategies. A more liquid stock market means that the securities can be bought or sold more easily. As a sound indicator of market liquidity, the transaction duration is the focus of this study. We concentrate on estimating the probability density function p({\\Delta}t_(i+1) |G_i) where {\\Delta}t_(i+1) represents the duration of the (i+1)-th transaction, G_i represents the historical information at the time when the (i+1)-th transaction occurs. In this paper, we propose a new ultra-high-frequency (UHF) duration modelling framework by utilizing long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extend the conditional mean equation of classic autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model while retaining the probabilistic inference ability. And then the attention mechanism is leveraged to unveil the internal mechanism of the constructed model. In order to minimize the impact of manual parameter tuning, we adopt fixed hyperparameters during the training process.

Ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) is a new service class introduced in 5G which is characterized by strict reliability $(1-10^{-5})$ and low latency requirements (1 ms). To meet these requisites, several strategies like overprovisioning of resources and channel-predictive algorithms have been developed. This paper describes the application of a Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NARNN) as a novel approach to forecast interference levels in a wireless system for the purpose of efficient resource allocation. Accurate interference forecasts also grant the possibility of meeting specific outage probability requirements in URLLC scenarios. Performance of this proposal is evaluated upon the basis of NARNN predictions accuracy and system resource usage.
