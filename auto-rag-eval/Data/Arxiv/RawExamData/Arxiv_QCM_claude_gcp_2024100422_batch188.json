Recurrence networks are powerful tools used effectively in the nonlinear analysis of time series data. The analysis in this context is done mostly with unweighted and undirected complex networks constructed with specific criteria from the time series. In this work, we propose a novel method to construct \"weighted recurrence network\"(WRN) from a time series and show how it can reveal useful information regarding the structure of a chaotic attractor, which the usual unweighted recurrence network cannot provide. Especially, we find the node strength distribution of the WRN, from every chaotic attractor follows a power law (with exponential tail) with the index characteristic to the fractal structure of the attractor. This leads to a new class among complex networks, to which networks from all standard chaotic attractors are found to belong. In addition, we present generalized definitions for clustering coefficient and characteristic path length and show that these measures can effectively discriminate chaotic dynamics from white noise and $1/f$ colored noise.

In most contemporary approaches to decision making, a decision problem is described by a sets of states and set of outcomes, and a rich set of acts, which are functions from states to outcomes over which the decision maker (DM) has preferences. Most interesting decision problems, however, do not come with a state space and an outcome space. Indeed, in complex problems it is often far from clear what the state and outcome spaces would be. We present an alternative foundation for decision making, in which the primitive objects of choice are syntactic programs. A representation theorem is proved in the spirit of standard representation theorems, showing that if the DM's preference relation on objects of choice satisfies appropriate axioms, then there exist a set S of states, a set O of outcomes, a way of interpreting the objects of choice as functions from S to O, a probability on S, and a utility function on O, such that the DM prefers choice a to choice b if and only if the expected utility of a is higher than that of b. Thus, the state space and outcome space are subjective, just like the probability and utility; they are not part of the description of the problem. In principle, a modeler can test for SEU behavior without having access to states or outcomes.

The pairing heap is a classical heap data structure introduced in 1986 by Fredman, Sedgewick, Sleator, and Tarjan.

The resulting collection of trees is consolidated in two rounds: a left-to-right pairing round, followed by a right-to-left accumulation round.

Above a critical vaccination coverage, epidemics are prevented; hence individuals find it unnecessary to vaccinate.

This feedback mechanism creates a unique self-organized state where epidemics are prevented. This state is attracting, but unstable; thus epidemics are rarely prevented.

We investigated how collective behavior changes when public health programs are implemented.

Large sample size brings the computation bottleneck for modern data analysis. Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem.

In this paper we investigate a kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary least-square problem. We establish non-asymptotic property, i.e, the error bound of the correspond- ing subsample estimator, which provide a tradeoff between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the subsample estimator.
