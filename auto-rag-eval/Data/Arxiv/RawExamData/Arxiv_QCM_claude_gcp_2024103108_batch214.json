A specific class of transport infrastructures contributing significantly to overcoming the spatial constraints is the airtransport infrastructures. Nowadays, the importance of air-transport infrastructures in the economic development is determinative, especially for the geographically isolated regions, such as for the island regions of Greece.

The Weighted Sum Bisection method, as described in the paper, is designed to find the lowest emission tax rate that can reduce the anticipated emissions of the power sector below a prescribed, regulatorily-defined target.

The reinforcement learning procedure developed in Carbonneau and Godin (2020), which relies on the deep hedging algorithm of Buehler et al.

Among other findings, numerical results indicate that in the presence of jump risk, hedging long-term puts with shorter-term options entails a significant decrease of both equal risk prices and market incompleteness as compared to trading only the stock.

The objective of this paper is to introduce an innovative approach for the recovery of non-stationary signal components with possibly cross-over instantaneous frequency (IF) curves from a multi-component blind-source signal. The main idea is to incorporate a chirp rate parameter with the time-scale continuous wavelet-like transformation, by considering the quadratic phase representation of the signal components. Hence-forth, even if two IF curves cross, the two corresponding signal components can still be separated and recovered, provided that their chirp rates are different.

Numerical calculation of two-loop electroweak corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($g$-2) is done based on, on shell renormalization scheme (OS) and free quark model (FQM). The GRACE-FORM system is used to generate Feynman diagrams and corresponding amplitudes. Total 1780 two-loop diagrams and 70 one-loop diagrams composed of counter terms are calculated to get the renormalized quantity. As for the numerical calculation, we adopt trapezoidal rule with Double Exponential method (DE). Linear extrapolation method (LE) is introduced to regularize UV- and IR-divergences and to get finite values. The reliability of our result is guaranteed by several conditions. The sum of one and two loop electroweak corrections in this renormalization scheme becomes $a_\\mu^{EW:OS}[1{\\rm+}2{\\rm -loop}]= 151.2 (\\pm 1.0)\\times 10^{-11}$, where the error is due to the numerical integration and the uncertainty of input mass parameters and of the hadronic corrections to electroweak loops. By taking the hadronic corrections into account, we get $a_\\mu^{EW}[1{\\rm+}2 {\\rm -loop}]= 152.9 (\\pm 1.0)\\times 10^{-11}$.

Based on a recent model of evolving viruses competing with an adapting immune system [1], we study the conditions under which a viral quasispecies can maximize its growth rate. The range of mutation rates that allows viruses to thrive is limited from above due to genomic information deterioration, and from below by insufficient sequence diversity, which leads to a quick eradication of the virus by the immune system. The mutation rate that optimally balances these two requirements depends to first order on the ratio of the inverse of the virus' growth rate and the time the immune system needs to develop a specific answer to an antigen. We find that a virus is most viable if it generates exactly one mutation within the time it takes for the immune system to adapt to a new viral epitope. Experimental viral mutation rates, in particular for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), seem to suggest that many viruses have achieved their optimal mutation rate. [1] C.Kamp and S.

Resilience, the ability to recover from adverse events (\"shocks\"), is of fundamental importance to food security. This is especially true in poor countries, where basic needs are frequently threatened by economic, environmental, and health shocks. An empirically sound formalization of the concept of food security resilience, however, is lacking. Here we introduce a general framework for quantifying resilience based on a simple definition: a unit is resilient if $(a)$ its long-term food security trend is not deteriorating and $(b)$ the effects of shocks on this trend do not persist over time. Our approach can be applied to any food security variable for which high-frequency time-series data is available, can accommodate any unit of analysis (e.g., individuals, households, countries), and is especially useful in rapidly changing contexts wherein standard equilibrium-based economic models are ineffective. We illustrate our method with an analysis of per capita kilocalorie availability for 161 countries between 1961 and 2011. We find that resilient countries are not necessarily those that are characterized by high levels or less volatile fluctuations of kilocalorie intake.
