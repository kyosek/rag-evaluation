Mobile microrobots are envisioned to be useful in a wide range of high-impact applications, many of which requiring cohesive group formation to maintain self-bounded swarms in the absence of confining boundaries. Cohesive group formation relies on a balance between attractive and repulsive interactions between agents. We found that a balance of magnetic dipolar attraction and multipolar repulsion between self-assembled particle chain microrobots enable their self-organization into cohesive clusters. Self-organized microrobotic clusters translate above a solid substrate via a hydrodynamic self-propulsion mechanism. Cluster velocity increases with cluster size, resulting from collective hydrodynamic effects. Clustering is promoted by the strength of cohesive interactions and hindered by heterogeneities of individual microrobots. Scalability of cohesive interactions allows formation of larger groups, whose internal spatiotemporal organization undergoes a transition from solid-like ordering to liquid-like behavior with increasing cluster size.

In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-relay selection for multi-stream cooperative MIMO systems with $M$ relay nodes. Traditionally, relay selection approaches are primarily focused on selecting one relay node to improve the transmission reliability given a single-antenna destination node. As such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected relay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit cooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time coding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the cooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data streams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore, we propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support multi-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic performance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff.

Traditional relay selection approaches focus on selecting a single relay to improve transmission reliability for single-antenna destination nodes, primarily exploiting cooperative spatial diversity.

We focus on the role that tangent bundle learners (TBL) can play in estimating the underlying manifold from which data is assumed to be sampled.

In this paper, we propose a human-perception-based pseudo analog video transmission system named ROIC-Cast, which aims to intelligently enhance the transmission quality of the region-of-interest (ROI) parts. Firstly, the classic deep learning based saliency detection algorithm is adopted to decompose the continuous video sequences into ROI and non-ROI blocks.

Then, the power allocation scheme is formulated as a convex problem, and the optimal transmission power for both ROI and non-ROI blocks is derived in a closed form. Finally, the simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system by comparing with a few of existing systems, e.g., KMV-Cast, SoftCast, and DAC-RAN. The proposed ROIC-Cast can achieve over 4.1dB peak signal- to-noise ratio gains of ROI compared with other systems, given the channel signal-to-noise ratio as -5dB, 0dB, 5dB, and 10dB, respectively.

The documentation states that ${{\\rm Ra}}_n$ is a dimensionless parameter measuring the relevance of nuclear heating. As ${{\\rm Ra}}_n$ is varied, the flow characteristics change, progressing through periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic flows with coherent structures, and fully turbulent flows.

Multispectral image analysis is a relatively promising field of research with applications in several areas, such as medical imaging and satellite monitoring.
