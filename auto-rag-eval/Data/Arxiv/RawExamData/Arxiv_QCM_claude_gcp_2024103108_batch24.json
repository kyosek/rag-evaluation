We put particular focus on the change in the soft mode dynamics throughout the crossover, and find that three different effective theories describe it; these are, the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory in the BCS regime, the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory in the BEC regime, and the relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii (RGP) equation in the relativistic BEC (RBEC) regime.

Real people, on the other hand, often have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try to characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning. But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put this to the test -- rather than relying on assumptions about which specific bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator's planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed findings: on the one hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this benefit is dwarfed by the loss we incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner.

The study found that the ionization parameter of the ultrafast outflow (UFO) was correlated with the luminosity of the source.

This relationship suggests that UFOs may be more difficult to detect in very bright active galactic nuclei (AGN), potentially leading to an underestimation of their prevalence and feedback effects.

In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev.

Second, we analyze the secondary instability (around the time-dependent primary instability) and find similar strong stabilization. Since the secondary instability develops around a time-dependent solution and is three-dimensional, this brings us closer to the turbulent case.

Cross-situational word learning is based on the notion that a learner can determine the referent of a word by finding something in common across many observed uses of that word.

By adjusting these parameters so that the model predictions agree with data from representative experiments on cross-situational word learning, we were able to explain the learning strategies adopted by the participants of those experiments in terms of a trade-off between reinforcement and inference.

Tensor factorization is a powerful tool to analyse multi-way data. Compared with traditional multi-linear methods, nonlinear tensor factorization models are capable of capturing more complex relationships in the data. However, they are computationally expensive and may suffer severe learning bias in case of extreme data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose a distributed, flexible nonlinear tensor factorization model. Our model can effectively avoid the expensive computations and structural restrictions of the Kronecker-product in existing TGP formulations, allowing an arbitrary subset of tensorial entries to be selected to contribute to the training. At the same time, we derive a tractable and tight variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that enables highly decoupled, parallel computations and high-quality inference.

Deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have been successful for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification. A specific area of the application lies in digital pathology for pattern recognition in the tissue-based diagnosis of gastrointestinal(GI) diseases. This domain can utilize CNNs to translate histopathological images into precise diagnostics. This is challenging since these complex biopsies are heterogeneous and require multiple levels of assessment. This is mainly due to structural similarities in different parts of the GI tract and shared features among different gut diseases. Addressing this problem with a flat model that assumes all classes (parts of the gut and their diseases) are equally difficult to distinguish leads to an inadequate assessment of each class. Since the hierarchical model restricts classification error to each sub-class, it leads to a more informative model than a flat model. In this paper, we propose to apply the hierarchical classification of biopsy images from different parts of the GI tract and the receptive diseases within each. We embedded a class hierarchy into the plain VGGNet to take advantage of its layers' hierarchical structure. The proposed model was evaluated using an independent set of image patches from 373 whole slide images.
