In the shape analysis approach to computer vision problems, one treats shapes as points in an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, thereby facilitating algorithms for statistical calculations such as geodesic distance between shapes and averaging of a collection of shapes. The performance of these algorithms depends heavily on the choice of the Riemannian metric. In the setting of plane curve shapes, attention has largely been focused on a two-parameter family of first order Sobolev metrics, referred to as elastic metrics. They are particularly useful due to the existence of simplifying coordinate transformations for particular parameter values, such as the well-known square-root velocity transform. In this paper, we extend the transformations appearing in the existing literature to a family of isometries, which take any elastic metric to the flat $L^2$ metric.

Therefore, the optimal bandwidth for HAR tests is a double kernel HAC estimator.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is D) because the documentation states that existing LRV estimators tend to be inflated when the data are nonstationary, leading to HAR tests that can be undersized and exhibit dramatic power losses. The double kernel HAC estimator is mentioned as a robust alternative that does not suffer from low frequency contamination.

We use 3mm multi-line and continuum CARMA observations towards the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) candidate L1451-mm to characterize the envelope kinematics at 1000 AU scales and investigate its evolutionary state. We detect evidence of infall and rotation in the N2H+(1-0), NH2D(1(1,1)-1(0,1)) and HCN(1-0) molecular lines. We compare the position velocity diagram of the NH2D line with a simple kinematic model and find that it is consistent with an envelope that is both infalling and rotating while conserving angular momentum around a central mass of about 0.06 Msun. The N2H+(1-0) LTE mass of the envelope along with the inferred infall velocity leads to a mass infall rate of approximately 6e-6 Msun/yr, implying a young age of 10,000 years for this FHSC candidate. Assuming that the accretion onto the central object is the same as the infall rate we obtain that the minimum source size is 1.5-5 AU consistent with the size expected for a first core. We do not see any evidence of outflow motions or signs of outflow-envelope interaction at scales > 2000 AU. This is consistent with previous observations that revealed a very compact outflow (<500 AU). We conclude that L1451-mm is indeed at a very early stage of evolution, either a first core or an extremely young Class 0 protostar.
