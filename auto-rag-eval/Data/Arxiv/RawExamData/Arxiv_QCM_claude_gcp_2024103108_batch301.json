We consider a spatial model where a continuous set of sellers (e.g. farmers) must choose one trading location in a discrete set (e.g. cities) in a subset of the plane. Locations differ in terms of productivity, and shipping costs depend on the underlying geography via very general distance functions. Our analysis combines tools from general equilibrium theory and computational geometry. The key insight is that, under Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) preferences, the equilibrium trading choices of farmers can be represented as a Voronoi tessellation with additive weights, where the weights are determined at the market equilibrium. Using this insight, we prove that an equilibrium partition of space into market areas exists and is unique for general underlying geographies, and we characterize their comparative statics in terms of the model parameters. Moreover, we develop a set of tools that are useful in empirical applications. We show that the model can be solved with a simple, and economically-interpretable, gradient-descent algorithm, and we discuss two metrics to evaluate the distance between tessellations.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been introduced for designing wireless policies by approximating the mappings from environmental parameters to solutions of optimization problems. Considering that labeled training samples are hard to obtain, unsupervised deep learning has been proposed to solve functional optimization problems with statistical constraints recently. However, most existing problems in wireless communications are variable optimizations, and many problems are with instantaneous constraints. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of using unsupervised deep learning to solve both kinds of problems with both instantaneous and statistic constraints. For a constrained variable optimization, we first convert it into an equivalent functional optimization problem with instantaneous constraints. Then, to ensure the instantaneous constraints in the functional optimization problems, we use DNN to approximate the Lagrange multiplier functions, which is trained together with a DNN to approximate the policy. We take two resource allocation problems in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications as examples to illustrate how to guarantee the complex and stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints with the framework.
