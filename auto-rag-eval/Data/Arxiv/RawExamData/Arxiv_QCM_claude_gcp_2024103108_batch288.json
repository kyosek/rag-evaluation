According to the competitive exclusion principle, in a finite ecosystem, extinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same resources. An important question that arises is: when coexistence is not possible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the other(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher reproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such as asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been found to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine competitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models, including stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic (mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the \"biological clock\" of one species is a factor of $\\alpha$ slower than that of the other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and competition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems.

The automated analysis of social networks has become an important problem due to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and Facebook. The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can handle massive networks. The basis idea of MSLP is to construct low rank approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner.

The mixed-state resistive response of a superconductor thin film with an asymmetric washboard pinning potential subject to superimposed dc and ac currents of arbitrary amplitudes and frequency at finite temperature is theoretically investigated. The problem is considered in the single-vortex approximation, relying upon the exact solution of the Langevin equation in terms of a matrix continued fraction. The dc voltage response and the absorbed power in ac response are analyzed as functions of dc bias, ac current amplitude and frequency, in a wide range of corresponding dimensionless parameters. Predictions are made of (i) a reversal of the rectified voltage at small dc biases and strong ac drives and (ii) a non-monotonic enhancement of the absorbed power in the nonlinear ac response at far sub-depinning frequencies.

We present four Mpc-sized radio galaxies which consist of a pair of double-lobed radio sources, aligned along the same axis, and with a coinciding radio core. We have called these peculiar radio sources `double-double' radio galaxies (DDRG) and propose a general definition of such sources: A `double-double' radio galaxy consists of a pair of double radio sources with a common centre. Furthermore, the two lobes of the inner radio source must have a clearly extended, edge-brightened radio morphology. Adopting this definition we find several other candidate DDRGs in the literature. We find that in all sources the smaller (inner) pair of radio lobes is less luminous than the larger (outer) pair, and that the ratio of 1.4-GHz flux density of these two pairs appears to be anti-correlated with the projected linear size of the inner source. Also, the outer radio structures are large, exceeding 700 kpc. We discuss possible formation scenarios of the DDRGs, and we conclude that an interruption of the jet-forming central activity is the most likely mechanism. For one of our sources (B 1834+620) we have been able to observationally constrain the length of time of the interruption to a few Myr.
