In two dimensions we find that modest shear rates align the system and stabilise an almost regular lamellar phase, but high shear rates induce the nucleation and proliferation of defects, which in steady state is balanced by the annihilation of defects of opposite sign. The critical shear rate at onset of this second regime is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; we offer a scaling analysis that relates the critical shear rate to a critical \"capillary number\" involving those variables. Within the defect proliferation regime, the defects may be partially annealed by slowly decreasing the applied shear rate; this causes marked memory effects, and history-dependent rheology. Simulations in three dimensions show instead shear-induced ordering even at the highest shear rates studied here. This suggests that the critical shear rate shifts markedly upward on increasing dimensionality.

We provide an ex-ante evaluation of the effectiveness of a massive increase in research and innovation (R&I) funding in Finland to stimulate post-crisis recovery growth through an increase in R&I activities of Finnish firms. We make use of the fact that novel R&I grants for firms in disruptive circumstances granted in 2020 were allocated through established R&I policy channels. This allows us to estimate the structural link between R&I funding and economic growth for Finnish NUTS-3 regions using pre-COVID-19 data.

To overcome these problems, we describe a method of stability estimation without family classifications, based on mathematical modelling and the analysis of contemporary geospatial distributions of linguistic features.
