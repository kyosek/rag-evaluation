Recent studies have demonstrated that analysis of laboratory-quality voice recordings can be used to accurately differentiate people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) from healthy controls (HC).

In this study, we analyzed 2759 telephone-quality voice recordings from 1483 PD and 15321 recordings from 8300 HC participants. To account for variations in phonetic backgrounds, we acquired data from seven countries. We developed a statistical framework for analyzing voice, whereby we computed 307 dysphonia measures that quantify different properties of voice impairment, such as, breathiness, roughness, monopitch, hoarse voice quality, and exaggerated vocal tremor. We used feature selection algorithms to identify robust parsimonious feature subsets, which were used in combination with a Random Forests (RF) classifier to accurately distinguish PD from HC. The best 10-fold cross-validation performance was obtained using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) and RF, leading to mean sensitivity of 64.90% (standard deviation, SD 2.90%) and mean specificity of 67.96% (SD 2.90%).

This space, denoted $\\mathcal{N}(X)$, is defined in terms of two operations on networks -- the nearest neighbor interchange and triangle operations -- which can be used to transform any network with leaf set $X$ into any other network with that leaf set.

Recent ALMA observations may indicate a surprising abundance of sub-Jovian planets on very wide orbits in protoplanetary discs that are only a few million years old. These planets are too young and distant to have been formed via the Core Accretion (CA) scenario, and are much less massive than the gas clumps born in the classical Gravitational Instability (GI) theory. It was recently suggested that such planets may form by the partial destruction of GI protoplanets: energy output due to the growth of a massive core may unbind all or most of the surrounding pre-collapse protoplanet. Here we present the first 3D global disc simulations that simultaneously resolve grain dynamics in the disc and within the protoplanet. We confirm that massive GI protoplanets may self-destruct at arbitrarily large separations from the host star provided that solid cores of mass around 10-20 Earth masses are able to grow inside them during their pre-collapse phase. In addition, we find that the heating force recently analysed by Masset and Velasco Romero (2017) perturbs these cores away from the centre of their gaseous protoplanets. This leads to very complicated dust dynamics in the protoplanet centre, potentially resulting in the formation of multiple cores, planetary satellites, and other debris such as planetesimals within the same protoplanet.

A robust game is a distribution-free model to handle ambiguity generated by a bounded set of possible realizations of the values of players' payoff functions.

We assess the potential of using presupernova neutrino signals at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to probe the yet-unknown neutrino mass hierarchy.

The correct answer is D for the following reasons:\n\n1. The text mentions that for Betelgeuse (at 222 pc), using only electron antineutrino signals would require an uncertainty in predicted signals of <14-30% for a 95% confidence level determination. This rules out options A and C, which either have too high uncertainty (50%) or only focus on antineutrinos.\n\n2.
