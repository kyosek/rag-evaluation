Slow and dense granular flows often exhibit narrow shear bands, making them ill-suited for a continuum description. However, smooth granular flows have been shown to occur in specific geometries such as linear shear in the absence of gravity, slow inclined plane flows and, recently, flows in split-bottom Couette geometries. The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable to a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding constitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We propose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including rate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the constitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in the highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with the simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a constant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be inconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the effective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the shear zone localizes. We suggest that a subtle dependence of the effective-friction coefficient on the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force is crucial for the understanding of slow granular flows."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the key finding regarding the effective-friction coefficient in slow granular flows, and how does it differ between linear shear and inclined plane flows compared to split-bottom geometry?\n\nA) The effective-friction coefficient is a constant in all three geometries, and its value is independent of the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force.\n\nB) The effective-friction coefficient is a constant in linear shear and inclined plane flows, but it must vary throughout the shear zone in split-bottom geometry.\n\nC) The effective-friction coefficient is a function of the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force in all three geometries, and its value is constant in split-bottom geometry.\n\nD) The effective-friction coefficient is a constant in split-bottom geometry, but it must vary throughout the shear zone in linear shear and inclined plane flows.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The effective-friction coefficient is a constant in linear shear and inclined plane flows, but it must vary throughout the shear zone in split-bottom geometry.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the documentation states that the effective-friction coefficient is consistent with a simple constitutive assumption in linear shear and inclined plane flows, where it is a constant.

We say that an edge-ordered graph $G$ $\\textit{avoids}$ another edge-ordered graph $H$, if no subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to $H$. The $\\textit{Tur\\'an number}$ of an edge-ordered graph $H$ is the maximum number of edges in an edge-ordered graph on $n$ vertices that avoids $H$. We study this problem in general, and establish an Erd\\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits-type theorem for edge-ordered graphs -- we discover that the relevant parameter for the Tur\\'an number of an edge-ordered graph is its $\\textit{order chromatic number}$.

Recently, deep learning-based perception methods have addressed multiple degrading effects to reflect real-world bad weather cases but have shown limited success due to 1) high computational costs for deployment on mobile devices and 2) poor relevance between image enhancement and visual perception in terms of the model ability.

Resilience characterizes a system's ability to retain its original function when perturbations happen. In the past years our attention mainly focused on small-scale resilience, yet our understanding of resilience in large-scale network considering interactions between components is limited. Even though, recent research in macro and micro resilience pattern has developed analytical tools to analyze the relationship between topology and dynamics across network scales. The effect of uncertainty in a large-scale networked system is not clear, especially when uncertainties cascade between connected nodes. In order to quantify resilience uncertainty across the network resolutions (macro to micro),an arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion method is developed in this paper to estimate the resilience subject to parameter uncertainties with arbitrary distributions. For the first time and of particular importance, is our ability to identify the probability of a node in losing its resilience and how the different model parameters contribute to this risk. We test this using a generic networked bi-stable system and this will aid practitioners to both understand macro-scale behaviour and make micro-scale interventions."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the paper \"Uncertainty Quantification of Multi-Scale Resilience in Nonlinear Complex Networks using Arbitrary Polynomial Chaos\", what is the primary goal of the authors in developing an arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion method to estimate resilience in large-scale networked systems?\n\n**A)** To identify the probability of a node losing its resilience in a generic networked bi-stable system.\n**B)** To analyze the relationship between topology and dynamics across network scales.\n**C)** To quantify the effect of uncertainty in large-scale networked systems, particularly when uncertainties cascade between connected nodes.\n**D)** To develop analytical tools for understanding macro-scale behavior and making micro-scale interventions.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) To quantify the effect of uncertainty in large-scale networked systems, particularly when uncertainties cascade between connected nodes.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is C) because the paper aims to develop an aPC expansion method to estimate resilience in large-scale networked systems, with a focus on quantifying the effect of uncertainty in these systems.

In addition, EyeTAP has a lower error rate than the dwell-time method in a ribbon-shaped experiment. These characteristics make it applicable for users for whom physical movements are restricted or not possible due to a disability.

Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of mixed uncorrelated and coherent sources is a long existing challenge in array signal processing. Application of compressive sensing to array signal processing has opened up an exciting class of algorithms. The authors investigated the application of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for different scenarios, especially to tackle the case of coherent sources and observed inconsistencies in the results. In this paper, a modified OMP algorithm is proposed to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting maximum variance based criterion using only one snapshot. This criterion relaxes the imposed restricted isometry property (RIP) on the measurement matrix to obtain the sources and hence, reduces the sparsity of the input vector to the local OMP algorithm. Moreover, it also tackles sources irrespective of their coherency. The condition for the weak-1 RIP on decreased sparsity is derived and it is shown that how the algorithm gives better result than the OMP algorithm. With an addition to this, a simple method is also presented to calculate source distance from the reference point in a uniform linear sensor array. Numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** A Novel Sparse recovery based DOA estimation algorithm by relaxing the RIP constraint is proposed to tackle the challenge of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of mixed uncorrelated and coherent sources.
