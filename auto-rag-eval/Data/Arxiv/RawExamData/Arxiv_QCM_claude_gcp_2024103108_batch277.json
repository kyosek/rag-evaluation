In social science research, however, many outcomes of interest are measured on an ordinal scale. This makes the linearity assumption inappropriate because the difference between two ordinal potential outcomes is not well defined. In this paper, I propose a method to draw causal inferences for ordinal outcomes under the DID design. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method utilizes the latent variable framework to handle the non-numeric nature of the outcome, enabling identification and estimation of causal effects based on the assumption on the quantile of the latent continuous variable.

Here we present results from observational programs at two Indian observatories, 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle (HCT) and 1.2 m telescope at the Mount Abu Infrared Observatory (MIRO). Two epochs of imaging and spectroscopy were carried out at the HCT and three epochs of imaging at MIRO. We found CN to be the dominant molecular emission on both epochs, 31/11/2019 and 22/12/2019, at distances of r$_H$ = 2.013 and 2.031 AU respectively. The comet was inferred to be relatively depleted in Carbon bearing molecules on the basis of low $C_2$ and $C_3$ abundances. We find the production rate ratio, Q($C_2$)/Q(CN) = 0.54 $\\pm$ 0.18, pre-perihelion and Q($C_2$)/Q(CN) = 0.34 $\\pm$ 0.12 post-perihelion. This classifies the comet as being moderately depleted in carbon chain molecules. Using the results from spectroscopic observations, we believe the comet to have a chemically heterogeneous surface having variation in abundance of carbon chain molecules. From imaging observations we infer a dust-to-gas ratio similar to carbon chain depleted comets of the Solar system. We also compute the nucleus size to be in the range $0.18\\leq r \\leq 3.1$ Km. Our observations show that 2I/Borisov's behaviour is analogous to that of the Solar system comets."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the observations of comet 2I/Borisov from Indian observatories, which of the following statements is true regarding its chemical composition and behavior?\n\nA) The comet showed high abundances of C2 and C3, indicating it was rich in carbon-bearing molecules.\n\nB) The comet's dust-to-gas ratio was significantly different from that of Solar system comets, suggesting a unique origin.\n\nC) The comet exhibited a chemically homogeneous surface with consistent abundance of carbon chain molecules.\n\nD) The comet was classified as moderately depleted in carbon chain molecules, with CN as the dominant molecular emission.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

The comet was inferred to be relatively depleted in Carbon bearing molecules based on low C2 and C3 abundances. The production rate ratio Q(C2)/Q(CN) values (0.54 \u00b1 0.18 pre-perihelion and 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 post-perihelion) classify the comet as being moderately depleted in carbon chain molecules.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the comet showed low, not high, abundances of C2 and C3.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the dust-to-gas ratio was found to be similar to carbon chain depleted comets of the Solar system, not significantly different.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the comet was believed to have a chemically heterogeneous surface with variation in abundance of carbon chain molecules, not a homogeneous surface."}, "52": {"documentation": {"title": "Hierarchical Point-Edge Interaction Network for Point Cloud Semantic\n  Segmentation", "source": "Li Jiang, Hengshuang Zhao, Shu Liu, Xiaoyong Shen, Chi-Wing Fu, Jiaya\n  Jia", "docs_id": "1909.10469", "section": ["cs.CV"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Hierarchical Point-Edge Interaction Network for Point Cloud Semantic\n  Segmentation.

Robustness of deep learning methods for limited angle tomography is challenged by two major factors: a) due to insufficient training data the network may not generalize well to unseen data; b) deep learning methods are sensitive to noise. Thus, generating reconstructed images directly from a neural network appears inadequate. We propose to constrain the reconstructed images to be consistent with the measured projection data, while the unmeasured information is complemented by learning based methods. For this purpose, a data consistent artifact reduction (DCAR) method is introduced: First, a prior image is generated from an initial limited angle reconstruction via deep learning as a substitute for missing information. Afterwards, a conventional iterative reconstruction algorithm is applied, integrating the data consistency in the measured angular range and the prior information in the missing angular range. This ensures data integrity in the measured area, while inaccuracies incorporated by the deep learning prior lie only in areas where no information is acquired.
