Most of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis up to date are established in the supervised learning paradigm, which usually requires a large set of labeled data collected a priori. In practical applications, however, obtaining accurate labels based on real-time bearing conditions can be far more challenging than simply collecting a huge amount of unlabeled data using various sensors. In this paper, we thus propose a semi-supervised learning approach for bearing anomaly detection using variational autoencoder (VAE) based deep generative models, which allows for effective utilization of dataset when only a small subset of data have labels. Finally, a series of experiments is performed using both the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset and the University of Cincinnati's Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) dataset.

Motivation: Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key step in drug repositioning. In recent years, the accumulation of a large number of genomics and pharmacology data has formed mass drug and target related heterogeneous networks (HNs), which provides new opportunities of developing HN-based computational models to accurately predict DTIs.

HampDTI automatically learns the important meta-paths between drugs and targets from the HN, and generates meta-path graphs. For each meta-path graph, the features learned from drug molecule graphs and target protein sequences serve as the node attributes, and then a node-type specific graph convolutional network (NSGCN) which efficiently considers node type information (drugs or targets) is designed to learn embeddings of drugs and targets. Finally, the embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs are combined to predict novel DTIs.

We apply this concept to the surface array of the Pierre Auger Observatory consisting of a 1.5 km spaced grid of about 1600 water Cherenkov stations. Using Monte Carlo simulations of ultra-high energy showers the LTP functions are derived for energies in the range between 10^{17} and 10^{19} eV and zenith angles up to 65 degs. A parametrization combining a step function with an exponential is found to reproduce them very well in the considered range of energies and zenith angles.

The performance of a cross-sectional currency strategy depends crucially on accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs produced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank algorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable alternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these techniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the extreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the long/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space, and thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in Information Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information embedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query's characteristics to improve ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of both out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the original ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer architecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our selection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.

Now that the Higgs particle has been observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, the next endeavour would be to probe its fundamental properties and to measure its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons with the highest possible accuracy. However, the measurements will be limited by significant theoretical uncertainties that affect the production cross section in the main production channels as well as by experimental systematical errors. Following earlier work, we propose in this paper to consider ratios of Higgs production cross sections times decay branching ratios in which most of the theoretical uncertainties and some systematical errors, such as the ones due to the luminosity measurement and the Higgs decay branching fractions, cancel out. The couplings of the Higgs particle could be then probed in a way that will be mostly limited by the statistical accuracy achievable at the LHC and accuracies at the percent level are foreseen for some of the ratios at the end of the LHC run. At the theoretical level, these ratios are also interesting as they do not involve the ambiguities that affect the Higgs total decay width in new physics scenarios.

Named entity recognition systems perform well on standard datasets comprising English news. But given the paucity of data, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the robustness of systems with respect to recognizing a diverse set of entities. We propose a method for auditing the in-domain robustness of systems, focusing specifically on differences in performance due to the national origin of entities. We create entity-switched datasets, in which named entities in the original texts are replaced by plausible named entities of the same type but of different national origin. We find that state-of-the-art systems' performance vary widely even in-domain: In the same context, entities from certain origins are more reliably recognized than entities from elsewhere. Systems perform best on American and Indian entities, and worst on Vietnamese and Indonesian entities. This auditing approach can facilitate the development of more robust named entity recognition systems, and will allow research in this area to consider fairness criteria that have received heightened attention in other predictive technology work."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose and findings of the entity-switched dataset approach in auditing Named Entity Recognition (NER) models?\n\nA) To evaluate NER models' performance on non-English languages and improve multilingual capabilities.\n\nB) To assess the impact of sentence structure on NER accuracy across different domains.\n\nC) To examine in-domain robustness of NER systems with respect to entities' national origins and identify performance disparities.\n\nD) To compare the effectiveness of different NER architectures on various entity types.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Despite attempts to relax these assumptions in the context of MHD turbulence, the central idea of turbulence generation persists.
