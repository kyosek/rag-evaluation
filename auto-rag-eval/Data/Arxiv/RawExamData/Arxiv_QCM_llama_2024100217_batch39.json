This is because the model successfully reproduces empirical probability and power spectral densities of volatility, but the analysis of burst and inter-burst duration statistics shows that the empirical statistical properties of these variables can be explained by non-linear stochastic differential equations driving volatility in the financial markets.

However, for longer chains, these general claims are no longer valid. This suggests that the relationship between the length of the electron transport chain and the stability of the equilibrium is not straightforward, and that the stability of the equilibrium can depend on the specific length of the chain."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Spelling provides a precise (but sometimes misplaced) phonological\n  target.

Orthography and acoustic variability in second language word learning.

Our results show a robust influence of orthography, with faster response times in both production (picture naming) and recognition (picture mapping) tasks for words learned in the Audio-Ortho condition. Moreover, formant analyses of the picture naming responses show that orthographic input pulls pronunciations of English novel words towards a non-native (French) phonological target. Words learned with their orthographic forms were pronounced more precisely (with smaller Dispersion Scores), but were misplaced in the vowel space (as reflected by smaller Euclidian distances with respect to French vowels). Finally, we found only limited evidence of an effect of talker-based acoustic variability: novel words learned with multiple talkers showed faster responses times in the picture naming task, but only in the Audio-only condition, which suggests that orthographic information may have overwhelmed any advantage of talker-based acoustic variability."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Compare the effects of orthographic and acoustic variability on second language word learning in the context of L1 French participants learning novel L2 English words.\n\nA) The Audio-Ortho condition led to faster response times in picture naming tasks, but words learned with multiple talkers showed faster response times in the Audio-only condition.\n\nB) The Audio-Ortho condition resulted in more precise pronunciations of English novel words, but words learned with multiple talkers showed smaller Euclidean distances with respect to French vowels.\n\nC) The Audio-Ortho condition led to faster response times in picture mapping tasks, but words learned with multiple talkers showed faster response times in the Audio-only condition.\n\nD) The Audio-Ortho condition resulted in smaller Dispersion Scores, but words learned with multiple talkers showed faster response times in the picture naming task.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The Audio-Ortho condition resulted in more precise pronunciations of English novel words, but words learned with multiple talkers showed smaller Euclidean distances with respect to French vowels.\n\nExplanation: This question requires the test-taker to carefully read and analyze the results of the study, specifically the effects of orthographic and acoustic variability on second language word learning.

Such derivations cannot be used, for example, in the context of relativistic quantum field theory. Here we solve this problem by providing a new, general formulation of perturbation theory for calculating the changes in the energy spectrum and wave function of bound states and resonances induced by perturbations to the Hamiltonian. Although our derivation is valid for energy-dependent potentials and is not restricted to inverse free Green functions that are linear in the energy, the expressions obtained for the energy and wave function corrections are compact, practical, and maximally similar to the ones of quantum mechanics.

Time-varying parameter (TVP) models often assume that the TVPs evolve according to a random walk. This assumption, however, might be questionable since it implies that coefficients change smoothly and in an unbounded manner. In this paper, we relax this assumption by proposing a flexible law of motion for the TVPs in large-scale vector autoregressions (VARs). Instead of imposing a restrictive random walk evolution of the latent states, we carefully design hierarchical mixture priors on the coefficients in the state equation. These priors effectively allow for discriminating between periods where coefficients evolve according to a random walk and times where the TVPs are better characterized by a stationary stochastic process. Moreover, this approach is capable of introducing dynamic sparsity by pushing small parameter changes towards zero if necessary. The merits of the model are illustrated by means of two applications.
