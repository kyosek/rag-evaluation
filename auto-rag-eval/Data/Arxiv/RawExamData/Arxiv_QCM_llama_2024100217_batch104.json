Global concern regarding ultrafine particles (UFPs), which are particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 100nm, is increasing. These particles-with more serious health effects than PM less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)-are difficult to measure using the current methods because their characteristics are different from those of other air pollutants. Therefore, a new monitoring system is required to obtain accurate UFPs information, which will raise the financial burden of the government and people. In this study, we estimated the economic value of UFPs information by evaluating the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the UFPs monitoring and reporting system. We used the contingent valuation method (CVM) and the one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice (OOHBDC) spike model. We analyzed how the respondents' socio-economic variables, as well as their cognition level of PM, affected their WTP. Therefore, we collected WTP data of 1,040 Korean respondents through an online survey. The estimated mean WTP for building a UFPs monitoring and reporting system is KRW 6,958.55-7,222.55 (USD 6.22-6.45) per household per year. We found that people satisfied with the current air pollutant information, and generally possessing relatively greater knowledge of UFPs, have higher WTP for a UFPs monitoring and reporting system.

Many studies have aimed at optimizing probe design and statistical analysis to tackle this problem. However, less emphasis has been placed on controlling the noise inherent to the experimental approach. To address this problem, we investigate here a procedure that controls for such experimental variance and combine it with an assessment of probe performance. Two custom arrays were used to evaluate the procedure: one based on 25mer probes from an Affymetrix design and the other based on 60mer probes from an Agilent design. To assess experimental variance, all probes were replicated ten times. To assess probe performance, the probes were calibrated using a dilution series of target molecules and the signal response was fitted to an absorption model. We found that significant variance of the signal could be controlled by averaging across probes and removing probes that are nonresponsive.

We discuss a possible answer to the fundamental question of why nature would actually prefer low-scale supersymmetry, but end up with a supersymmetry scale that is not completely natural. This question is inevitable if we postulate that low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null observation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. As we argue in this paper, superparticles masses in the multi-TeV range can, in fact, be reconciled with the concept of naturalness by means of a cosmological selection effect--a selection effect based on the assumption of an exact discrete R-symmetry that is spontaneously broken by gaugino condensation in a pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In such theories, the dynamical scale of the Yang-Mills gauge interactions is required to be higher than the inflationary Hubble scale, in order to avoid the formation of domain walls. This results in a lower limit on the superparticle masses and leads us to conclude that, according to the idea of naturalness, the most probable range of superparticle masses is potentially located at the multi-TeV, if the inflationary Hubble rate is of O(10^{14}) GeV.

Spatial organization of chromatin plays a critical role in genome regulation. Various types of affinity mediators and enzymes have been attributed to regulate spatial organization of chromatin from a thermodynamics perspective.

Here, we construct a polymer physics model following the mechanistic scheme of Topoisomerase-II, an enzyme resolving topological constraints of chromatin, and investigate its role on interphase chromatin organization. Our computer simulations demonstrate Topoisomerase-II's ability to phase separate chromatin into eu- and heterochromatic regions with a characteristic wall-like organization of the euchromatic regions. Exploiting a mean-field framework, we argue that the ability of the euchromatic regions crossing each other due to enzymatic activity of Topoisomerase-II induces this phase separation.

To meet the challenge to promote a more equitable resource distribution, this work aims at identifying and describing patterns of urban services supply, their accessibility, and household income.
