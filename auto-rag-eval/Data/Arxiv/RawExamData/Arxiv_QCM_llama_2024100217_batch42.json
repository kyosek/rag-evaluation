Financial markets are often driven by latent factors which traders cannot observe. Here, we address an algorithmic trading problem with collections of heterogeneous agents who aim to perform optimal execution or statistical arbitrage, where all agents filter the latent states of the world, and their trading actions have permanent and temporary price impact. This leads to a large stochastic game with heterogeneous agents. We solve the stochastic game by investigating its mean-field game (MFG) limit, with sub-populations of heterogeneous agents, and, using a convex analysis approach, we show that the solution is characterized by a vector-valued forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). We demonstrate that the FBSDE admits a unique solution, obtain it in closed-form, and characterize the optimal behaviour of the agents in the MFG equilibrium.

In this paper we introduce and discuss a general approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for full control of transmitted and reflected plane waves and show that perfect performance can be realized. The method is based on the use of an equivalent impedance matrix model which connects the tangential field components at the two sides on the metasurface. With this approach we are able to understand what physical properties of the metasurface are needed in order to perfectly realize the desired response. Furthermore, we determine the required polarizabilities of the metasurface unit cells and discuss suitable cell structures.

Transit network simulation models are often used for performance and retrospective analysis of urban rail systems, taking advantage of the availability of extensive automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL) data. Important inputs to such models, in addition to origin-destination flows, include passenger path choices and train capacity. Train capacity, which has often been overlooked in the literature, is an important input that exhibits a lot of variabilities. The paper proposes a simulation-based optimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate path choices and train capacity for urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data. The calibration is formulated as an optimization problem with a black-box objective function. Seven algorithms from four branches of SBO solving methods are evaluated. The algorithms are evaluated using an experimental design that includes five scenarios, representing different degrees of path choice randomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system is used as a case study. The data is used to generate synthetic observations used as \"ground truth\". The results show that the response surface methods (particularly Constrained Optimization using Response Surfaces) have consistently good performance under all scenarios.

Typically the data are sparse: only a fraction of a percent of the entries in the design matrix are non-zero. Nevertheless, often the only computationally feasible approach is to perform dimension reduction to obtain a new design matrix with far fewer columns and then work with this compressed data. $b$-bit min-wise hashing (Li and Konig, 2011) is a promising dimension reduction scheme for sparse matrices which produces a set of random features such that regression on the resulting design matrix approximates a kernel regression with the resemblance kernel.

This is a direct application of the rigidity result mentioned in the paper. The other options are incorrect because they do not follow from the given information. Option B is incorrect because the sequence of volumes does not necessarily converge to the volume of the holonomy of $M$. Option C is incorrect because the sequence of representations does not necessarily converge to the holonomy of $M$. Option D is incorrect because the sequence of representations does converge to an ideal point of the character variety, which implies that it converges to the holonomy of $M$."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Engineering mesoscale structures with distinct dynamical implications in\n  networks of delay-coupled delay oscillators", "source": "Anne-Ly Do, Johannes H\\\"ofener and Thilo Gross", "docs_id": "1207.1319", "section": ["nlin.CD", "math.DS"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Engineering mesoscale structures with distinct dynamical implications in\n  networks of delay-coupled delay oscillators. The dynamics of networks of interacting systems depends intricately on the interaction topology. When the dynamics is explored, generally the whole topology has to be considered. However, we show that there are certain mesoscale subgraphs that have precise and distinct consequences for the system-level dynamics. In particular, if meso-scale symmetries are present then eigenvectors of the Jacobian localise on the symmetric subgraph and the corresponding eigenvalues become insensitive to the topology outside the subgraph. Hence, dynamical instabilities associated with these eigenvalues can be analyzed without considering the topology outside the subgraph. While such instabilities are thus generated entirely in small network subgraphs, they generally do not remain confined to the subgraph once the instability sets in and thus have system-level consequences. Here we illustrate the analytical investigation of such instabilities in an ecological meta-population model consisting of a network of delay-coupled delay oscillators."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of networks of delay-coupled delay oscillators, what is the significance of mesoscale symmetries in the system-level dynamics, and how do they impact the analysis of dynamical instabilities?\n\nA) Mesoscale symmetries imply that the system's dynamics are invariant under certain transformations, allowing for the reduction of the network topology to a smaller subgraph for analysis.\n\nB) Mesoscale symmetries are a type of network structure that enhances the stability of the system, making it less susceptible to dynamical instabilities.\n\nC) Mesoscale symmetries are a consequence of the system's eigenvalues becoming insensitive to the topology outside the subgraph, but they do not necessarily impact the analysis of dynamical instabilities.\n\nD) Mesoscale symmetries are a type of feedback loop that can amplify or dampen the system's dynamics, but their presence or absence does not affect the overall stability of the system.\n\nCorrect Answer: A) Mesoscale symmetries imply that the system's dynamics are invariant under certain transformations, allowing for the reduction of the network topology to a smaller subgraph for analysis.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A) because the documentation states that \"if meso-scale symmetries are present then eigenvectors of the Jacobian localise on the symmetric subgraph and the corresponding eigenvalues become insensitive to the topology outside the subgraph.\" This implies that mesoscale symmetries enable the reduction of the network topology to a smaller subgraph for analysis, allowing for a more focused examination of the system's dynamics.
