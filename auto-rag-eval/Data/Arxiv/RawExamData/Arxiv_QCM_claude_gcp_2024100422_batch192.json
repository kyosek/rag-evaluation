Modelling financial time series as a time change of a simpler process has been proposed in various forms over the years. One of such recent approaches is called volatility homogenisation decomposition, and has been designed specifically to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets. The authors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a specific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this procedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time series. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the forecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them non-exhaustive. Second, the results obtained were not completely convincing, with some values falling under 50% guessing rate. Additionally, only nine Australian stocks were being investigated, which further limits the scope of this proof. In this study we propose to find the usefulness of volatility homogenisation by calculating the predictability of the decomposed time series and comparing it to the predictability of the original time series. We are applying information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify predictability, which guarantees the result is not tied to a specific method of prediction, and additionally we base our calculations on a large number of stocks from the Warsaw Stock Exchange."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the main limitation of the original volatility homogenisation decomposition study, as highlighted in the given text?\n\nA) The study only used Australian stocks, limiting its geographical scope.\nB) The forecasting procedure chosen influenced the results, making them non-exhaustive.\nC) The results were not convincing, with some values below the 50% guessing rate.\nD) The study relied on a small sample size of only nine stocks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nWhile all options present limitations mentioned in the text, the main limitation highlighted is option B.

It is well known that highly volatile control laws, while theoretically optimal for certain systems, are undesirable from an engineering perspective, being generally deleterious to the controlled system. In this article we are concerned with the temporal volatility of the control process of the regulator in discrete time Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQRs). Our investigation in this paper unearths a surprising connection between the cost functional which an LQR is tasked with minimizing and the temporal variations of its control laws. We first show that optimally controlling the system always implies high levels of control volatility, i.e., it is impossible to reduce volatility in the optimal control process without sacrificing cost. We also show that, akin to communication systems, every LQR has a $Capacity~Region$ associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of control volatility. This additionally establishes the fact that no admissible control policy can simultaneously achieve low volatility and low cost.

Changing the diffusion coefficient by a factor of 2, leads to maximum age differences of approx. 8-20% depending on the stellar mass.

We present the performance of Multi-gap timing RPCs under irradiation by fully stripped relativistic ions (gamma*beta=2.7, Z=1-6).
