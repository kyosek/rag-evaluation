The common belief about the growing medium of livestreaming is that its value lies in its \"live\" component. In this paper, we leverage data from a large livestreaming platform to examine this belief. We are able to do this as this platform also allows viewers to purchase the recorded version of the livestream. We summarize the value of livestreaming content by estimating how demand responds to price before, on the day of, and after the livestream. We do this by proposing a generalized Orthogonal Random Forest framework. This framework allows us to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional confounders whose relationships with the treatment policy (i.e., price) are complex but partially known. We find significant dynamics in the price elasticity of demand over the temporal distance to the scheduled livestreaming day and after. Specifically, demand gradually becomes less price sensitive over time to the livestreaming day and is inelastic on the livestreaming day. Over the post-livestream period, demand is still sensitive to price, but much less than the pre-livestream period. This indicates that the vlaue of livestreaming persists beyond the live component. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence for the likely mechanisms driving our results. These are quality uncertainty reduction for the patterns pre- and post-livestream and the potential of real-time interaction with the creator on the day of the livestream."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the study on livestreaming markets, which of the following statements best describes the dynamics of price elasticity of demand in relation to the livestreaming day?\n\nA) Demand becomes more price sensitive as it approaches the livestreaming day and remains highly elastic on the day of the livestream.\n\nB) Demand gradually becomes less price sensitive over time leading up to the livestreaming day, is inelastic on the livestreaming day, and becomes highly elastic in the post-livestream period.\n\nC) Demand gradually becomes less price sensitive over time leading up to the livestreaming day, is inelastic on the livestreaming day, and remains sensitive to price post-livestream but less so than in the pre-livestream period.\n\nD) Demand maintains consistent price elasticity throughout the pre-livestream, livestream, and post-livestream periods.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the findings of the study.

Incomplete multi-view clustering is an important technique to deal with real-world incomplete multi-view data. Previous works assume that all views have the same incompleteness, i.e., balanced incompleteness. However, different views often have distinct incompleteness, i.e., unbalanced incompleteness, which results in strong views (low-incompleteness views) and weak views (high-incompleteness views). The unbalanced incompleteness prevents us from directly using the previous methods for clustering. In this paper, inspired by the effective biological evolution theory, we design the novel scheme of view evolution to cluster strong and weak views. Moreover, we propose an Unbalanced Incomplete Multi-view Clustering method (UIMC), which is the first effective method based on view evolution for unbalanced incomplete multi-view clustering. Compared with previous methods, UIMC has two unique advantages: 1) it proposes weighted multi-view subspace clustering to integrate these unbalanced incomplete views, which effectively solves the unbalanced incomplete multi-view problem; 2) it designs the low-rank and robust representation to recover the data, which diminishes the impact of the incompleteness and noises.

The determination of the folding mechanisms of proteins is critical to understand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and Creutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid considerable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale, typically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable challenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing facilities and new techniques must be introduced.

Using an Eulerian nested grid code, we present 3D simulations to determine how stellar wind material evolves within the GC environment. We expand upon work done in the 70's and move a single-mass King-model GC through the Galactic halo medium, stripping a 10^5 Msun GC of its intra-cluster medium but predicting a detectable medium for a 10^6 Msun cluster. We find from new multi-mass King model simulations, the first to incorporate empirical mass-loss formulae, that the single-mass King model underestimates the retention of intra-cluster gas in the cluster.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely studied in the portfolio management task.

In this paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model. Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods. Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021.

Improving productivity among farm microenterprises is important, especially in low-income countries where market imperfections are pervasive and resources are scarce. Relaxing credit constraints can increase the productivity of farmers. Using a field experiment involving microenterprises in Bangladesh, we estimate the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice farmers, and disentangle the total effect into technological change (frontier shift) and technical efficiency changes. We find that relative to the baseline rice output per decimal, access to credit results in, on average, approximately a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency improvement, we find that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in output comes from changes in technology, or frontier shift, while the remaining 3 percent is attributed to improvements in technical efficiency.
