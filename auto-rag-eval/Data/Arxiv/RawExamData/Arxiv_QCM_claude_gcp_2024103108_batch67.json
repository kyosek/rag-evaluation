We present a detailed experimental study of bulk and powder samples of the Heusler shape memory alloy Ni$_2$MnGa, including zero-field static and dynamic $^{55}$Mn NMR experiments, X-ray powder diffraction and magnetization experiments. The NMR spectra give direct access to the sequence of structural phase transitions in this compound, from the high-T austenitic phase down to the low-T martensitic phase. In addition, a detailed investigation of the so-called rf-enhancement factor provides local information for the magnetic stiffness and restoring fields for each separate coordination, structural, crystallographic environment, thus differentiating signals coming from austenitic and martensitic components. The temperature evolution of the NMR spectra and the rf-enhancement factors shows strong dependence on sample preparation. In particular, we find that sample powderization gives rise to a significant portion of martensitic traces inside the high-T austenitic region, and that these traces can be subsequently removed by annealing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the study of Ni\u2082MnGa Heusler alloys, which of the following techniques was NOT mentioned as being used to investigate the structural and magnetic properties?\n\nA) Zero-field static and dynamic \u2075\u2075Mn NMR experiments\nB) X-ray powder diffraction\nC) Magnetization experiments\nD) Neutron scattering\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The passage mentions three main experimental techniques used to study the Ni\u2082MnGa Heusler alloys: zero-field static and dynamic \u2075\u2075Mn NMR experiments, X-ray powder diffraction, and magnetization experiments.

Deep learning models, such as the fully convolutional network (FCN), have been widely used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Two approaches are widely used in the literature to fuse multiple modalities in the segmentation networks: early-fusion (which stacks multiple modalities as different input channels) and late-fusion (which fuses the segmentation results from different modalities at the very end). These fusion methods easily suffer from the cross-modal interference caused by the input modalities which have wide variations.

In contrast, the proposed Joint Source-Channel (JSC) coding approach using Type-Based Multiple Access (TBMA) allows the base station to directly detect the events' values without first performing individual decoding for each sensor.

The performance of on-chip communication in the state-of-the-art multi-core processors that use the traditional electron-ic NoCs has already become severely energy-constrained. To that end, emerging photonic NoCs (PNoC) are seen as a po-tential solution to improve the energy-efficiency (performance per watt) of on-chip communication. However, existing PNoC designs cannot realize their full potential due to their exces-sive laser power consumption. Prior works that attempt to improve laser power efficiency in PNoCs do not consider all key factors that affect the laser power requirement of PNoCs. Therefore, they cannot yield the desired balance between the reduction in laser power, achieved performance and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. In this paper, we present PROTEUS framework that employs rule-based self-adaptation in PNoCs. Our approach not only reduces the laser power consumption, but also minimizes the average packet latency by opportunis-tically increasing the communication data rate in PNoCs, and thus, yields the desired balance between the laser power re-duction, performance, and energy-efficiency in PNoCs.
