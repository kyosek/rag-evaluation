The amount and evolution of lurkers may strongly affect an online social environment, therefore understanding the lurking dynamics and identifying strategies to curb this trend are relevant problems.

The pro-cancer view of mutations is however incomplete, and several studies show that mutational load can reduce tumor fitness. Given its negative effect, genetic load should make tumors more sensitive to anticancer drugs. Here, we test this hypothesis across all major types of cancer from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, which provides genetic and expression data of 496 cell lines together with their response to 24 common anticancer drugs. We found that the efficacy of 9 out of 24 drugs showed significant association with genetic load in a pan-cancer analysis. The associations for some tissue-drug combinations were remarkably strong, with genetic load explaining up to 83% of the variance in the drug response. Overall, the role of genetic load depended on both the drug and the tissue type with 10 tissues being particularly vulnerable to genetic load. We also identified changes in gene expression associated with increased genetic load, which included cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA damage and apoptosis. Our results show that genetic load is an important component of tumor fitness and can predict drug sensitivity.

The Kondo effect, an eminent manifestation of many-body physics in condensed matter, is traditionally explained as exchange scattering of conduction electrons on a spinful impurity in a metal. The resulting screening of the impurity's local moment by the electron Fermi sea is characterized by a Kondo temperature $T_K$, below which the system enters a non-perturbative strongly-coupled regime. In recent years, this effect has found its realizations beyond the bulk-metal paradigm in many other itinerant-electron systems, such as quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures and in nanomaterials, quantum point contacts, and graphene.

Option D is incorrect because ferromagnetic ordering is mentioned as a separate phenomenon, not directly linked to the interaction-driven phase transition.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the interplay between strong correlations and fragile topology, requiring application of knowledge about phase transitions in correlated systems and the defining characteristics of fragile topological insulators."}, "28": {"documentation": {"title": "Response of solar irradiance to sunspot area variations", "source": "T.

One of the important open questions in solar irradiance studies is whether long-term variability (i.e. on timescales of years and beyond) can be reconstructed by means of models that describe short-term variability (i.e. days) using solar proxies as inputs. Preminger and Walton (2005, GRL, 32, 14109) showed that the relationship between spectral solar irradiance and proxies of magnetic-flux emergence, such as the daily sunspot area, can be described in the framework of linear system theory by means of the impulse response. We significantly refine that empirical model by removing spurious solar-rotational effects and by including an additional term that captures long-term variations. Our results show that long-term variability cannot be reconstructed from the short-term response of the spectral irradiance, which cautions the extension of solar proxy models to these timescales.

Fuzzy logic was introduced by Zadeh in 1965. Since then, the importance of fuzzy logic has come increasingly to the present.There are many applications of fuzzy logic in the field of science and engineering, e.g. population dynamics (Barros), chaos control (Feng,Fradkov), computer programming (Giles), nonlinear dynamical systems (Hong), etc. The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set, as a generalization of fuzzy logic, was introduced by Atanassov in 1986. Quite recently Park has introduced the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy metric space, and Saadati and Park studied the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy normed space. Intuitionistic fuzzy analogues of many concept in classical analysis was studied by many authors (Mursaleen, Rsaadati, Jebril, Dinda, etc.). The concept of statistical convergence was introduced by Fast. Mursaleen defined {\\lambda}-statistical convergence in Muhammed. Also the concept of statistical convergence was studied in intuitionistic fuzzy normed space in Karakus..Quite recently, Karakaya et al. defined and studied statistical convergence of function sequences in intuitionistic fuzzy normed spaces.

We find two especially successful methods for classifying causal sets and we computationally test them for all causal sets of up to $9$ elements. One of the spectral geometric methods that we study involves holding a given causal set fixed and collecting a growing set of its geometric invariants such as spectra (including the spectra of the commutator of certain operators). The second method involves obtaining a limited set of geometric invariants for a given causal set while also collecting these geometric invariants for small `perturbations' of the causal set, a novel method that may also be useful in other areas of spectral geometry.

The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that the method of obtaining geometric invariants for a given causal set and its small 'perturbations' fully resolves the causal sets considered (up to 9 elements). \n\nOption A is a distractor based on the fact that spectra of operators derived from the causal matrix were mentioned as having considerable but not complete power to distinguish causal sets.

It has been hypothesized that an increase in bubble lifetime results from a decrease in surface tension due to added surfactants.
