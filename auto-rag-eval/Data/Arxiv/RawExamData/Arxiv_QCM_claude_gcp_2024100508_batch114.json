We consider a basic model of multi-period trading, which can be used to evaluate the performance of a trading strategy. We describe a framework for single-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by solving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk, transaction cost and holding cost such as the borrowing cost for shorting assets. We then describe a multi-period version of the trading method, where optimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one executed, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades are chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period methods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe the single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a clear description of the development and the approximations made. In this paper we do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm, the predictions or forecasts of future quantities.

We introduce a minimal agent-based model to qualitatively conceptualize the allocation of limited wealth among more abundant opportunities.

We develop a Hilbert space framework for a number of general multi-scale problems from dynamics. The aim is to identify a spectral theory for a class of systems based on iterations of a non-invertible endomorphism. We are motivated by the more familiar approach to wavelet theory which starts with the two-to-one endomorphism $r: z \\mapsto z^2$ in the one-torus $\\bt$, a wavelet filter, and an associated transfer operator. This leads to a scaling function and a corresponding closed subspace $V_0$ in the Hilbert space $L^2(\\br)$. Using the dyadic scaling on the line $\\br$, one has a nested family of closed subspaces $V_n$, $n \\in \\bz$, with trivial intersection, and with dense union in $L^2(\\br)$. More generally, we achieve the same outcome, but in different Hilbert spaces, for a class of non-linear problems. In fact, we see that the geometry of scales of subspaces in Hilbert space is ubiquitous in the analysis of multiscale problems, e.g., martingales, complex iteration dynamical systems, graph-iterated function systems of affine type, and subshifts in symbolic dynamics. We develop a general framework for these examples which starts with a fixed endomorphism $r$ (i.e., generalizing $r(z) = z^2$) in a compact metric space $X$.

Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems.

The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom by atom - with complete control over all degrees of freedom.

It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement.

This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of systemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations.

Autonomous driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades. In autonomous driving systems, identifying a precise dynamical model for motion control is nontrivial due to the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. Recent efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building vehicle dynamical models, but the generalization ability and interpretability of existing methods still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a data-driven vehicle modeling approach based on deep neural networks with an interpretable Koopman operator. The main advantage of using the Koopman operator is to represent the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. In the proposed approach, a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm is presented to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. Furthermore, a data-driven model predictive controller with the learned Koopman model is designed for path tracking control of autonomous vehicles. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim environment show that our approach exhibit a high modeling precision at a wide operating range and outperforms previously developed methods in terms of modeling performance.
