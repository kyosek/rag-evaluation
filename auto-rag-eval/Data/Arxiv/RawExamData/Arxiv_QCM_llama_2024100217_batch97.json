Long iterative training processes for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly required to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. Importance sampling approaches might play a key role in budgeted training regimes, i.e. when limiting the number of training iterations. These approaches aim at dynamically estimating the importance of each sample to focus on the most relevant and speed up convergence. This work explores this paradigm and how a budget constraint interacts with importance sampling approaches and data augmentation techniques. We show that under budget restrictions, importance sampling approaches do not provide a consistent improvement over uniform sampling. We suggest that, given a specific budget, the best course of action is to disregard the importance and introduce adequate data augmentation; e.g. when reducing the budget to a 30% in CIFAR-10/100, RICAP data augmentation maintains accuracy, while importance sampling does not.

This implies that the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and are dominated by a few very large returns. We discuss both the endogenous and exogenous origins of these extreme events."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The authors of the study on power law scaling and \"Dragon-Kings\" in distributions of intraday financial drawdowns suggest that the extreme tail of the drawdown/drawup distributions deviates from the power law due to the presence of large outliers, referred to as \"Dragon-Kings\". What is the primary characteristic of these \"Dragon-Kings\" that distinguishes them from the rest of the drawdown/drawup distributions?\n\nA) They are characterized by significant transient dependence between returns.\nB) They are dominated by a few very large returns that occur fast.\nC) They are the result of endogenous factors, such as market inefficiencies.\nD) They are the primary drivers of the power law scaling in the distribution of returns.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) They are dominated by a few very large returns that occur fast.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) They are dominated by a few very large returns that occur fast. According to the study, the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and are dominated by a few very large returns. This is in contrast to the power law scaling in the distribution of returns, which is characterized by a relationship between size and speed, but not between size and duration. The presence of \"Dragon-Kings\" is a key factor in this phenomenon, and option B accurately reflects this finding."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Reference Class Selection in Similarity-Based Forecasting of Sales\n  Growth", "source": "Etienne Theising, Dominik Wied, Daniel Ziggel", "docs_id": "2107.11133", "section": ["q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Reference Class Selection in Similarity-Based Forecasting of Sales\n  Growth. This paper proposes a method to find appropriate outside views for sales forecasts of analysts. The idea is to find reference classes, i.e. peer groups, for each analyzed company separately. Hence, additional companies are considered that share similarities to the firm of interest with respect to a specific predictor. The classes are regarded to be optimal if the forecasted sales distributions match the actual distributions as closely as possible. The forecast quality is measured by applying goodness-of-fit tests on the estimated probability integral transformations and by comparing the predicted quantiles. The method is applied on a data set consisting of 21,808 US firms over the time period 1950 - 2019, which is also descriptively analyzed. It appears that in particular the past operating margins are good predictors for the distribution of future sales.

The popularity of penalized regression in high-dimensional data analysis has led to a demand for new inferential tools for these models. False discovery rate control is widely used in high-dimensional hypothesis testing, but has only recently been considered in the context of penalized regression. Almost all of this work, however, has focused on lasso-penalized linear regression. In this paper, we derive a general method for controlling the marginal false discovery rate that can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, such as logistic regression and Cox regression. Our approach is fast, flexible and can be used with a variety of penalty functions including lasso, elastic net, MCP, and MNet. We derive theoretical results under which the proposed method is valid, and use simulation studies to demonstrate that the approach is reasonably robust, albeit slightly conservative, when these assumptions are violated. Despite being conservative, we show that our method often offers more power to select causally important features than existing approaches. Finally, the practical utility of the method is demonstrated on gene expression data sets with binary and time-to-event outcomes."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary contribution of the proposed method for controlling the marginal false discovery rate in likelihood-based penalized regression models, and how does it differ from existing approaches?\n\nA) The method is based on a new penalty function that is specifically designed for high-dimensional data analysis, and it offers more power to select causally important features than existing approaches.\n\nB) The method is a generalization of the existing false discovery rate control methods for lasso-penalized linear regression, and it can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, including logistic regression and Cox regression.\n\nC) The method is based on a novel theoretical framework that accounts for the non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable, and it provides a more conservative estimate of the false discovery rate than existing approaches.\n\nD) The method is a simulation-based approach that uses a large number of simulations to estimate the false discovery rate, and it is particularly useful for large-scale datasets with many features.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The method is a generalization of the existing false discovery rate control methods for lasso-penalized linear regression, and it can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, including logistic regression and Cox regression.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the paper states that the proposed method is a generalization of existing false discovery rate control methods for lasso-penalized linear regression, and it can be applied to any penalized likelihood-based model, including logistic regression and Cox regression.
