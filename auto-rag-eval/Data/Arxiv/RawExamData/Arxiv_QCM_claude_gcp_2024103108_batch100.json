Over the past decades, researchers have been pushing the limits of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Although DRL has attracted substantial interest from practitioners, many are blocked by having to search through a plethora of available methodologies that are seemingly alike, while others are still building RL agents from scratch based on classical theories. To address the aforementioned gaps in adopting the latest DRL methods, I am particularly interested in testing out if any of the recent technology developed by the leads in the field can be readily applied to a class of optimal trading problems. Unsurprisingly, many prominent breakthroughs in DRL are investigated and tested on strategic games: from AlphaGo to AlphaStar and at about the same time, OpenAI Five. Thus, in this writing, I want to show precisely how to use a DRL library that is initially built for games in a fundamental trading problem; mean reversion.

The documentation states that \"The final topological state is found to be that of a marginally linked network structure in which the fraction of mini-circles linked to the largest connected component approaches unity as R/A decreases.\" This indicates that the ratio between the rate of removal (R) and reattachment (A) of mini-circles is the primary factor determining the final topological state.

Here we address this problem by using an ab initio microscopic model of living cells, whose fitness is derived directly from their genomes using a biophysically realistic model of protein folding and interactions in the cytoplasm. The model organisms contain replication controlling genes (DCGs) and genes modeling the mismatch repair (MMR) complexes. We find that adaptation occurs through the transient fixation of a mutator phenotype, regardless of particular perturbations in the fitness landscape. The microscopic pathway of adaptation follows a well-defined set of events: stochastic switching to the mutator phenotype first, then mutation in the MMR complex that hitchhikes with a beneficial mutation in the DCGs, and finally a compensating mutation in the MMR complex returning the population to a non-mutator phenotype.

We observe that at low pump-pulse energies the switching of the cavity resonance is governed by the instantaneous electronic Kerr effect and is achieved within 300 fs. At high pump-pulse energies the index change induced by free carriers generated in the GaAs start to compete with the electronic Kerr effect and reduce the resonance frequency shift.

According to the documentation, at low pump-pulse energies, the switching of the cavity resonance is governed by the instantaneous electronic Kerr effect.
