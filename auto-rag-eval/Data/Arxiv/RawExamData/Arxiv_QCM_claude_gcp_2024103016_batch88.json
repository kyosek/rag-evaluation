Recently [Gr\\\"uning et al. Nano Lett. {\\bf 8}, 2820 (2009)], we have identified that such Hamiltonians are usually pseudo-Hermitian.

Over the last decades, images have become an important source of information in many domains, thus their high quality has become necessary to acquire better information. One of the important issues that arise is image denoising, which means recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples. This interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory, which is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then the original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much less, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling theories. A strong factor in Compressive Sensing (CS) theory to achieve the sparsest solution and the noise removal from the corrupted image is the selection of the basis dictionary. In this paper, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and moment transform (Tchebichef, Krawtchouk) are compared in order to achieve image denoising of Gaussian additive white noise based on compressive sensing and sparse approximation theory. The experimental results revealed that the basis dictionaries constructed by the moment transform perform competitively to the traditional DCT.

This article analyzes the procedure for the initial employment of research assistants in Turkish universities to see if it complies with the rules and regulations. We manually collected 2409 applicant data from 53 Turkish universities to see if applicants are ranked according to the rules suggested by the Higher Education Council of Turkey. The rulebook states that applicants should be ranked according to a final score based on the weighted average of their GPA, graduate examination score, academic examination score, and foreign language skills score. Thus, the research assistant selection is supposed to be a fair process where each applicant is evaluated based on objective metrics. However, our analysis of data suggests that the final score of the applicants is almost entirely based on the highly subjective academic examination conducted by the hiring institution. Thus, the applicants GPA, standardized graduate examination score, standardized foreign language score are irrelevant in the selection process, making it a very unfair process based on favoritism."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the study on research assistantship selection in Turkish academia, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the findings regarding the fairness of the selection process?\n\nA) The selection process adheres strictly to the Higher Education Council of Turkey's rulebook, ensuring a fair evaluation based on objective metrics.\n\nB) The final score of applicants is primarily determined by their GPA and standardized graduate examination scores, as intended by the regulations.\n\nD) Foreign language skills scores play a disproportionately large role in the selection process, overshadowing other criteria.\n\nD) The selection process is largely influenced by the subjective academic examination conducted by the hiring institution, rendering other objective criteria nearly irrelevant.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The study found that despite the Higher Education Council of Turkey's rulebook stipulating a weighted average of various objective criteria (GPA, graduate examination score, academic examination score, and foreign language skills score), the actual selection process is dominated by the highly subjective academic examination conducted by the hiring institution. This makes the process unfair and potentially based on favoritism, as the objective metrics like GPA, standardized graduate examination scores, and foreign language scores become practically irrelevant in the final selection. The research concludes that this deviation from the intended fair process allows for a system where favoritism can significantly influence the outcomes."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "A two-component generalization of the reduced Ostrovsky equation and its\n  integrable semi-discrete analogue", "source": "Bao-Feng Feng, Ken-ichi Maruno and Yasuhiro Ohta", "docs_id": "1609.00326", "section": ["nlin.SI", "math-ph", "math.MP"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "A two-component generalization of the reduced Ostrovsky equation and its\n  integrable semi-discrete analogue.

There are two schools of thought regarding market impact modeling. On the one hand, seminal papers by Almgren and Chriss introduced a decomposition between a permanent market impact and a temporary (or instantaneous) market impact. This decomposition is used by most practitioners in execution models. On the other hand, recent research advocates for the use of a new modeling framework that goes down to the resilient dynamics of order books: transient market impact. One of the main criticisms against permanent market impact is that it has to be linear to avoid dynamic arbitrage. This important discovery made by Huberman and Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear permanent market impact is at odds with reality. In this paper, we reconsider the point made by Gatheral using a simple model for market impact and show that permanent market impact can be nonlinear.

Many colour maps provided by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range.

Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified.

The inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of organisms is a problem of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. The abundance of DNA sequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to significant challenges in the inference of these phylogenetic relationships. Among these challenges is the inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of species based on sequence information from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. It is widely accepted that each individual gene has its own phylogeny, which may not agree with the species tree. Many possible causes of this gene tree incongruence are known. The best studied is incomplete lineage sorting, which is commonly modeled by the coalescent process. Numerous methods based on the coalescent process have been proposed for estimation of the phylogenetic species tree given DNA sequence data. However, use of these methods assumes that the phylogenetic species tree can be identified from DNA sequence data at the leaves of the tree, although this has not been formally established. We prove that the unrooted topology of the n-leaf phylogenetic species tree is generically identifiable given observed data at the leaves of the tree that are assumed to have arisen from the coalescent process under a time-reversible substitution process with the possibility of site-specific rate variation modeled by the discrete gamma distribution and a proportion of invariable sites."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the main contribution of the research discussed in the given text?\n\nA) It proves that the rooted topology of the phylogenetic species tree is identifiable under the coalescent model with time-reversible substitution processes.\n\nB) It demonstrates that gene tree incongruence can be completely eliminated using the coalescent process model.\n\nC) It establishes that the unrooted topology of the n-leaf phylogenetic species tree is generically identifiable under specific conditions of the coalescent process and substitution model.\n\nD) It shows that site-specific rate variation and invariable sites have no impact on the identifiability of species tree topology under the coalescent model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.
