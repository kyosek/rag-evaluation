The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is the central hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is scheduled to undergo a major upgrade, in 2022, for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The ATLAS upgrade program for high luminosity is split into three phases: Phase-0 occurred during $2013-2014$ and prepared the LHC for Run 2; Phase-I, foreseen for 2019, will prepare the LHC for Run 3, whereafter the peak luminosity reaches $2-3 \\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{2}s^{-1}$; finally, Phase-II, which is foreseen for 2024, will prepare the collider for the HL-LHC operation ($5-7 \\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{2}s^{-1}$). The TileCal main activities for Phase-0 were the installation of the new low voltage power supplies and the activation of the TileCal third layer signal for assisting the muon trigger at $1.0<|\\eta|<1.3$ (TileMuon Project). In Phase-II, a major upgrade in the TileCal readout electronics is planned.

Hence, mean-field models (e.g. pairwise) focusing on describing the evolution of some summary statistics from the exact model gained a lot of traction over the last few decades.

In this paper, we are concerned with the valuation of Guaranteed Annuity Options (GAOs) under the most generalised modelling framework where both interest and mortality rates are stochastic and correlated. Pricing these type of options in the correlated environment is a challenging task and no closed form solution exists in the literature. We employ the use of doubly stochastic stopping times to incorporate the randomness about the time of death and employ a suitable change of measure to facilitate the valuation of survival benefit, there by adapting the payoff of the GAO in terms of the payoff of a basket call option. We derive general price bounds for GAOs by utilizing a conditioning approach for the lower bound and arithmetic-geometric mean inequality for the upper bound. The theory is then applied to affine models to present some very interesting formulae for the bounds under the affine set up. Numerical examples are furnished and benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the price of a GAO for a variety of affine processes governing the evolution of mortality and the interest rate."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary challenge in pricing Guaranteed Annuity Options (GAOs) under a stochastic and correlated interest and mortality rate environment, and how do the authors address this challenge in their paper?\n\nA) The authors argue that the stochastic and correlated interest and mortality rates create a complex and non-linear payoff function, making it difficult to derive a closed-form solution.

Decision-theoretic planning is a popular approach to sequential decision making problems, because it treats uncertainty in sensing and acting in a principled way. In single-agent frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs, planning can be carried out by resorting to Q-value functions: an optimal Q-value function Q* is computed in a recursive manner by dynamic programming, and then an optimal policy is extracted from Q*. In this paper we study whether similar Q-value functions can be defined for decentralized POMDP models (Dec-POMDPs), and how policies can be extracted from such value functions. We define two forms of the optimal Q-value function for Dec-POMDPs: one that gives a normative description as the Q-value function of an optimal pure joint policy and another one that is sequentially rational and thus gives a recipe for computation. This computation, however, is infeasible for all but the smallest problems. Therefore, we analyze various approximate Q-value functions that allow for efficient computation.

Solid state single photon sources with Fourier Transform (FT) limited lines are among the most crucial constituents of photonic quantum technologies and have been accordingly the focus of intensive research over the last several decades. However, so far, solid state systems have only exhibited FT limited lines at cryogenic temperatures due to strong interactions with the thermal bath of lattice phonons. In this work, we report a solid state source that exhibits FT limited lines measured in photo luminescence excitation (sub 100 MHz linewidths) from 3K-300K. The studied source is a color center in the two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and we propose that the center's decoupling from phonons is a fundamental consequence of material's low dimensionality. While the center's luminescence lines exhibit spectral diffusion, we identify the likely source of the dffusion and propose to mitigate it via dynamic spectral tuning. The discovery of FT-limited lines at room temperature, which once the spectral diffusion is controlled, will also yield FT-limited emission.
