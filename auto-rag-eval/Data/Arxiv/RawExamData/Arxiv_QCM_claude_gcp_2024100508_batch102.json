Slow and dense granular flows often exhibit narrow shear bands, making them ill-suited for a continuum description. However, smooth granular flows have been shown to occur in specific geometries such as linear shear in the absence of gravity, slow inclined plane flows and, recently, flows in split-bottom Couette geometries. The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable to a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding constitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We propose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including rate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the constitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in the highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with the simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a constant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be inconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the effective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the shear zone localizes. We suggest that a subtle dependence of the effective-friction coefficient on the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force is crucial for the understanding of slow granular flows."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of slow granular flows, which of the following statements is correct regarding the constitutive assumption of a constant effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses)?\n\nA) It is consistent with all observed granular flow geometries, including split-bottom Couette flows.\n\nB) It is inconsistent with linear shear and inclined plane flows, but consistent with split-bottom geometries.\n\nC) It is consistent with highly symmetric flows like linear shear and inclined plane flows, but inconsistent with split-bottom geometries.\n\nD) It is inconsistent with all observed granular flow geometries and must be replaced with a more complex model in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the limitations of the simple constitutive assumption of a constant effective-friction coefficient in different granular flow geometries.

We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true quantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals.

Deep learning models, such as the fully convolutional network (FCN), have been widely used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Two approaches are widely used in the literature to fuse multiple modalities in the segmentation networks: early-fusion (which stacks multiple modalities as different input channels) and late-fusion (which fuses the segmentation results from different modalities at the very end). These fusion methods easily suffer from the cross-modal interference caused by the input modalities which have wide variations. To address the problem, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely OctopusNet, to better leverage and fuse the information contained in multi-modalities. The proposed framework employs a separate encoder for each modality for feature extraction and exploits a hyper-fusion decoder to fuse the extracted features while avoiding feature explosion.

Many models of market dynamics make use of the idea of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for economic markets the system converges to a very unequal \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the wide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here we present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation but also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of interacting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated by the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is changed at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of this poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory tool for wealth redistribution.

Recently, deep learning-based perception methods have addressed multiple degrading effects to reflect real-world bad weather cases but have shown limited success due to 1) high computational costs for deployment on mobile devices and 2) poor relevance between image enhancement and visual perception in terms of the model ability.

Resilience characterizes a system's ability to retain its original function when perturbations happen. In the past years our attention mainly focused on small-scale resilience, yet our understanding of resilience in large-scale network considering interactions between components is limited. Even though, recent research in macro and micro resilience pattern has developed analytical tools to analyze the relationship between topology and dynamics across network scales. The effect of uncertainty in a large-scale networked system is not clear, especially when uncertainties cascade between connected nodes. In order to quantify resilience uncertainty across the network resolutions (macro to micro),an arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion method is developed in this paper to estimate the resilience subject to parameter uncertainties with arbitrary distributions. For the first time and of particular importance, is our ability to identify the probability of a node in losing its resilience and how the different model parameters contribute to this risk.

Importantly, it allows for the identification of the probability of a node losing its resilience and how different model parameters contribute to this risk. This capability goes beyond simple topology-dynamics relationships or macro-scale patterns, and it doesn't claim to provide exact resilience values for all scenarios.

Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of mixed uncorrelated and coherent sources is a long existing challenge in array signal processing. Application of compressive sensing to array signal processing has opened up an exciting class of algorithms. The authors investigated the application of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for different scenarios, especially to tackle the case of coherent sources and observed inconsistencies in the results. In this paper, a modified OMP algorithm is proposed to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting maximum variance based criterion using only one snapshot. This criterion relaxes the imposed restricted isometry property (RIP) on the measurement matrix to obtain the sources and hence, reduces the sparsity of the input vector to the local OMP algorithm. Moreover, it also tackles sources irrespective of their coherency. The condition for the weak-1 RIP on decreased sparsity is derived and it is shown that how the algorithm gives better result than the OMP algorithm.
