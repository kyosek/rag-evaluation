Model learning (a.k.a. active automata learning) is a highly effective technique for obtaining black-box finite state models of software components. Thus far, generalisation to infinite state systems with inputs/outputs that carry data parameters has been challenging. Existing model learning tools for infinite state systems face scalability problems and can only be applied to restricted classes of systems (register automata with equality/inequality). In this article, we show how we can boost the performance of model learning techniques by extracting the constraints on input and output parameters from a run, and making this grey-box information available to the learner. More specifically, we provide new implementations of the tree oracle and equivalence oracle from RALib, which use the derived constraints. We extract the constraints from runs of Python programs using an existing tainting library for Python, and compare our grey-box version of RALib with the existing black-box version on several benchmarks, including some data structures from Python's standard library. Our proof-of-principle implementation results in almost two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of numbers of inputs sent to the software system. Our approach, which can be generalised to richer model classes, also enables RALib to learn models that are out of reach of black-box techniques, such as combination locks."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about grey-box learning of register automata, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is developing a model learning system for a complex web application that processes user transactions.

This solution directly addresses the challenges mentioned in the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. Scalability: The documentation states that existing model learning tools for infinite state systems face scalability problems. By using grey-box learning and extracting constraints from runs, the performance of model learning techniques can be significantly improved, potentially by \"almost two orders of magnitude\" in terms of inputs sent to the system.\n\n2.

Exception handling is a programming construct de- signed to handle the occurrence of anomalous or exceptional conditions (that changes the normal flow of program execution).

Silently catching and ignoring exceptions without any logging or proper handling is a serious code smell that Parichayana would likely detect. This practice can hide errors, make debugging difficult, and potentially lead to system instability.\n\nOption A describes a generally acceptable practice of catching, logging, and re-throwing exceptions, which provides visibility into errors while allowing them to propagate.\n\nOption C presents a valid use of custom exceptions, which can enhance error handling and provide more context, rather than being an anti-pattern.\n\nOption D showcases good practice in resource management, ensuring cleanup occurs regardless of exceptions, which is not an anti-pattern but a recommended approach.\n\nThe question requires analysis and application of exception handling concepts, integration of multiple ideas from the documentation (anti-patterns, code smells, and the purpose of Parichayana), and applies these to a real-world scenario of improving code quality in a large-scale project.

In this contribution we present the first formulation of a heterogeneous multiscale method for an incompressible immiscible two-phase flow system with degenerate permeabilities.

We do not specify the discretization of the derived macroscopic equation, but we give two examples of possible realizations, suggesting a finite element solver for the fine scale and a vertex centered finite volume method for the effective coarse scale equations. Assuming periodicity, we show that the method is equivalent to a discretization of the homogenized equation.

Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself.

Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that allow for representation of reticulate evolution. Recently, a space of unrooted phylogenetic networks was introduced, where such a network is a connected graph in which every vertex has degree 1 or 3 and whose leaf-set is a fixed set $X$ of taxa. This space, denoted $\\mathcal{N}(X)$, is defined in terms of two operations on networks -- the nearest neighbor interchange and triangle operations -- which can be used to transform any network with leaf set $X$ into any other network with that leaf set. In particular, it gives rise to a metric $d$ on $\\mathcal N(X)$ which is given by the smallest number of operations required to transform one network in $\\mathcal N(X)$ into another in $\\mathcal N(X)$. The metric generalizes the well-known NNI-metric on phylogenetic trees which has been intensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we derive a bound for the metric $d$ as well as a related metric $d_{N\\!N\\!I}$ which arises when restricting $d$ to the subset of $\\mathcal{N}(X)$ consisting of all networks with $2(|X|-1+i)$ vertices, $i \\ge 1$. We also introduce two new metrics on networks -- the SPR and TBR metrics -- which generalize the metrics on phylogenetic trees with the same name and give bounds for these new metrics. We expect our results to eventually have applications to the development and understanding of network search algorithms."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about phylogenetic network space metrics, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the evolutionary relationships between a set of species X using phylogenetic networks.

Wireless networking is becoming an increasingly important and popular way of providing global information access to users on the move. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust handoff algorithms, which allow a mobile node to roam among heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, the authors devise a scheme, A Novel Adaptive Channel Allocation Scheme (ACAS) where the number of guard channel(s) is adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in the past certain period of time. The handoff blocking rate is controlled under the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized. The performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes.

This makes it particularly effective in scenarios with fluctuating handoff rates, as described in option C.\n\nOption A primarily focuses on new call requests rather than handoffs, which is not the main strength of ACAS.

For the ABB systems, with help of the bilinear approach and recasting the multi-soliton solutions of the usual Boussinesq equation to an equivalent novel form, the multi-soliton solutions with even numbers and the head on interactions are obtained. However, the multi-soliton solutions with odd numbers and the multi-soliton solutions with even numbers but with pursuant interactions are prohibited.

This paper studies the asymptotic convergence of computed dynamic models when the shock is unbounded. Most dynamic economic models lack a closed-form solution. As such, approximate solutions by numerical methods are utilized. Since the researcher cannot directly evaluate the exact policy function and the associated exact likelihood, it is imperative that the approximate likelihood asymptotically converges -- as well as to know the conditions of convergence -- to the exact likelihood, in order to justify and validate its usage. In this regard, Fernandez-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramirez, and Santos (2006) show convergence of the likelihood, when the shock has compact support. However, compact support implies that the shock is bounded, which is not an assumption met in most dynamic economic models, e.g., with normally distributed shocks. This paper provides theoretical justification for most dynamic models used in the literature by showing the conditions for convergence of the approximate invariant measure obtained from numerical simulations to the exact invariant measure, thus providing the conditions for convergence of the likelihood."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An economist is developing a dynamic model to analyze business cycle fluctuations with normally distributed shocks.
