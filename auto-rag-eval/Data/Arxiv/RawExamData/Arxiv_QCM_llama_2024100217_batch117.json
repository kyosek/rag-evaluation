A simple symmetry analysis of in-plane and out-of-plane transport in a family of high temperature superconductors is presented. It is shown that generalized scaling relations exist between the low frequency electronic Raman response and the low frequency in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities in both the normal and superconducting states of the cuprates. Specifically, for both the normal and superconducting state, the temperature dependence of the low frequency $B_{1g}$ Raman slope scales with the $c-$axis conductivity, while the $B_{2g}$ Raman slope scales with the in-plane conductivity. Comparison with experiments in the normal state of Bi-2212 and Y-123 imply that the nodal transport is largely doping independent and metallic, while transport near the BZ axes is governed by a quantum critical point near doping $p\\sim 0.22$ holes per CuO$_{2}$ plaquette. Important differences for La-214 are discussed. It is also shown that the $c-$ axis conductivity rise for $T\\ll T_{c}$ is a consequence of partial conservation of in-plane momentum for out-of-plane transport."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** Analyze the relationship between the low-frequency electronic Raman response and the low-frequency in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities in high-Tc superconductors, as presented in the paper \"Optical symmetries and anisotropic transport in high-Tc superconductors\".

In this work, we demonstrate that non-linearity may lead to a spin-to-charge conversion efficiency larger than 10 times the spin polarization of the tunnel barrier when the latter is under bias of a few mV.

Cell migration and mechanics are tightly regulated by the integrated activities of the various cytoskeletal networks. In cancer cells, cytoskeletal modulations have been implicated in the loss of tissue integrity, and acquisition of an invasive phenotype. In epithelial cancers, for example, increased expression of the cytoskeletal filament protein vimentin correlates with metastatic potential. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism whereby vimentin affects cell motility remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured the effects of vimentin expression on the mechano-elastic and migratory properties of the highly invasive breast carcinoma cell line MDA231. We demonstrate here that vimentin stiffens cells and enhances cell migration in dense cultures, but exerts little or no effect on the migration of sparsely plated cells. These results suggest that cell-cell interactions play a key role in regulating cell migration, and coordinating cell movement in dense cultures.

The recent progress on capsule networks by Hinton et al. has generated considerable excitement in the machine learning community. The idea behind a capsule is inspired by a cortical minicolumn in the brain, whereby a vertically organised group of around 100 neurons receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computation unit of the cerebral cortex. However, Hinton's paper on \"Matrix Capsule with EM Routing'\" was unfortunately not accompanied by a release of source code, which left interested researchers attempting to implement the architecture and reproduce the benchmarks on their own. This has certainly slowed the progress of research building on this work. While writing our own implementation, we noticed several common mistakes in other open source implementations that we came across. In this paper we share some of these learnings, specifically focusing on three implementation pitfalls and how to avoid them: (1) parent capsules with only one child; (2) normalising the amount of data assigned to parent capsules; (3) parent capsules at different positions compete for child capsules. While our implementation is a considerable improvement over currently available implementations, it still falls slightly short of the performance reported by Hinton et al. (2018). The source code for this implementation is available on GitHub at the following URL: https://github.com/IBM/matrix-capsules-with-em-routing."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is a common implementation pitfall in the \"Matrix Capsules with EM Routing\" architecture, as identified by the authors, and how can it be avoided?\n\n**A)** Parent capsules with only one child can lead to over-specialization and reduced generalization ability, which can be avoided by ensuring that each parent capsule has multiple child capsules.\n\n**B)** Normalizing the amount of data assigned to parent capsules can lead to uneven distribution of inputs, which can be avoided by using techniques such as data augmentation or normalization.\n\n**C)** Parent capsules at different positions competing for child capsules can lead to interference and reduced performance, which can be avoided by using techniques such as spatial hierarchies or capsule grouping.\n\n**D)** Parent capsules with only one child can lead to reduced computational efficiency, which can be avoided by using techniques such as parallelization or GPU acceleration.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) Parent capsules with only one child can lead to over-specialization and reduced generalization ability, which can be avoided by ensuring that each parent capsule has multiple child capsules.\n\n**Explanation:** The authors of the paper identified parent capsules with only one child as a common implementation pitfall, which can lead to over-specialization and reduced generalization ability.

The vivid success of the emerging wireless sensor technology (WSN) gave rise to the notion of localization in the communications field. Indeed, the interest in localization grew further with the proliferation of the wireless sensor network applications including medicine, military as well as transport. By utilizing a subset of sensor terminals, gathered data in a WSN can be both identified and correlated which helps in managing the nodes distributed throughout the network. In most scenarios presented in the literature, the nodes to be localized are often considered static. However, as we are heading towards the 5th generation mobile communication, the aspect of mobility should be regarded. Thus, the novelty of this research relies in its ability to merge the robotics as well as WSN fields creating a state of art for the localization of moving nodes. The challenging aspect relies in the capability of merging these two platforms in a way where the limitations of each is minimized as much as possible.

In a rechargeable wireless sensor network, the data packets are generated by sensor nodes at a specific data rate, and transmitted to a base station. Moreover, the base station transfers power to the nodes by using Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) to extend their battery life. However, inadequately scheduling WPT and data collection causes some of the nodes to drain their battery and have their data buffer overflow, while the other nodes waste their harvested energy, which is more than they need to transmit their packets. In this paper, we investigate a novel optimal scheduling strategy, called EHMDP, aiming to minimize data packet loss from a network of sensor nodes in terms of the nodes' energy consumption and data queue state information. The scheduling problem is first formulated by a centralized MDP model, assuming that the complete states of each node are well known by the base station. This presents the upper bound of the data that can be collected in a rechargeable wireless sensor network. Next, we relax the assumption of the availability of full state information so that the data transmission and WPT can be semi-decentralized.
