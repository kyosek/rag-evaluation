There is a long tradition of the axiomatic study of consensus methods in phylogenetics that satisfy certain desirable properties. One recently-introduced property is associative stability, which is desirable because it confers a computational advantage, in that the consensus method only needs to be computed \"pairwise\". In this paper, we introduce a phylogenetic consensus method that satisfies this property, in addition to being \"regular\". The method is based on the introduction of a partial order on the set of rooted phylogenetic trees, itself based on the notion of a hierarchy-preserving map between trees. This partial order may be of independent interest. We call the method \"lattice consensus\", because it takes the unique maximal element in a lattice of trees defined by the partial order. Aside from being associatively stable, lattice consensus also satisfies the property of being Pareto on rooted triples, answering in the affirmative a question of Bryant et al (2017). We conclude the paper with an answer to another question of Bryant et al, showing that there is no regular extension stable consensus method for binary trees."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the lattice consensus method is NOT true?\n\nA) It satisfies the property of associative stability.\nB) It is based on a partial order of rooted phylogenetic trees.\nC) It is Pareto on rooted triples.\nD) It is an extension stable consensus method for binary trees.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) is true.

Heat transfer to the outside significantly determines the transfer behaviour of the accumulator since heat transfer changes the thermodynamic state of the enclosed gas.

Argumentative structure prediction aims to establish links between textual units and label the relationship between them, forming a structured representation for a given input text. The former task, linking, has been identified by earlier works as particularly challenging, as it requires finding the most appropriate structure out of a very large search space of possible link combinations. In this paper, we improve a state-of-the-art linking model by using multi-task and multi-corpora training strategies.

Combining multi-corpora training with a selective sampling strategy increases the training data size while ensuring that the model still learns the desired target distribution well.

Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and lower-redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases, with large (>~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB detected by Swift and localized by the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec from our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments we suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc in projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset. Spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host show it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB 060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion since birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 Gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB progenitor is v_kick = 55 +- 15 km/s."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the observations of GRB 060502B and its putative host galaxy, which of the following statements is most accurately supported by the evidence presented?\n\nA) The progenitor of GRB 060502B likely originated from a young, high-redshift galaxy population similar to long-soft GRBs.\n\nB) The projected offset of GRB 060502B from its potential host galaxy is typical for short-duration hard-spectrum bursts (SHBs).\n\nC) The putative host galaxy of GRB 060502B shows signs of recent star formation activity, suggesting a relatively young progenitor.\n\nD) The large projected offset and ancient starburst in the potential host galaxy imply a long delay between progenitor formation and the GRB event.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

The deep learning community has devised a diverse set of methods to make gradient optimization, using large datasets, of large and highly complex models with deeply cascaded nonlinearities, practical.

The result now dominates much of practical machine learning, with applications in machine translation, computer vision, and speech recognition.

The goal of this paper is to explain not just those methods of most relevance to AD, but also the technical constraints and mindset which led to their discovery. After explaining this context, we present a \"laundry list\" of methods developed by the deep learning community.

A central debate in biology has been the allometric scaling of metabolic rate. Kleiber's observation that animals' basal metabolic rate scales to the 3/4-power of body mass (Kleiber's rule) has been the prevailing hypothesis in the last eight decades. Increasingly, more evidences are supporting the alternative 2/3-power scaling rule, especially for smaller animals. The 2/3-rule dates back to before Kleiber's time and was thought to originate from the surface to volume relationship in Euclidean geometry. In this study, we show that both the 3/4- and 2/3-scaling rules have in fact one common origin. They are governed by animals' nutrient supply networks-their vascular systems that obey Murray's law. Murray's law describes the branching pattern of energy optimized vascular network under laminar flow. It is generally regarded as being closely followed by blood vessels. Our analysis agrees with experimental observations and recent numerical analyses that showed a curvature in metabolic scaling. When applied to metabolic data, our model accurately produces the observed 2/3-scaling rule for small animals of ~10 kg or less and the 3/4-rule for all animals excluding the smallest ones (~15 g).

If we live in the Black-Scholes world, the brokers are presumably making arbitrage profits by shorting dynamically precise amounts of their clients' portfolios. First, we extend Fortune's (2000) application of Merton's (1974) no-arbitrage approach to allow for brokers that can only revise their hedges finitely many times during the term of the loan. We show that extremely small differences in the revision frequency can easily explain the observed variation in margin loan pricing. In fact, four additional revisions per three-day period serve to explain all of the currently observed heterogeneity.

We study a mathematical model of the DNA damage checkpoint in the $G_{2}$ phase which arrests the transition from the $G_{2}$ to the $M$ (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle.
