In a cognitive radio scenario we consider a single secondary user (SU) accessing a multi-channel system. The SU senses the channels sequentially to detect if a primary user (PU) is occupying the channels, and stops its search to access a channel if it offers a significantly high throughput. The optimal stopping rule and power control problem is considered. The problem is formulated as a SU's throughput-maximization problem under a power, interference and packet delay constraints. We first show the effect of the optimal stopping rule on the packet delay, then solve this optimization problem for both the overlay system where the SU transmits only at the spectrum holes as well as the underlay system where tolerable interference (or tolerable collision probability) is allowed. We provide closed-form expressions for the optimal stopping rule, and show that the optimal power control strategy for this multi-channel problem is a modified water-filling approach. We extend the work to multiple SU scenario and show that when the number of SUs is large the complexity of the solution becomes smaller than that of the single SU case. We discuss the application of this problem in typical networks where packets arrive simultaneously and have the same departure deadline. We further propose an online adaptation policy to the optimal stopping rule that meets the packets' hard-deadline constraint and, at the same time, gives higher throughput than the offline policy."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a cognitive radio scenario with a single secondary user (SU) accessing a multi-channel system, which of the following statements is correct regarding the optimal power control strategy and stopping rule?\n\nA) The optimal power control strategy is a standard water-filling approach, and the stopping rule is based solely on channel availability.\n\nB) The optimal power control strategy is a modified water-filling approach, and closed-form expressions for the optimal stopping rule are not possible due to system complexity.\n\nC) The optimal power control strategy is a modified water-filling approach, and closed-form expressions for the optimal stopping rule are provided, considering both overlay and underlay systems.\n\nD) The optimal power control strategy is channel-independent, and the stopping rule is determined only by the packet delay constraint.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of key concepts from the Arxiv documentation.

Protein adsorption at the solid-liquid interface is an important phenomenon that often can be observed as a first step in biological processes.

A general mathematical framework has been introduced in~arXiv:2010.08195. In this paper we develop and investigate a scaling approach of these models based on several biological assumptions.

Fine-grained indoor localization has attracted attention recently because of the rapidly growing demand for indoor location-based services (ILBS).

This paper presents an indoor localization testbed based on a massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which supports physical-layer channel measurements. Instead of exploiting channel state information (CSI) directly for localization, we focus on positioning from the perspective of multipath components (MPCs), which are extracted from the CSI through the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. On top of the available MPCs, we propose a generalized fingerprinting system based on different single-metric and hybrid-metric schemes. We evaluate the impact of the varying antenna topologies, the size of the training set, the number of antennas, and the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The paper proposes a novel methodology that uses Artificial Bee Colony optimization (ABC) to construct Ramsey graphs for R(3,10) and raise its lower bound.
