Matrix factorization is a key component of collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems because it allows us to complete sparse user-by-item ratings matrices under a low-rank assumption that encodes the belief that similar users give similar ratings and that similar items garner similar ratings. This paradigm has had immeasurable practical success, but it is not the complete story for understanding and inferring the preferences of people. First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social connections. In this paper, we develop a unified process model for both types of dynamics within a state space approach, together with an efficient optimization scheme for estimation within that model. The model combines elements from recent developments in dynamic matrix factorization, opinion dynamics and social learning, and trust-based recommendation. The estimation builds upon recent advances in numerical nonlinear optimization.

In some cases, one atypical data point can lead to severe bias and erroneous conclusions about the features of interest.

Surface roughness is primary measure of pavement performance that has been associated with ride quality and vehicle operating costs. Of all the surface roughness indicators, the International Roughness Index (IRI) is the most widely used. However, it is costly to measure IRI, and for this reason, certain road classes are excluded from IRI measurements at a network level. Higher levels of distresses are generally associated with higher roughness. However, for a given roughness level, pavement data typically exhibits a great deal of variability in the distress types, density, and severity. It is hypothesized that it is feasible to estimate the IRI of a pavement section given its distress types and their respective densities and severities. To investigate this hypothesis, this paper uses data from in-service pavements and machine learning methods to ascertain the extent to which IRI can be predicted given a set of pavement attributes. The results suggest that machine learning can be used reliably to estimate IRI based on the measured distress types and their respective densities and severities.

The document focuses more on physical parameters like mass, shape, velocity, and direction of motion.\n\nC) The size of the debris is extremely important. The document explicitly states that debris smaller than 10 cm cannot be tracked, and smaller debris tends to burn up in the atmosphere while larger pieces can reach Earth's surface.\n\nD) The initial height of descent is vital as it determines the amount of atmosphere the debris must travel through, affecting its trajectory, velocity, and whether it will burn up before reaching the surface.\n\nWhile all factors play a role, the chemical composition (B) is the least emphasized in the given information for predicting the impact of space debris that survives re-entry."}, "32": {"documentation": {"title": "Synchronization in networks with multiple interaction layers", "source": "Charo I. del Genio, Jes\\'us G\\'omez-Garde\\~nes, Ivan Bonamassa and\n  Stefano Boccaletti", "docs_id": "1611.05406", "section": ["physics.soc-ph", "math.DS", "nlin.CD"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Synchronization in networks with multiple interaction layers.

One of the exciting recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the development of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that can autonomously handle conversion between different cryptocurrencies. Decentralized exchange protocols such as Uniswap, Curve and other types of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) maintain a liquidity pool (LP) of two or more assets constrained to maintain at all times a mathematical relation to each other, defined by a given function or curve. Examples of such functions are the constant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from several challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of tokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially drain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price changes can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets and reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to constructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input from a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the assets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be identical to the market price.

According to the given information, for the distributed deployment where the M reflecting elements form two IRSs (each deployed near one user), the capacity region is derived in closed-form. In contrast, for the centralized deployment where all M reflecting elements are deployed near the access point (AP), the researchers derive a capacity region outer bound and propose an efficient rate-profile based method to characterize an achievable rate region (or capacity region inner bound). This aligns with option C, which accurately describes the different approaches used for analyzing the two deployment strategies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the scenarios for which closed-form solutions and bounds are derived. Option B is not supported by the given information, as the document doesn't claim that distributed deployment always outperforms centralized deployment. Option D is incorrect because the document explicitly states that the two deployment strategies lead to different user-AP effective channels, implying that their capacity regions would not be identical."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Why it takes a village to manage and share data", "source": "Christine L.

Implementation plans for the National Institutes of Health policy for data management and sharing, which takes effect in 2023, provide an opportunity to reflect on the stakeholders, infrastructures, practice, economics, and sustainability of data sharing.

Individual scientists have mixed incentives, and many disincentives to share data, all of which vary by research domain, methods, resources, and other factors. Motivations and investments for data sharing also vary widely among academic institutional stakeholders such as university leadership, research computing, libraries, and individual schools and departments. Stakeholder concerns are interdependent along many dimensions, seven of which are explored: what data to share; context and credit; discovery; methods and training; intellectual property; data science programs; and international tensions.

This altruistic view for a developing economy, however, is not tenable anymore once the poverty index is found to follow a pareto distribution.

Prior studies have shown that typical methanol dosage strategies produce a varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the reactor, which in turn leads to unstable nitrite concentrations in the effluent. The possibility of adding a model-free control to the actual classical dosage strategy has thus been tested on the SimBio model, which simulates the behavior of wastewater biofilters.
