Anomaly detection refers to the task of finding unusual instances that stand out from the normal data. In several applications, these outliers or anomalous instances are of greater interest compared to the normal ones. Specifically in the case of industrial optical inspection and infrastructure asset management, finding these defects (anomalous regions) is of extreme importance. Traditionally and even today this process has been carried out manually. Humans rely on the saliency of the defects in comparison to the normal texture to detect the defects. However, manual inspection is slow, tedious, subjective and susceptible to human biases. Therefore, the automation of defect detection is desirable. But for defect detection lack of availability of a large number of anomalous instances and labelled data is a problem. In this paper, we present a convolutional auto-encoder architecture for anomaly detection that is trained only on the defect-free (normal) instances. For the test images, residual masks that are obtained by subtracting the original image from the auto-encoder output are thresholded to obtain the defect segmentation masks.

Research on belief formation has produced contradictory findings on whether and when communication between group members will improve the accuracy of numeric estimates such as economic forecasts, medical diagnoses, and job candidate assessments.

Still others argue that independent individuals produce the most accurate beliefs. This paper shows how network theories of belief formation can resolve these inconsistencies, even when groups lack apparent structure as in informal conversation. Emergent network structures of influence interact with the pre-discussion belief distribution to moderate the effect of communication on belief formation. As a result, communication sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the accuracy of the average belief in a group.

The key insight is that emergent network structures of influence interact with the pre-discussion belief distribution to moderate the effect of communication on belief formation. This means that sometimes communication increases accuracy and sometimes it decreases it, depending on these factors. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the paper does not claim that unstructured discussion is always better.

The principal rank-one (RO) components of an image represent the self-similarity of the image, which is an important property for image restoration. However, the RO components of a corrupted image could be decimated by the procedure of image denoising. We suggest that the RO property should be utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks, extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information. Experimental results on four tasks, i.e., noise-free image super-resolution (SR), realistic image SR, gray-scale image denoising, and color image denoising, show that the method is effective and efficient for image restoration, and it delivers superior performance for realistic image SR and color image denoising."}, "answer": "Question: Which of the following best describes the purpose and key components of the Rank-One Network framework for image restoration?\n\nA) It uses a single neural network to directly restore corrupted images without any decomposition step.\n\nB) It decomposes an image into frequency components and reconstructs it using Fourier transforms.\n\nC) It employs a two-module approach: RO decomposition to extract RO components and residual, followed by RO reconstruction to restore the image.\n\nD) It focuses solely on enhancing the edges and textures of corrupted images using convolutional filters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The Rank-One Network framework, as described in the documentation, consists of two main modules:\n\n1. RO decomposition: This module decomposes a corrupted image into rank-one (RO) components and residual.

Automated segmentation of esophagus is critical in image guided/adaptive radiotherapy of lung cancer to minimize radiation-induced toxicities such as acute esophagitis. We developed a semantic physics-based data augmentation method for segmenting esophagus in both planning CT (pCT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) using 3D convolutional neural networks. 191 cases with their pCT and CBCTs from four independent datasets were used to train a modified 3D-Unet architecture with a multi-objective loss function specifically designed for soft-tissue organs such as esophagus.

Segmentations were evaluated using geometric Dice and Hausdorff distance as well as dosimetrically using mean esophagus dose and D5cc. Due to the physics-based data augmentation, our model trained just on the synthetic CBCTs was robust and generalizable enough to also produce state-of-the-art results on the pCTs and CBCTs, achieving 0.81 and 0.74 Dice overlap.

This creates synthetic CBCTs that span the realistic noise/artifact spectrum across patient CBCT/pCT data.\n\nThis method is crucial because it allows the model to be trained on synthetic data that closely mimics real-world variations, making it more robust and generalizable.

Moreover, convex hull analysis provides additional information on the sub-ensemble of tracers that on average disperse most efficiently in the form of extreme value statistics and flow anisotropy via the geometric properties of the convex hulls. We use the convex hull surface geometry to examine the anisotropy that occurs in turbulent convection. Applying extreme value theory, we show that the maximal square extensions of convex hull vertices are well described by a classic extreme value distribution, the Gumbel distribution.
