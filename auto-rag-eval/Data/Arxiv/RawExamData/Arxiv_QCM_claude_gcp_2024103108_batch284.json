Krypton-85 is an anthropogenic beta-decaying isotope which produces low energy backgrounds in dark matter and neutrino experiments, especially those based upon liquid xenon. Several technologies have been developed to reduce the Kr concentration in such experiments. We propose to augment those separation technologies by first adding to the xenon an 85Kr-free sample of krypton in an amount much larger than the natural krypton that is already present. After the purification system reduces the total Kr concentration to the same level, the final 85Kr concentration will have been reduced even further by the dilution factor. A test cell for measurement of the activity of various Kr samples has been assembled, and the activity of 25-year-old Krypton has been measured. The measured activity agrees well with the expected activity accounting for the 85Kr abundance of the earth atmosphere in 1990 and the half-life of the isotope. Additional tests with a Kr sample produced in the year 1944 (before the atomic era) have been done in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the test cell."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a new method to reduce 85Kr in noble gas-based low-background detectors. They propose adding 85Kr-free krypton to xenon before purification. If the initial 85Kr concentration in xenon is 100 ppt (parts per trillion), and they add 85Kr-free krypton at 10 times the natural krypton concentration, what would be the approximate reduction factor of 85Kr after purification to the same total Kr concentration?\n\nA) 2x\nB) 5x\nC) 11x\nD) 20x\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The proposed method involves adding a larger amount of 85Kr-free krypton to dilute the existing 85Kr before purification. If the added krypton is 10 times the natural krypton concentration, the total krypton content becomes 11 times the original (1 part original + 10 parts added). When the purification system reduces the total Kr concentration to the same level as before, the 85Kr will have been diluted by a factor of 11. Therefore, the 85Kr concentration will be reduced by approximately 11x compared to using standard purification methods alone.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it significantly underestimates the dilution effect.

However, obtaining the steady-state distributions for such systems poses a significant challenge due to the state space explosion problem which often arises in the case of large PBNs. The only viable way is to use statistical methods. We have considered the two-state Markov chain approach and the Skart method for the analysis of large PBNs in our previous work.

FloWaveNet requires only a single-stage training procedure and a single maximum likelihood loss, without any additional auxiliary terms, and it is inherently parallel due to the characteristics of generative flow.
