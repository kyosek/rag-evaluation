Experimental observations of multi-quantum relaxation of highly vibrationally excited NO scattering from Au(111) are a benchmark for the breakdown of Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecule-surface systems. This remarkable vibrational inelasticity was long thought to be almost exclusively mediated by electron transfer; but, no theories have quantitatively reproduced various experimental data. This was suggested to be due to errors in the adiabatic potential energy surface (PES) used in those studies. Here, we investigate electronically adiabatic molecular dynamics of this system with a globally accurate high dimensional PES, newly developed with neural networks from first principles.

These conditional lower bounds have become important and popular due to the painfully slow progress on proving strong unconditional lower bounds.

Telecommunication networks play a critical role in modern society. With the arrival of 5G networks, these systems are becoming even more diversified, integrated, and intelligent. Traffic forecasting is one of the key components in such a system, however, it is particularly challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal dependency. In this work, we consider this problem from the aspect of a cellular network and the interactions among its base stations. We thoroughly investigate the characteristics of cellular network traffic and shed light on the dependency complexities based on data collected from a densely populated metropolis area.

To address these complexities, we propose an effective deep-learning-based approach, namely, Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network (STHGCN).

For completely arbitrary (even non-measurable) performance benchmarks, we show how the axiom of choice can be used to \"find\" an exact maximin strategy for the trader."}, "answer": "Question: In the context of Cover and Ordentlich's (1998) max-min portfolio game, which of the following statements is correct regarding the universal portfolio strategy and its performance?\n\nA) The universal portfolio always outperforms the best constant-rebalanced portfolio in any given finite time period.\n\nB) The universal portfolio's final wealth is guaranteed to be equal to D(X), the wealth of the best constant-rebalanced portfolio in hindsight.\n\nC) The universal portfolio compounds its money at the same asymptotic rate as the best rebalancing rule in hindsight, beating the market under very general conditions.\n\nD) The universal portfolio strategy is only effective in markets with a small number of stocks and short investment horizons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage states that the resulting universal portfolio \"compounds its money at the same asymptotic rate as the best rebalancing rule in hindsight, thereby beating the market asymptotically under extremely general conditions.\" This directly supports option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the universal portfolio matches the performance asymptotically, not in any given finite time period. There's no guarantee of outperformance in shorter timeframes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the universal portfolio's wealth W_\u03b8(X) is not guaranteed to be equal to D(X). The game's payoff kernel is W_\u03b8(X)/D(X), which implies a ratio, not equality.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage suggests that the strategy is effective under \"extremely general conditions,\" which contradicts the limitation to small markets and short horizons."}}
