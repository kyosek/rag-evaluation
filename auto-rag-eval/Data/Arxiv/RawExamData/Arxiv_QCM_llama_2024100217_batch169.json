Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) has emerged as a key MCMC algorithm for Bayesian learning from large scale datasets. While SGLD with decreasing step sizes converges weakly to the posterior distribution, the algorithm is often used with a constant step size in practice and has demonstrated successes in machine learning tasks. The current practice is to set the step size inversely proportional to $N$ where $N$ is the number of training samples. As $N$ becomes large, we show that the SGLD algorithm has an invariant probability measure which significantly departs from the target posterior and behaves like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This difference is inherently due to the high variance of the stochastic gradients. Several strategies have been suggested to reduce this effect; among them, SGLD Fixed Point (SGLDFP) uses carefully designed control variates to reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients. We show that SGLDFP gives approximate samples from the posterior distribution, with an accuracy comparable to the Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm for a computational cost sublinear in the number of data points. We provide a detailed analysis of the Wasserstein distances between LMC, SGLD, SGLDFP and SGD and explicit expressions of the means and covariance matrices of their invariant distributions. Our findings are supported by limited numerical experiments."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary reason why the SGLD algorithm, despite converging weakly to the posterior distribution, often deviates from the target posterior and behaves like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the number of training samples (N) becomes large?\n\n**A)** The step size is not inversely proportional to N.\n**B)** The high variance of the stochastic gradients is not taken into account.\n**C)** The algorithm is not designed to handle large-scale datasets.\n**D)** The step size is inversely proportional to N, but the high variance of the stochastic gradients dominates the convergence.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) The step size is inversely proportional to N, but the high variance of the stochastic gradients dominates the convergence.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is D) because the documentation states that the current practice is to set the step size inversely proportional to N, but the high variance of the stochastic gradients dominates the convergence, causing the algorithm to deviate from the target posterior and behave like SGD.
