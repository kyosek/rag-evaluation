As Super-Resolution (SR) has matured as a research topic, it has been applied to additional topics beyond image reconstruction. In particular, combining classification or object detection tasks with a super-resolution preprocessing stage has yielded improvements in accuracy especially with objects that are small relative to the scene. While SR has shown promise, a study comparing SR and naive upscaling methods such as Nearest Neighbors (NN) interpolation when applied as a preprocessing step for object detection has not been performed. We apply the topic to satellite data and compare the Multi-scale Deep Super-Resolution (MDSR) system to NN on the xView challenge dataset. To do so, we propose a pipeline for processing satellite data that combines multi-stage image tiling and upscaling, the YOLOv2 object detection architecture, and label stitching. We compare the effects of training models using an upscaling factor of 4, upscaling images from 30cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD) to an effective GSD of 7.5cm. Upscaling by this factor significantly improves detection results, increasing Average Precision (AP) of a generalized vehicle class by 23 percent.

The Weyl semimetal realized in the TaAs class features multiple Fermi arcs arising from topological surface states [10, 11, 14-16] and exhibits novel quantum phenomena, e.g., chiral anomaly induced negative mag-netoresistance [17-19] and possibly emergent supersymmetry [20].

In the framework of the paradigmatic prisoner's dilemma, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas in the presence of \"cooperation facilitators\". In our model, cooperators and defectors interact as in the classical prisoner's dilemma game, where selection favors defection. However, here the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the fitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that of defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's dilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation takes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing states. These quantities are computed exactly and using Fokker-Planck equations. Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate that the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between their density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r.

Heterogeneity of economic agents is emphasized in a new trend of macroeconomics. Accordingly the new emerging discipline requires one to replace the production function, one of key ideas in the conventional economics, by an alternative which can take an explicit account of distribution of firms' production activities. In this paper we propose a new idea referred to as production copula; a copula is an analytic means for modeling dependence among variables. Such a production copula predicts value added yielded by firms with given capital and labor in a probabilistic way. It is thereby in sharp contrast to the production function where the output of firms is completely deterministic. We demonstrate empirical construction of a production copula using financial data of listed firms in Japan. Analysis of the data shows that there are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added and confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented by a production function.

The correct answer is B because the MACE telescope's primary objective is to study gamma-ray sources in the unexplored energy region of 20-100 GeV and beyond with high sensitivity. The telescope's large light collector (21m diameter with 1424 mirror facets) is a key feature that enables this capability.\n\nOption A is a plausible distractor because the high-altitude location (4270m asl) does reduce atmospheric interference, but this alone doesn't explain the high number of events specifically in the 20-100 GeV range.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the uniform pixel resolution (0.125\u00b0) and large field of view (4.0\u00b0 \u00d7 4.0\u00b0) contribute to the telescope's overall performance, they don't specifically explain an increase in detections in the 20-100 GeV range.\n\nOption D is a misconception because while MACE is located in the northern hemisphere, this doesn't inherently provide access to unexplored regions of the gamma-ray sky. The sky accessible to the telescope is determined by its location, but this doesn't explain the energy-specific observation.\n\nThe question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a hypothetical scenario, and critically evaluate which feature of the telescope best explains the observed phenomenon."}, "28": {"documentation": {"title": "A Direct Measurement of the IGM Opacity to HI Ionizing Photons", "source": "J.

What will be the efficiency gain if MF is prevented at the advent of a technology? We answer these questions using survey data and official statistics employing economic surplus model.

The efficiency gain accruing to producers if MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs was estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion).

The Klein-Gordon equation doesn't always yield higher energy levels; the relationship is more complex and depends on the relativistic regime.\n\nOption B is partially correct but misleading. While it correctly identifies that the equations converge in the non-relativistic limit, it incorrectly suggests that only the Dirac equation accounts for spin effects.

Predictive maintenance, i.e. predicting failure to be few steps ahead of the fault, is one of the pillars of Industry 4.0. An effective method for that is to track early signs of degradation before a failure happens. This paper presents an innovative failure predictive scheme for machines. The proposed scheme combines the use of full spectrum of the vibration data caused by the machines and data visualization technologies. This scheme is featured by no training data required and by quick start after installation. First, we propose to use full spectrum (as high-dimensional data vector) with no cropping and no complex feature extraction and to visualize data behavior by mapping the high dimensional vectors into a 2D map. We then can ensure the simplicity of process and less possibility of overlooking of important information as well as providing a human-friendly and human-understandable output. Second, we propose Real-Time Data Tracker (RTDT) which predicts the failure at an appropriate time with sufficient time for maintenance by plotting real-time frequency spectrum data of the target machine on the 2D map composed from normal data. Third, we show the test results of our proposal using vibration data of bearings from real-world test-to-failure measurements provided by the public dataset, the IMS dataset."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation about predictive maintenance and early failure prediction for rolling bearings:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is implementing a new predictive maintenance system for a factory's rolling bearings using the scheme described in the paper.
