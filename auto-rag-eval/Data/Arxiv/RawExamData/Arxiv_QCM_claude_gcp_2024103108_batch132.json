Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) affecting the whole world. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values. In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals closely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be closely monitored."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the study of virus host-genome similarity (HGS) between SARS-CoV-2 and various animal species, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Humans and monkeys showed the highest HGS values with SARS-CoV-2, indicating they are the most likely intermediate hosts.\n\nB) Bats, followed by mice and cats, demonstrated the highest HGS values with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting mice and cats could potentially be intermediate hosts.\n\nC) Pangolins and snakes exhibited median HGS values, positioning them as the most probable intermediate hosts in seafood markets.\n\nD) Chickens and swine showed significantly high HGS values, making them prime candidates for intermediate hosts in live poultry markets.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The study found that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bats was the highest, followed by mice and cats.

Current measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ on scale less than $\\sim100$ Mpc appear to be controversial, while the observations made at high redshift seem to provide a relatively low value.

In this paper, we discuss the influence of a possible variant Hubble constant on two fundamental relations in astronomy: the magnitude-redshift ($m$--$z$) and the number-magnitude relations.

The exceptional point (EP) is a critical point in the parameter space where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system coalesce. This coalescence marks the transition between two distinct regimes: one where the system is PT-symmetric (where PT stands for the combined operation of parity and time reversal in a generalized sense), and another where this symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\nAt the EP, the differences in eigenvalues transition from being either real or purely imaginary.

Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters (TX) is critical to many cooperation schemes such as Network MIMO, Interference Alignment etc. Practical CSI feedback and limited backhaul-based sharing inevitably creates degradations of CSI which are specific to each TX, giving rise to a distributed form of CSI.

We find a direct correlation between the decay timescale and the spectral lag, demonstrating the relationship between time delay of the low energy photons and the decay of $E_{pk}$.

In this article, it is argued that valuable new insight may be gained extending the experimental studies of kaon electro production from nuclei to include the $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime K^+) \\isotope[208][\\Lambda]{\\rm Tl}$ process. The connection with proton knockout reactions and the availability of accurate $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime p) \\isotope[207][]{\\rm Tl}$ data can be exploited to achieve a largely model-independent analysis of the measured cross section. A framework for the description of kaon electro production based on the formalism of nuclear many-body theory is outlined."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: The study of hypernuclear dynamics through the $(e, e^\\prime K^+)$ reaction is significant for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. Which of the following statements best describes the importance and proposed methodology of studying the $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime K^+) \\isotope[208][\\Lambda]{\\rm Tl}$ process?\n\nA) It provides direct evidence for the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars, resolving the hyperon puzzle in dense nuclear matter.\n\nB) It allows for a model-dependent analysis of kaon electroproduction, eliminating the need for comparison with proton knockout reactions.\n\nC) It offers a way to study strange quark dynamics in isolation, without the interference of up and down quarks in nuclear matter.\n\nD) It enables a largely model-independent analysis of the measured cross section by exploiting the connection with proton knockout reactions and existing $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime p) \\isotope[207][]{\\rm Tl}$ data.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation emphasizes that studying the $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime K^+) \\isotope[208][\\Lambda]{\\rm Tl}$ process can provide valuable new insights into hypernuclear dynamics. It specifically mentions that the connection with proton knockout reactions and the availability of accurate $\\isotope[208][]{\\rm Pb}(e,e^\\prime p) \\isotope[207][]{\\rm Tl}$ data can be exploited to achieve a largely model-independent analysis of the measured cross section. This approach allows researchers to gain understanding of hypernuclear properties while minimizing dependence on specific theoretical models.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the study is relevant to the neutron star mass problem, it doesn't provide direct evidence for two-solar-mass neutron stars. Option B is wrong as the method aims for a model-independent analysis, not a model-dependent one. Option C is incorrect because the study focuses on hypernuclear dynamics in nuclear matter, not isolated strange quark dynamics."}}
