The Contractor Renormalization group formalism (CORE) is a real-space renormalization group method which is the Hamiltonian analogue of the Wilson exact renormalization group equations. In an earlier paper\\cite{QGAF} I showed that the Contractor Renormalization group (CORE) method could be used to map a theory of free quarks, and quarks interacting with gluons, into a generalized frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) and proposed using CORE methods to study these theories. Since generalizations of HAF's exhibit all sorts of subtle behavior which, from a continuum point of view, are related to topological properties of the theory, it is important to know that CORE can be used to extract this physics. In this paper I show that despite the folklore which asserts that all real-space renormalization group schemes are necessarily inaccurate, simple Contractor Renormalization group (CORE) computations can give highly accurate results even if one only keeps a small number of states per block and a few terms in the cluster expansion. In addition I argue that even very simple CORE computations give a much better qualitative understanding of the physics than naive renormalization group methods.

The breakdown of the asymptotic expansion at large distances is prevented by introducing the long-range variables \"untied\" from the short-range oscillations. We formulate a quantitative theory for the fading of the kink's wobbling due to the second-harmonic radiation, explain the wobbling mode's longevity and discuss ways to compensate the radiation losses.
