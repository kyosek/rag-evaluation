Many complex adaptive systems contain a large diversity of specialized components. The specialization at the level of the microscopic degrees of freedom, and diversity at the level of the system as a whole are phenomena that appear during the course of evolution of the system. We present a mathematical model to describe these evolutionary phenomena in economic communities. The model is a generalization of the replicator equation. The economic motivation for the model and its relationship with some other game theoretic models applied to ecology and sociobiology is discussed. Some results about the attractors of this dynamical system are described. We argue that while the microscopic variables -- the agents comprising the community -- act locally and independently, time evolution produces a collective behaviour in the system characterized by individual specialization of the agents as well as global diversity in the community. This occurs for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions provided the community is sufficiently large, and can be viewed as a kind of self-organization in the system.

Most of the previously-reported approaches create speaker models based on averaging the extracted features from utterances of the speaker, which is known as the d-vector system.

Automated airway segmentation is a prerequisite for pre-operative diagnosis and intra-operative navigation for pulmonary intervention. Due to the small size and scattered spatial distribution of peripheral bronchi, this is hampered by severe class imbalance between foreground and background regions, which makes it challenging for CNN-based methods to parse distal small airways. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is arisen by gradient erosion and dilation of the neighborhood voxels. During back-propagation, if the ratio of the foreground gradient to background gradient is small while the class imbalance is local, the foreground gradients can be eroded by their neighborhoods. This process cumulatively increases the noise information included in the gradient flow from top layers to the bottom ones, limiting the learning of small structures in CNNs. To alleviate this problem, we use group supervision and the corresponding WingsNet to provide complementary gradient flows to enhance the training of shallow layers.

Providing security for messages in group communication is more essential and critical nowadays. In group oriented applications such as Video conferencing and entertainment applications, it is necessary to secure the confidential data in such a way that intruders are not able to modify or transmit the data. Key transfer protocols fully rely on trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) to compute group key and to transport the group keys to all communication parties in a secured and secret manner. In this paper, an efficient key generation and key transfer protocol has been proposed where KGC can broadcast group key information to all group members in a secure way. Hence, only authorized group members will be able to retrieve the secret key and unauthorized members cannot retrieve the secret key. Hence, inorder to maintain the forward and backward secrecy, the group keys are updated whenever a new member joins or leaves the communication group.
