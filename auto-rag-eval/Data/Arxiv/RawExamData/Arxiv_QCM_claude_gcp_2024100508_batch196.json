Okapi is a new causally consistent geo-replicated key- value store. Okapi leverages two key design choices to achieve high performance. First, it relies on hybrid logical/physical clocks to achieve low latency even in the presence of clock skew. Second, Okapi achieves higher resource efficiency and better availability, at the expense of a slight increase in update visibility latency. To this end, Okapi implements a new stabilization protocol that uses a combination of vector and scalar clocks and makes a remote update visible when its delivery has been acknowledged by every data center. We evaluate Okapi with different workloads on Amazon AWS, using three geographically distributed regions and 96 nodes. We compare Okapi with two recent approaches to causal consistency, Cure and GentleRain.

With automobiles becoming increasingly reliant on sensors to perform various driving tasks, it is important to encode the relevant CAN bus sensor data in a way that captures the general state of the vehicle in a compact form. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based method, called Drive2Vec, for embedding such sensor data in a low-dimensional yet actionable form. Our method is based on stacked gated recurrent units (GRUs). It accepts a short interval of automobile sensor data as input and computes a low-dimensional representation of that data, which can then be used to accurately solve a range of tasks. With this representation, we (1) predict the exact values of the sensors in the short term (up to three seconds in the future), (2) forecast the long-term average values of these same sensors, (3) infer additional contextual information that is not encoded in the data, including the identity of the driver behind the wheel, and (4) build a knowledge base that can be used to auto-label data and identify risky states. We evaluate our approach on a dataset collected by Audi, which equipped a fleet of test vehicles with data loggers to store all sensor readings on 2,098 hours of driving on real roads. We show in several experiments that our method outperforms other baselines by up to 90%, and we further demonstrate how these embeddings of sensor data can be used to solve a variety of real-world automotive applications."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the capabilities and applications of the Drive2Vec method as presented in the paper?\n\nA) It can only predict short-term sensor values and identify the driver, but cannot forecast long-term averages or build a knowledge base.\n\nB) It embeds CAN bus sensor data into a high-dimensional representation that requires significant computational resources to process.\n\nC) It uses convolutional neural networks to process vehicular sensor data and can only perform driver identification tasks.\n\nD) It creates a low-dimensional embedding of sensor data that enables short-term predictions, long-term forecasting, driver identification, and knowledge base construction for auto-labeling and risk identification.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately summarizes the key capabilities of Drive2Vec as described in the paper.

In recent years, end-to-end (E2E) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved great success due to their simplicity and promising performance. Neural Transducer based models are increasingly popular in streaming E2E based ASR systems and have been reported to outperform the traditional hybrid system in some scenarios. However, the joint optimization of acoustic model, lexicon and language model in neural Transducer also brings about challenges to utilize pure text for language model adaptation. This drawback might prevent their potential applications in practice. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel model, factorized neural Transducer, by factorizing the blank and vocabulary prediction, and adopting a standalone language model for the vocabulary prediction. It is expected that this factorization can transfer the improvement of the standalone language model to the Transducer for speech recognition, which allows various language model adaptation techniques to be applied.

The element is based on hierarchical, heterogeneous, and anisotropic shape functions. As with other solid shell formulations, only displacement degrees of freedom are required to describe the shell kinematics and general three-dimensional material laws can be adopted. However, the novelty of this formulation is the ability to capture complex shell behaviour and avoid locking phenomena, without the need to use reduced integration or adopt additional natural strain or enhanced strain fields. Thus, this element is ideally suited for geometrically and physically nonlinear problems. This is achieved by constructing independent approximation shape functions on both the prism element's triangular faces and through the thickness, where the latter is associated with a local coordinate system that convects with deformation of the shell. The element is extremely efficient, with the hierarchical property lending itself to an efficient and highly scalable multigrid solver, and the heterogeneity property enables local p-adaptivity. The paper demonstrates performance of the element for a number of linear and geometrically nonlinear problems, benchmarked against well established problems in the literature.

Counterfactual inference has become a ubiquitous tool in online advertisement, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, and econometrics. Accurate modeling of outcome distributions associated with different interventions -- known as counterfactual distributions -- is crucial for the success of these applications. In this work, we propose to model counterfactual distributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual mean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite kernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape of the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a distributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over entire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be estimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without requiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also establish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the smoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the underlying marginal distributions.
