Parametric resonance: The documentation states that the study focuses on an optomechanical cavity in parametric resonance, which is likely to be more efficient for photon generation than a detuned cavity.\n\n2. Initial phononic product state: The text mentions that for initial phononic product states, the evolution of the photon number can be described as a non-harmonic quantum oscillator.

Shaking optical lattices in a resonant manner offers an efficient and versatile method to devise artificial gauge fields and topological band structures for ultracold atomic gases.

Adding inter-particle interactions to these engineered band systems is expected to lead to strongly-correlated states with topological features, such as fractional Chern insulators.

Finding a fixed point to a nonexpansive operator, i.e., $x^*=Tx^*$, abstracts many problems in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and other areas of scientific computing. To solve fixed-point problems, we propose ARock, an algorithmic framework in which multiple agents (machines, processors, or cores) update $x$ in an asynchronous parallel fashion. Asynchrony is crucial to parallel computing since it reduces synchronization wait, relaxes communication bottleneck, and thus speeds up computing significantly. At each step of ARock, an agent updates a randomly selected coordinate $x_i$ based on possibly out-of-date information on $x$. The agents share $x$ through either global memory or communication. If writing $x_i$ is atomic, the agents can read and write $x$ without memory locks. Theoretically, we show that if the nonexpansive operator $T$ has a fixed point, then with probability one, ARock generates a sequence that converges to a fixed points of $T$. Our conditions on $T$ and step sizes are weaker than comparable work. Linear convergence is also obtained. We propose special cases of ARock for linear systems, convex optimization, machine learning, as well as distributed and decentralized consensus problems.

Based on reasonable physical constraints, such as minimal entropy gradients, we propose steady state distribution functions for disc stars, applicable over a range of gravitational potentials. The resulting surface density profiles are generally a power-law term times a Sersic-type exponential.

Shear viscosity to entropy ratio: A lower ratio allows for more efficient translation of initial spatial anisotropies into momentum anisotropies (flow). This effect is more pronounced in peripheral collisions where the initial spatial anisotropy is larger.\n\n2.

This answer integrates multiple concepts from the documentation and requires analysis of the given information.\n\nThe documentation states that \"the maximum photocurrent, and hence the highest responsivity, scales inversely with the slot gap width.\" It also mentions that using a dual-lithography step, they realized \"15 nm narrow slots that show a 15-times higher responsivity per unit device-length compared to photonic graphene photodetectors.\" This directly supports the use of narrow plasmonic slots to achieve high responsivity in a compact device.\n\nOption A is incorrect because increasing the slot gap width would decrease responsivity, contradicting the inverse relationship mentioned in the document.\n\nOption B is wrong because the document explicitly states that the plasmonic design outperforms photonic waveguide designs in terms of responsivity per unit length.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it goes against the goal of minimizing device length. The document emphasizes the benefits of a \"5 \u03bcm-short device length\" and \"micrometer compact\" design for \"short-carrier pathways.\"\n\nThe inclusion of back-gating in the correct answer adds complexity to the question, as the document discusses how \"back-gated electrostatics is overshadowed by channel-doping contributions\" in ultra-short channel devices.

A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) approach that always outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) called Fair-NOMA is introduced.

For any slow-fading channel gains of the two users, the set of possible power allocation coefficients are derived. For the infimum and supremum of this set, the individual capacity gains and the sum-rate capacity gain are derived. It is shown that the ergodic sum-rate capacity gain approaches 1 b/s/Hz when the transmit power increases for the case when pairing two random users with i.i.d. channel gains. The outage probability of this approach is derived and shown to be better than OMA.

Let's break down why A is the correct answer and why the other options are plausible distractors:\n\nA) The documentation states that the time resolution worsened to 100 ps for \"~ 1 kHz/cm\u00b2 proton flux.\" A flux of 2 kHz/cm\u00b2 would exceed this demonstrated limit, likely further degrading performance.

While significantly higher fields might push the detectors beyond their usual operating parameters, there's no direct evidence that this would exceed their capabilities, and increased field strength often improves RPC performance up to a point.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring candidates to extrapolate from the given information, consider the implications of pushing beyond demonstrated limits, and evaluate which scenario most likely exceeds the detector's capabilities.

Yet, in practice, even models learned with privacy guarantees can inadvertently memorize unique training examples or leak sensitive features. To identify such privacy violations, existing model auditing techniques use finite adversaries defined as machine learning models with (a) access to some finite side information (e.g., a small auditing dataset), and (b) finite capacity (e.g., a fixed neural network architecture). Our work investigates the requirements under which an unsuccessful attempt to identify privacy violations by a finite adversary implies that no stronger adversary can succeed at such a task.
