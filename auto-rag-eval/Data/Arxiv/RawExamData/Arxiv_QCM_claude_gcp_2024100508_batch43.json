We investigate the survivor distributions of a spatially extended model of competitive dynamics in different geometries.

Every such initial state leads to a unique and extended pattern of survivors and non-survivors, which is known as an attractor of the dynamics. We show that the number of such attractors grows exponentially with system size, so that their exact characterisation is limited to only very small systems.

The main goal of this work is a short description and a qualitative analysis of experimental data on low-frequency nonlinear resonances revealed in a nonautonomous ruby phaser. Under phaser pumping modulation near these resonances, an unusual kind of self-organized motions in the ruby spin-phonon system was observed by me in 1984 for the first time.

Large liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs), especially those operating near the surface, are susceptible to space charge effects.
