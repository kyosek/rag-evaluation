Fourier ptychographic microscopy is a computational imaging technique that provides quantitative phase information and high resolution over a large field-of-view. Although the technique presents numerous advantages over conventional microscopy, model mismatch due to unknown optical aberrations can significantly limit reconstruction quality. Many attempts to address this issue rely on embedding pupil recovery into the reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of a purely algorithmic approach and evaluate the merits of implementing a simple, dedicated calibration procedure. In simulations, we find that for a target sample reconstruction error, we can image without any aberration corrections up to a maximum aberration magnitude of $\\lambda$/40. When we use algorithmic self-calibration, we can increase the aberration magnitude up to $\\lambda$/10, and with our in situ speckle calibration technique, this working range is extended further to a maximum aberration magnitude of $\\lambda$/3. Hence, one can trade-off complexity for accuracy by using a separate calibration process, which is particularly useful for larger aberrations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Fourier ptychographic microscopy, what is the maximum aberration magnitude that can be effectively corrected using the in situ speckle calibration technique, and how does this compare to other methods?\n\nA) \u03bb/40, which is better than both uncorrected imaging and algorithmic self-calibration\nB) \u03bb/10, which is the same as algorithmic self-calibration but better than uncorrected imaging\nC) \u03bb/3, which is better than both uncorrected imaging and algorithmic self-calibration\nD) \u03bb, which is worse than both uncorrected imaging and algorithmic self-calibration\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage states that with the in situ speckle calibration technique, the working range is extended to a maximum aberration magnitude of \u03bb/3.

In this paper we make progress in this direction by studying the cell probe complexity of two conjectured to be hard problems of particular importance: matrix-vector multiplication and a version of dynamic set disjointness known as Patrascu's Multiphase Problem. We give improved unconditional lower bounds for these problems as well as introducing new proof techniques of independent interest.
