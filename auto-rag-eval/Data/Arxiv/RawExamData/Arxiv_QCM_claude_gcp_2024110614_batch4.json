On a Riemannian or a semi-Riemannian manifold, the metric determines invariants like the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann curvature. If the metric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these constructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the metric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant indices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between covariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction applies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in the contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to define the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant tensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named radical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann curvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds, named semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to construct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains smooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a densitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is equivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A team of physicists is developing a new mathematical model for a space-time singularity near a black hole.

The Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators on small-world (SW) graphs is analyzed in this work.

We show that this class of solutions plays an important role in the formation of spatial patterns in the Kuramoto model on SW graphs. In particular, the analysis of q-twisted elucidates the role of long-range random connections in shaping the attractors in this model. We develop two complementary approaches for studying q-twisted states in the coupled oscillator model on SW graphs: the linear stability analysis and the numerical continuation. The former approach shows that long-range random connections in the SW graphs promote synchronization and yields the estimate of the synchronization rate as a function of the SW randomization parameter.

Here's why:\n\n1. Performance improvement: The method addresses both ICI and IUI by aligning interference in multi-dimensional subspace, which is crucial for the two-cell MIMO interfering broadcast channel.\n\n2.

An Analysis of the Disposition Effect in\n  Bitcoin. Investors tend to sell their winning investments and hold onto their losers. This phenomenon, known as the \\emph{disposition effect} in the field of behavioural finance, is well-known and its prevalence has been shown in a number of existing markets. But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis. Our results show that investors are indeed subject to the disposition effect, tending to sell their winning positions too soon and holding on to their losing position for too long. This effect is very prominently evident from the boom and bust year 2017 onwards, confirmed via most of the applied technical indicators.

This directly relates to the main finding of the study, which showed that Bitcoin traders exhibit the disposition effect, particularly from 2017 onwards.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while market manipulation can occur, the pattern described is more consistent with individual investor behavior rather than coordinated manipulation.\n\nOption B is correct as it accurately identifies the disposition effect, which the study confirms is present in Bitcoin trading. This demonstrates irrational behavior as investors are selling winners too soon and holding losers too long, potentially missing out on further gains and realizing unnecessary losses.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the efficient market hypothesis would suggest that traders respond rationally to new information, which is contradicted by the observed disposition effect.\n\nOption D is plausible but incorrect, as the pattern is more likely explained by psychological factors (disposition effect) rather than external regulatory changes.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (disposition effect, market behavior, rationality in investing) and applies them to a real-world scenario in cryptocurrency trading.

Channel allocation is the task of assigning channels to users such that some objective (e.g., sum-rate) is maximized. In centralized networks such as cellular networks, this task is carried by the base station which gathers the channel state information (CSI) from the users and computes the optimal solution. In distributed networks such as ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks, no base station exists and conveying global CSI between users is costly or simply impractical. When the CSI is time varying and unknown to the users, the users face the challenge of both learning the channel statistics online and converge to a good channel allocation. This introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) scenario with multiple decision makers. If two users or more choose the same channel, a collision occurs and they all receive zero reward.

Besides, correlations between features from multiple views always vary greatly, which challenges multi-view subspace learning.

In statistics and data analysis the word outlier usually refers to a row of the data matrix, and the methods to detect such outliers only work when at least half the rows are clean. But often many rows have a few contaminated cell values, which may not be visible by looking at each variable (column) separately. We propose the first method to detect deviating data cells in a multivariate sample which takes the correlations between the variables into account. It has no restriction on the number of clean rows, and can deal with high dimensions. Other advantages are that it provides estimates of the `expected' values of the outlying cells, while imputing missing values at the same time. We illustrate the method on several real data sets, where it uncovers more structure than found by purely columnwise methods or purely rowwise methods. The proposed method can help to diagnose why a certain row is outlying, e.g. in process control. It may also serve as an initial step for estimating multivariate location and scatter matrices."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about detecting deviating data cells, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is analyzing a large multivariate dataset with 1000 rows and 50 columns.

Here's why:\n\n1. The question describes a large multivariate dataset (1000 rows, 50 columns) where traditional outlier detection methods are not working well. This suggests that the outliers may not be entire rows, but rather individual cell values spread across multiple rows.\n\n2.

The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is presently the best description of nature at small distances and high energies.

Well-motivated scenarios that resolve these issues exist but also predict extended gauge (e.g., Left-Right Symmetric Models), scalar (e.g., Supersymmetry), and/or fermion sectors (e.g., Seesaw Models).

We study analytically and by simulation how this feature of durations generated by the MSMD process propagates to counts and realized volatility. We employ a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator of the MSMD parameters based on the Whittle approximation and establish its strong consistency and asymptotic normality for general MSMD specifications. We show that the Whittle estimation is a computationally simple and fast alternative to maximum likelihood. Finally, we compare the performance of the MSMD model with competing short- and long-memory duration models in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise based on price durations of three major foreign exchange futures contracts. The results of the comparison show that the MSMD and LMSD perform similarly and are superior to the short-memory ACD models."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A quantitative analyst is comparing the Markov-Switching Multifractal Duration (MSMD) model with other duration models for forecasting price durations in foreign exchange futures contracts.

In the first step, different sets of users are scheduled to send signals over networks and the remaining users and relays overhear the transmitted signals, thereby learning the interference patterns.
