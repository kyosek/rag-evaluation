Measurement and management of credit concentration risk is critical for banks and relevant for micro-prudential requirements. While several methods exist for measuring credit concentration risk within institutions, the systemic effect of different institutions' exposures to the same counterparties has been less explored so far. In this paper, we propose a measure of the systemic credit concentration risk that arises because of common exposures between different institutions within a financial system. This approach is based on a network model that describes the effect of overlapping portfolios. This network metric is applied to synthetic and real world data to illustrate that the effect of common exposures is not fully reflected in single portfolio concentration measures. It also allows to quantify several aspects of the interplay between interconnectedness and credit risk. Using this network measure, we formulate an analytical approximation for the additional capital requirement corresponding to the systemic risk arising from credit concentration interconnectedness. Our methodology also avoids double counting between the granularity adjustment and the common exposure adjustment. Although approximated, this common exposure adjustment is able to capture, with only two parameters, an aspect of systemic risk that can extend single portfolios view to a system-wide one."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary objective of the proposed network measure for systemic credit concentration risk, and how does it differ from single portfolio concentration measures?\n\n**A)** To quantify the impact of common exposures on credit risk, allowing for a system-wide view of interconnectedness and risk.\n**B)** To estimate the additional capital requirement for individual institutions, avoiding double counting between granularity adjustment and common exposure adjustment.\n**C)** To measure the effect of overlapping portfolios on credit concentration risk, providing a more accurate representation of systemic risk.\n**D)** To develop a new method for calculating credit risk, focusing on the impact of interconnectedness on credit concentration risk.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) To quantify the impact of common exposures on credit risk, allowing for a system-wide view of interconnectedness and risk.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe proposed network measure aims to capture the systemic effect of common exposures between different institutions within a financial system.

In this work, we present a nonperturbative theoretical approach to the quasirepulsive upper branch of a Fermi gas near a broad Feshbach resonance, and we determine the finite-temperature phase diagram for the Stoner instability. Our results agree well with the known quantum Monte-Carlo simulations at zero temperature, and we recover the known virial expansion prediction at high temperature for arbitrary interaction strengths.
