It seems to be very unlikely that all relevant information in the stock market could be fully encoded in a geometrical shape.

The prices of market index (DJIA) stock components are arranged in ascending order from the smallest one in the left to the highest in the right. In such arrangement, as stock prices changes due to daily market quotations, it could be noticed that the price of a certain stock get over /under the price of a neighbor stock. These stocks are crossing. Arranged this way, the diagram of successive stock crossings is nothing else than a permutation diagram. From this point on the financial and combinatorial concepts are netted together to build a bridge connecting the stock market to a beautiful geometrical object that will be called stock market polytope.

So far climate change aspects have been the dominant aspect in managing sustainability risks and opportunities, accompanied by the development of several legislative initiatives triggered by supervisory authorities. However, a sole concentration on these aspects misses out other important economic and social facets of sustainable development goals formulated by the UN. Such aspects have very recently come into the focus of the European Committee concerning the Solvency II project for the European insurance industry. Clearly the new legislative expectations can be better handled by larger insurance companies and holdings than by small- and medium-sized mutual insurance companies which are numerous in central Europe, due to their historic development starting in the late medieval ages and early modern times.

It is found that overall the best set of BLVs to initialize a (multiscale) coupled ocean-atmosphere forecasting system are the ones associated with near-neutral or slightly negative Lyapunov exponents.

The latter dynamics is a natural property of any generic perturbation in nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems, allowing for a reliable spread with the atmosphere too.

The documentation states that BLVs associated with near-neutral or slightly negative Lyapunov exponents are unexpectedly the best for initializing coupled ocean-atmosphere forecasting systems.
