Currently, most of the approaches used to establish the battery-state (i.e., State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH)) require time-consuming processes. In the present preliminary study, an ultrasound array was used to assess the influence of the SoC and SoH on the variations in the time of flight (TOF) and the speed of sound (SOS) of the ultrasound wave inside the batteries. Nine aged 18650 Lithium-ion batteries were imaged at 100% and 0% SoC using a Vantage-256 system (Verasonics, Inc.) equipped with a 64-element ultrasound array and a center frequency of 5 MHz (Imasonic SAS). It was found that second-life batteries have a complex ultrasound response due to the presence of many degradation pathways and, thus, making it harder to analyze the ultrasound measurements.

The correct answer is A because the documentation states that when z > r (where z is the density of facilitators and r is the cost-to-benefit ratio), and under weak selection pressure, invasion and replacement of defection by cooperation is favored by selection if b(z-r)(1-z) > 1/N.

In this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a bistable interstellar medium is investigated using two-dimensional simulations with a realistic cooling rate, thermal conduction, and physical viscosity. The calculations are performed using periodic boundary conditions without any external dynamical forcing. As the initial condition, a spatially uniform unstable gas under thermal equilibrium is considered. At the initial stage, the unstable gas quickly segregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM). Then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of $0.1-0.2\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}}$ is observed in which the CNM moves around in the WNM. We find that the interfacial medium (IFM) between the CNM and WNM plays an important role in sustaining the turbulence. The self-sustaining mechanism can be divided into two steps. First, thermal conduction drives fast flows streaming into concave CNM surfaces towards the WNM. The kinetic energy of the fast flows in the IFM is incorporated into that of the CNM through the phase transition. Second, turbulence inside the CNM deforms interfaces and forms other concave CNM surfaces, leading to fast flows in the IFM.

The polarization of light is utilized in many technologies throughout science and engineering. The ability to transform one state of polarization to another is a key enabling technology. Common polarization transformers are simple polarizers and polarization rotators. Simple polarizers change the intensity depending on the input state and can only output a fixed polarized state, while polarization rotators rotates the input Stokes vector in the 3D Stokes space. We experimentally demonstrate an all-optical input-agnostic polarization transformer (AI-APT), which transforms all input states of polarization to a particular state that can be polarized or partially polarized. The output state of polarization and intensity depends solely on setup parameters, and not on the input state, thereby the AI-APT functions differently from simple polarizers and polarization rotators. The AI-APT is completely passive, and thus can be used as a polarization controller or stabilizer for single photons and ultrafast pulses. To achieve this, we, for the first time, experimentally realize complete kinematic state controllability of an open single-qubit by Kraus maps put forth in [Wu et al. J. Phys. A 40, 5681 (2007)].

In this paper, we present a new black-box attack termed AdvFoolGen, which can generate attacking images from the same feature space as that of the natural images, so as to keep baffling the network even though state-of-the-art defense mechanisms have been applied. We systematically evaluate our model by comparing with well-established attack algorithms.

In this work, starting from a modified version of one-spatial dimensional general inhomogeneous split-step discrete quantum walk we derive an effective Hamiltonian which mimics a single massive Dirac particle dynamics in curved $(1+1)$ space-time dimension coupled to $U(1)$ gauge potential---which is a forward step towards the simulation of the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational forces in lower dimension and at the single particle level.
