The Contractor Renormalization group formalism (CORE) is a real-space renormalization group method which is the Hamiltonian analogue of the Wilson exact renormalization group equations. In an earlier paper\\cite{QGAF} I showed that the Contractor Renormalization group (CORE) method could be used to map a theory of free quarks, and quarks interacting with gluons, into a generalized frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) and proposed using CORE methods to study these theories. Since generalizations of HAF's exhibit all sorts of subtle behavior which, from a continuum point of view, are related to topological properties of the theory, it is important to know that CORE can be used to extract this physics. In this paper I show that despite the folklore which asserts that all real-space renormalization group schemes are necessarily inaccurate, simple Contractor Renormalization group (CORE) computations can give highly accurate results even if one only keeps a small number of states per block and a few terms in the cluster expansion. In addition I argue that even very simple CORE computations give a much better qualitative understanding of the physics than naive renormalization group methods.

Federated learning is a distributed framework according to which a model is trained over a set of devices, while keeping data localized. This framework faces several systems-oriented challenges which include (i) communication bottleneck since a large number of devices upload their local updates to a parameter server, and (ii) scalability as the federated network consists of millions of devices. Due to these systems challenges as well as issues related to statistical heterogeneity of data and privacy concerns, designing a provably efficient federated learning method is of significant importance yet it remains challenging.

Fast-Skip Regularization (FSR) primarily aims to accelerate the inference process of transducer-based models. It does this by aligning the blank token positions predicted by the transducer with those predicted by a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) model during training. During inference, this alignment allows the transducer to use a simple CTC projection layer to predict blank tokens in advance, without requiring the more computationally expensive forward calculations of the transducer decoder. This enables the model to skip the processing of blank tokens, which account for about 90% of all tokens, thus significantly reducing computation time and improving inference speed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because FSR doesn't eliminate blank tokens; it optimizes their prediction and processing.\nAnswer B is partially correct in mentioning alignment with a CTC model, but it misses the primary purpose of improving inference speed.\nAnswer D is incorrect as FSR doesn't focus on enhancing the acoustic model's performance or regularizing hidden states.\n\nThe key point is that FSR allows for faster processing by predicting and skipping blank tokens efficiently, leading to a significant speedup (nearly 4 times, according to the document) with only a slight performance degradation."}, "35": {"documentation": {"title": "Optical spectroscopy of SDSS J004054.65-0915268: three possible\n  scenarios for the classification.

Asynchronous methods for solving systems of linear equations have been researched since Chazan and Miranker's pioneering 1969 paper on chaotic relaxation. The underlying idea of asynchronous methods is to avoid processor idle time by allowing the processors to continue to make progress even if not all progress made by other processors has been communicated to them. Historically, the applicability of asynchronous methods for solving linear equations was limited to certain restricted classes of matrices, such as diagonally dominant matrices. Furthermore, analysis of these methods focused on proving convergence in the limit. Comparison of the asynchronous convergence rate with its synchronous counterpart and its scaling with the number of processors were seldom studied, and are still not well understood.
