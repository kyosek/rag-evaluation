Heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC give access to the medium-induced suppression patterns of heavy-flavored single inclusive hadron spectra at high transverse momentum. This opens novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of the medium produced in the collision. In this note, we point out that the capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic projectile is an independent signature, which may differ for different media at the same density. In particular, while the mass hierarchy (i.e., the projectile mass dependence) of radiative energy loss depends solely on a property of the projectile, the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss depends significantly on properties of the medium. By varying these properties in a class of models, we find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative parton energy loss. This may help to disentangle the relative strengths of radiative and collisional contributions to jet quenching, and it may be employed to constrain properties of the produced QCD medium beyond its density."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is a key finding from the study on varying and inverting the mass hierarchy in collisional energy loss, and how does it relate to the characterization of the QCD medium produced in heavy ion collisions?\n\nA) The mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss is independent of the medium's properties and only depends on the projectile's mass.\nB) The mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted compared to radiative parton energy loss, allowing for a more detailed characterization of the QCD medium.\nC) The capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic projectile is a signature that is the same for all media at the same density.\nD) The mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss is solely determined by the properties of the projectile and not by the properties of the medium.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted compared to radiative parton energy loss, allowing for a more detailed characterization of the QCD medium.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the study found that the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted compared to radiative parton energy loss.

When a single cell senses a chemical gradient and chemotaxes, stochastic receptor-ligand binding can be a fundamental limit to the cell's accuracy. For clusters of cells responding to gradients, however, there is a critical difference: even genetically identical cells have differing responses to chemical signals. With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is limited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling. We find that when different cells cooperate the resulting bias can be much larger than the effects of ligand-receptor binding. Specifically, when a strongly-responding cell is at one end of a cell cluster, cluster motion is biased toward that cell. These errors are mitigated if clusters average measurements over times long enough for cells to rearrange.

Heavy fermion pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation is a fundamental process in hadron physics and is of considerable interest for various phenomena.

The PMC provides a systematic, unambiguous method for determining the renormalization scales of the QCD coupling constant for single-scale and multiple-scale applications. The resulting predictions eliminate any renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities, eliminate the factorial renormalon divergences, and are consistent with the requirements of the renormalization group.

We have grown and studied high quality SrRuO3 films grown by MBE as well as PLD. By changing the oxygen activity during deposition we were able to make SrRuO3 samples that were stoichiometric (low oxygen activity) or with ruthenium vacancies (high oxygen activity). Samples with strontium vacancies were found impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO2. The volume of the unit cell of SrRuO3 becomes larger as more ruthenium vacancies are introduced. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and room temperature resistivity were found to systematically depend on the volume of the unit cell and therefore on the amount of ruthenium vacancies.
