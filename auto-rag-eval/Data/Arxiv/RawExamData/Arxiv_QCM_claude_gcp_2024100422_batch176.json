One main barrier is the over-fitting issue that leads to poor generalizability of the policy learned by DRL. In particular, for offline DRL with observational data, model selection is a challenging task as there is no ground truth available for performance demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments. In this work, we propose a pessimistic model selection (PMS) approach for offline DRL with a theoretical guarantee, which features a provably effective framework for finding the best policy among a set of candidate models.

The Pessimistic Model Selection (PMS) approach primarily addresses the challenge of model selection in offline DRL. This is particularly problematic compared to online DRL because, as stated in the documentation, \"there is no ground truth available for performance demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments.\" In online DRL, the model can be tested and evaluated in real-time within a simulated environment, providing clear performance metrics. However, in offline DRL, which relies on observational data, there's no way to directly test the model's performance, making it difficult to select the best model or policy from a set of candidates. The PMS approach aims to provide a framework for effectively finding the best policy among candidate models in this challenging offline context."}, "43": {"documentation": {"title": "Exciting extreme events in the damped and AC-driven NLS equation through\n  plane wave initial conditions", "source": "Sevastos Diamantidis, Theodoros P.

In this paper, we develop computationally efficient Bayesian methods for estimating TVP models using an integrated rotated Gaussian approximation (IRGA).

This approach exploits the fact that while constant coefficients on regressors are often important, most of the time-varying parameters (TVPs) are often unimportant. By using rotations of Gaussian distributions, the posterior can be split into two parts: one for constant coefficients and another for TVPs.
