For carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting hydrogen or helium at rates in the range ~1-10 x 10^(-8) Msun/y, a variety of explosive outcomes is possible well before the star reaches the Chandrasekhar mass. These outcomes are surveyed for a range of white dwarf masses (0.7 - 1.1 Msun), accretion rates (1 - 7 x 10^(-8) Msun/y), and initial white dwarf temperatures (0.01 and 1 Lsun). The results are particularly sensitive to the convection that goes on during the last few minutes before the explosion. Unless this convection maintains a shallow temperature gradient, and unless the density is sufficiently high, the accreted helium does not detonate. Below a critical helium ignition density, which we estimate to be 5 - 10 x 10^5 g cm^(-3), either helium novae or helium deflagrations result. The hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, light curves, and spectra of a representative sample of detonating and deflagrating models are explored. Some can be quite faint indeed, powered at peak for a few days by the decay of 48Cr and 48V. Only the hottest, most massive white dwarfs considered with the smallest helium layers, show reasonable agreement with the light curves and spectra of common Type Ia supernovae. For the other models, especially those involving lighter white dwarfs, the helium shell mass exceeds 0.05 Msun and the mass of the 56Ni that is synthesized exceeds 0.01 Msun.

We report a method for growing 2D nanosheets of hybrid lead halide perovskites (I, Br and Cl), with tunable lateral sizes ranging from 0.05 to 8 microns, and a structure consisting of n stacked monolayers separated by long alkylamines, tunable from bulk down to n=1. The key to obtaining such a wide range of perovskite properties hinged on utilizing the respective lead halide nanosheets as precursors in a hot-injection synthesis that afforded careful control over all process parameters. The layered, quantum confined (n small than 4) nanosheets were comprised of major and minor fractions with differing n. Energy funneling from low to high n (high to low energy) regions within a single sheet, mediated by the length of the ligands between stacks, produced photoluminescent quantum yields as high as 49 percent.

With the rising popularity of intelligent mobile devices, it is of great practical significance to develop accurate, realtime and energy-efficient image Super-Resolution (SR) inference methods. A prevailing method for improving the inference efficiency is model quantization, which allows for replacing the expensive floating-point operations with efficient fixed-point or bitwise arithmetic. To date, it is still challenging for quantized SR frameworks to deliver feasible accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Here, we propose a Fully Quantized image Super-Resolution framework (FQSR) to jointly optimize efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we target on obtaining end-to-end quantized models for all layers, especially including skip connections, which was rarely addressed in the literature. We further identify training obstacles faced by low-bit SR networks and propose two novel methods accordingly. The two difficulites are caused by 1) activation and weight distributions being vastly distinctive in different layers; 2) the inaccurate approximation of the quantization. We apply our quantization scheme on multiple mainstream super-resolution architectures, including SRResNet, SRGAN and EDSR.

We present an analysis of the swimming path geometries based on a volumetric Monte Carlo sampling approach, which is particularly adept at revealing such trade-offs by measuring the self-overlap of the trajectories.

This paper proposes speaker-adaptive neural vocoders for parametric text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Recently proposed WaveNet-based neural vocoding systems successfully generate a time sequence of speech signal with an autoregressive framework. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize high-quality speech when the amount of a target speaker's training data is insufficient. To generate more natural speech signals with the constraint of limited training data, we propose a speaker adaptation task with an effective variation of neural vocoding models. In the proposed method, a speaker-independent training method is applied to capture universal attributes embedded in multiple speakers, and the trained model is then optimized to represent the specific characteristics of the target speaker. Experimental results verify that the proposed TTS systems with speaker-adaptive neural vocoders outperform those with traditional source-filter model-based vocoders and those with WaveNet vocoders, trained either speaker-dependently or speaker-independently.
