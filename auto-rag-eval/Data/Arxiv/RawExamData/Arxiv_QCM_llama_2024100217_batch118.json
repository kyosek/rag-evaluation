The total storage budget is $S$ and the size of the original data object is $D$. The data collector attempts to recover the original data object by accessing only the data stored in a random subset of the nodes. Assuming that the optimal storage allocation is achieved when the probability of successful recovery is maximized, determine the optimal storage allocation for the following scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:** The storage nodes are identical and the access model is uniform, i.e., each node has an equal probability of being accessed.\n\n**Scenario 2:** The storage nodes are heterogeneous and the access model is biased towards nodes with higher storage capacity.\n\n**Scenario 3:** The storage nodes are identical, but the access model is non-uniform, i.e., some nodes have a higher probability of being accessed than others.\n\n**A)** For Scenario 1, the optimal storage allocation is to distribute the data evenly across all nodes, i.e., each node stores $\\frac{S}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes.\n\n**B)** For Scenario 1, the optimal storage allocation is to store the entire data object in a single node, i.e., one node stores $S$ and the other nodes store $0$.\n\n**C)** For Scenario 2, the optimal storage allocation is to store the entire data object in the node with the highest storage capacity, i.e., one node stores $S$ and the other nodes store $0$.\n\n**D)** For Scenario 3, the optimal storage allocation is to store the entire data object in the node with the highest probability of being accessed, i.e., one node stores $S$ and the other nodes store $0$.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) For Scenario 1, the optimal storage allocation is to distribute the data evenly across all nodes, i.e., each node stores $\\frac{S}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes.\n\n**Explanation:** The optimal storage allocation for Scenario 1 can be determined by maximizing the probability of successful recovery. Since the access model is uniform, the probability of successful recovery is maximized when the data is distributed evenly across all nodes. This is because the data collector can recover the original data object by accessing any subset of nodes, and the probability of successful recovery is maximized when the data is spread out across all nodes.\n\nFor Scenario 2, the optimal storage allocation is not necessarily to store the entire data object in a single node. The data collector may need to access multiple nodes to recover the original data object, and the probability of successful recovery may be lower if the data is concentrated in a single node.\n\nFor Scenario 3, the optimal storage allocation depends on the specific access model. If the access model is biased towards nodes with higher storage capacity, it may be beneficial to store the entire data object in a single node. However, if the access model is biased towards nodes with lower storage capacity, it may be beneficial to distribute the data evenly across all nodes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) For Scenario 1, the optimal storage allocation is to distribute the data evenly across all nodes, i.e., each node stores $\\frac{S}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes."}, "3": {"documentation": {"title": "Weiss mean-field approximation for multicomponent stochastic spatially\n  extended systems", "source": "Svetlana E.

Researchers often face data fusion problems, where multiple data sources are available, each capturing a distinct subset of variables. While problem formulations typically take the data as given, in practice, data acquisition can be an ongoing process. In this paper, we aim to estimate any functional of a probabilistic model (e.g., a causal effect) as efficiently as possible, by deciding, at each time, which data source to query. We propose online moment selection (OMS), a framework in which structural assumptions are encoded as moment conditions. The optimal action at each step depends, in part, on the very moments that identify the functional of interest. Our algorithms balance exploration with choosing the best action as suggested by current estimates of the moments. We propose two selection strategies: (1) explore-then-commit (OMS-ETC) and (2) explore-then-greedy (OMS-ETG), proving that both achieve zero asymptotic regret as assessed by MSE.

Value [4][5] is typically modeled using a continuous representation (i.e., a Real number). A discrete representation of value has recently been postulated [6]. A quantized representation of probability in the brain was also posited and supported by experimental data [7]. Value and probability are inter-related via Prospect Theory [4][5]. In this paper, we hypothesize that intertemporal choices may also be quantized. For example, people may treat (or discount) 16 days indifferently to 17 days. To test this, we analyzed an intertemporal task by using 2 novel models: quantized hyperbolic discounting, and quantized exponential discounting. Our work here is a re-examination of the behavioral data previously collected for an fMRI study [8]. Both quantized hyperbolic and quantized exponential models were compared using AIC and BIC tests. We found that 13/20 participants were best fit to the quantized exponential model, while the remaining 7/20 were best fit to the quantized hyperbolic model. Overall, 15/20 participants were best fit to models with a 5-bit precision (i.e., 2^5 = 32 steps).

Rev. 92, 023610 (2015)] for a parity-mixing effect in a model two-dimensional lattice fermions to a realistic three-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas. Including effects of broken local spatial inversion symmetry by a trap potential within the framework of the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory at $T=0$, we point out that an odd-parity $p$-wave Cooper-pair amplitude is expected to have already been realized in previous experiments on an (even-parity) $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas with spin imbalance. This indicates that, when one suddenly changes the $s$-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate $p$-wave one by using a Feshbach technique in this case, a non-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter is immediately obtained, which is given by the product of the $p$-wave interaction and the $p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the spin-imbalanced $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas. Thus, by definition, the system is in the $p$-wave superfluid state, at least just after this manipulation. Since the achievement of a $p$-wave superfluid state is one of the most exciting challenges in cold Fermi gas physics, our results may provide an alternative approach to this unconventional pairing state.

Recent work finds that this likelihood of encoding a given entity - memorability - is highly consistent across viewers and intrinsic to an image; people tend to remember and forget the same images. However, several forces influence our memories beyond the memorability of the stimulus itself - for example, how attention-grabbing the stimulus is, how much attentional resources we dedicate to the task, or how primed we are for that stimulus. How does memorability interact with these various phenomena, and could any of them explain the effects of memorability found in prior work?

We propose a new ABC method for high dimensional data based on rare event methods which we refer to as RE-ABC. This uses a latent variable representation of the model. For a given parameter value, we estimate the probability of the rare event that the latent variables correspond to data roughly consistent with the observations. This is performed using sequential Monte Carlo and slice sampling to systematically search the space of latent variables. In contrast standard ABC can be viewed as using a more naive Monte Carlo estimate.

We observed a sunspot with a main umbra and several additional umbral cores, one of them with opposite magnetic polarity (the delta-umbra).
