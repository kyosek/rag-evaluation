Recently, AutoVC, a conditional autoencoders (CAEs) based method achieved state-of-the-art results by disentangling the speaker identity and speech content using information-constraining bottlenecks, and it achieves zero-shot conversion by swapping in a different speaker's identity embedding to synthesize a new voice.

In the paper, we modified and improved autoencoder-based voice conversion to disentangle content, F0, and speaker identity at the same time.

In practice, many companies rely on nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to find key risk metrics.

There is therefore a need to explore new active site origins in molybdenum disulfide with ultrafast reaction kinetics and to understand their mechanisms.

Adopting adiabatic (WKB) approximation or adiabatic regularization methods, we clearly show that vacuum fluctuations of the Higgs field in the FLRW background depend on the curvature and also masses of the Higgs or other scalar fields. The Higgs fluctuations can generate true vacuum bubbles and trigger off a collapse of the electroweak vacuum.

With the development of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission.
