The resultant mixed timescale design problem is an anticausal problem because the optimal cache allocation depends on the future file requests. To handle it, a two-stage optimization scheme is proposed by utilizing historical knowledge of users' requests and channel state information.

Since Kolmogorov proposed his phenomenological theory of hydrodynamic turbulence in 1941, the description of mechanism leading to the energy cascade and anomalous scaling remains an open problem in fluid mechanics. Soon after, in 1949 Onsager noticed that the scaling properties in inertial range imply non-differentiability of the velocity field in the limit of vanishing viscosity. This observation suggests that the turbulence mechanism may be related to a finite-time singularity (blowup) of incompressible Euler equations. However, the existence of such blowup is still an open problem too.

Here, blowups generate coherent structures (instantons), which travel through the inertial range in finite time and are described by universal self-similar statistics.

The anomaly, or deviation of scaling exponents from Kolmogorov theory, is analytically related to the process of instanton creation using the large deviation principle.

GATs leverage a self-attention mechanism over graph structured data to model the data manifold and the relationships between nodes. Our graph is constructed from representations produced by a ResNet. Nodes in the graph represent information either in specific sub-bands or temporal segments. Experiments performed on the ASVspoof 2019 logical access database show that our GAT-based model with temporal attention outperforms all of our baseline single systems.

We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian.

Finance is about how the continuous stream of news gets incorporated into prices. But not all news have the same impact. Can one distinguish the effects of the Sept. 11, 2001 attack or of the coup against Gorbachev on Aug., 19, 1991 from financial crashes such as Oct. 1987 as well as smaller volatility bursts? Using a parsimonious autoregressive process with long-range memory defined on the logarithm of the volatility, we predict strikingly different response functions of the price volatility to great external shocks compared to what we term endogeneous shocks, i.e., which result from the cooperative accumulation of many small shocks. These predictions are remarkably well-confirmed empirically on a hierarchy of volatility shocks. Our theory allows us to classify two classes of events (endogeneous and exogeneous) with specific signatures and characteristic precursors for the endogeneous class. It also explains the origin of endogeneous shocks as the coherent accumulations of tiny bad news, and thus unify all previous explanations of large crashes including Oct. 1987."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the research described, which of the following statements best characterizes the difference between endogenous and exogenous shocks in financial markets?\n\nA) Endogenous shocks are caused by single large events, while exogenous shocks result from the accumulation of small events.\n\nB) Exogenous shocks, such as the September 11 attacks, have a different volatility fingerprint compared to endogenous shocks like the 1987 stock market crash.\n\nC) Endogenous shocks can be predicted with high accuracy, while exogenous shocks are completely unpredictable.\n\nD) Exogenous shocks always lead to larger market volatility than endogenous shocks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The research described in the text distinguishes between exogenous shocks (like the September 11 attacks or the coup against Gorbachev) and endogenous shocks (such as the October 1987 market crash). The key finding is that these two types of shocks have \"strikingly different response functions of the price volatility,\" which can be interpreted as different volatility fingerprints.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it reverses the definitions of endogenous and exogenous shocks.

For this purpose, we introduce the concept of edge anisotropy and define a class of measures characterizing the spatial directedness of connections. Specifically, we demonstrate that the local anisotropy of edges incident to a given vertex provides useful information about the local geometry of geophysical flows based on networks constructed from spatio-temporal data, which is complementary to topological characteristics of the same flow networks.

Here, we exploit the non-linear conversion operation in the eavesdropper's receiver to obtain the desired advantage - even when the eavesdropper has perfect access to the transmitted signal at the input to their receiver.
