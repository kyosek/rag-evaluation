Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer cells is widely observed and is often linked to drug resistance. In several cases, such heterogeneity in drug sensitivity of tumors is driven by stochastic and reversible acquisition of a drug tolerant phenotype by individual cells even in an isogenic population. Accumulating evidence further suggests that cell-fate transitions such as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated with drug resistance. In this study, we analyze stochastic models of phenotypic switching to provide a framework for analyzing cell-fate transitions such as EMT as a source of phenotypic variability in drug sensitivity. Motivated by our cell-culture based experimental observations connecting phenotypic switching in EMT and drug resistance, we analyze a coarse-grained model of phenotypic switching between two states in the presence of cytotoxic stress from chemotherapy. We derive analytical results for time-dependent probability distributions that provide insights into the rates of phenotypic switching and characterize initial phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells.

The recent progress on capsule networks by Hinton et al. has generated considerable excitement in the machine learning community. The idea behind a capsule is inspired by a cortical minicolumn in the brain, whereby a vertically organised group of around 100 neurons receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computation unit of the cerebral cortex.

A recent suggestion that vector potentials in electrodynamics (ED) are nontensorial objects under 4D frame rotations is found to be both unnecessary and confusing. As traditionally used in ED, a vector potential $A$ always transforms homogeneously under 4D rotations in spacetime, but if the gauge is changed by the rotation, one can restore the gauge back to the original gauge by adding an inhomogeneous term. It is then \"not a 4-vector\", but two: one for rotation and one for translation. For such a gauge, it is much more important to preserve {\\it explicit} homogeneous Lorentz covariance by simply skipping the troublesome gauge-restoration step. A gauge-independent separation of $A$ into a dynamical term and a non-dynamical term in Abelian gauge theories is re-defined more generally as the terms caused by the presence and absence respectively of the 4-current term in the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations for $A$. Such a separation {\\it cannot} in general be extended to non-Abelian theories where $A$ satisfies nonlinear differential equations.

This solution directly addresses the challenges presented in the question and aligns with the key concepts introduced in the documentation.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that existing sequential kernels often ignore time indices or assume regular spacing, which is not suitable for the given scenario with irregular data collection intervals.

The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would show that lepton number is violated and that neutrinos are Majorana particles and would simultaneously provide information on neutrino mass.

The correct answer (C) addresses several key points:\n\n1. Scaling up to tonne-scale: The documentation states that \"Attaining sensitivities for neutrino masses in the inverted hierarchy region, 15 - 50 meV, will require large, tonne-scale detectors.\" This is directly addressed in option C.\n\n2. Background reduction: The documentation mentions the need for \"extremely low backgrounds, at the level of ~1 count/t-y or lower.\" Option C proposes reducing background to 0.5 counts/t-y, which is even better than the stated requirement.\n\n3. Enrichment level: The current DEMONSTRATOR uses 87% enriched 76Ge, which is maintained in option C. This is a reasonable choice, as increasing enrichment further (as in option D) would likely be prohibitively expensive without providing proportional benefits.\n\nOption A increases the mass but not to the required tonne-scale, and the higher enrichment alone wouldn't compensate for this.\n\nOption B focuses on depth, which can help reduce backgrounds, but using natural germanium would significantly reduce sensitivity due to the lower abundance of the isotope of interest.\n\nOption D increases enrichment but doesn't address the critical factors of scaling to tonne-scale and reducing background levels.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the key factors influencing experimental sensitivity and apply them to a real-world scenario of designing an improved experiment, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "64": {"documentation": {"title": "The paradox of the infinity", "source": "Mohamed Ayad and Omar Kihel", "docs_id": "2106.01311", "section": ["math.NT"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "The paradox of the infinity. \\textit{Let $E$ be an infinite set on which a property $(\\bf P)$ is defined.

We show that, under certain circumstances, overtaking is good because it increases the road capacity and minimizes the mean time spent by the driver on the road. However, when these conditions are not met, overtaking is harmful to all. More specifically, we found that a social dilemma emerges in the vicinity of the transition to the congested traffic if the probability of random deceleration is low, which can also happen in more realistic single-lane models.

The model consists of a large population of phase oscillators with all-to-all sinusoidal coupling. The oscillators' intrinsic frequencies are randomly distributed across the population according to a prescribed probability density, here taken to be unimodal and symmetric about its mean.

Using Rational Choice Theory (RCT), neoclassical economics assumes that exchange between two individuals will occur when resources are scarce and that these individuals interact rationally to satisfy their requirements (i.e., preferences).

Which of the following best explains this counterintuitive outcome and its implications for the emerging market economy?\n\nA) The interest rate hike was smaller than expected, leading to capital inflows to emerging markets seeking higher yields\nB) The Federal Reserve's announcement revealed positive information about global economic conditions, outweighing the direct effect of higher US interest rates\nC) The emerging market's central bank likely intervened in the forex market to artificially strengthen its currency\nD) Investors anticipate that the rate hike will slow US economic growth, making emerging markets more attractive investment destinations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the information effect in monetary policy, as described in the paper. The correct answer (B) directly relates to the paper's finding that \"For several FOMC announcements dates, emerging market economies' exchange rate strengthened relative to the US dollar, in contrast to what the standard theory predicts. These results are in line with the information effect, which denote the Federal Reserve's disclosure of information about the state of the economy.\"\n\nThis phenomenon occurs when the Federal Reserve's actions reveal positive information about economic conditions that outweighs the direct impact of higher interest rates. This information effect can lead to counterintuitive outcomes in emerging markets, such as currency appreciation instead of depreciation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a smaller-than-expected rate hike would typically lead to dollar weakness, not emerging market currency strength. Option C is a plausible distractor but doesn't explain the systematic pattern observed across multiple emerging markets. Option D represents a common misconception about the relationship between US interest rates and emerging market attractiveness.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the concept of information effects in monetary policy, integration of multiple ideas from the documentation, and consideration of real-world economic scenarios. It tests critical thinking about the complex interactions between US monetary policy and emerging market economies, going beyond simple memorization of facts."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "Pattern formation in one-dimensional polaron systems and temporal\n  orthogonality catastrophe", "source": "G.

Recent studies have demonstrated that higher than two-body bath-impurity correlations are not important for quantitatively describing the ground state of the Bose polaron. Motivated by the above, we employ the so-called Gross Ansatz (GA) approach to unravel the stationary and dynamical properties of the homogeneous one-dimensional Bose-polaron for different impurity momenta and bath-impurity couplings. We explicate that the character of the equilibrium state crossovers from the quasi-particle Bose polaron regime to the collective-excitation stationary dark-bright soliton for varying impurity momentum and interactions. Following an interspecies interaction quench the temporal orthogonality catastrophe is identified, provided that bath-impurity interactions are sufficiently stronger than the intraspecies bath ones, thus generalizing the results of the confined case. This catastrophe originates from the formation of dispersive shock wave structures associated with the zero-range character of the bath-impurity potential. For initially moving impurities, a momentum transfer process from the impurity to the dispersive shock waves via the exerted drag force is demonstrated, resulting in a final polaronic state with reduced velocity. Our results clearly demonstrate the crucial role of non-linear excitations for determining the behavior of the one-dimensional Bose polaron."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about one-dimensional polaron systems, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the behavior of a one-dimensional Bose polaron system after an interspecies interaction quench. Under which conditions is the temporal orthogonality catastrophe most likely to occur, and what physical phenomenon is associated with its onset?\n\nA) When bath-impurity interactions are slightly stronger than intraspecies bath interactions, due to the formation of stable dark-bright solitons\nB) When bath-impurity interactions are significantly weaker than intraspecies bath interactions, resulting in the creation of quasi-particle Bose polarons\nC) When bath-impurity interactions are substantially stronger than intraspecies bath interactions, leading to the formation of dispersive shock wave structures\nD) When bath-impurity and intraspecies bath interactions are of equal strength, causing a crossover between quasi-particle and soliton regimes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests the understanding of complex interactions in one-dimensional polaron systems and the conditions leading to the temporal orthogonality catastrophe. The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"the temporal orthogonality catastrophe is identified, provided that bath-impurity interactions are sufficiently stronger than the intraspecies bath ones.\" This catastrophe is explicitly linked to \"the formation of dispersive shock wave structures associated with the zero-range character of the bath-impurity potential.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while dark-bright solitons are mentioned in the text, they are associated with the equilibrium state crossover, not the temporal orthogonality catastrophe. Option B is wrong as it describes conditions opposite to those required for the catastrophe. Option D is a distractor that combines elements from the text but does not accurately describe the conditions for the temporal orthogonality catastrophe.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including bath-impurity interaction strengths, temporal orthogonality catastrophe, and dispersive shock waves. It also tests the ability to apply these concepts to a hypothetical research scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and application."}}
