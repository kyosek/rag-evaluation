We present a data-driven nonintrusive model order reduction method for dynamical systems with moving boundaries. The proposed method draws on the proper orthogonal decomposition, Gaussian process regression, and moving least squares interpolation. It combines several attributes that are not simultaneously satisfied in the existing model order reduction methods for dynamical systems with moving boundaries. Specifically, the method requires only snapshot data of state variables at discrete time instances and the parameters that characterize the boundaries, but not further knowledge of the full-order model and the underlying governing equations. The dynamical systems can be generally nonlinear. The movements of boundaries are not limited to prescribed or periodic motions but can be free motions. In addition, we numerically investigate the ability of the reduced order model constructed by the proposed method to forecast the full-order solutions for future times beyond the range of snapshot data. The error analysis for the proposed reduced order modeling and the criteria to determine the furthest forecast time are also provided.

The economic downturn and the air travel crisis triggered by the recent coronavirus pandemic pose a substantial threat to the new consumer class of many emerging economies. In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades.

An Analysis of the Disposition Effect in\n  Bitcoin. Investors tend to sell their winning investments and hold onto their losers. This phenomenon, known as the \\emph{disposition effect} in the field of behavioural finance, is well-known and its prevalence has been shown in a number of existing markets. But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis. Our results show that investors are indeed subject to the disposition effect, tending to sell their winning positions too soon and holding on to their losing position for too long.

Channel allocation is the task of assigning channels to users such that some objective (e.g., sum-rate) is maximized. In centralized networks such as cellular networks, this task is carried by the base station which gathers the channel state information (CSI) from the users and computes the optimal solution. In distributed networks such as ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks, no base station exists and conveying global CSI between users is costly or simply impractical. When the CSI is time varying and unknown to the users, the users face the challenge of both learning the channel statistics online and converge to a good channel allocation. This introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) scenario with multiple decision makers. If two users or more choose the same channel, a collision occurs and they all receive zero reward.
