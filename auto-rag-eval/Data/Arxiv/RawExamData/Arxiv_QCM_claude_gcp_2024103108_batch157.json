We study the rock-paper-scissors game in structured populations, where the invasion rates determine individual payoffs that govern the process of strategy change. The traditional version of the game is recovered if the payoffs for each potential invasion stem from a single pairwise interaction. However, the transformation of invasion rates to payoffs also allows the usage of larger interaction ranges. In addition to the traditional pairwise interaction, we therefore consider simultaneous interactions with all nearest neighbors, as well as with all nearest and next-nearest neighbors, thus effectively going from single pair to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance. We show that differences in the interaction range affect not only the stationary fractions of strategies, but also their relations of dominance. The transition from pairwise to group interactions can thus decelerate and even revert the direction of the invasion between the competing strategies. Like in evolutionary social dilemmas, in games of cyclic dominance too the indirect multipoint interactions that are due to group interactions hence play a pivotal role.

Graph models are widely used to analyse diffusion processes embedded in social contacts and to develop applications. A range of graph models are available to replicate the underlying social structures and dynamics realistically. However, most of the current graph models can only consider concurrent interactions among individuals in the co-located interaction networks. However, they do not account for indirect interactions that can transmit spreading items to individuals who visit the same locations at different times but within a certain time limit. The diffusion phenomena occurring through direct and indirect interactions is called same place different time (SPDT) diffusion. This paper introduces a model to synthesize co-located interaction graphs capturing both direct interactions, where individuals meet at a location, and indirect interactions, where individuals visit the same location at different times within a set timeframe. We analyze 60 million location updates made by 2 million users from a social networking application to characterize the graph properties, including the space-time correlations and its time evolving characteristics, such as bursty or ongoing behaviors.

This type of model, as described in the document, can account for both concurrent interactions (direct) and indirect interactions where individuals visit the same location at different times within a set timeframe.

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field that has attracted considerable research interest over the past few years.

In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS.

It is still unclear how to ingrate DR transportation into current transit systems to take full advantage of it. We propose a Continuous Approximation model of a transit system that gets the best from fixed-route and DR transit. Our model allows to decide, in each area and time of day, whether to deploy a fixed-route or a DR feeder, and to redesign line frequencies and stop spacing of the main trunk service accordingly.

The vivid success of the emerging wireless sensor technology (WSN) gave rise to the notion of localization in the communications field.

This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify.
