Existing deep learning (DL) based speech enhancement approaches are generally optimised to minimise the distance between clean and enhanced speech features. These often result in improved speech quality however they suffer from a lack of generalisation and may not deliver the required speech intelligibility in real noisy situations. In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers have explored intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions and integration of audio-visual (AV) information for more robust speech enhancement (SE). In this paper, we introduce DL based I-O SE algorithms exploiting AV information, which is a novel and previously unexplored research direction. Specifically, we present a fully convolutional AV SE model that uses a modified short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric as a training cost function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the integration of AV modalities with an I-O based loss function for SE. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed I-O AV SE framework outperforms audio-only (AO) and AV models trained with conventional distance-based loss functions, in terms of standard objective evaluation measures when dealing with unseen speakers and noises."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary motivation behind the development of intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions and the integration of audio-visual (AV) information in speech enhancement (SE) algorithms, as described in the paper \"Towards Intelligibility-Oriented Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement\"?\n\nA) To improve the robustness of SE algorithms to unseen speakers and noises\nB) To enhance the quality of speech features, but at the cost of reduced intelligibility\nC) To develop a novel research direction that exploits the integration of AV modalities with I-O based loss functions for SE\nD) To minimize the distance between clean and enhanced speech features, while sacrificing intelligibility\n\nCorrect Answer: C) To develop a novel research direction that exploits the integration of AV modalities with I-O based loss functions for SE\n\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to understand the underlying motivation behind the development of I-O loss functions and AV integration in SE algorithms.

In this paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model. Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods. Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021.
