This article hypothesizes that the radioprotecting effect of FLASH irradiation could be due to the specific sparing of hypoxic stem cell niches, which have been identified in several organs including the bone marrow and the brain. To explore this hypothesis, a new computational model is presented that frames transient radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) during FLASH irradiation in terms of its effect on the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER).

In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity ||x||_0 of the unknown signal x\\in\\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend on knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation.

The primordial bispectrum has been considered in the past decade as a powerful probe of the physical processes taking place in the early Universe. Within the inflationary paradigm, the properties of the bispectrum are one of the keys that serves to discriminate among competing scenarios concerning the details of the origin of cosmological perturbations. However, all of the scenarios, based on the conventional approach to the so-called \"quantum-to-classical transition\" during inflation, lack the ability to point out the precise physical mechanism responsible for generating the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of our Universe starting from and exactly homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state associated with the early inflationary regime.
