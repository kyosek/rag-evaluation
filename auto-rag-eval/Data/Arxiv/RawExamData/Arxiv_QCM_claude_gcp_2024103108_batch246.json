Observations of neutron stars (NSs) by the LIGO-Virgo and NICER collaborations have provided reasonably precise measurements of their various macroscopic properties. In this paper, we employ a Bayesian framework to combine them and place improved joint constraints on the properties of NS equation of state (EoS). We use a hybrid EoS formulation that employs a parabolic expansion-based nuclear empirical parameterization around the nuclear saturation density augmented by a generic 3-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities.

Indeed, UTe$_2$, which has a $T_c\\approx 1.6$ K, has been identified as a candidate for a chiral spin-triplet topological superconductor near an FM instability, although it also has antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to show that superconductivity in UTe$_2$ is coupled to a sharp magnetic excitation, termed resonance, at the Brillouin zone boundary near AF order. Because the resonance has only been found in spin-singlet unconventional superconductors near an AF instability, its observation in UTe$_2$ suggests that AF spin fluctuations may also induce spin-triplet pairing or that electron pairing in UTe$_2$ has a spin-singlet component."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: The observation of a magnetic resonance at the Brillouin zone boundary in UTe\u2082 suggests which of the following conclusions about its superconductivity?\n\nA) UTe\u2082 is definitively a spin-singlet superconductor near an antiferromagnetic instability.\n\nB) Ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are the primary mechanism for Cooper pair formation in UTe\u2082.\n\nC) The superconductivity in UTe\u2082 may involve antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations or have a spin-singlet component, challenging the initial assumption of pure spin-triplet pairing.\n\nD) The magnetic resonance confirms that UTe\u2082 is a topological superconductor with Majorana fermions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the observation of a magnetic resonance at the Brillouin zone boundary near antiferromagnetic order in UTe\u2082 challenges the initial assumption that it is purely a spin-triplet superconductor mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. This finding suggests two possibilities: either antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations can also induce spin-triplet pairing (which was not previously thought to be the case), or the electron pairing in UTe\u2082 has a spin-singlet component. This interpretation is supported by the fact that such resonances have previously only been observed in spin-singlet unconventional superconductors near an antiferromagnetic instability.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the resonance suggests a connection to antiferromagnetic fluctuations, it doesn't definitively prove that UTe\u2082 is a spin-singlet superconductor. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the presence of the resonance actually challenges the idea that ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are the primary mechanism for Cooper pair formation in UTe\u2082.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while UTe\u2082 is considered a candidate for a topological superconductor, the observation of the resonance alone doesn't confirm this status or the presence of Majorana fermions."}, "42": {"documentation": {"title": "Challenges in Bayesian Adaptive Data Analysis", "source": "Sam Elder", "docs_id": "1604.02492", "section": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Challenges in Bayesian Adaptive Data Analysis.

At typical $s$-process temperatures ($T\\sim$ 0.2-0.3 GK), our new rate is one order of magnitude lower than the widely-used rate from Takahashi and Yokoi (hereafter TY87). The impact on the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars is investigated with various masses and metallicities. Our new decay rate leads to an overall decrease in the ${}^{134}$Ba/${}^{136}$Ba ratio, and well explains the measured ratio in meteorities without introducing the $i$ process. We also derive the elapsed time from the last AGB nucleosynthetic event that polluted the early Solar System to be $>$28 Myr based on the ${}^{135}$Cs/${}^{133}$Cs ratio, which is consistent with the elapsed times derived from ${}^{107}$Pd and ${}^{182}$Hf.
