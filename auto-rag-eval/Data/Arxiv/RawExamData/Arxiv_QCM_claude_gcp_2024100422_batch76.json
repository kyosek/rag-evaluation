The evidence that double negative media, with an effective negative permittivity, and an effective negative permeability, can be manufactured to operate at frequencies ranging from microwave to optical is ushering in a new era of metamaterials. They are referred to here as 'left-handed', even though a variety of names is evident from the literature. In anticipation of a demand for highly structured integrated practical waveguides, this paper addresses the impact of this type of medium upon waveguides that can be also nonlinear. After an interesting historical overview and an exposure of some straightforward concepts, a planar guide is investigated, in which the waveguide is a slab consisting of a left-handed medium sandwiched between a substrate and cladding that are simple dielectrics. The substrate and cladding display a Kerr-type nonlinear response. Because of the nonlinear properties of the Kerr media, the power flow direction can be controlled by the intensity of the electric field. A comprehensive finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) analysis is presented that concentrates upon spatial soliton behaviour.

The stepping motion that occurs within a relatively short time scale (~100 microsec) is, however, beyond the resolution of current experiments, therefore a basic understanding to the real-time dynamics within the 8-nm step is still lacking. For instance, the rate of power stroke (or conformational change), that leads to the undocked-to-docked transition of neck-linker, is not known, and the existence of a substep during the 8-nm step still remains a controversial issue in the kinesin community.

In this paper we present tools for applied researchers that re-purpose off-the-shelf methods from the computer-science field of machine learning to create a \"discovery engine\" for data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This prevents us from extracting as much information as possible from each RCT, which in turn impairs our ability to develop new theories or strengthen the design of policy interventions.

Nevertheless, we are often interested not only in the existence of extensions of a binary relation $R$ satisfying certain axioms of orderability, but in something more: (A) The conditions of the sets of alternatives and the properties which $R$ satisfies to be inherited when one passes to any member of a subfamily of the family of extensions of $R$ and: (B) The size of a family of ordering extensions of $R$, whose intersection is $R$, to be the smallest one. The key to addressing these kinds of problems is the szpilrajn inherited method. In this paper, we define the notion of $\\Lambda(m)$-consistency, where $m$ can reach the first infinite ordinal $\\omega$, and we give two general inherited type theorems on extending binary relations, a Szpilrajn type and a Dushnik-Miller type theorem, which generalize all the well known existence and inherited type extension theorems in the literature. \\keywords{Consistent binary relations, Extension theorems, Intersection of binary relations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advancements made in the paper regarding Szpilrajn's Theorem and its applications?\n\nA) The paper introduces a new theorem that replaces Szpilrajn's Theorem entirely in economic and game theories.\n\nB) The paper focuses solely on proving the existence of extensions of binary relations without considering their properties or size.\n\nC) The paper defines \u039b(m)-consistency and provides two general inherited type theorems that generalize existing extension theorems while addressing both the inheritance of properties and the size of extension families.\n\nD) The paper disproves Dushnik and Miller's work on realizers for partial orders.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately summarizes the key contributions of the paper.

With the discovery of charge density waves (CDW) in most members of the cuprate high temperature superconductors, the interplay between superconductivity and CDW has become a key point in the debate on the origin of high temperature superconductivity. Some experiments in cuprates point toward a CDW state competing with superconductivity, but others raise the possibility of a CDW-superconductivity intertwined order, or more elusive pair-density wave (PDW).

In the multiway cut problem, we are given an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights and a collection of $k$ terminal nodes, and the goal is to partition the node set of the graph into $k$ non-empty parts each containing exactly one terminal so that the total weight of the edges crossing the partition is minimized.

During its history, the ultimate goal of economics has been to develop similar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important, currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics.
