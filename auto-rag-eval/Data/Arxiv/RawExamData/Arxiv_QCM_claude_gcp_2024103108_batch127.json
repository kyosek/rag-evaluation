Heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC give access to the medium-induced suppression patterns of heavy-flavored single inclusive hadron spectra at high transverse momentum. This opens novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of the medium produced in the collision. In this note, we point out that the capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic projectile is an independent signature, which may differ for different media at the same density. In particular, while the mass hierarchy (i.e., the projectile mass dependence) of radiative energy loss depends solely on a property of the projectile, the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss depends significantly on properties of the medium. By varying these properties in a class of models, we find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative parton energy loss. This may help to disentangle the relative strengths of radiative and collisional contributions to jet quenching, and it may be employed to constrain properties of the produced QCD medium beyond its density."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In heavy ion collisions, the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss differs from that of radiative energy loss primarily because:\n\nA) Collisional energy loss is independent of medium properties\nB) Radiative energy loss depends solely on projectile properties\nC) Collisional energy loss depends significantly on medium properties\nD) The recoil absorption capacity is the same for all QCD media\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key differences between radiative and collisional energy loss in heavy ion collisions.

With the continuous growth of machine-type devices (MTDs), it is expected that massive machine-type communication (mMTC) will be the dominant form of traffic in future wireless networks.

Conversely, in mMTC applications, a very large number of MTDs transmit small packets sporadically. Therefore, conventional grant-based access schemes commonly adopted for H2H service, are not suitable for mMTC, as they incur in a large overhead associated with the channel request procedure.

The mechanism of atrial fibrillation (AF) is poorly understood, resulting in disappointing success rates of ablative treatment. Different mechanisms defined largely by different atrial activation patterns have been proposed and, arguably, this dispute has slowed the progress of AF research. Recent clinical evidence suggests a unifying mechanism based on sustained re-entrant circuits in the complex atrial architecture. Here, we present a simple computational model showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a theoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation. We show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct consequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells through which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface. The model naturally follows the clinical spectrum of AF spanning sinus rhythm, paroxysmal and persistent AF as the decoupling of myocardial cells results in the lattice approaching the percolation threshold. This allows the model to make additional predictions beyond the current clinical understanding, showing that for paroxysmal AF re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium, but in persistent AF they emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall where endocardial ablation is less effective.

An Analysis of the Disposition Effect in\n  Bitcoin. Investors tend to sell their winning investments and hold onto their losers. This phenomenon, known as the \\emph{disposition effect} in the field of behavioural finance, is well-known and its prevalence has been shown in a number of existing markets. But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis. Our results show that investors are indeed subject to the disposition effect, tending to sell their winning positions too soon and holding on to their losing position for too long.

One group heard the words pronounced by a single talker, while another group heard them pronounced by multiple talkers. On the third day, they completed a variety of tasks to evaluate their learning. Our results show a robust influence of orthography, with faster response times in both production (picture naming) and recognition (picture mapping) tasks for words learned in the Audio-Ortho condition. Moreover, formant analyses of the picture naming responses show that orthographic input pulls pronunciations of English novel words towards a non-native (French) phonological target. Words learned with their orthographic forms were pronounced more precisely (with smaller Dispersion Scores), but were misplaced in the vowel space (as reflected by smaller Euclidian distances with respect to French vowels). Finally, we found only limited evidence of an effect of talker-based acoustic variability: novel words learned with multiple talkers showed faster responses times in the picture naming task, but only in the Audio-only condition, which suggests that orthographic information may have overwhelmed any advantage of talker-based acoustic variability."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the study of L1 French participants learning novel L2 English words, which of the following statements best describes the impact of orthographic input on pronunciation?\n\nA) Orthographic input led to more native-like English pronunciations.\nB) Orthographic input resulted in faster response times but had no effect on pronunciation accuracy.\nC) Orthographic input caused pronunciations to be more precise but shifted towards French phonological targets.\nD) Orthographic input slowed down response times but improved overall pronunciation accuracy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The study found that orthographic input had a complex effect on pronunciation. Specifically, words learned with their orthographic forms were pronounced more precisely (with smaller Dispersion Scores), indicating increased precision. However, these pronunciations were also \"misplaced\" in the vowel space, being closer to French vowels than English ones (as reflected by smaller Euclidean distances with respect to French vowels). This indicates that while orthography improved precision, it also pulled pronunciations towards non-native (French) phonological targets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the orthographic input actually led to more French-like, not English-like, pronunciations. \n\nOption B is partially correct about faster response times but wrong about the effect on pronunciation accuracy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because orthographic input led to faster, not slower, response times, and the improvement in pronunciation accuracy was offset by the shift towards French phonological targets."}, "34": {"documentation": {"title": "A competitive search game with a moving target", "source": "Benoit Duvocelle, J\\'anos Flesch, Mathias Staudigl, Dries Vermeulen", "docs_id": "2008.12032", "section": ["cs.GT", "econ.TH", "math.PR"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "A competitive search game with a moving target.

We present first results from the Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS). Our goal is to assess the frequency of close-in extrasolar planets around main-sequence stars in several open clusters. By concentrating on main-sequence stars in clusters of known (and varied) age, metallicity, and stellar density, we will gain insight into how these various properties affect planet formation, migration, and survival. We show preliminary results from our 19 night photometric campaign of the old, solar metallicity cluster NGC 1245. Taking into account the photometric precision, observational window function, transit probability, and total number of stars monitored, we estimate that we should be able to probe planetary companion fractions of <1% for separations of a<0.03 AU. If 1% of the stars in the cluster have Jupiter-sized companions evenly distributed in log(a) between 0.03 and 0.3 AU, we expect to find ~2 transits. A preliminary search of our light curve data has revealed a transit with a depth ~4%. Based on its shape, it is likely to be a grazing binary eclipse rather than a planetary transit, emphasizing the need for high temporal resolution in transit surveys."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the STEPSS survey of NGC 1245, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the researchers' ability to detect planetary companions?\n\nA) They can detect planetary companions around 1% of stars at separations greater than 0.3 AU.\n\nB) They expect to find approximately 2 transits if 1% of stars have Jupiter-sized companions between 0.03 and 0.3 AU.\n\nC) They can probe planetary companion fractions of less than 10% for separations less than 0.03 AU.\n\nD) They are certain to detect all Jupiter-sized companions with separations between 0.03 and 0.3 AU.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

We seek to understand the interplay between amino acid sequence and local structure in proteins. Are some amino acids unique in their ability to fit harmoniously into certain local structures? What is the role of sequence in sculpting the putative native state folds from myriad possible conformations? In order to address these questions, we represent the local structure of each C-alpha atom of a protein by just two angles, theta and mu, and we analyze a set of more than 4000 protein structures from the PDB. We use a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the 20 amino acids into six distinct groups based on their similarity to each other in fitting local structural space. We present the results of a detailed analysis of patterns of amino acid specificity in adopting local structural conformations and show that the sequence-structure correlation is not very strong compared to a random assignment of sequence to structure.

As exemplary inflationary models the SU(N) Yang-Mills in the Veneziano limit and various RG-improvements of the gravitational action are studied.
