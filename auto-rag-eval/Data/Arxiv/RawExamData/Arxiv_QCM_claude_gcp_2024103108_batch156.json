Recently, it was realized that anomalies can be completely classified by topological orders, symmetry protected topological (SPT) orders, and symmetry enriched topological orders in one higher dimension.

In this paper, we introduce a notion of non-invertible anomaly, which describes the boundary of generic topological order. A key feature of non-invertible anomaly is that it has several partition functions. Under the mapping class group transformation of space-time, those partition functions transform in a certain way characterized by the data of the corresponding topological order in one higher dimension. In fact, the anomalous partition functions transform in the same way as the degenerate ground states of the corresponding topological order in one higher dimension.

Accordingly, electrolyte gating is well-suited to studies of superconductivity and other phenomena robust to disorder, but of limited use when reactions or disorder must be avoided.

The weights are consistent with previous measures of product complexity in the literature. The second dimension of variation is a proficiency in machinery relative to agriculture. PriSDA then couples these quantities with per-capita income and infers the dynamics of the system over time.

However, existing 2D deep learning methods are not equipped to effectively capture 3D spatial contextual information that is needed to achieve accurate brain structure segmentation. In order to overcome this limitation, we develop an Anatomical Context-Encoding Network (ACEnet) to incorporate 3D spatial and anatomical contexts in 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for efficient and accurate segmentation of brain structures from MR scans, consisting of 1) an anatomical context encoding module to incorporate anatomical information in 2D CNNs and 2) a spatial context encoding module to integrate 3D image information in 2D CNNs.
