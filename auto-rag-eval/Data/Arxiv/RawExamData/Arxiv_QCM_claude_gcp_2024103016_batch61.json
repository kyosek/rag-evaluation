The growth of a population divided among spatial sites, with migration between the sites, is sometimes modelled by a product of random matrices, with each diagonal elements representing the growth rate in a given time period, and off-diagonal elements the migration rate. If the sites are reinterpreted as age classes, the same model may apply to a single population with age-dependent mortality and reproduction. We consider the case where the off-diagonal elements are small, representing a situation where there is little migration or, alternatively, where a deterministic life-history has been slightly disrupted, for example by introducing a rare delay in development. We examine the asymptotic behaviour of the long-term growth rate. We show that when the highest growth rate is attained at two different sites in the absence of migration (which is always the case when modelling a single age-structured population) the increase in stochastic growth rate due to a migration rate $\\epsilon$ is like $(\\log \\epsilon^{-1})^{-1}$ as $\\epsilon\\downarrow 0$, under fairly generic conditions.

Compared to existing models, which only capture the cross-sectional variation or time-serial dependence in the dimension reduction step, the new model captures both features efficiently under a hierarchical structure, and provides insights into the understanding of dynamic variation of mortality patterns over time. By comparing with static PCA utilized in Lee and Carter 1992, dynamic PCA introduced in Lam et al. 2011, as well as other existing mortality modelling methods, we find that this approach provides both better estimation results and superior out-of-sample forecasting performance.

These are simulated by super cells containing up to 64 formula units (Z = 64). All compositions and structural models turn out metallic, hence the dielectric functions contain interband and intraband free electron contributions. The former are calculated in the independent particle random phase approximation. The latter are modeled based upon the intraband plasma frequencies, which are also calculated from first-principles.
