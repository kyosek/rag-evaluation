In the shape analysis approach to computer vision problems, one treats shapes as points in an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, thereby facilitating algorithms for statistical calculations such as geodesic distance between shapes and averaging of a collection of shapes. The performance of these algorithms depends heavily on the choice of the Riemannian metric. In the setting of plane curve shapes, attention has largely been focused on a two-parameter family of first order Sobolev metrics, referred to as elastic metrics. They are particularly useful due to the existence of simplifying coordinate transformations for particular parameter values, such as the well-known square-root velocity transform. In this paper, we extend the transformations appearing in the existing literature to a family of isometries, which take any elastic metric to the flat $L^2$ metric. We also extend the transforms to treat piecewise linear curves and demonstrate the existence of optimal matchings over the diffeomorphism group in this setting.

Recently developed particle flow algorithms provide an alternative to importance sampling for drawing particles from a posterior distribution, and a number of particle filters based on this principle have been proposed.

We find that the fastest growing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very different to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the background flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times faster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized in a completely different region of space.

Simulation is a third pillar next to experiment and theory in the study of complex dynamic systems such as biological neural networks. Contemporary brain-scale networks correspond to directed graphs of a few million nodes, each with an in-degree and out-degree of several thousands of edges, where nodes and edges correspond to the fundamental biological units, neurons and synapses, respectively. When considering a random graph, each node's edges are distributed across thousands of parallel processes. The activity in neuronal networks is also sparse. Each neuron occasionally transmits a brief signal, called spike, via its outgoing synapses to the corresponding target neurons. This spatial and temporal sparsity represents an inherent bottleneck for simulations on conventional computers: Fundamentally irregular memory-access patterns cause poor cache utilization.

In times of crisis when governments intend to stimulate economy, a relevant question is on the proper size of stimulus bill. To address the answer, we emphasize the role of hysteresis in economic networks.

The values of this product distance determine the stability of the fixed point in question, when it bifurcates, and even when chaos arises, as it passes through what we have termed stability bands.

There has been a surge of interest in continual learning and federated learning, both of which are important in deep neural networks in real-world scenarios. Yet little research has been done regarding the scenario where each client learns on a sequence of tasks from a private local data stream. This problem of federated continual learning poses new challenges to continual learning, such as utilizing knowledge from other clients, while preventing interference from irrelevant knowledge. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel federated continual learning framework, Federated Weighted Inter-client Transfer (FedWeIT), which decomposes the network weights into global federated parameters and sparse task-specific parameters, and each client receives selective knowledge from other clients by taking a weighted combination of their task-specific parameters. FedWeIT minimizes interference between incompatible tasks, and also allows positive knowledge transfer across clients during learning.

For example, in coherent photoproduction of vector mesons their 4-momentum transfer distribution would image the \"gluon charge\" in the nucleus in the same way that Hofstadter measured its charge structure using elastic scattering of $\\sim$100 MeV electrons. Whereas he could measure the $\\sim$4 MeV energy loss by the electron due to excitation of nuclear energy levels (Figure 1), even the energy spread of the incident beam would prevent such an inclusive selection of quasielastic events at an eIC. The only available tool is fragment detection. Since, in our example, one finds that $\\sim100$ of deexcitations go through $\\gamma$'s or 1 neutron, rarely to 2 neutron and never to protons(due to Coulomb barrier suppression), the eIC design should emphasize their detection."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of an electron-ion collider (eIC), which of the following statements best describes the importance and challenges of spectator fragment detection?\n\nA) Spectator fragment detection is unnecessary as coherence in diffractive processes can be maintained regardless of fragment emission.\n\nB) The detection of spectator fragments is crucial, but only proton detection is required due to their prevalence in nuclear deexcitations.\n\nC) Efficient detection of spectator fragments, particularly neutrons and \u03b3-rays, is essential for maintaining experimental coherence and overcoming the limitations of inclusive event selection.\n\nD) Spectator fragment detection is important, but can be replaced by precise measurement of electron energy loss, similar to Hofstadter's experiments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that efficient detection of spectator fragments is key to main topics at an eIC. It states that any process leading to emission of fragments or \u03b3-rays breaks coherence in diffractive processes. Unlike Hofstadter's experiments with ~100 MeV electrons, where energy loss could be measured precisely, the energy spread of the incident beam at an eIC prevents such inclusive selection of quasielastic events. Therefore, fragment detection becomes the only available tool.\n\nThe document specifically mentions that ~100% of deexcitations go through \u03b3's or 1 neutron, rarely to 2 neutrons, and never to protons due to Coulomb barrier suppression. This information directly contradicts option B and supports the importance of neutron and \u03b3-ray detection over proton detection.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they contradict the main points of the documentation.

The main result is a proof of consistency under mild conditions on the errors introduced by the misspecification. The rate of convergence is determined by the dependence between units' specification errors, and consistency is achieved even if the errors are large as long as they are sufficiently weakly dependent. In other words, exposure effects can be precisely estimated also under misspecification as long as the units' exposures are not misspecified in the same way.

Federated learning forms a global model using data collected from a federation agent. This type of learning has two main challenges: the agents generally don't collect data over the same distribution, and the agents have limited capabilities of storing and transmitting data. Therefore, it is impractical for each agent to send the entire data over the network. Instead, each agent must form a local model and decide what information is fundamental to the learning problem, which will be sent to a central unit. The central unit can then form the global model using only the information received from the agents. We propose a method that tackles these challenges. First each agent forms a local model using a low complexity reproducing kernel Hilbert space representation. From the model the agents identify the fundamental samples which are sent to the central unit. The fundamental samples are obtained by solving the dual problem. The central unit then forms the global model. We show that the solution of the federated learner converges to that of the centralized learner asymptotically as the sample size increases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments with both simulated data and real data sets from an activity recognition task, for which the data is collected from a wearable device.
