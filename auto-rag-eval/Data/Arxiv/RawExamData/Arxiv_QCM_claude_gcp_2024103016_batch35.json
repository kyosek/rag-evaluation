For this reason, they may be sensitive to global, topological, properties of the system and depend on nonperturbative data. Such operators are generally known as monopole operators. Sometimes they act as disorder operators because their nonzero expectation values define a disordered vacuum associated with a condensate of the collective modes, also known as defects.

Streaming social media provides a real-time glimpse of extreme weather impacts. However, the volume of streaming data makes mining information a challenge for emergency managers, policy makers, and disciplinary scientists. Here we explore the effectiveness of data learned approaches to mine and filter information from streaming social media data from Hurricane Irma's landfall in Florida, USA. We use 54,383 Twitter messages (out of 784K geolocated messages) from 16,598 users from Sept. 10 - 12, 2017 to develop 4 independent models to filter data for relevance: 1) a geospatial model based on forcing conditions at the place and time of each tweet, 2) an image classification model for tweets that include images, 3) a user model to predict the reliability of the tweeter, and 4) a text model to determine if the text is related to Hurricane Irma. All four models are independently tested, and can be combined to quickly filter and visualize tweets based on user-defined thresholds for each submodel. We envision that this type of filtering and visualization routine can be useful as a base model for data capture from noisy sources such as Twitter. The data can then be subsequently used by policy makers, environmental managers, emergency managers, and domain scientists interested in finding tweets with specific attributes to use during different stages of the disaster (e.g., preparedness, response, and recovery), or for detailed research."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of models would be most effective for quickly identifying relevant, reliable tweets about Hurricane Irma's immediate impact on specific locations?\n\nA) Geospatial model and User model\nB) Image classification model and Text model\nC) Geospatial model and Image classification model\nD) Geospatial model and Text model\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe question asks for the most effective combination to quickly identify relevant, reliable tweets about Hurricane Irma's immediate impact on specific locations. Let's analyze each model:\n\n1. Geospatial model: This is crucial as it's based on forcing conditions at the place and time of each tweet, helping to pinpoint location-specific impacts.\n2. Image classification model: While useful, it's limited to tweets with images and doesn't necessarily indicate relevance to immediate impacts.\n3. User model: This predicts the reliability of the tweeter but doesn't directly address the relevance of the tweet's content to immediate impacts.\n4. Text model: This determines if the text is related to Hurricane Irma, which is essential for identifying relevant content.\n\nThe combination of the Geospatial model (D) and Text model (D) would be most effective because:\n- The Geospatial model ensures the tweet is from the affected area at the relevant time.\n- The Text model confirms the content is about Hurricane Irma.\n\nTogether, these models provide both location-specific and topic-relevant filtering, which is ideal for identifying tweets about immediate impacts in specific locations. While the User model could add value for reliability, it's not as crucial for immediate impact assessment as the content and location of the tweets."}, "12": {"documentation": {"title": "Exact Solution of a Field Theory Model of Frontal Photopolymerization", "source": "James A.

Such commitments are possible only with practically CO2-free power generation based on variable renewable technologies.

Power-to-X systems, which convert excess power to other stores of energy for later use, can play an important role in offsetting the variability of renewable power production.

Critical transitions, or large changes in the state of a system after a small change in the system's external conditions or parameters, commonly occur in a wide variety of disciplines, from the biological and social sciences to physics. Statistical physics first confronted the problem of emergent phenomena such as critical transitions in the 1800s and 1900s, culminating in the theory of phase transitions. However, although phase transitions show a strong resemblance to critical transitions, the theoretical connections between the two sets of phenomena are tenuous at best, and it would be advantageous to make them more concrete in order to take advantage of the theoretical methods developed by physicists to study phase transitions. Here we attempt to explicitly connect the theory of critical transitions to phase transitions in physics. We initially find something paradoxical, that many critical transitions closely resemble first-order phase transitions, but that many of the early warning indicators developed to anticipate critical transitions, such as critical slowing down or increasing spatial correlations, occur instead in second-order phase transitions.

This analysis aims at exploring what can be said about the growth rate of magnetized inhomogeneities under two concurrent hypotheses: a phase of quasi-de Sitter dynamics driven by a single inflaton field and the simultaneous presence of a spectator field coupled to gravity and to the gauge sector. Instead of invoking ad hoc correlations between the various components, the system of scalar inhomogeneities is diagonalized in terms of two gauge-invariant quasi-normal modes whose weighted sum gives the curvature perturbations on comoving orthogonal hypersurfaces. The predominance of the conventional adiabatic scalar mode implies that the growth rate of magnetized inhomogeneities must not exceed 2.2 in Hubble units if the conventional inflationary phase is to last about 70 efolds and for a range of slow roll parameters between 0.1 and 0.001.
