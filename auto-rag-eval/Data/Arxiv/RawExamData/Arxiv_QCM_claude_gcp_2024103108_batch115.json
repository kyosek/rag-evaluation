Machine learning algorithms have been available since the 1990s, but it is much more recently that they have come into use also in the physical sciences. While these algorithms have already proven to be useful in uncovering new properties of materials and in simplifying experimental protocols, their usage in liquid crystals research is still limited. This is surprising because optical imaging techniques are often applied in this line of research, and it is precisely with images that machine learning algorithms have achieved major breakthroughs in recent years. Here we use convolutional neural networks to probe several properties of liquid crystals directly from their optical images and without using manual feature engineering. By optimizing simple architectures, we find that convolutional neural networks can predict physical properties of liquid crystals with exceptional accuracy. We show that these deep neural networks identify liquid crystal phases and predict the order parameter of simulated nematic liquid crystals almost perfectly.

We present a framework to simulate the dynamics of hard probes such as heavy quarks or jets in a hot, strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) on a quantum computer. Hard probes in the QGP can be treated as open quantum systems governed in the Markovian limit by the Lindblad equation. However, due to large computational costs, most current phenomenological calculations of hard probes evolving in the QGP use semiclassical approximations of the quantum evolution. Quantum computation can mitigate these costs, and offers the potential for a fully quantum treatment with exponential speedup over classical techniques. We report a simplified demonstration of our framework on IBM Q quantum devices, and apply the Random Identity Insertion Method (RIIM) to account for CNOT depolarization noise, in addition to measurement error mitigation.

We find that the seasonal optimal mix of wind and solar PV comes at around 80% solar PV share, owing to the US summer load peak. By picking this mix, long-term storage requirements can be more than halved compared to a wind only mix. The daily optimal mix lies at about 80% wind share due to the nightly gap in solar PV production. Picking this mix instead of solar only reduces backup energy needs by about 50%. Furthermore, we calculate shifts in FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)-level LCOE (Levelized Costs Of Electricity) for wind and solar PV due to their differing resource quality and fluctuation patterns. LCOE vary by up to 35% due to regional conditions, and LCOE-optimal mixes turn out to largely follow resource quality. A transmission network enhancement among FERC regions is constructed to transfer high penetrations of solar and wind across FERC boundaries, based on a novel least-cost optimization approach."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a fully renewable US electricity system based primarily on wind and solar PV power, which of the following statements is true regarding the optimal mix of these energy sources?\n\nA) The seasonal optimal mix favors wind power at 80% due to consistent wind patterns throughout the year.\nB) The daily optimal mix consists of 80% solar PV to maximize daytime energy production.\nC) The seasonal optimal mix includes 80% solar PV to address the US summer load peak, while the daily optimal mix comprises 80% wind power to cover nighttime demand.\nD) Both seasonal and daily optimal mixes equally balance wind and solar PV at 50% each to ensure consistent energy production.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the optimal mixes for both seasonal and daily energy production in a renewable US electricity system. The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation. The seasonal optimal mix favors 80% solar PV to address the US summer load peak, while the daily optimal mix includes 80% wind share to cover the nightly gap in solar PV production.

Motivated by the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that have been observed in many countries after the vaccination and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we propose a mathematical model on time-varying networks for the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in a partially vaccinated population. The model encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe symptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals, and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold, we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing practices are key toward avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be a double-edged sword, whereby in some cases it might favour resurgent outbreaks, calling for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve complete eradication."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the mathematical model described in the paper, which of the following combinations is most likely to lead to a resurgent outbreak of an epidemic disease in a partially vaccinated population?\n\nA) High vaccine effectiveness, extensive testing practices, and cautious human behavior\nB) Low vaccine effectiveness, limited testing practices, and relaxed human behavior\nC) High vaccine effectiveness, limited testing practices, and relaxed human behavior\nD) Low vaccine effectiveness, extensive testing practices, and cautious human behavior\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The plague of false information, popularly called fake news has affected lives of news consumers ever since the prevalence of social media. Thus understanding the spread of false information in social networks has gained a lot of attention in the literature. While most proposed models do content analysis of the information, no much work has been done by exploring the community structures that also play an important role in determining how people get exposed to it. In this paper we base our idea on Computational Trust in social networks to propose a novel Community Health Assessment model against fake news. Based on the concepts of neighbor, boundary and core nodes of a community, we propose novel evaluation metrics to quantify the vulnerability of nodes (individual-level) and communities (group-level) to spreading false information. Our model hypothesizes that if the boundary nodes trust the neighbor nodes of a community who are spreaders, the densely-connected core nodes of the community are highly likely to become spreaders. We test our model with communities generated using three popular community detection algorithms based on two new datasets of information spreading networks collected from Twitter.

The presence of clouds, however, would remain as one of the most uncertain components in deciphering such direct-imaged signals of planets. We attempt to examine how the planetary obliquity produce different cloud patterns by performing a series of GCM (General Circulation Model) simulation runs using a set of parameters relevant for our Earth. Then we use the simulated photometric lightcurves to compute their frequency modulation due to the planetary spin-orbit coupling over an entire orbital period, and attempt to see to what extent one can estimate the obliquity of an Earth-twin. We find that it is possible to estimate the obliquity of an Earth-twin within the uncertainty of several degrees with a dedicated 4 m space telescope at 10 pc away from the system if the stellar flux is completely blocked.
