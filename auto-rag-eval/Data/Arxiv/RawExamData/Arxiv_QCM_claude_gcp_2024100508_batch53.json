The first-stage regression is a natural framework to evaluate the validity of instruments, and in particular, the validity of the Jacobian identification conditions. Hence, we suggest testing procedures to evaluate the adequacy of instruments by evaluating their statistical significance using the first-stage result. This procedure may be specially useful in QR since the instruments may be relevant at some quantiles but not at others, which indicates the use of weak-identification robust inference.

Gaseous detectors are widely used in high energy physics, and are attractive choices in tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography. Such detectors offer high resolution and high efficiency at reasonable cost for large sizes, however, one of the drawbacks is that the gaseous detection medium must be prevented from contamination by outside air or internal outgassing. Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such \"breathing\" effect can be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contamination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system with 0.9 square meter area, total volume of 160 l, has been operated for 36 days with a flow of 3 l/day, confirming that the buffer volume, in this case a 50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufficient gas quality.

In this paper, we investigate how the range of cooperative interactions within a prey group affects the survival chances of the group while chased by a predator. As observed in nature, the interaction range of preys may vary due to their vision, age, or even physical structure. Based on a simple theoretical prey-predator model, here, we show that an optimality criterion for the survival can be established on the interaction range of preys.

Recent work in adversarial machine learning started to focus on the visual perception in autonomous driving and studied Adversarial Examples (AEs) for object detection models.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a revolutionary force in the ongoing information revolution, and yet their intrinsic properties remain a mystery. In particular, it is widely known that DNNs are highly sensitive to noise, whether adversarial or random. This poses a fundamental challenge for hardware implementations of DNNs, and for their deployment in critical applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper we construct robust DNNs via error correcting codes. By our approach, either the data or internal layers of the DNN are coded with error correcting codes, and successful computation under noise is guaranteed. Since DNNs can be seen as a layered concatenation of classification tasks, our research begins with the core task of classifying noisy coded inputs, and progresses towards robust DNNs. We focus on binary data and linear codes. Our main result is that the prevalent parity code can guarantee robustness for a large family of DNNs, which includes the recently popularized binarized neural networks.
