Studying the spectral properties of 4U 1909+07 between 0.5 to 90 keV we find that a power-law with an exponential cutoff can describe the data well, when additionally allowing for a blackbody or a partially covering absorber at low energies. We find no evidence for a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF), a feature seen in many other neutron star HMXBs sources. By performing pulse phase resolved spectroscopy we investigate the origin of the strong energy dependence of the pulse profile, which evolves from a broad two-peak profile at low energies to a profile with a single, narrow peak at energies above 20 keV.

The paper presents the comparative study of the nature of stock markets in short-term and long-term time scales with and without structural break in the stock data. Structural break point has been identified by applying Zivot and Andrews structural trend break model to break the original time series (TSO) into time series before structural break (TSB) and time series after structural break (TSA). The empirical mode decomposition based Hurst exponent and variance techniques have been applied to the TSO, TSB and TSA to identify the time scales in short-term and long-term from the decomposed intrinsic mode functions. We found that for TSO, TSB and TSA the short-term time scales and long-term time scales are within the range of few days to 3 months and greater than 5 months respectively, which indicates that the short-term and long-term time scales are present in the stock market. The Hurst exponent is $\\sim 0.5$ and $\\geq 0.75$ for TSO, TSB and TSA in short-term and long-term respectively, which indicates that the market is random in short-term and strongly correlated in long-term. The identification of time scales at short-term and long-term investment horizon will be useful for investors to design investment and trading strategies."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher applies the Zivot and Andrews structural trend break model to a stock market time series, followed by empirical mode decomposition and Hurst exponent analysis.

The shrinkage is due to the the so-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the asymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing.

Initially, the radius shrinks due to the pairing anti-halo effect, which decreases the asymptotic density distribution.
