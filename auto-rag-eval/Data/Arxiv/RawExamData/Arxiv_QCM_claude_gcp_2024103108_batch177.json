Recently, Neural Topic Models (NTMs) inspired by variational autoencoders have obtained increasingly research interest due to their promising results on text analysis.

Moreover, they often degrade their performance severely on short documents. The requirement of reparameterisation could also comprise their training quality and model flexibility. To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural topic model via the theory of optimal transport (OT). Specifically, we propose to learn the topic distribution of a document by directly minimising its OT distance to the document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix of the OT distance models the weights between topics and words, which is constructed by the distances between topics and words in an embedding space.

The key contribution is that this research creates a relative ecological pollution ranking (REPR) while also considering countries' productive structures and levels of economic complexity. This allows for more appropriate comparisons between countries with similar economic activities, helping to identify suitable benchmark countries for efficiency improvements and cleaner production. The research does not focus solely on measuring CO2 emissions (A), is not limited to economic complexity rankings (B), and does not propose a new international treaty (D)."}, "42": {"documentation": {"title": "Lagrangian transport through an ocean front in the North-Western\n  Mediterranean Sea", "source": "Ana M.

It allocates a portion of the design points to enable lack of fit tests with good power for practically interesting alternatives.

The remaining design points are determined to ensure that the overall design is optimal for inference on the unknown parameters, conditional on the lack of fit test not rejecting the linear regression model.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only focuses on maximizing the power of lack of fit tests without considering parameter estimation efficiency. Option B is incorrect as it doesn't account for the need to check model adequacy through lack of fit tests. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests using all design points for lack of fit testing, which would not allow for optimal parameter inference if the model is not rejected.\n\nThe correct answer, C, accurately captures the dual purpose of efficient lack of fit designs: allowing for model adequacy checking while maintaining optimality for parameter inference if the model is not rejected."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Analysis of stability and bifurcation for two heterogeneous triopoly\n  games with the isoelastic demand", "source": "Xiaoliang Li", "docs_id": "2112.05950", "section": ["math.DS", "cs.SC", "econ.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Analysis of stability and bifurcation for two heterogeneous triopoly\n  games with the isoelastic demand.

Understanding the role that exciton diffusion plays in organic solar cells is a crucial to understanding the recent rise in power conversion effciencies brought about by non-fullerene acceptors (NFA).
