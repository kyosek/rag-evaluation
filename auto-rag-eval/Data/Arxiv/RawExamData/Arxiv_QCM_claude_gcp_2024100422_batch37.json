Current state-of-the-art object detectors can have significant performance drop when deployed in the wild due to domain gaps with training data. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt models for new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. However, without ground truth labels, most prior works on UDA for object detection tasks can only perform coarse image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using adversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based methods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain content distribution gap that is shown to be important for object detectors. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Cross-Domain Semi-Supervised Learning (CDSSL) framework by leveraging high-quality pseudo labels to learn better representations from the target domain directly. To enable SSL for cross-domain object detection, we propose fine-grained domain transfer, progressive-confidence-based label sharpening and imbalanced sampling strategy to address two challenges: (i) non-identical distribution between source and target domain data, (ii) error amplification/accumulation due to noisy pseudo labeling on the target domain. Experiment results show that our proposed approach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance (2.2% - 9.5% better than prior best work on mAP) under various domain gap scenarios.

With the continuous development of the petroleum industry, long-distance transportation of oil and gas has been the norm.

Scaling and corrosion will make the transportation process difficult, and transportation costs will be considerably increased.

Caregivers in eldercare can benefit from telepresence robots that allow them to perform a variety of tasks remotely. In order for such robots to be operated effectively and efficiently by non-technical users, it is important to examine if and how the robotic system's level of automation (LOA) impacts their performance. The objective of this work was to develop suitable LOA modes for a mobile robotic telepresence (MRP) system for eldercare and assess their influence on users' performance, workload, awareness of the environment and usability at two different levels of task complexity. For this purpose, two LOA modes were implemented on the MRP platform: assisted teleoperation (low LOA mode) and autonomous navigation (high LOA mode). The system was evaluated in a user study with 20 participants, who, in the role of the caregiver, navigated the robot through a home-like environment to perform various control and perception tasks. Results revealed that performance improved at high LOA when the task complexity was low. However, when task complexity increased, lower LOA improved performance. This opposite trend was also observed in the results for workload and situation awareness. We discuss the results in terms of the LOAs' impact on users' attitude towards automation and implications on usability."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a study on Levels of Automation (LOA) for mobile robotic telepresence systems in eldercare, researchers found that the relationship between LOA and user performance was:\n\nA) Consistently better with high LOA regardless of task complexity\nB) Consistently better with low LOA regardless of task complexity\nC) Better with high LOA for low complexity tasks, but better with low LOA for high complexity tasks\nD) Better with low LOA for low complexity tasks, but better with high LOA for high complexity tasks\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex relationship between Levels of Automation (LOA) and task performance in the context of telepresence robots for eldercare.
