Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but their excessive computation results in long inference time. Model sparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining model quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in each layer for pruning. The limitations of these algorithms reduce the level of achievable sparsity. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without having to pre-train a dense model. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous works by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning them back to sparse after some training. Experiments show that the models pruned using the proposed methods match or beat the quality of the highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object part segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for model sparsification.

Here, we propose a new mechanism underlying this \"collective guidance\", and study a model based on this mechanism both analytically and computationally. Our approach posits that the contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), where cells polarize away from cell-cell contact, is regulated by the chemoattractant. Individual cells must measure the mean attractant value, but need not measure its gradient, to give rise to directional motility for a cell cluster.

Density functional theory has been employed to study graphene on the (111), (100) and (110) surfaces of silicon (Si) substrates. There are several interesting findings. First, carbon atoms in graphene form covalent bonds with Si atoms, when placed close enough on Si (111) and (100) surfaces, but not on the (110) surface. The presence of a Si (111) surface shifts the Fermi level of graphene into its conduction band, resulting in an increase of the work function by 0.29 eV and of the electron density by three orders of magnitude.

According to the documentation, the Si (100) substrate increases the carrier density of graphene by eighty times without doping, due to the modification of the density of states near the Dirac point.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because graphene does not form covalent bonds on all studied surfaces.

The Si (111) surface actually increases the work function by 0.29 eV and increases the electron density by three orders of magnitude, not decreases them.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that no interfacial covalent bond can be formed on Si (110), contrary to what this option suggests.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and interpret complex scientific findings, distinguishing between the effects of different silicon surface orientations on graphene's properties."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Dual Graph-Laplacian PCA: A Closed-Form Solution for Bi-clustering to\n  Find \"Checkerboard\" Structures on Gene Expression Data", "source": "Jin-Xing Liu, Chun-Mei Feng, Xiang-Zhen Kong, Yong Xu", "docs_id": "1901.06794", "section": ["q-bio.GN", "cs.CE", "q-bio.QM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Dual Graph-Laplacian PCA: A Closed-Form Solution for Bi-clustering to\n  Find \"Checkerboard\" Structures on Gene Expression Data.

Quantum annealing is a generic solver for optimization problems that uses fictitious quantum fluctuation. The most groundbreaking progress in the research field of quantum annealing is its hardware implementation, i.e., the so-called quantum annealer, using artificial spins. However, the connectivity between the artificial spins is sparse and limited on a special network known as the chimera graph. Several embedding techniques have been proposed, but the number of logical spins, which represents the optimization problems to be solved, is drastically reduced. In particular, an optimization problem including fully or even partly connected spins suffers from low embeddable size on the chimera graph. In the present study, we propose an alternative approach to solve a large-scale optimization problem on the chimera graph via a well-known method in statistical mechanics called the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation or its variants. The proposed method can be used to deal with a fully connected Ising model without embedding on the chimera graph and leads to nontrivial results of the optimization problem.

In this work, we generalize the additive assumption to tree-structured functions and propose an additive tree-structured covariance function, showing improved sample-efficiency, wider applicability and greater flexibility. Furthermore, by incorporating the structure information of parameter spaces and the additive assumption in the BO loop, we develop a parallel algorithm to optimize the acquisition function and this optimization can be performed in a low dimensional space.
