The interpretation of the nuclear cross sections measured using accelerator neutrino beams involve severe difficulties, arising primarily from the average over the incoming neutrino flux. The broad energy distribution of the beam particles hampers the determination of the energy transfer to the nuclear target, the knowledge of which is needed to pin down the dominant reaction mechanism. Overcoming this problem requires the development of a theoretical approach suitable to describe neutrino interactions at energies ranging from hundreds of MeV to few GeV. In this paper, it is argued that the approach based on the factorisation of the nuclear cross section provides a consistent framework for the calculation of neutrino-nucleus interactions in both the quasi elastic and inelastic channels.

Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of software to improve its quality without modifying its external behavior. Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that refactoring has a positive impact on the understandability and maintainability of software systems. However, before carrying out refactoring activities, developers need to identify refactoring opportunities. Currently, refactoring opportunity identification heavily relies on developers' expertise and intuition. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting software refactorings.

However, current deep learning-based singular point detection methods are either two-stage or multi-stage, which makes them time-consuming. More importantly, their detection accuracy is yet unsatisfactory, especially in the case of the low-quality fingerprint. In this paper, we make a Real One-Stage Effort to detect fingerprint singular points more accurately and efficiently, and therefore we name the proposed algorithm ROSE for short, in which the multi-scale spatial attention, the Gaussian heatmap and the variant of focal loss are applied together to achieve a higher detection rate.

Measuring the closeness between two distributions with the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence, the closest distribution is called the \"information projection.\" The estimation risk of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is defined as the expectation of K-L divergence between the information projection and the predictive distribution with plugged-in MLE. Here, the asymptotic expansion of the risk is derived up to $n^{-2}$-order, and the sufficient condition on the risk for the Bayes error rate between the true distribution and the information projection to be lower than a specified value is investigated. Combining these results, the \"$p-n$ criterion\" is proposed, which determines whether the MLE is sufficiently close to the information projection for the given model and sample. In particular, the criterion for an exponential family model is relatively simple and can be used for a complex model with no explicit form of normalizing constant.

The spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in a wide energy range can usually be well described by the Band function, which is a two smoothly jointed power laws cutting at a breaking energy. Below the breaking energy, the Band function reduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple power law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working energy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can be fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy band of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well even using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample of Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the empirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the reconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram.
