The search for topological superconductors has recently become a key issue in condensed matter physics, because of their possible relevance to provide a platform for Majorana bound states, non-Abelian statistics, and fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose a new scheme which links as directly as possible the experimental search to a material-based microscopic theory for topological superconductivity. For this, the analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy, which typically uses a phenomenological ansatz for the superconductor gap functions, is elevated to a theory, where a multi-orbital functional renormalization group analysis allows for an unbiased microscopic determination of the material-dependent pairing potentials. The combined approach is highlighted for paradigmatic hexagonal systems, such as doped graphene and water-intercalated sodium cobaltates, where lattice symmetry and electronic correlations yield a propensity for a chiral singlet topological superconductor state.

This paper fills such a gap by studying the convergence of a more general proximal-GDA for regularized nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization.

Resonant annihilation of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos (UHECnu) on the cosmic neutrino background (CnuB) into Z bosons--the Z-burst mechanism--and its associated absorption and emission phenomenology provide a unique, albeit indirect, probe of the CnuB in its present state. In this paper, we examine the implications of gravitational clustering of the CnuB in nearby galaxy clusters for the Z-burst phenomenology.

Through simulating the evolution of Prisoners' dilemma game with three hierarchical distributions, we find that the levels of cooperation are enhanced in all cases, and the enhancement is optimal in the uniform case. The enhancement is due to the fact that the presence of hierarchy facilitates the formation of cooperation clusters with high-rank players acting as the nucleation cores.

Many modern tools in machine learning and signal processing, such as sparse dictionary learning, principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), $K$-means clustering, etc., rely on the factorization of a matrix obtained by concatenating high-dimensional vectors from a training collection. While the idealized task would be to optimize the expected quality of the factors over the underlying distribution of training vectors, it is achieved in practice by minimizing an empirical average over the considered collection. The focus of this paper is to provide sample complexity estimates to uniformly control how much the empirical average deviates from the expected cost function. Standard arguments imply that the performance of the empirical predictor also exhibit such guarantees.

Turing (or double-diffusive) instabilities describe pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems, and were proposed in 1952 as a potential mechanism behind pattern formation in nature, such as leopard spots and zebra stripes. Because the mechanism requires the reacting species to have significantly different diffusion rates, only a few liquid phase chemical reaction systems exhibiting the phenomenon have been discovered. In solids the situation is markedly different, since species such as impurities or other defects typically have diffusivities $\\propto\\!\\exp\\left( -E/k_{\\rm B} T\\right)$, where $E$ is the migration barrier and $T$ is the temperature.
