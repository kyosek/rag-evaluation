Inferential summaries of tree estimates are useful in the setting of evolutionary biology, where phylogenetic trees have been built from DNA data since the 1960's. In bioinformatics, psychometrics and data mining, hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and practitioners have similar questions about the stability and `generalizability' of these summaries. This paper provides an implementation of the geometric distance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) [BHV] equally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hieirarchical clustering trees, and shows some of the applications in statistical inference for which this distance can be useful. In particular, since BHV have shown that the space of trees is negatively curved (a CAT(0) space), a natural representation of a collection of trees is a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean approximations of treespace made available through Multidimensional Scaling of the matrix of distances between trees. We also provide applications of the distances between trees to hierarchical clustering trees constructed from microarrays. Our method gives a new way of evaluating the influence both of certain columns (positions, variables or genes) and of certain rows (whether species, observations or arrays)."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation about computational tools for evaluating phylogenetic and hierarchical clustering trees:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing the stability of hierarchical clustering trees generated from microarray data across multiple experiments.

The question requires analysis of tree stability and the influence of specific genes (columns in microarray data), which aligns with the documentation's mention of \"evaluating the influence both of certain columns (positions, variables or genes).\"\n\n2.

We consider the recent argument by Higuchi, Marolf and Morrison [1] that a nonlocal gauge transformation can be used to eliminate the infrared divergence of the graviton propagator, when evaluated in Bunch-Davies vacuum on the open coordinate submanifold of de Sitter space in transverse-traceless-synchronous gauge. Because the transformation is not local, the equal time commutator of undifferentiated fields no longer vanishes. From explicit examination of the Wightman function we demonstrate that the transformation adds anti-sources in the far future which cancel the bad infrared behavior but also change the propagator equation. The same problem exists in the localized version of the recent argument. Adding such anti-sources does not seem to be legitimate and could be used to eliminate the infrared divergence of the massless, minimally coupled scalar. The addition of such anti-sources in flat space QED could be effected by an almost identical gauge transformation, and would seem to eliminate the well known infrared divergences which occur in loop corrections to exclusive amplitudes."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about gauge transformations in physics, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist proposes using a nonlocal gauge transformation to eliminate the infrared divergence of the graviton propagator in de Sitter space.

While this does cancel the problematic infrared behavior, it also fundamentally changes the propagator equation. This is not a trivial side effect, but a significant alteration of the physics being described.\n\nThe importance of this problem extends beyond just the specific case of the graviton propagator in de Sitter space. The documentation notes that a similar approach could be used to eliminate the infrared divergence of the massless, minimally coupled scalar, or even the well-known infrared divergences in flat space QED. \n\nThis has profound implications because these infrared divergences are generally considered to be real physical effects with observable consequences. For example, in QED, infrared divergences play a crucial role in the description of soft photon emission and are essential for maintaining gauge invariance in scattering amplitudes.\n\nBy introducing a method that could arbitrarily eliminate such divergences, we risk losing important physical information and potentially violating fundamental principles of quantum field theory. The fact that this method could be applied so broadly (to scalar fields, QED, and gravity) suggests that it's not solving the underlying physical problem, but rather artificially removing it in a way that may not be physically justified.\n\nOption A, while true, is not the most significant problem.

Tumor cells acquire different genetic alterations during the course of evolution in cancer patients.

In recent years, many statistical and computational methods have been developed to identify tumor subclones, leading to biologically significant discoveries and shedding light on tumor progression, metastasis, drug resistance and other processes. However, most existing methods are either not able to infer the phylogenetic structure among subclones, or not able to incorporate copy number variations (CNV). In this article, we propose SIFA (tumor Subclone Identification by Feature Allocation), a Bayesian model which takes into account both CNV and tumor phylogeny structure to infer tumor subclones.

Although recent studies have shown that electricity systems with shares of wind and solar above 80% can be affordable, economists have raised concerns about market integration. Correlated generation from variable renewable sources depresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their own revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This cannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and thus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here we show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact with prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline in average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy assumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with subsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of whether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving policy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without cannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar above 80%.

We consider social activities and phenomena as proxies for user relatedness. Such activities are represented in so-called social interaction networks or evidence networks, with different degrees of explicitness. We focus on evidence networks containing relations on users, which are represented by connections between individual nodes. Explicit interaction networks are then created by specific user actions, for example, when building a friend network. On the other hand, more implicit networks capture user traces or evidences of user actions as observed in Web portals, blogs, resource sharing systems, and many other social services. These implicit networks can be applied for a broad range of analysis methods instead of using expensive gold-standard information. In this paper, we analyze different properties of a set of networks in social media. We show that there are dependencies and correlations between the networks. These allow for drawing reciprocal conclusions concerning pairs of networks, based on the assessment of structural correlations and ranking interchangeability.

This, in turn, is followed by increasingly complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse.

The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather than working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is constrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands the ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a chosen threshold.

Quantum game theory is a multidisciplinary field which combines quantum mechanics with game theory by introducing non-classical resources such as entanglement, quantum operations and quantum measurement.

Moreover, players receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise impossible in classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted that quantum versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply allowing N-partite entangled states.

Using on-shell unitarity methods, we show that higher-derivative operators are renormalized at one-loop only if they generate local, on-shell matrix elements that are invariant tensors of the electromagnetic duality group $U(N)$. The one-loop logarithmic running of the four-derivative Wilson coefficients is calculated and shown to imply the positivity of the extremality form at some finite value of $Q^2$.

Although the regularizer and constraint are usually convex, several particular features of these problems (huge dimensionality, non-smoothness) preclude the use of off-the-shelf optimization tools and have stimulated a considerable amount of research. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to handle one class of constrained problems (often known as basis pursuit denoising) tailored to image recovery applications.

The dynamical structures and oscillation properties of these shock cones strongly depend on the black hole spin parameter $a$ and Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant alpha. It is found that the various values of alpha can lead the different amounts of matter to pile up close to the black hole horizon, higher alpha causes bigger oscillation amplitude in the mass accretion rate, and the required time to reach the steady-state is getting smaller with the increase in alpha. Moreover, increasing alpha in the negative direction causes a decrease in the shock opening angle and this angle slightly increases with the increasing $\\alpha$ in the positive direction.
