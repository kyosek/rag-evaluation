Companies do not operate in a vacuum. As companies move towards an increasingly specialized production function and their reach is becoming truly global, their aptitude in managing and shaping their inter-organizational network is a determining factor in measuring their health. Current models of company financial health often lack variables explaining the inter-organizational network, and as such, assume that (1) all networks are the same and (2) the performance of partners do not impact companies.

Specifically, the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer and supplier concentrations and partners' credit risk on credit-default swap (CDS) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size. We rely upon supply-chain data from Bloomberg that provides insight into companies' relationships. The empirical results show that a well diversified customer network lowers CDS spread, while having stable partners with low default probabilities increase spreads.

I frame these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed patterns.

The evolutionary relationships among organisms have traditionally been represented using rooted phylogenetic trees. However, due to reticulate processes such as hybridization or lateral gene transfer, evolution cannot always be adequately represented by a phylogenetic tree, and rooted phylogenetic networks have been introduced as a generalization of rooted phylogenetic trees. In fact, estimating rooted phylogenetic networks from genomic sequence data and analyzing their structural properties is one of the most important tasks in contemporary phylogenetics. Over the last two decades, several subclasses of rooted phylogenetic networks (characterized by certain structural constraints) have been introduced in the literature, either to model specific biological phenomena or to enable tractable mathematical and computational analyses. In the present manuscript, we provide a thorough review of these network classes, as well as provide a biological interpretation of the structural constraints underlying these networks where possible.

We present results of ultra-deep ISOCAM observations through a cluster-lens at 7 and 15 micron with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) satellite. These observations reveal a large number of luminous Mid-Infrared (MIR) sources. Cross-identification in the optical and Near-Infrared (NIR) wavebands shows that about half of the 7 micron sources are cluster galaxies. The other 7 micron and almost all 15 micron sources are identified as lensed distant galaxies. Thanks to the gravitational amplification they constitute the faintest MIR detected sources, allowing us to extend the number counts in both the 7 and 15 micron bands. In particular, we find that the 15 micron counts have a steep slope alpha_15 = -1.5 +/- 0.3 and are large, with N_15 (>30 microJy}) = 13 +/- 5 per square arcmin. These numbers rule out non-evolutionary models and favour very strong evolution. Down to our counts limit, we found that the resolved 7 and 15 microns background radiation intensity is respectively (2 +/-0.5) 10^(-9) and (5 +/-1) 10^(-9) W m^(-2) sr^(-1)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the ultra-deep ISOCAM observations through a cluster-lens, which of the following statements is correct regarding the 15 micron source counts?\n\nA) The slope of the 15 micron counts is shallow, with \u03b1_15 = -0.5 \u00b1 0.3\nB) The number of 15 micron sources brighter than 30 microJy is 3 \u00b1 1 per square arcmin\nC) The 15 micron counts favor non-evolutionary models of galaxy formation\nD) The slope of the 15 micron counts is steep, with \u03b1_15 = -1.5 \u00b1 0.3, and the number of sources brighter than 30 microJy is 13 \u00b1 5 per square arcmin\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation clearly states that the 15 micron counts have a steep slope \u03b1_15 = -1.5 \u00b1 0.3 and that N_15 (>30 microJy) = 13 \u00b1 5 per square arcmin. This finding rules out non-evolutionary models and favors very strong evolution in galaxy formation and evolution. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a shallow slope, which contradicts the steep slope mentioned in the document. \n\nOption B is incorrect as it underestimates the number of sources per square arcmin. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the document explicitly states that these numbers rule out non-evolutionary models."}}
