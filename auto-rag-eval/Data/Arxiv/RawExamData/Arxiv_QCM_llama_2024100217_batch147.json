Detection of rare variants by resequencing is important for the identification of individuals carrying disease variants. Rapid sequencing by new technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it is still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve cost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which enable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals. However, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals in a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases. We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach, which is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental procedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially in situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual. Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance performance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing costs. For example, when targeting a small enough genomic region (~100 base-pairs) and using only ~10 sequencing lanes and ~10 distinct barcodes, one can recover the identity of 4 rare allele carriers out of a population of over 4000 individuals."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary advantage of the proposed pooling design in the detection of rare allele carriers, and how does it differ from previous pooling designs?\n\nA) It requires a large number of sequencing lanes to achieve high coverage, making it less efficient.\nB) It is limited to detecting rare allele carriers in groups of only a few individuals, and requires specific pooling schemes for each case.\nC) It enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than previous designs, especially in situations with high coverage for each individual.\nD) It is only feasible for small genomic regions and requires a large number of distinct barcodes.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) It enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than previous designs, especially in situations with high coverage for each individual.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is C) because the proposed pooling design, based on compressed sensing, enables the detection of rare allele carriers in larger groups than previous designs, which were limited to detecting carriers in groups of only a few individuals.

For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums.

Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies. Combining these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to the published Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task, while using very little auxiliary storage in the optimizer.

Compressed Sensing (CS) seeks to recover an unknown vector with $N$ entries by making far fewer than $N$ measurements; it posits that the number of compressed sensing measurements should be comparable to the information content of the vector, not simply $N$. CS combines the important task of compression directly with the measurement task. Since its introduction in 2004 there have been hundreds of manuscripts on CS, a large fraction of which develop algorithms to recover a signal from its compressed measurements. Because of the paradoxical nature of CS -- exact reconstruction from seemingly undersampled measurements -- it is crucial for acceptance of an algorithm that rigorous analyses verify the degree of undersampling the algorithm permits. The Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) has become the dominant tool used for the analysis in such cases. We present here an asymmetric form of RIP which gives tighter bounds than the usual symmetric one. We give the best known bounds on the RIP constants for matrices from the Gaussian ensemble.
