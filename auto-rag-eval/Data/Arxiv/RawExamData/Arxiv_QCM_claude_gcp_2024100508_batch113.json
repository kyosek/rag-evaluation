The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism.

This paper presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global and local models. The new model, which we call decoupled PLDA, is tested on a speaker verification task. Experimental results show that it consistently outperforms the vanilla PLDA when the model is based on raw speaker vectors. However, when the speaker vectors are processed by length normalization, the advantage of decoupled PLDA will be largely lost, suggesting future research on non-linear local models."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the core concept and challenge addressed by the decoupled Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) approach as presented in the study?\n\nA) It aims to completely replace the simple linear Gaussian model with a more complex non-linear model.\n\nB) It seeks to improve PLDA's modeling capacity while maintaining its simplicity by combining a simple global model with a complex local model.\n\nC) It focuses solely on enhancing the global model's complexity to better represent the entire dataset.\n\nD) It proposes using only local models to capture individual class details without considering the overall data distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the study presents a decoupling approach that aims to improve PLDA's modeling capacity while retaining its simplicity.

Recently, much research in the string matching field has focused on the efficiency and flexibility of the searching procedure and quite effective techniques have been proposed for speeding up the existing solutions. In this context, algorithms based on factors recognition are among the best solutions. In this paper, we present a simple and very efficient algorithm for string matching based on a weak factor recognition and hashing. Our algorithm has a quadratic worst-case running time. However, despite its quadratic complexity, experimental results show that our algorithm obtains in most cases the best running times when compared, under various conditions, against the most effective algorithms present in literature. In the case of small alphabets and long patterns, the gain in running times reaches 28%. This makes our proposed algorithm one of the most flexible solutions in practical cases."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and performance characteristics of the string matching algorithm presented in the paper?\n\nA) It uses strong factor recognition and has a linear worst-case running time, performing best with large alphabets and short patterns.\n\nB) It employs weak factor recognition and hashing, has a quadratic worst-case running time, but shows superior performance in most practical cases, especially with small alphabets and long patterns.\n\nC) It utilizes strong factor recognition and hashing, has a linear average-case running time, and performs consistently across all alphabet sizes and pattern lengths.\n\nD) It implements weak factor recognition without hashing, has a logarithmic worst-case running time, and excels with large alphabets and short patterns.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the paper describes an algorithm that uses weak factor recognition and hashing. It explicitly states that the algorithm has a quadratic worst-case running time. Despite this theoretical complexity, the algorithm shows superior performance in practical cases, particularly for small alphabets and long patterns, where it achieves up to 28% improvement in running times compared to other effective algorithms.

Prediction of events in financial markets is every investor's dream and, usually, wishful thinking. From a more general, economic and societal viewpoint, the identification of indicators for large events is highly desirable to assess systemic risks. Unfortunately, the very nature of financial markets, particularly the predominantly non-Markovian character as well as non-stationarity, make this challenge a formidable one, leaving little hope for fully fledged answers. Nevertheless, it is called for to collect pieces of evidence in a variety of observables to be assembled like the pieces of a puzzle that eventually might help to catch a glimpse of long-term indicators or precursors for large events - if at all in a statistical sense. Here, we present a new piece for this puzzle. We use the quasi-stationary market states which exist in the time evolution of the correlation structure in financial markets. Recently, we identified such market states relative to the collective motion of the market as a whole. We study their precursor properties in the US stock markets over 16 years, including two crises, the dot-com bubble burst and the pre-phase of the Lehman Brothers crash.

This paper provides a study and discussion of earlier as well as novel more efficient schemes for the precise evaluation of finite-temperature response functions of strongly correlated quantum systems in the framework of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG).

Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning method that has been proposed to allow training of models using data from many different clients, without these clients having to transfer all their data to a central server. There has as yet been relatively little consideration of FL or other privacy-preserving methods in audio. In this paper, we investigate using FL for a sound event detection task using audio from the FSD50K dataset. Audio is split into clients based on uploader metadata. This results in highly imbalanced subsets of data between clients, noted as a key issue in FL scenarios. A series of models is trained using `high-volume' clients that contribute 100 audio clips or more, testing the effects of varying FL parameters, followed by an additional model trained using all clients with no minimum audio contribution. It is shown that FL models trained using the high-volume clients can perform similarly to a centrally-trained model, though there is much more noise in results than would typically be expected for a centrally-trained model.
