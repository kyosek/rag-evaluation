Current state-of-the-art object detectors can have significant performance drop when deployed in the wild due to domain gaps with training data. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt models for new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. However, without ground truth labels, most prior works on UDA for object detection tasks can only perform coarse image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using adversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based methods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain content distribution gap that is shown to be important for object detectors. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Cross-Domain Semi-Supervised Learning (CDSSL) framework by leveraging high-quality pseudo labels to learn better representations from the target domain directly. To enable SSL for cross-domain object detection, we propose fine-grained domain transfer, progressive-confidence-based label sharpening and imbalanced sampling strategy to address two challenges: (i) non-identical distribution between source and target domain data, (ii) error amplification/accumulation due to noisy pseudo labeling on the target domain. Experiment results show that our proposed approach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance (2.2% - 9.5% better than prior best work on mAP) under various domain gap scenarios.

This paper augments the existing macroscopic circuit noise model for phase noise in relaxation oscillators by showing the microscopic origins of the noise and explains temperature dependency. The noise arises from fluctuation of the energy accompanying the excess carriers on device (transistors) capacitors in the oscillator. Such fluctuation has its physical origin from the noise of such carriers, which, microscopically, are distributed across the energy levels (Fermi-Dirac). Furthermore this energy can be interpreted, circuit-wise, such that its gradient, with respect to circuit state variables, correspond to time evolution of current and voltage i.e. the oscillator dynamics.
