As a fragile construction, a granular pile is very sensitive to minute external perturbations. In particular, it is now well established that a granular assembly is sensitive to variations of temperature. Such variations can produce localized rearrangements as well as global static avalanches inside a pile. In this review, we sum up the various observations that have been made concerning the effect of temperature on a granular assembly. In particular, we dwell on the way controlled variations of temperature have been employed to generate the compaction of a granular pile. After laying emphasis on the key features of this compaction process, we compare it to the classic vibration-induced compaction. Finally, we also review other granular systems in a large sense, from microscopic (jammed multilamellar vesicles) to macroscopic scales (stone heave phenomenon linked to freezing and thawing of soils) for which periodic variations of temperature could play a key role in the dynamics at stake."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the effects of temperature variations on granular piles.

The documentation states that temperature variations can produce both \"localized rearrangements as well as global static avalanches inside a pile.\" It also mentions that controlled temperature variations have been used to generate compaction in granular piles, and that this process shares key features with vibration-induced compaction. This aligns with option C, which accurately describes the effects of temperature changes on granular piles and their similarity to vibration-induced compaction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because temperature variations affect more than just the surface, causing internal rearrangements as well.

We estimated the metallicity of 4141 M dwarf stars with spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using a molecular band strength versus metallicity calibration developed using high resolution spectra of nearby M dwarfs. Using a sample of M dwarfs with measured magnitudes, parallaxes, and metallicities, we derived a relation that describes the absolute magnitude variation as a function of metallicity. When we examined the metallicity distribution of SDSS stars, after correcting for the different volumes sampled by the magnitude-limited survey, we found that there is an M dwarf problem, with the number of M dwarfs at [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 less than 1% the number at [Fe/H] = 0, where a simple model of Galactic chemical evolution predicts a more gradual drop in star numbers with decreasing metallicity."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The \"M dwarf problem\" in galactic evolution refers to:\n\nA) An overabundance of high-metallicity M dwarf stars compared to theoretical models\nB) A discrepancy between observed and predicted numbers of low-metallicity M dwarf stars\nC) The difficulty in accurately measuring metallicity in M dwarf spectra\nD) An unexplained gap in the mass distribution of M dwarf stars\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \"M dwarf problem\" refers to the discrepancy between the observed number of low-metallicity M dwarf stars and the predictions of simple closed-box models of galactic chemical evolution.

As the angular velocities of the oscillators are updated, the leader and follower status may also be reassigned.

Private information retrieval (PIR) is a protocol that guarantees the privacy of a user who is in communication with databases. The user wants to download one of the messages stored in the databases while hiding the identity of the desired message. Recently, the benefits that can be obtained by weakening the privacy requirement have been studied, but the definition of weak privacy needs to be elaborated upon. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the weak privacy (i.e., information leakage) in PIR problems by using the R\\'enyi divergence that generalizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. By introducing R\\'enyi divergence into the existing PIR problem, the tradeoff relationship between privacy (information leakage) and PIR performance (download cost) is characterized via convex optimization. Furthermore, we propose an alternative PIR scheme with smaller message sizes than the Tian-Sun-Chen (TSC) scheme.
