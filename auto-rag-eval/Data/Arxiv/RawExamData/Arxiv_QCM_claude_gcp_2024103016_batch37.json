The creative Education system is one of the effective education systems in many countries like Finland, Denmark, and South Korea. Bangladesh Government has also launched the creative curriculum system in 2009 in both primary and secondary levels, where changes have been made in educational contents and exam question patterns. These changes in the previous curriculum aimed to avoid memorization and less creativity and increase the students' level of understanding and critical thinking. Though the Government has taken these steps, the quality of the educational system in Bangladesh is still deteriorating. Since the curriculum has been changed recently, this policy issue got massive attention of the people because the problem of a substandard education system has arisen. Many students have poor performances in examinations, including entrance hall exams in universities and board examinations. This deteriorating situation is mostly for leakage of question paper, inadequate equipment and materials, and insufficient training. As a result, the existing education system has failed to provide the standard level of education. This research will discuss and find why this creative educational system is getting impacted by these factors. It will be qualitative research.

Advances in materials science have led to physical instantiations of self-assembled networks of memristive devices and demonstrations of their computational capability through reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is an approach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time computing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a time-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a desired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal amplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which improves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number of output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small networks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform generation tasks.
