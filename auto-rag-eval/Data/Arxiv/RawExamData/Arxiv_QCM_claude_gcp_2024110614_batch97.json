The proliferation of edge networks creates islands of learning agents working on local streams of data.

Transferring knowledge in a selective decentralized approach enables models to retain their local insights, allowing for local flavors of a machine learning model. This approach suits the decentralized architecture of edge networks, as a local edge node will serve a community of learning agents that will likely encounter similar data.

Semi-Grundy functions offer a potential workaround for digraphs that lack a kernel but possess a semi-kernel, which is not possible with traditional Grundy functions.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on the NP-completeness of determining Grundy functions, but this doesn't specifically advantage Semi-Grundy functions.\n\nOption C is plausible because the documentation mentions that the size of a Semi-Grundy function is an upper bound for the chromatic number, but this isn't the primary advantage over Grundy functions.\n\nOption D is tempting because the documentation discusses Semi-Grundy functions for product digraphs, but this isn't uniquely advantageous compared to Grundy functions.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple concepts and applying them to a real-world scenario in game theory and algorithm development."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "Automated Crowdturfing Attacks and Defenses in Online Review Systems", "source": "Yuanshun Yao, Bimal Viswanath, Jenna Cryan, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y.

We seek to minimize the expected average communication delay to service the data transmission requests, subject to an average power constraint on the mobility of the UAV. The problem is cast as a semi-Markov decision process, and it is shown that the policy exhibits a two-scale structure, which can be efficiently optimized: in the outer decision, upon starting a communication phase, and given its current radius, the UAV selects a target end radius position so as to optimally balance a trade-off between average long-term communication delay and power consumption; in the inner decision, the UAV selects its trajectory between the start radius and the selected end radius, so as to greedily minimize the delay and energy consumption to serve the current request.

Here we report an experiment to explore the parity-odd interaction between moving polarized electrons and unpolarized nucleons using a magnetic force microscope.

Let's break down each option:\n\nA) This option is incorrect because eliminating the periodic density modulation would actually reduce the experiment's ability to detect the exotic interaction. The alternating gold and silicon dioxide stripes provide the necessary nucleon density variation to potentially observe the interaction effects.\n\nB) While increasing the oscillation frequency might help reduce some types of environmental noise, it doesn't directly address the primary challenge of detecting the very weak exotic interaction. The question asks for the modification that would \"most likely\" enhance sensitivity, and there are more impactful changes that could be made.\n\nC) This is a tricky distractor.

Cooling the system to cryogenic temperatures would significantly reduce thermal noise in the cantilever. Thermal fluctuations are a major source of noise in high-precision measurements like this one.

The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly states that in the kinematical regime of very forward rapidities and low transverse momentum, a new state of matter called the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is expected to form. This state is characterized by a large number of gluons at very small Bjorken x values.\n\nThe key aspects that make this the correct choice are:\n1.

It correctly associates this with small Bjorken x, as stated in the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because quark-gluon plasma is typically associated with heavy-ion collisions, not proton-proton collisions as described here. \n\nOption C, while plausible, does not capture the fundamental change in the gluon dynamics that the CGC represents. Enhanced soft gluon radiation is a more general feature of high-energy collisions and doesn't specifically explain the deviation from traditional models.\n\nOption D touches on an important concept in high-energy QCD, but the breakdown of collinear factorization alone doesn't fully explain the observations. The CGC formalism goes beyond this to describe a new state of matter.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the kinematical regime of interest, the formation of the CGC, and its ability to describe data that deviates from traditional phenomenological models.

Anatomical landmarks are a crucial prerequisite for many medical imaging tasks. Usually, the set of landmarks for a given task is predefined by experts. The landmark locations for a given image are then annotated manually or via machine learning methods trained on manual annotations. In this paper, in contrast, we present a method to automatically discover and localize anatomical landmarks in medical images. Specifically, we consider landmarks that attract the visual attention of humans, which we term visually salient landmarks. We illustrate the method for fetal neurosonographic images. First, full-length clinical fetal ultrasound scans are recorded with live sonographer gaze-tracking. Next, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict the gaze point distribution (saliency map) of the sonographers on scan video frames. The CNN is then used to predict saliency maps of unseen fetal neurosonographic images, and the landmarks are extracted as the local maxima of these saliency maps. Finally, the landmarks are matched across images by clustering the landmark CNN features. We show that the discovered landmarks can be used within affine image registration, with average landmark alignment errors between 4.1% and 10.9% of the fetal head long axis length."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing an AI system to assist in fetal neurosonography.

The weakest form of SCP is called 1-SCP, where we only aim to provide resilience against the collusion of the miner and a single user. Sadly, despite the various attempts, to the best of knowledge, no existing mechanism can satisfy all three properties in all situations. Since the TFM departs from classical mechanism design in modeling and assumptions, to date, our understanding of the design space is relatively little. In this paper, we further unravel the mathematical structure of transaction fee mechanism design by proving the following results: - Can we have a dream TFM? - Rethinking the incentive compatibility notions. - Do the new design elements make a difference?"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFM) in blockchain systems, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A blockchain startup is designing a new transaction fee mechanism for their platform.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that \"to the best of knowledge, no existing mechanism can satisfy all three properties in all situations.\" This strongly suggests that a mechanism satisfying all three properties is currently believed to be impossible.\n\n2.

D is a tempting distractor because trade-offs are common in complex systems. However, the question states that the startup claims to have fully satisfied all three properties, not achieved a trade-off.\n\n5. C is the most likely scenario because it's common for implementations to misunderstand or incorrectly apply theoretical concepts, especially in complex domains like blockchain mechanism design.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to critically evaluate claims in light of established research, apply skepticism to purported breakthroughs, and understand the fundamental challenges in transaction fee mechanism design.

The Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2 (103P) was the target of the NASA EPOXI mission. In support of this mission, we conducted observations from radio to submillimeter wavelengths of comet 103P in the three weeks preceding the spacecraft rendezvous on UT 2010 November 4.58. This time period included the passage at perihelion and the closest approach of the comet to the Earth.

The water production rate, QH2O = (0.67 - 1.07) x 10^28 s^-1, was determined from the GBT OH data. From the average abundance ratios of HCN and H2CO relative to water (0.13 +/- 0.03 % and 0.14 +/- 0.03 %, respectively), we conclude that H2CO is depleted and HCN is normal with respect to typically-observed cometary mixing ratios.
