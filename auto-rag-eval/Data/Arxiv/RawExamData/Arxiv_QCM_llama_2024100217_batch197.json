While the properties of such models are less well-known, a numerical study with Ricker density-dependence suggested that when competition coefficients acting on juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies, stage structure could foster coexistence. We revisit and expand those results using models more amenable to mathematical analysis. First, through a Beverton-Holt two-species juvenile-adult model, we obtain analytical expressions explaining how this coexistence emerging from life-history complexity can occur. Second, we show using a community-level sensitivity analysis that such emergent coexistence is robust to perturbations of parameter values. Finally, we ask whether these results extend from two to many species, using simulations. We show that they do not, as coexistence emerging from life-history complexity is only seen for very similar life-history parameters.

Modification of the radiation and the quantum efficiencies resulting from varying the position of the emitter and the orientation of its dipole moment are calculated by using a rigorous electromagnetic method based on Green's second identity. Large enhancements in the emission and the radiation of the emitter occur due to the coupling with the antenna surface plasmons in the spectral region from 4THz to 15THz.

Two-neutron transfer associated with the pair correlation in superfluid neutron-rich nuclei is studied with focus on low-lying $0^+$ states in Sn isotopes beyond the N=82 magic number. We describe microscopically the two-neutron addition and removal transitions by means of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field model and the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation formulated in the coordinate space representation. It is found that the pair transfer strength for the transitions between the ground states becomes significantly large for the isotopes with $A \\ge 140$, reflecting very small neutron separation energy and long tails of the weakly bound $3p$ orbits. In $^{132-140}$Sn, a peculiar feature of the pair transfer is seen in transitions to low-lying excited $0^+$ states. They can be regarded as a novel kind of pair vibrational mode which is characterized by an anomalously long tail of the transition density extending to far outside of the nuclear surface, and a large strength comparable to that of the ground-state transitions. The presence of the weakly bound neutron orbits plays a central role for these anomalous behaviors."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary reason for the anomalous pair transfer strength observed in the low-lying $0^+$ states of Sn isotopes beyond the N=82 magic number, particularly in the range $A \\ge 140$?\n\nA) The presence of strong neutron pairing correlations in the nucleus.\nB) The influence of the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation on the nuclear wave function.\nC) The role of weakly bound $3p$ orbits in the neutron-rich nuclei, leading to a significant decrease in neutron separation energy.\nD) The impact of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field model on the nuclear pairing correlations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The role of weakly bound $3p$ orbits in the neutron-rich nuclei, leading to a significant decrease in neutron separation energy.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) because the documentation states that the pair transfer strength becomes significantly large for isotopes with $A \\ge 140$, reflecting very small neutron separation energy and long tails of the weakly bound $3p$ orbits.
