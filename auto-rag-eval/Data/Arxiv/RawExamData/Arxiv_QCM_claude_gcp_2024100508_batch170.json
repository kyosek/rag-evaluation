In this paper, we present the first laboratory experiments that show the generation of internal solitary waves by the impingement of a quasi-two-dimensional internal wave beam on a pycnocline. These experiments were inspired by observations of internal solitary waves in the deep ocean from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, where this so-called mechanism of 'local generation' was argued to be at work, here in the form of internal tidal beams hitting the thermocline.

Furthermore, datasets can be hard to share between research entities, as the machine learning models and the collected user data from the user studies may be IPR- or GDPR-sensitive.

To overcome these difficulties, this study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled with time series elements according to our algorithm. The accuracy of the classification of images from the MNIST-10 database is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The novelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing the input information in the res-ervoir. Greater complexity in the time series leads to a higher classification accuracy and higher NNetEn values.

The documentation states that \"The most prominent structures in the cross section are rainbow singularities.

The hard thermal loop approximation has been used for the heat bath to compute various form factors associated with the gauge boson's two point functions both in strong and weak field approximation.

These systems can support a large variety of stable bright and dark dissipative solitons that can interact with each other and with the inhomogeneities of the pump. One of the focus points of this work is the influence of slow variations of the pump on the behavior of the solitons. It is shown that for the fixed sets of parameters the effect of pump inhomogeneities on the solitons is not the same for the solitons of different kinds. The second main goal of the paper is systematic studies of the interaction between the solitons of the same or of different kinds. It is demonstrated that various scenarios of inter-soliton interactions can occur: the solitons can repulse each other or get attracted.
