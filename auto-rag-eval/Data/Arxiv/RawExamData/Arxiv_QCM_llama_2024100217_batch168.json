We do this using a sample of stars that have all been previously mapped with Zeeman-Doppler imaging. For a given star, as long as its mass-loss rate is below some critical mass-loss rate, only the dipolar fields contribute to its spin-down torque. However, if it has a larger mass-loss rate, higher order modes need to be considered. For each star, we calculate this critical mass-loss rate, which is a simple function of the field geometry. Additionally, we use two methods of estimating mass-loss rates for our sample of stars. In the majority of cases, we find that the estimated mass-loss rates do not exceed the critical mass-loss rate and hence, the dipolar magnetic field alone is sufficient to determine the spin-down torque.

Federated Learning (FL), an emerging paradigm for fast intelligent acquisition at the network edge, enables joint training of a machine learning model over distributed data sets and computing resources with limited disclosure of local data.

In this paper, we consider a network of wireless devices sharing a common fading wireless channel for the deployment of FL. Each device holds a generally distinct training set, and communication typically takes place in a Device-to-Device (D2D) manner. In the ideal case in which all devices within communication range can communicate simultaneously and noiselessly, a standard protocol that is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution of the global empirical risk minimization problem under convexity and connectivity assumptions is Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD).

High spectral and spatial resolution, mid-infrared fine structure line observations toward two ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions (G29.96 -0.02 and Mon R2) allow us to study the structure and kinematics of cometary UCHII regions. In our earlier study of Mon R2, we showed that highly organized mass motions accounted for most of the velocity structure in that UCHII region. In this work, we show that the kinematics in both Mon R2 and G29.96 are consistent with motion along an approximately paraboloidal shell. We model the velocity structure seen in our mapping data and test the stellar wind bow shock model for such paraboloidal like flows. The observations and the simulation indicate that the ram pressures of the stellar wind and ambient interstellar medium cause the accumulated mass in the bow shock to flow along the surface of the shock. A relaxation code reproduces the mass flow's velocity structure as derived by the analytical solution. It further predicts that the pressure gradient along the flow can accelerate ionized gas to a speed higher than that of the moving star.
