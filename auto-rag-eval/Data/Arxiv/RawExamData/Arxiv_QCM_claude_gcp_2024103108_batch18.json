However, since most real-life conversations occur randomly and are sparsely overlapped, we argue that training with different overlap ratio data benefits. To do so, an unavoidable problem is that the popularly used SI-SNR loss has no definition for silent sources. This paper proposes the weighted SI-SNR loss, together with the joint learning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss imposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker's duration and returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD generates masks and sets non-target speech to silence.

The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance between positive effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and autonomy) and its downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work life). Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of workers, such as women.

Following the seminal works of Downs (1957) and Sims (1998), we assume that voters are rationally inattentive and can process information about the policies at a cost proportional to entropy reduction. The main finding is an equilibrium phenomenon called attention- and media-driven extremism, namely as we increase the attention cost or garble the news technology, a truncated set of the equilibria captures voters' attention through enlarging the policy differentials between the varying types of the candidates.

In these remarks, we clarify the problematic aspects of gravitational interaction in a weak-field limit of Kaluza-Klein models.

This is the main reason of the problem. It happens for all considered models (linear with respect to the scalar curvature and nonlinear $f(R)$, with toroidal and spherical compactifications). We explicitly single out the contribution of the fifth force to nonrelativistic gravitational potentials. In the case of models with toroidal compactification, we demonstrate how tension (with and without effects of nonlinearity) of the gravitating source can fix the total volume of the internal space, resulting in the vanishing fifth force and consequently in agreement with the observations. It takes place for latent solitons, black strings and black branes. We also demonstrate a particular example where non-vanishing variations of the internal space volume do not contradict the gravitational experiments.

Realistic Fermi surface topologies in layered ferromagnets are taken into account, with the possibilities of different types of orbits depending on the electron spin. Both configurations, with ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic couplings between magnetic layers, are considered and the transmission coefficient for scattering at the interface boundary is modelled to include magnetic and roughness contributions.

The Chicago Air Shower Array (CASA), operating in coincidence with the Michigan muon array (MIA), has recorded over 2.2 x 10^{9} air showers from April 4, 1990 to October 7, 1995. We search for gamma rays based upon the muon content of air showers arriving from the direction of the galactic plane. We find no significant evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission, and we set an upper limit on the ratio of gamma rays to normal hadronic cosmic rays at less than 2.4 x 10^{-5} at 310 TeV (90% confidence limit) from the galactic plane region: (50 degrees < l < 200 degrees); -5 degrees < b < 5 degrees). This limit places a strong constraint on models for emission from molecular clouds in the galaxy. We rule out significant spectral hardening in the outer galaxy, and conclude that emission from the plane at these energies is likely to be dominated by the decay of neutral pions resulting from cosmic rays interactions with passive target gas molecules."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the CASA-MIA experiment's search for diffuse ultrahigh energy gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane, which of the following conclusions can be drawn?\n\nA) The experiment found significant evidence of gamma-ray emission from molecular clouds in the galactic disk.\n\nB) The upper limit on the ratio of gamma rays to normal hadronic cosmic rays was set at 2.4 x 10^{-5} at 1 PeV.\n\nC) The results suggest that emission from the galactic plane at these energies is likely dominated by inverse Compton scattering.\n\nD) The experiment ruled out significant spectral hardening in the outer galaxy and constrained models of emission from molecular clouds.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

Traditional studies about disease dynamics have focused on global stability issues, due to their epidemiological importance. We study a classical SIR-SI model for arboviruses in two different directions: we begin by describing an alternative proof of previously known global stability results by using only a Lyapunov approach. In the sequel, we take a different view and we argue that vectors and hosts can have very distinctive intrinsic time-scales, and that such distinctiveness extends to the disease dynamics. Under these hypothesis, we show that two asymptotic regimes naturally appear: the fast host dynamics and the fast vector dynamics. The former regime yields, at leading order, a SIR model for the hosts, but with a rational incidence rate. In this case, the vector disappears from the model, and the dynamics is similar to a directly contagious disease. The latter yields a SI model for the vectors, with the hosts disappearing from the model.
