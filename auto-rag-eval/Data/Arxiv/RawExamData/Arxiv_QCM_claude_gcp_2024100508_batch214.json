Understanding the controlling mechanisms underlying injection-induced seismicity is important for optimizing reservoir productivity and addressing seismicity-related concerns related to hydraulic stimulation in Enhanced Geothermal Systems. Hydraulic stimulation enhances permeability through elevated pressures, which cause normal deformations, and the shear slip of pre-existing fractures. Previous experiments indicate that fracture deformation in the normal direction reverses as the pressure decreases, e.g., at the end of stimulation. We hypothesize that this normal closure of fractures enhances pressure propagation away from the injection region and significantly increases the potential for post-injection seismicity. To test this hypothesis, hydraulic stimulation is modeled by numerically coupling fracture deformation, pressure diffusion and stress alterations for a synthetic geothermal reservoir in which the flow and mechanics are strongly affected by a complex three-dimensional fracture network. The role of the normal closure of fractures is verified by comparing simulations conducted with and without the normal closure effect."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the hypothesized mechanism for post-injection seismicity in Enhanced Geothermal Systems according to the study?\n\nA) Shear slip of pre-existing fractures during pressure increase\nB) Normal closure of fractures after pressure decrease\nC) Continuous pressure diffusion throughout the reservoir\nD) Formation of new fractures due to stress alterations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The study hypothesizes that the normal closure of fractures after pressure decreases (e.g., at the end of stimulation) enhances pressure propagation away from the injection region and significantly increases the potential for post-injection seismicity.

While volume-based grid tariffs have been the norm for residential consumers, capacity-based tariffs will become more relevant with the increasing electrification of society. A further development is capacity subscription, where consumers are financially penalised for exceeding their subscribed capacity, or alternatively their demand is limited to the subscribed level. The penalty or limitation can either be static (always active) or dynamic, meaning that it is only activated when there are active grid constraints. We investigate the cost impact for static and dynamic capacity subscription tariffs, for 84 consumers based on six years of historical load data. We use several approaches for finding the optimal subscription level ex ante. The results show that annual costs remain both stable and similar for most consumers, with a few exceptions for those that have high peak demand. In the case of a physical limitation, it is important to use a stochastic approach for the optimal subscription level to avoid excessive demand limitations.

In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based Automatic Graphene Detection Method with Color Correction (MLA-GDCC), a reliable and autonomous graphene detection from microscopic images. The MLA-GDCC includes a white balance (WB) to correct the color imbalance on the images, a modified U-Net and a support vector machine (SVM) to segment the graphene flakes. Considering the color shifts of the images caused by different cameras, we apply WB correction to correct the imbalance of the color pixels. A modified U-Net model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for fast and precise image segmentation, is introduced to segment the graphene flakes from the background. In order to improve the pixel-level accuracy, we implement a SVM after the modified U-Net model to separate the monolayer and bilayer graphene flakes. The MLA-GDCC achieves flake-level detection rates of 87.09% for monolayer and 90.41% for bilayer graphene, and the pixel-level accuracy of 99.27% for monolayer and 98.92% for bilayer graphene.

The automated analysis of social networks has become an important problem due to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and Facebook. The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can handle massive networks.
