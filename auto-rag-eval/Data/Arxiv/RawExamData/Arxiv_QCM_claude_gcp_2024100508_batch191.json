We modified the Lotka-Volterra Equations with the assumption that two of the original four constant parameters in the traditional equations are time-dependent. In the first place, we assumed that the human population (borrowed from the T-Function) plays the role as the prey while all lethal factors that jeopardize the existence of the human race as the predator. Although we could still calculate the time-dependent lethal function, the idea of treating the lethal factors as the prey was too general to recognize the meaning of them. Hence, in the second part of the modified Lotka-Volterra Equations, we exchanged the roles between the prey and the predator. This time, we treated the prey as the natural resources while the predator as the human population (still borrowed from the T-Function). After carefully choosing appropriate parameters to match the maximum carrying capacity with the saturated number of the human population predicted by the T-Function, we successfully calculated the natural resources as a function of time.

Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is one of the most promising methods in cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search. Most CMH solutions ideally assume the labels of training and testing set are identical. However, the assumption is often violated, causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones using label attributes. However, the attributes are isolated from the features of multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap, we introduce an approach called LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing). LAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec model and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common subspace. Next, it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix to guide the feature extraction network of different modalities.

Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively studied for low-dose CT denoising thanks to its superior performance despite the fast computational time. In particular, cycleGAN has been demonstrated as a powerful unsupervised learning scheme to improve the low-dose CT image quality without requiring matched high-dose reference data. Unfortunately, one of the main limitations of the cycleGAN approach is that it requires two deep neural network generators at the training phase, although only one of them is used at the inference phase. The secondary auxiliary generator is needed to enforce the cycle-consistency, but the additional memory requirement and increases of the learnable parameters are the main huddles for cycleGAN training. To address this issue, here we propose a novel cycleGAN architecture using a single switchable generator. In particular, a single generator is implemented using adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layers so that the baseline generator converting a low-dose CT image to a routine-dose CT image can be switched to a generator converting high-dose to low-dose by simply changing the AdaIN code. Thanks to the shared baseline network, the additional memory requirement and weight increases are minimized, and the training can be done more stably even with small training data.

Single-pixel imaging is a novel imaging scheme that has gained popularity due to its huge computational gain and potential for a low-cost alternative to imaging beyond the visible spectrum.

As a remedy, several deep-learning-based solutions have been proposed which lack good generalization ability due to the architectural setup and loss functions.

This indicates that coherence alone can not be enough to explain all the structural features observed in many real-world networks.

Since the mesh does not fit the boundary, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed weakly by a stabilized Nitsche-type approach. The addition of CIP-like ghost-penalties in the boundary zone allows to prove that our method is inf-sup stable and to derive optimal order a priori error estimates in an energy-type norm, irrespective of how the boundary cuts the underlying mesh.
