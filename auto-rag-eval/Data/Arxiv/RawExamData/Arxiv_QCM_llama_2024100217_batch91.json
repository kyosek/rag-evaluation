First, we apply the formalism of nonholonomic frame deformations (formally considered for nonholonomic manifolds and Finsler spaces) when the gravitational field equations transform into systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which can be integrated in general form. The new classes of solutions are defined by generic off-diagonal metrics depending on integration functions on one, two and three (or three and four) variables if we consider four (or five) dimensional spacetimes. Second, we use a general scheme when one (two) parameter families of exact solutions are defined by any source-free solutions of Einstein's equations with one (two) Killing vector field(s). A successive iteration procedure results in new classes of solutions characterized by an infinite number of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary functions on one variable. Five classes of exact off-diagonal solutions are constructed in vacuum Einstein and in string gravity describing solitonic pp-wave interactions.
