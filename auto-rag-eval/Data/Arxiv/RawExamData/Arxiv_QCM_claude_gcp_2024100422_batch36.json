Motivated by many applications in complex domains with boundaries exposed to large topological changes or deformations, fictitious domain methods regard the actual domain of interest as being embedded in a fixed Cartesian background. This is usually achieved via a geometric parameterization of its boundary via level-set functions. In this note, the a priori analysis of unfitted numerical schemes with cut elements is extended beyond the realm of linear problems. More precisely, we consider the discretization of semilinear elliptic boundary value problems of the form $- \\Delta u +f_1(u)=f_2$ with polynomial nonlinearity via the cut finite element method. Boundary conditions are enforced, using a Nitsche-type approach. To ensure stability and error estimates that are independent of the position of the boundary with respect to the mesh, the formulations are augmented with additional boundary zone ghost penalty terms.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly deployed on end devices that exist in constantly changing environments.

However, end devices have limited resources making it challenging to train on the same device.

Spectral and Temporal properties of black hole candidates can be explained reasonably well using Chakrabarti-Titarchuk solution of two component advective flow (TCAF).

This article identifies how scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency influence exchange behavior. Analyzing the mechanisms governing exchange of resources constitutes the foundation of several social-science perspectives. Neoclassical economics provides one of the most well-known perspectives of how rational individuals allocate and exchange resources. Using Rational Choice Theory (RCT), neoclassical economics assumes that exchange between two individuals will occur when resources are scarce and that these individuals interact rationally to satisfy their requirements (i.e., preferences). While RCT is useful to characterize interaction in closed and stylized systems, it proves insufficient to capture social and psychological reality where culture, emotions, and habits play an integral part in resource exchange. Social Resource Theory (SRT) improves on RCT in several respects by making the social nature of resources the object of study. SRT shows how human interaction is driven by an array of psychological mechanisms, from emotions to heuristics. Thus, SRT provides a more realistic foundation for analyzing and explaining social exchange than the stylized instrumental rationality of RCT.

This paper develops a nonparametric model that represents how sequences of outcomes and treatment choices influence one another in a dynamic manner.

The identification of this quantity allows us to identify the average treatment effects (ATE's) and the ATE's on transitions, as well as the optimal treatment regimes, namely, the regimes that maximize the (weighted) sum of the average potential outcomes, possibly less the cost of the treatments. The main contribution of this paper is to relax the sequential randomization assumption widely used in the biostatistics literature by introducing a flexible choice-theoretic framework for a sequence of endogenous treatments.

The dexterity of conventional myoelectric prostheses is limited in part by the small datasets used to train the control algorithms.

To address these challenges, we developed an inexpensive, easy-to-don sleeve that can record robust and repeatable surface electromyography from 32 embedded monopolar electrodes. Embedded grommets are used to consistently align the sleeve with natural skin markings (e.g., moles, freckles, scars). The sleeve can be manufactured in a few hours for less than $60.

We also highlight that consistent recordings, accumulated over time to establish a large dataset, significantly improve dexterity.
