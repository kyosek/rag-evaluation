This work describes how to perform automatic fiducials detection, towards development of an application for automatic electrodes placement (digitization), over a three-dimensional surface of a subject head, scanned with the Occipital Inc. structure sensor ST01. We offer a wide description of the proposed algorithm to explore the three-dimensional object to features detection, by means of: dimensional reduction with perspective projection from 3D to 2D, object detection with custom detectors, robotic control of mouse motion and clicks events and reprojection from 2D to 3D to get spatial coordinates. This is done taking into account the characteristics of the scanner information, the training process of detectors with Computer-Vision Toolbox resources of MATLAB R2018b, the integration of FieldTrip Toolbox and the main properties of several ways to represents pixels; putting together all those things to automatically find the fiducials landmarks to generate the subject's coordinate system.

Automated airway segmentation is a prerequisite for pre-operative diagnosis and intra-operative navigation for pulmonary intervention. Due to the small size and scattered spatial distribution of peripheral bronchi, this is hampered by severe class imbalance between foreground and background regions, which makes it challenging for CNN-based methods to parse distal small airways. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is arisen by gradient erosion and dilation of the neighborhood voxels. During back-propagation, if the ratio of the foreground gradient to background gradient is small while the class imbalance is local, the foreground gradients can be eroded by their neighborhoods. This process cumulatively increases the noise information included in the gradient flow from top layers to the bottom ones, limiting the learning of small structures in CNNs. To alleviate this problem, we use group supervision and the corresponding WingsNet to provide complementary gradient flows to enhance the training of shallow layers.

An adaptive variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE) approach is introduced that yields efficient representations of ground states for interacting Hamiltonians on near-term quantum computers.

The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance.

These properties were found to be consequences of the hierarchical organization assumed for the system, though their nature remained unexplained. In the present work we bring an unified entropical framework that provides a deeper understanding of those system features. By perfoming numerical simulations, the system track probabilistic dependence on the initial structures is quantified in terms of entropy. Several entropical regimes are unveiled.

We believe that such an abstract conceptualization can benefit various communities and applications such as natural language processing, information extraction, machine learning, and ontology engineering. In this paper, we present Comprehensive EVent Ontology (CEVO), built on Levin's conceptual hierarchy of English verbs that categorizes verbs with shared meaning, and syntactic behavior. We present the fundamental concepts and requirements for this ontology.
