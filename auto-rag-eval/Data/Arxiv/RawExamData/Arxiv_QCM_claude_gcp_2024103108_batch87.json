Firstly, it has been an issue that output synchronization among passivity-short systems requires global information for the design of controllers in the cases when initial conditions need to be taken into account, such as average consensus and distributed optimization. We show that a stable PFC can be designed to passivate a passivity-short system while its output asymptotically vanishes as its input tends to zero. As a result, output synchronization is achieved among these systems by fully distributed controls without altering the original consensus results. Secondly, it is generally required in the literature that the graph Laplacian be positive semidefinite, i.e., $L \\geq 0$ for undirected graphs or $L + L^T \\geq 0$ for balanced directed graphs, to achieve output synchronization over signed weighted graphs.

This scenario corresponds to the last part of the provided information, which states: \"Allowing for a (maximal) coupling to nucleons, the limit improves to the level of g_a\u03b3 \u2272 10^-19 GeV^-1 for m_a ~ 20 MeV, which represents the strongest constraint to date.\" Although the mass in the question (15 MeV) is not exactly 20 MeV, it is in the same order of magnitude and significantly heavier than the keV range mentioned earlier. Therefore, the most stringent upper bound applicable in this case is g_a\u03b3 \u2272 10^-19 GeV^-1, which corresponds to option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it applies to ALPs coupled only to photons with mass \u2272 10^-11 eV.\nOption B is incorrect as it applies to ALPs with both couplings but in a much lower mass range (\u2272 10^-11 eV).\nOption C is incorrect as it applies to ALPs with only photon coupling and mass around 5 keV, which is much lighter than the given 15 MeV."}, "43": {"documentation": {"title": "Polaronic transport and thermoelectricity in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ single\n  crystals", "source": "Yu Liu, Zhixiang Hu, Milinda Abeykoon, Eli Stavitski, Klaus\n  Attenkofer, Eric D.
