Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an infectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment. It can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic crisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a long-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic cost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to manage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for COVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The social distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently accessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community mobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven economic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the search of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control problem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach.

Strongly overlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price movements of the underlying financial assets.

While option A might seem correct due to the asymmetric distribution of CO and dust in NGC 2320, which could suggest external origin (e.g., from a merger or accretion event), the documentation provides a crucial piece of information that complicates this interpretation. Specifically, it states that \"the specific angular momentum distribution of molecular gas in NGC 2320 is consistent with that of the stars.\" This consistency in angular momentum distribution between gas and stars suggests that an internal origin of the gas (from stellar mass loss) cannot be ruled out, despite the asymmetric structure.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while NGC 2320 does have bright [O III] emission, the documentation explicitly states that the large radio/FIR flux ratio and the mismatch between the kinematics of CO and [O III] suggest that the ionized gas should not be attributed to star formation.\n\nOption D, while plausible, is not directly supported by the information given.

Further, the scalability is another crucial aspect. This paper focuses on synchronization for uncoordinated dense networks without any external timing reference. Two synchronization methods are proposed and compared: i) conventional synchronization that copes with the high density of nodes by frame collision-avoidance methods (e.g., CSMA/CA) to avoid the superimposition (or collision) of synchronization signals; and ii) distributed synchronization that exploits the frames' collision to drive the network to a global synchronization. The distributed synchronization algorithm allows the network to reach a timing synchronization status based on a common beacon with the same signature broadcasted by every device. The superimposition of beacons from all the other devices enables the network synchronization, rather than preventing it.

We supplement Hi-C data with data from AIA's 193 \\AA\\ passband to see the complete lifetime of the BDs that appeared before and/or lasted longer than Hi-C's 3-minute observation period. Most Hi-C BDs show clear lateral movement along penumbral striations, toward or away from the sunspot umbra. Single BDs often interact with other BDs, combining to fade away or brighten. The BDs that do not interact with other BDs tend to have smaller displacements. These BDs are about as numerous but move slower on average than Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) BDs, recently reported by \\cite{tian14}, and the sizes and lifetimes are on the higher end of the distribution of IRIS BDs. Using additional AIA passbands, we compare the lightcurves of the BDs to test whether the Hi-C BDs have transition region (TR) temperature like that of the IRIS BDs. The lightcurves of most Hi-C BDs peak together in different AIA channels indicating that their temperature is likely in the range of the cooler TR ($1-4\\times 10^5$ K)."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Hi-C observations of sunspot penumbral bright dots (BDs), here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An astrophysicist is analyzing data from both Hi-C and AIA instruments, focusing on bright dots (BDs) in a sunspot penumbra. They notice that some BDs are clearly visible in Hi-C images but barely detectable in AIA images. Additionally, the BDs show varying behaviors in their movement and interactions.

Complex dynamics: The documentation mentions that \"Single BDs often interact with other BDs, combining to fade away or brighten\" and \"BDs that do not interact with other BDs tend to have smaller displacements.\" This supports the idea of complex dynamics influenced by local structures.\n\n3. Multi-thermal structure: The lightcurve analysis across different AIA channels suggests that \"their temperature is likely in the range of the cooler TR (1-4\u00d710^5 K),\" indicating a multi-thermal nature rather than a single temperature plasma.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes magnetic reconnection events are only observable at Hi-C resolutions, which is not supported by the text. Option B is incorrect because it focuses solely on temporal resolution, which is not mentioned as a key factor in the documentation. Option C is incorrect because it suggests a much cooler temperature than what the documentation indicates and oversimplifies the thermal structure.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information about instrument capabilities, observed BD behaviors, and temperature analyses to form a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon."}, "47": {"documentation": {"title": "Reaction Mechanisms at MINER$\\nu$A", "source": "U.

This paper presents an adaptive haptic shared control framework wherein a driver and an automation system are physically connected through a motorized steering wheel.

To enable the automation system to smoothly exchange the control authority with the human partner, this paper introduces a novel self-regulating impedance controller for the automation system.

The terms of the cost function are assigned to minimize the performance error and reduce the disagreement between the human and automation system. To solve the optimal control problem, we employed a nonlinear model predictive approach and used the continuation generalized minimum residual method to solve the nonlinear cost function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation studies consider a scenario where the human and the automation system both detect an obstacle and negotiate on controlling the steering wheel so that the obstacle can be avoided safely.

Many neurons display bistability - coexistence of two firing modes such as bursting and tonic spiking or tonic spiking and silence. Bistability has been proposed to endow neurons with richer forms of information processing in general and to be involved in short-term memory in particular by allowing a brief signal to elicit long-lasting changes in firing. In this paper, we focus on bistability that allows for a choice between tonic spiking and depolarization block in a wide range of the depolarization levels. We consider the spike-producing currents in two neurons, models of which differ by the parameter values. Our dopaminergic neuron model displays bistability in a wide range of applied currents at the depolarization block. The Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon shows no bistability. We varied parameter values for the model to analyze transitions between the two parameter sets. We show that bistability primarily characterizes the inactivation of the Na+ current. Our study suggests a connection between the amount of the Na+ window current and the length of the bistability range. For the dopaminergic neuron we hypothesize that bistability can be linked to a prolonged action of antipsychotic drugs."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation about neuronal bistability:\n\nQuestion: A neuroscientist is studying the bistability of neurons at the depolarization block. They observe that a particular neuron can switch between tonic spiking and a silent state over a wide range of depolarization levels. Which of the following conclusions is most supported by the information provided in the documentation?\n\nA) The neuron likely has characteristics similar to the squid giant axon\nB) The neuron probably has a significant amount of Na+ window current\nC) The neuron's behavior is primarily determined by its K+ current dynamics\nD) The neuron is exhibiting a form of short-term memory unrelated to its Na+ current\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, B, is supported by the statement: \"Our study suggests a connection between the amount of the Na+ window current and the length of the bistability range.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon shows no bistability, contrary to the neuron in the question.\n\nOption C is a distractor based on the common misconception that K+ currents are the primary determinants of neuronal firing patterns. However, the documentation emphasizes the role of Na+ currents, particularly their inactivation, in bistability.\n\nOption D is partially true in that bistability has been proposed to be involved in short-term memory, but it's incorrect in suggesting that this is unrelated to the Na+ current. The documentation clearly links bistability to Na+ current characteristics.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a novel scenario, and draw appropriate conclusions, targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "93": {"documentation": {"title": "Quenching of flames by fluid advection", "source": "Peter Constantin, Alexander Kiselev and Leonid Ryzhik", "docs_id": "nlin/0006024", "section": ["nlin.CD", "math.AP", "physics.flu-dyn"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Quenching of flames by fluid advection. We consider a simple scalar reaction-advection-diffusion equation with ignition-type nonlinearity and discuss the following question: What kinds of velocity profiles are capable of quenching any given flame, provided the velocity's amplitude is adequately large? Even for shear flows, the answer turns out to be surprisingly subtle. If the velocity profile changes in space so that it is nowhere identically constant, (or if it is identically constant only in a region of small measure) then the flow can quench any initial data. But if the velocity profile is identically constant in a sizable region, then the ensuing flow is incapable of quenching large enough flames, no matter how much larger is the amplitude of this velocity. The constancy region must be wider across than a couple of laminar propagating front-widths.

With the precipitous decline in response rates, researchers and pollsters have been left with highly non-representative samples, relying on constructed weights to make these samples representative of the desired target population. Though practitioners employ valuable expert knowledge to choose what variables, $X$ must be adjusted for, they rarely defend particular functional forms relating these variables to the response process or the outcome. Unfortunately, commonly-used calibration weights -- which make the weighted mean $X$ in the sample equal that of the population -- only ensure correct adjustment when the portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear functions of $X$ are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency, we describe kernel balancing for population weighting (kpop). This approach replaces the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ with a kernel matrix, $\\mathbf{K}$ encoding high-order information about $\\mathbf{X}$. Weights are then found to make the weighted average row of $\\mathbf{K}$ among sampled units approximately equal that of the target population.

Here, we use a computational model to address the existence and sensitivity of dynamic sequestering and how it depends on the parameters governing the cytoskeletal network geometry, with a focus on filament lengths and polarization away or toward the periphery. Our model of intracellular transport solves for the time evolution of a probability distribution of cargo that is transported by passive diffusion in the bulk cytoplasm and driven by motors on explicitly rendered, polar cytoskeletal filaments with random orientations. We show that depending on the lengths and polarizations of filaments in the network, dynamic sequestering regions can form in different regions of the cell.
