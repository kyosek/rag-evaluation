This paper investigates the decoding process of asynchronous convolutional-coded physical-layer network coding (PNC) systems. Specifically, we put forth a layered decoding framework for convolutional-coded PNC consisting of three layers: symbol realignment layer, codeword realignment layer, and joint channel-decoding network coding (Jt-CNC) decoding layer. Our framework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony between the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient feature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral symbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and reduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset. Moreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is BER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC. Extending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding algorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms the previously proposed XOR-CD algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by 2dB for synchronous PNC. For phase-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC is 4dB better than the other two algorithms.

In contrast to previous works, we also consider positive feedback that leads to various novel effects. For instance, besides the known excitable and oscillatory regime, that are separated by a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation, positive feedback can lead to bistable dynamics and a change of the system's excitability. The feedback has also a strong effect on noise-induced phenomena like coherence resonance or anti-coherence resonance. Both positive and negative feedback can lead to more regular output for particular noise strengths. Finally, we investigate serial correlation in the sequence of interevent intervals that occur due to the additional slow dynamics.
