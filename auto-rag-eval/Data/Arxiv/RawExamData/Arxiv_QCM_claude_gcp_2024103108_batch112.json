We propose a stabilized Nitsche-based cut finite element formulation for the Oseen problem in which the boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the elements of an easy-to-generate background mesh. Our formulation is based on the continuous interior penalty (CIP) method of Burman et al. [1] which penalizes jumps of velocity and pressure gradients over inter-element faces to counteract instabilities arising for high local Reynolds numbers and the use of equal order interpolation spaces for the velocity and pressure. Since the mesh does not fit the boundary, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed weakly by a stabilized Nitsche-type approach. The addition of CIP-like ghost-penalties in the boundary zone allows to prove that our method is inf-sup stable and to derive optimal order a priori error estimates in an energy-type norm, irrespective of how the boundary cuts the underlying mesh. All applied stabilization techniques are developed with particular emphasis on low and high Reynolds numbers. Two- and three-dimensional numerical examples corroborate the theoretical findings.

For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums.

Standard model calibration routines rely on the repetitive evaluation of the map from model parameters to Black-Scholes implied volatility, rendering calibration of many (rough) stochastic volatility models prohibitively expensive since there the map can often only be approximated by costly Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (Bennedsen, Lunde, & Pakkanen, 2017; McCrickerd & Pakkanen, 2018; Bayer et al., 2016; Horvath, Jacquier, & Muguruza, 2017).

In this paper we study whether similar Q-value functions can be defined for decentralized POMDP models (Dec-POMDPs), and how policies can be extracted from such value functions.
