How can we protect the network infrastructure from malicious traffic, such as scanning, malicious code propagation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks?

Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in the expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem.

From nutrient uptake, to chemoreception, to synaptic transmission, many systems in cell biology depend on molecules diffusing and binding to membrane receptors. Mathematical analysis of such systems often neglects the fact that receptors process molecules at finite kinetic rates. A key example is the celebrated formula of Berg and Purcell for the rate that cell surface receptors capture extracellular molecules. Indeed, this influential result is only valid if receptors transport molecules through the cell wall at a rate much faster than molecules arrive at receptors. From a mathematical perspective, ignoring receptor kinetics is convenient because it makes the diffusing molecules independent. In contrast, including receptor kinetics introduces correlations between the diffusing molecules since, for example, bound receptors may be temporarily blocked from binding additional molecules. In this work, we present a modeling framework for coupling bulk diffusion to surface receptors with finite kinetic rates. The framework uses boundary homogenization to couple the diffusion equation to nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the boundary.

A plethora of computational models have been developed in recent decades to account for the morphogenesis of complex biological fluid networks, such as capillary beds. Contemporary adaptation models are based on optimization schemes where networks react and adapt toward given flow patterns. Doing so, a system reduces dissipation and network volume, thereby altering its final form. Yet, recent numeric studies on network morphogenesis, incorporating uptake of metabolites by the embedding tissue, have indicated the conventional approach to be insufficient. Here, we systematically study a hybrid-model which combines the network adaptation schemes intended to generate space-filling perfusion as well as optimal filtration of metabolites. As a result, we find hydrodynamic stimuli (wall-shear stress) and filtration based stimuli (uptake of metabolites) to be antagonistic as hydrodynamically optimized systems have suboptimal uptake qualities and vice versa. We show that a switch between different optimization regimes is typically accompanied with a complex transition between topologically redundant meshes and spanning trees.

Metallicity Gradient and\n  Age-Metallicity Relation. We present results from the largest CaII triplet line metallicity study of Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) field red giant stars to date, involving 3037 objects spread across approximately 37.5 sq. deg., centred on this galaxy. We find a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.99+/-0.01, with clear evidence for an abundance gradient of -0.075+/-0.011 dex / deg. over the inner 5 deg. We interpret the abundance gradient to be the result of an increasing fraction of young stars with decreasing galacto-centric radius, coupled with a uniform global age-metallicity relation. We also demonstrate that the age-metallicity relation for an intermediate age population located 10kpc in front of the NE of the Cloud is indistinguishable from that of the main body of the galaxy, supporting a prior conjecture that this is a stellar analogue of the Magellanic Bridge. The metal poor and metal rich quartiles of our RGB star sample (with complementary optical photometry from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey) are predominantly older and younger than approximately 6Gyr, respectively. Consequently, we draw a link between a kinematical signature, tentatively associated by us with a disk-like structure, and the upsurges in stellar genesis imprinted on the star formation history of the central regions of the SMC. We conclude that the increase in the star formation rate around 5-6Gyr ago was most likely triggered by an interaction between the SMC and LMC."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the metallicity study of Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) field red giant stars, which of the following statements best explains the observed abundance gradient in the SMC?\n\nA) The abundance gradient is caused by a uniform distribution of young stars across the galaxy, coupled with a varying age-metallicity relation.\n\nB) The abundance gradient results from an increasing fraction of young stars with increasing galacto-centric radius, combined with a uniform global age-metallicity relation.\n\nC) The abundance gradient is due to an increasing fraction of young stars with decreasing galacto-centric radius, coupled with a uniform global age-metallicity relation.\n\nD) The abundance gradient is primarily driven by variations in the age-metallicity relation across different regions of the SMC, independent of the distribution of young stars.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

In optical fiber communication, due to the random variation of the environment, the state of polarization (SOP) fluctuates randomly with time leading to distortion and performance degradation.

In this paper, for what we believe to be the first time, the capacity of the polarization drift channel under an average power constraint with imperfect channel knowledge is characterized. An achievable information rate (AIR) is derived when imperfect channel knowledge is available and is shown to be highly dependent on the channel estimation technique. It is also shown that a tighter lower bound can be achieved when a unitary estimation of the channel is available.

It is well known that skyrmions can be driven using spin-orbit torques due to the spin-Hall effect.

This additional interfacial spin torque is similar in form to the in-plane spin transfer torque, but is significantly enhanced in ultra-thin films and acts in the opposite direction to the electron flow. The combination of this diffusive spin torque and the spin-orbit torque results in skyrmion motion which helps to explain the observation of small skyrmion Hall angles even with moderate magnetisation damping values.

The deepening penetration of renewables in power systems has contributed to the increasing needs for generation scheduling flexibility. Specifically, for short-term operations, flexibility here indicates that sufficient ramp capacities should be reserved to respond to the expected changes in the load and intermittent generation, also covering a certain amount of their uncertainty. To address the growing requirements for flexible ramp capacity, markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in California ISO and Midcontinent ISO. Some-times, to guarantee sufficient ramp capacity, expensive fast start units have to be committed in real-time. Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable generation, the flexibility provided by the conventional units might not be enough.
