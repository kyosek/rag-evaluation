We propose Tuneful, an approach that efficiently tunes the configuration of in-memory cluster computing systems. Tuneful combines incremental Sensitivity Analysis and Bayesian optimization to identify near-optimal configurations from a high-dimensional search space, using a small number of executions. This setup allows the tuning to be done online, without any previous training. Our experimental results show that Tuneful reduces the search time for finding close-to-optimal configurations by 62\\% (at the median) when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Network intrusion attacks are a known threat. To detect such attacks, network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have been developed and deployed. These systems apply machine learning models to high-dimensional vectors of features extracted from network traffic to detect intrusions. Advances in NIDSs have made it challenging for attackers, who must execute attacks without being detected by these systems. Prior research on bypassing NIDSs has mainly focused on perturbing the features extracted from the attack traffic to fool the detection system, however, this may jeopardize the attack's functionality. In this work, we present TANTRA, a novel end-to-end Timing-based Adversarial Network Traffic Reshaping Attack that can bypass a variety of NIDSs. Our evasion attack utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network (DNN) which is trained to learn the time differences between the target network's benign packets.

The United Nations is the major organization producing and regularly updating probabilistic population projections for all countries.

Many investment models in discrete or continuous-time settings boil down to maximizing an objective of the quantile function of the decision variable. This quantile optimization problem is known as the quantile formulation of the original investment problem.

In this paper, we propose a change-of-variable and relaxation method to solve the quantile optimization problems without using the calculus of variations or making any monotonicity assumptions. The method is demonstrated through a portfolio choice problem under rank-dependent utility theory (RDUT). We show that this problem is equivalent to a classical Merton's portfolio choice problem under expected utility theory with the same utility function but a different pricing kernel explicitly determined by the given pricing kernel and probability weighting function. With this result, the feasibility, well-posedness, attainability and uniqueness issues for the portfolio choice problem under RDUT are solved. It is also shown that solving functional optimization problems may reduce to solving probabilistic optimization problems.
