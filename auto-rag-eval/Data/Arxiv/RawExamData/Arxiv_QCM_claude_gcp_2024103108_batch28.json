Many neurons display bistability - coexistence of two firing modes such as bursting and tonic spiking or tonic spiking and silence. Bistability has been proposed to endow neurons with richer forms of information processing in general and to be involved in short-term memory in particular by allowing a brief signal to elicit long-lasting changes in firing. In this paper, we focus on bistability that allows for a choice between tonic spiking and depolarization block in a wide range of the depolarization levels. We consider the spike-producing currents in two neurons, models of which differ by the parameter values. Our dopaminergic neuron model displays bistability in a wide range of applied currents at the depolarization block. The Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon shows no bistability. We varied parameter values for the model to analyze transitions between the two parameter sets. We show that bistability primarily characterizes the inactivation of the Na+ current.

Unfortunately, commonly-used calibration weights -- which make the weighted mean $X$ in the sample equal that of the population -- only ensure correct adjustment when the portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear functions of $X$ are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency, we describe kernel balancing for population weighting (kpop).

We present quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations (QMBE) for spatially inhomogeneous semiconductor laser devices. The QMBE are derived from fully quantum mechanical operator dynamics describing the interaction of the light field with the quantum states of the electrons and the holes near the band gap. By taking into account field-field correlations and field-dipole correlations, the QMBE include quantum noise effects which cause spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission. In particular, the source of spontaneous emission is obtained by factorizing the dipole-dipole correlations into a product of electron and hole densities. The QMBE are formulated for general devices, for edge emitting lasers and for vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, providing a starting point for the detailed analysis of spatial coherence in the near field and far field patterns of such laser diodes. Analytical expressions are given for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission described by the QMBE. These results are applied to the case of a broad area laser, for which the frequency and carrier density dependent spontaneous emission factor beta and the evolution of the far field pattern near threshold are derived."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the quantum Maxwell-Bloch equations (QMBE) for spatially inhomogeneous semiconductor lasers, how is the source of spontaneous emission obtained?\n\nA) By neglecting field-field correlations\nB) By factorizing the dipole-dipole correlations into a product of electron and hole densities\nC) By ignoring field-dipole correlations\nD) By assuming homogeneous electron distribution\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been shown to contribute to the amy-loid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains.

This answer accurately summarizes the protective effects of ADAM30 overexpression observed in the study.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it states the opposite of the findings. The research shows that ADAM30 overexpression decreases amyloid plaque load and improves long-term potentiation, not increases and impairs them.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect because it misrepresents the relationship between ADAM30 and A\u03b2 peptide levels.

In this method, the internal LM score is subtracted from the score obtained by interpolating the E2E score with the external LM score, during inference. To improve the ILME-based inference, we propose an internal LM training (ILMT) method to minimize an additional internal LM loss by updating only the E2E model components that affect the internal LM estimation.

A major requirement for credit scoring models is to provide a maximally accurate risk prediction. Additionally, regulators demand these models to be transparent and auditable. Thus, in credit scoring, very simple predictive models such as logistic regression or decision trees are still widely used and the superior predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms cannot be fully leveraged. Significant potential is therefore missed, leading to higher reserves or more credit defaults.
