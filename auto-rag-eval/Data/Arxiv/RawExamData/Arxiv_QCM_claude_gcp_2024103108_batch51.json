The key ideas behind RMC are as follows. First, under any reasonable policy, the reward process is ergodic. So, by renewal theory, the performance of a policy is equal to the ratio of expected discounted reward to the expected discounted time over a regenerative cycle. Second, by carefully examining the expression for performance gradient, we propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that only requires estimates of the expected discounted reward and discounted time over a regenerative cycle and their gradients. We propose two unbiased estimators for evaluating performance gradients---a likelihood ratio based estimator and a simultaneous perturbation based estimator---and show that for both estimators, RMC converges to a locally optimal policy. We generalize the RMC algorithm to post-decision state models and also present a variant that converges faster to an approximately optimal policy.

Algorithms like k-means and fuzzy c-means has long been used in this task. Computational Intelligence has proven to be an important field to assist in building classifiers optimized according to the quality of the grouping of classes and the evaluation of the quality of vector quantization. Several studies have shown that Philosophy, especially the Dialectical Method, has served as an important inspiration for the construction of new computational methods. This paper presents an evaluation of four methods based on the Dialectics: the Objective Dialectical Classifier and the Dialectical Optimization Method adapted to build a version of k-means with optimal quality indices; each of them is presented in two versions: a canonical version and another version obtained by applying the Principle of Maximum Entropy. These methods were compared to k-means, fuzzy c-means and Kohonen's self-organizing maps. The results showed that the methods based on Dialectics are robust to noise, and quantization can achieve results as good as those obtained with the Kohonen map, considered an optimal quantizer."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the Dialectical Method and unsupervised classification of multispectral images, as presented in the research?\n\nA) The Dialectical Method is primarily used to improve the performance of traditional algorithms like k-means and fuzzy c-means.\n\nB) Methods based on the Dialectical Method have shown to be less effective than Kohonen's self-organizing maps in image quantization.\n\nC) The Dialectical Method has inspired new computational methods that can achieve optimal quantization results comparable to Kohonen's self-organizing maps.\n\nD) The Principle of Maximum Entropy, when applied to Dialectical methods, always results in inferior classification performance compared to canonical versions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Relevance vector machine (RVM) can be seen as a probabilistic version of support vector machines which is able to produce sparse solutions by linearly weighting a small number of basis functions instead using all of them.

As a solution, we propose a new combination of RVM and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule which resolves this issue with regionally dealing with every test instance. In our settings, we obtain the relevance vectors for each test instance in the local area given by k-NN rule. In this way, relevance vectors are closer and more relevant to the test instance which results in a more accurate model. This can be seen as a piece-wise learner which locally classifies test instances. The model is hence called localized relevance vector machine (LRVM).
