Polarization based sensing with tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensors is analysed theoretically by two alternative approaches. The first method is based on tracking the grating transmission for two orthogonal states of linear polarized light that are extracted from the measured Jones matrix or Stokes vectors of the TFBG transmission spectra. The second method is based on the measurements along the system principle axes and polarization dependent loss (PDL) parameter, also calculated from measured data. It is shown that the frequent crossing of the Jones matrix eigenvalues as a function of wavelength leads to a non-physical interchange of the calculated principal axes; a method to remove this unwanted mathematical artefact and to restore the order of the system eigenvalues and the corresponding principal axes is provided. A comparison of the two approaches reveals that the PDL method provides a smaller standard deviation and therefore lower limit of detection in refractometric sensing. Furthermore, the polarization analysis of the measured spectra allows for the identification of the principal states of polarization of the sensor system and consequentially for the calculation of the transmission spectrum for any incident polarization state.

Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs.

This work applies Matrix Completion (MC) -- a class of machine-learning methods commonly used in the context of recommendation systems -- to analyse economic complexity. MC is applied to reconstruct the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix, whose elements express the relative advantage of countries in given classes of products, as evidenced by yearly trade flows. A high-accuracy binary classifier is derived from the application of MC, with the aim of discriminating between elements of the RCA matrix that are, respectively, higher or lower than one. We introduce a novel Matrix cOmpletion iNdex of Economic complexitY (MONEY) based on MC, which is related to the predictability of countries' RCA (the lower the predictability, the higher the complexity). Differently from previously-developed indices of economic complexity, the MONEY index takes into account the various singular vectors of the matrix reconstructed by MC, whereas other indices are based only on one/two eigenvectors of a suitable symmetric matrix, derived from the RCA matrix. Finally, MC is compared with a state-of-the-art economic complexity index (GENEPY). We show that the false positive rate per country of a binary classifier constructed starting from the average entry-wise output of MC can be used as a proxy of GENEPY."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the Matrix Completion of World Trade paper, what is the primary advantage of using the MONEY index over previously-developed indices of economic complexity, such as GENEPY?\n\n**A)** MONEY index only considers the top eigenvectors of the RCA matrix, while GENEPY considers all eigenvectors.\n\n**B)** MONEY index takes into account the various singular vectors of the matrix reconstructed by MC, whereas GENEPY only considers the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix derived from the RCA matrix.\n\n**C)** MONEY index is more computationally efficient than GENEPY, requiring less computational resources to calculate.\n\n**D)** MONEY index is more interpretable than GENEPY, providing a clearer understanding of the underlying economic relationships.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) MONEY index takes into account the various singular vectors of the matrix reconstructed by MC, whereas GENEPY only considers the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix derived from the RCA matrix.\n\n**Explanation:** The MONEY index is a novel approach that builds upon the Matrix Completion (MC) method, which is used to reconstruct the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix. Unlike previous indices of economic complexity, such as GENEPY, the MONEY index considers all singular vectors of the reconstructed matrix, not just the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. This allows the MONEY index to capture a more comprehensive picture of economic complexity, making it a more robust and informative measure."}, "52": {"documentation": {"title": "Scalable Bayesian estimation in the multinomial probit model", "source": "Ruben Loaiza-Maya and Didier Nibbering", "docs_id": "2007.13247", "section": ["econ.EM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Scalable Bayesian estimation in the multinomial probit model.
