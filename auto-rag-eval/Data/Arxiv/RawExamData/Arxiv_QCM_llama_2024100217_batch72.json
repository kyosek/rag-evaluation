With the improvements of Los Angeles in many aspects, people in mounting numbers tend to live or travel to the city. The primary objective of this paper is to apply a set of methods for the time series analysis of traffic accidents in Los Angeles in the past few years. The number of traffic accidents, collected from 2010 to 2019 monthly reveals that the traffic accident happens seasonally and increasing with fluctuation. This paper utilizes the ensemble methods to combine several different methods to model the data from various perspectives, which can lead to better forecasting accuracy.

Financial time series typically exhibit strong fluctuations that cannot be described by a Gaussian distribution. In recent empirical studies of stock market indices it was examined whether the distribution P(r) of returns r(tau) after some time tau can be described by a (truncated) Levy-stable distribution L_{alpha}(r) with some index 0 < alpha <= 2. While the Levy distribution cannot be expressed in a closed form, one can identify its parameters by testing the dependence of the central peak height on tau as well as the power-law decay of the tails. In an earlier study [Mantegna and Stanley, Nature 376, 46 (1995)] it was found that the behavior of the central peak of P(r) for the Standard & Poor 500 index is consistent with the Levy distribution with alpha=1.4.

In this study, we used data Shapley, a data valuation metric, to quantify the value of training data to the performance of a pneumonia detection algorithm in a large chest X-ray dataset. We characterized the effectiveness of data Shapley in identifying low quality versus valuable data for pneumonia detection. We found that removing training data with high Shapley values decreased the pneumonia detection performance, whereas removing data with low Shapley values improved the model performance. Furthermore, there were more mislabeled examples in low Shapley value data and more true pneumonia cases in high Shapley value data. Our results suggest that low Shapley value indicates mislabeled or poor quality images, whereas high Shapley value indicates data that are valuable for pneumonia detection.

In characteristic not two, L/L^k is known to be metabelian, and hence uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its dimension k, which ranges in an explicitly known set of possible values. The quotient L/L^k need not be metabelian in characteristic two. We describe here all the possibilities for L/L^k up to isomorphism. In particular, we prove that k+1 equals a power of two."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider a thin Lie algebra L, graded over the positive integers, with all homogeneous components of dimension at most two.

In DCE-MRI a bolus of gadolinium based contrast agent is injected into the blood stream and spatiotemporal changes induced by the contrast agent flow are estimated from a time series of MRI data. Sufficient time resolution can often only be obtained by using an imaging protocol which produces undersampled data for each image in the time series. This has led to the popularity of compressed sensing based image reconstruction approaches, where all the images in the time series are reconstructed simultaneously, and temporal coupling between the images is introduced into the problem by a sparsity promoting regularization functional. We propose the use of Huber penalty for temporal regularization in DCE-MRI, and compare it to total variation, total generalized variation and smoothness based temporal regularization models. We also study the effect of spatial regularization to the reconstruction and compare the reconstruction accuracy with different temporal resolutions due to varying undersampling. The approaches are tested using simulated and experimental radial golden angle DCE-MRI data from a rat brain specimen.
