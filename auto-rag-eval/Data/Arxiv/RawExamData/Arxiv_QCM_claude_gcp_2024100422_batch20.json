It is not uncommon for certain social networks to divide into two opposing camps in response to stress. This happens, for example, in networks of political parties during winner-takes-all elections, in networks of companies competing to establish technical standards, and in networks of nations faced with mounting threats of war. A simple model for these two-sided separations is the dynamical system dX/dt = X^2 where X is a matrix of the friendliness or unfriendliness between pairs of nodes in the network. Previous simulations suggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: either all relationships become friendly, or two hostile factions emerge. Here we prove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possible outcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membership as a function of the initial conditions, and implies that the initial amount of friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions) determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the continuous-time model of structural balance described by dX/dt = X^2, where X represents the friendliness or unfriendliness between pairs of nodes in a network, what factor primarily determines the long-term outcome for large social networks with random initial conditions?\n\nA) The initial distribution of positive and negative relationships\nB) The size of the network\nC) The rate of change in relationships over time\nD) The initial amount of friendliness in the network\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key findings from the analysis of the continuous-time model of structural balance. The correct answer is D because the documentation explicitly states that \"the initial amount of friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions) determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the distribution of relationships is related to the amount of friendliness, it's not specifically mentioned as the determining factor.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the size of the network is not indicated as a primary factor in determining the outcome, although the model applies to \"large social networks.\"\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the rate of change is not mentioned as a determining factor in the long-term outcome.

We investigated progestin and corticosteroid activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) from elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii), a cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates. Comparison with human PR experiments provides insights into the evolution of steroid activation of human PR.

The only difference is in their response to RU486, which is determined by a single amino acid substitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the key points from the text. The passage states that at 1 nM steroid concentration, elephant shark PR is activated by a wider range of steroids compared to human PR, which is only activated by progesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. This indicates increased specificity in human PR for progestins and corticosteroids during evolution.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that RU486, an important clinical antagonist of human PR, did not inhibit progesterone activation of elephant shark PR. This difference in RU486 sensitivity is attributed to a key amino acid difference: Cys-528 in elephant shark PR corresponds to Gly-722 in human PR, which is essential for RU486 inhibition of human PR.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it wrongly states that RU486 inhibits both PRs equally.

Modelling the near-wall region of wall-bounded turbulent flows is a widespread practice to reduce the computational cost of large-eddy simulations (LESs) at high Reynolds number.

Simplified considerations for\n  diagnosing radial and azimuthal flow. This paper presents first results on the line profile shapes from a circumstellar envelope in bulk motion as modified by a microlensing event. Only geometrically and optically thin spherical shells in uniform expansion or rotation are considered here so as to emphasise the information content available in the profile shapes. In particular it is demonstrated that for the case of expansion, the line emission can increase by significant factors and the time variation of the profile shape is symmetric about line centre. For uniform rotation the line emission also increases significantly, but the time evolution of the profile shape is distinctly asymmetric. Thus, microlensing is seen to yield information about the velocity field in the extended envelope. We elaborate on (a) the observational advantages of tailoring microlensing programs toward detecting extended circumstellar envelopes, (b) the use of multiline observations to infer other properties of the envelopes, such as the ionization stratification, (c) the use of the continuum excess emission at infrared wavelengths as a means of probing the envelope structure, and (d) the use of polarisation for constraining the properties of ``clumpy'' winds."}, "answer": "Question: A microlensing event occurs for a star with a circumstellar envelope in uniform expansion.

Additionally, the time variation of the profile shape is symmetric about line center.
