There is growing interest in the role of sentiment in economic decision-making. However, most research on the subject has focused on positive and negative valence. Conviction Narrative Theory (CNT) places Approach and Avoidance sentiment (that which drives action) at the heart of real-world decision-making, and argues that it better captures emotion in financial markets. This research, bringing together psychology and machine learning, introduces new techniques to differentiate Approach and Avoidance from positive and negative sentiment on a fundamental level of meaning. It does this by comparing word-lists, previously constructed to capture these concepts in text data, across a large range of semantic features. The results demonstrate that Avoidance in particular is well defined as a separate type of emotion, which is evaluative/cognitive and action-orientated in nature.

Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyze the relation between these types of cash balances and risk. This article presents the discussion about relations between firm net working investment policy and as result operating cash balances and firm value. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary cash balances and speculative cash balances. Application of these propositions should help managers to make better decisions to maximize the value of a firm."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between cash balance management and corporate value creation, according to the article?\n\nA) Cash balance management should primarily focus on book profit maximization to increase firm value.\n\nB) Precautionary and speculative cash balances are equally important for maximizing firm value in all market conditions.\n\nC) The optimal level of operating cash investments should be determined by balancing risk management with value creation opportunities.\n\nD) Transactional cash balances are the most critical component in a firm's value creation strategy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The article emphasizes that the basic financial purpose of a corporation is the creation of its value, and liquidity management should contribute to this aim. It critiques models that focus solely on book profit maximization, suggesting they may not fully align with the goal of enterprise value maximization. The text discusses various types of cash balances, including precautionary (for hedging against negative risks) and speculative (for capitalizing on positive opportunities). The correct answer, C, best captures the article's central theme of balancing risk management (through precautionary cash) with value creation opportunities (through speculative cash), all while considering the firm's operating needs and value creation strategy.

Variable selection in cluster analysis is important yet challenging.

However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are often greedy because they need multiple calls of EM algorithms.
