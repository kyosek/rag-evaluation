The equilibrium composition of neutron star matter is achieved through weak interactions (direct and inverse beta decays), which proceed on relatively long time scales. If the density of a matter element is perturbed, it will relax to the new chemical equilibrium through non-equilibrium reactions, which produce entropy that is partly released through neutrino emission, while a similar fraction heats the matter and is eventually radiated as thermal photons. We examined two possible mechanisms causing such density perturbations: 1) the reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down (particularly in millisecond pulsars), leading to \"rotochemical heating\", and 2) a hypothetical time-variation of the gravitational constant, as predicted by some theories of gravity and current cosmological models, leading to \"gravitochemical heating\". If only slow weak interactions are allowed in the neutron star (modified Urca reactions, with or without Cooper pairing), rotochemical heating can account for the observed ultraviolet emission from the closest millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, which also provides a constraint on |dG/dt| of the same order as the best available in the literature."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism by which neutron stars can heat up and emit thermal radiation, and how does it relate to the observed ultraviolet emission from millisecond pulsars?\n\nA) Gravitational waves cause a perturbation in the neutron star's density, leading to a relaxation of chemical equilibrium and the production of entropy through neutrino emission.\n\nB) The reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down leads to a change in the neutron star's composition, resulting in the production of entropy and thermal radiation through non-equilibrium reactions.\n\nC) The hypothetical time-variation of the gravitational constant causes a perturbation in the neutron star's density, leading to a relaxation of chemical equilibrium and the production of entropy through neutrino emission.\n\nD) The modification of the Urca reaction process leads to a change in the neutron star's composition, resulting in the production of entropy and thermal radiation through non-equilibrium reactions.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down leads to a change in the neutron star's composition, resulting in the production of entropy and thermal radiation through non-equilibrium reactions.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the text states that \"rotochemical heating\" (the reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down) can account for the observed ultraviolet emission from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J0437-4715.

We establish the selection rules for the additional transitions and characterize the additional absorption peaks.

However, this approach neglects the changing subjective perception of risk, which is a key aspect of the scenario.\n\nB) The decision-maker would use the LT framework to weigh the potential returns against the subjective perception of risk, considering the changing perception over time. This approach would allow the decision-maker to adapt their decision-making to the changing circumstances.\n\nC) The decision-maker would rely on IT to evaluate the project's expected utility, taking into account the subjective perception of risk and potential returns. However, this approach may not fully capture the dynamic nature of the subjective perception, which could lead to suboptimal decisions.\n\nD) The decision-maker would choose the project with the highest expected return, but would also consider the subjective perception of risk and potential returns, using a hybrid approach that combines elements of PT and IT. However, this approach may be overly complex and difficult to implement.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The decision-maker would use the LT framework to weigh the potential returns against the subjective perception of risk, considering the changing perception over time. This approach would allow the decision-maker to adapt their decision-making to the changing circumstances.\n\n**Explanation:** The Ladder Theory (LT) is specifically designed to capture the dynamic nature of subjective perception in decision-making. By considering the changing perception of risk and potential returns over time, the LT framework provides a more nuanced and adaptive approach to decision-making. In contrast, Prospect Theory (PT) and Image Theory (IT) may not fully capture the dynamic nature of subjective perception, leading to suboptimal decisions in this scenario. The LT framework provides a more suitable approach for understanding decision-making under changing subjective perception."}, "43": {"documentation": {"title": "Assessment Voting in Large Electorates", "source": "Hans Gersbach, Akaki Mamageishvili, Oriol Tejada", "docs_id": "1712.05470", "section": ["econ.EM", "math.PR"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Assessment Voting in Large Electorates.

We suggest that SBF distance measurements can be improved by using a filter around 1 micron and calibrating I-band SBFs with the integrated V-K galaxy color.

The data favor specific choices of evolutionary tracks and spectra in the models among the several choices allowed by comparisons based on only integrated light. In addition, the tightness of the empirical I-band SBF calibration suggests that model uncertainties in post-main sequence lifetimes are less than +/-50% and that the IMF in ellipticals is not much steeper than that in the solar neighborhood.

We infer the presence of a turbulent accretion flow forming a small-scale accretion disk. We find a large-scale outflow and ionisation cone along the minor axis of the galaxy. Part of this outflow region is photoionised by the AGN, and shares properties with the ENLR of Seyfert galaxies, but the inner ($R \\lesssim 1.0$~arcsec) accretion disk and the region around the radio jet appear shock excited. The emission line properties can be modelled by a \"double shock\" model in which the accretion flow first passes through an accretion shock in the presence of a hard X-ray radiation, and the accretion disk is then processed through a cocoon shock driven by the overpressure of the radio jets. This model explains the observation of two distinct densities ($\\sim10^4$ and $\\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$), and provides a good fit to the observed emission line spectrum. We derive estimates for the velocities of the two shock components and their mixing fractions, the black hole mass, the accretion rate needed to sustain the LINER emission and derive an estimate for the jet power. Our emission line model is remarkably robust against variation of input parameters, and so offers a generic explanation for the excitation of LINER galaxies, including those of spiral type such as NGC 3031 (M81)."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism driving the excitation of the emission lines in the LINER galaxy NGC 1052, as inferred from the \"double shock\" model?\n\nA) The accretion flow is directly photoionised by the AGN, resulting in a single shock component.\nB) The accretion disk is processed through a cocoon shock driven by the overpressure of the radio jets, resulting in two distinct shock components.\nC) The emission lines are excited by the interaction between the accretion flow and the surrounding intergalactic medium.\nD) The LINER emission is powered by the accretion of material onto the black hole, with no shock component involved.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The accretion disk is processed through a cocoon shock driven by the overpressure of the radio jets, resulting in two distinct shock components.\n\n**Explanation:** The \"double shock\" model presented in the paper suggests that the accretion flow first passes through an accretion shock in the presence of hard X-ray radiation, and then the accretion disk is processed through a cocoon shock driven by the overpressure of the radio jets.

Modulational, Benjamin-Feir, instability is studied for the down-stream evolution of surface gravity waves. An explicit solution, the soliton on finite background, of the NLS equation in physical space is used to study various phenomena in detail. It is shown that for sufficiently long modulation lengths, at a unique position where the largest waves appear, phase singularities are present in the time signal. These singularities are related to wave dislocations and lead to a discrimination between successive `extreme' waves and much smaller intermittent waves. Energy flow in opposite directions through successive dislocations at which waves merge and split, causes the large amplitude difference. The envelope of the time signal at that point is shown to have a simple phase plane representation, and will be described by a symmetry breaking unfolding of the steady state solutions of NLS.

The QSO sight line lies at a position angle of 27 degrees from the minor axis of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy IC 691 (cz_gal = 1204+-3 km/s, L_B ~ 0.09 L*, current star formation rate = 0.08-0.24 solar masses per year) and 33 kpc (6.6 arcmin) from its nucleus.

The UV spectrum of SBS 1122+594 shows a metal-line (Ly-alpha + C IV) absorber near the redshift of IC 691 at cz_abs = 1110+-30 km/s. Since IC 691 is a dwarf starburst and the SBS 1122+594 sight line lies in the expected location for an outflowing wind, we propose that the best model for producing this metal-line absorber is a starburst wind from IC 691. We place consistent metallicity limits on IC 691 ([Z/Zsun] ~ -0.7) and the metal-line absorber ([Z/Zsun] < -0.3). We also find that the galaxy's escape velocity at the absorber location is v_esc = 80+-10 km/s and derive a wind velocity of v_w = 160+-50 km/s.
