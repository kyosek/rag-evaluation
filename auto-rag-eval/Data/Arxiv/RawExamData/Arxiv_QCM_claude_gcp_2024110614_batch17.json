In this paper we report on optical experiments of sub-scale starshades that advance critical starlight suppression technologies in preparation for the next generation of space telescopes. These experiments were conducted at the Princeton starshade testbed, an 80 m long enclosure testing 1/1000th scale starshades at a flight-like Fresnel number. We demonstrate 1e-10 contrast at the starshade's geometric inner working angle across 10% of the visible spectrum, with an average contrast at the inner working angle of 2.0e-10 and contrast floor of 2e-11. In addition to these high contrast demonstrations, we validate diffraction models to better than 35% accuracy through tests of intentionally flawed starshades. Overall, this suite of experiments reveals a deviation from scalar diffraction theory due to light propagating through narrow gaps between the starshade petals. We provide a model that accurately captures this effect at contrast levels below 1e-10. The results of these experiments demonstrate that there are no optical impediments to building a starshade that provides sufficient contrast to detect Earth-like exoplanets. This work also sets an upper limit on the effect of unknowns in the diffraction model used to predict starshade performance and set tolerances on the starshade manufacture."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about optical verification experiments of sub-scale starshades, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An aerospace engineer is analyzing the results of sub-scale starshade experiments conducted at the Princeton starshade testbed.

While most proposed models do content analysis of the information, no much work has been done by exploring the community structures that also play an important role in determining how people get exposed to it.
