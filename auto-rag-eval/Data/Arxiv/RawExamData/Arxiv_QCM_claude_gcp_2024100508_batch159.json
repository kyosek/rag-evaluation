To overcome this problem, existing works have devised statistical tests for model specification.

Extending the definition in conventional statistical tests, we define a correctly specified model as a model with zero conditional mean of the error term over any distribution of the explanatory variable.

So far, it has been analyzed with the hexagon approximation of the cluster variation method (CVM). However, the possible systematic error of the approximation was not fully estimated; in fact, it has been known that the transfer-matrix calculation is limited in the tractable strip widths L \\le 6. Aiming to surmount this limitation, we utilized the density-matrix renormalization group. Thereby, we succeeded in treating strip widths up to L=29 which admit reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. Our data indicate an onset of a discontinuous crumpling transition with the latent heat substantially larger than the CVM estimate.

Graphene exhibits extremely strong optical nonlinearity when a strong perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the response current shows strong field dependence even for moderate light intensity, and the perturbation theory fails. We nonperturbatively calculate full optical conductivities induced by a periodic field in an equation-of-motion framework based on the Floquet theorem, with the scattering described phenomenologically. The nonlinear response at high fields is understood in terms of the dressed electronic states, or Floquet states, which is further characterized by the optical conductivity for a weak probe light field. This approach is illustrated for a magnetic field at $5$ T and a driving field with photon energy $0.05$ eV.

At an intuitive level, it might seem natural that random mutations should tend to interact synergistically, such that the rate of mean fitness decline accelerates as the number of random mutations is increased.

We found a clear prevalence of antagonistic epistasis in RNA secondary structure folding.

High dynamic range (HDR) photography is becoming increasingly popular and available by DSLR and mobile-phone cameras.

In this paper we describe a new tone-mapping approach guided by the distinct goal of producing low dynamic range (LDR) renditions that best reproduce the visual characteristics of native LDR images. This goal enables the use of an unpaired adversarial training based on unrelated sets of HDR and LDR images, both of which are widely available and easy to acquire.

Agents trained by reinforcement learning (RL) often fail to generalize beyond the environment they were trained in, even when presented with new scenarios that seem similar to the training environment. We study the query complexity required to train RL agents that generalize to multiple environments. Intuitively, tractable generalization is only possible when the environments are similar or close in some sense. To capture this, we introduce Weak Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each individual environment can be efficiently solved to obtain an optimal linear policy, and when the agent possesses a generative model. Our lower bound applies to the more complex task of representation learning for the purpose of efficient generalization to multiple environments.
