Annotating microscopy images for nuclei segmentation is laborious and time-consuming. To leverage the few existing annotations, also across multiple modalities, we propose a novel microscopy-style augmentation technique based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Unlike other style transfer methods, it can not only deal with different cell assay types and lighting conditions, but also with different imaging modalities, such as bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. Using disentangled representations for content and style, we can preserve the structure of the original image while altering its style during augmentation. We evaluate our data augmentation on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset consisting of various cell assays, lighting conditions, and imaging modalities. With our style augmentation, the segmentation accuracy of the two top-ranked Mask R-CNN-based nuclei segmentation algorithms in the competition increases significantly.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing rapidly in recent years. With the appearance of 5G, it is expected to become even more indispensable to people's lives. In accordance with the increase of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks from IoT devices, DDoS defense has become a hot research topic. DDoS detection mechanisms executed on routers and SDN environments have been intensely studied. However, these methods have the disadvantage of requiring the cost and performance of the devices. In addition, there is no existing DDoS mitigation algorithm on the network edge that can be performed with the low-cost and low performance equipments. Therefore, this paper proposes a light-weight DDoS mitigation scheme at the network edge using limited resources of inexpensive devices such as home gateways. The goal of the proposed scheme is to simply detect and mitigate flooding attacks. It utilizes unused queue resources to detect malicious flows by random shuffling of queue allocation and discard the packets of the detected flows. The performance of the proposed scheme was confirmed via theoretical analysis and computer simulation. The simulation results match the theoretical results and the proposed algorithm can efficiently detect malicious flows using limited resources."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary motivation behind the proposed light-weight DDoS mitigation scheme at the network edge, and how does it address the limitations of existing DDoS detection mechanisms?\n\n**A)** The scheme is designed to improve the performance of routers and SDN environments, which are currently the primary targets of DDoS attacks.

We show that these quantities admit determinant representations with rows and columns labelled by the roots of the Q-functions of the corresponding separate states, as in the periodic case, although the form of the determinant are here slightly different. We also propose alternative types of determinant representations written directly in terms of the transfer matrix eigenvalues."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with antiperiodic boundary conditions, and let $\\{|\\psi_n\\rangle\\}$ be a set of eigenstates of the transfer matrix. Compute the form factor of the local spin operator $S_z$ between two eigenstates $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_m\\rangle$, and express it in terms of the Q-functions of the corresponding separate states.\n\nA) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_n} \\det Q_m$\nB) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_m} \\det Q_n$\nC) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_n} \\det Q_m$\nD) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_n + \\det Q_m}$\n\nCorrect Answer: A) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_n} \\det Q_m$\n\nExplanation: The form factor of the local spin operator $S_z$ between two eigenstates $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_m\\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of the Q-functions of the corresponding separate states. The correct answer is A) $\\langle \\psi_n | S_z | \\psi_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\det Q_n} \\det Q_m$, which is a determinant representation of the form factor. The other options are incorrect because they do not match the form of the determinant representation in the periodic case, and the correct expression involves the inverse of the determinant of the Q-function of the first state and the determinant of the Q-function of the second state."}}
