In this article, we propose a novel ECG classification framework for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using spectro-temporal representation (i.e., time varying spectrum) and deep convolutional networks. In the first step we use a Bayesian spectro-temporal representation based on the estimation of time-varying coefficients of Fourier series using Kalman filter and smoother. Next, we derive an alternative model based on a stochastic oscillator differential equation to accelerate the estimation of the spectro-temporal representation in lengthy signals. Finally, after comparative evaluations of different convolutional architectures, we propose an efficient deep convolutional neural network to classify the 2D spectro-temporal ECG data. The ECG spectro-temporal data are classified into four different classes: AF, non-AF normal rhythm (Normal), non-AF abnormal rhythm (Other), and noisy segments (Noisy). The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated and scored with the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2017 dataset.

Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit.

This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data.

This paper explores the genotype-phenotype relationship. It outlines conditions under which the dependence of quantitative trait on the genome might be predictable, based on measurement of a limited subset of genotypes. It uses the theory of real-valued Boolean functions in a systematic way to translate trait data into the Fourier domain. Important trait features, such as the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple Fourier interpretation. Roughness at a gene location corresponds to high sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces such sensitivity. Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated in identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait organizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data. As Fourier matrices are known to be maximally incoherent with the standard basis, this permits employing compressive sensing techniques to work from data sets that are relatively small -- sometimes even polynomial -- compared to the exponentially large sets of possible genomes.

As the document states, \"But as mismatch in time scale increases, the systems have to compromise to a state of no oscillations.\" This directly corresponds to option C, where the systems enter a state of quenched dynamics with no oscillations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because increased mismatch actually prevents frequency synchronization. Option B is only true for small mismatches, not when the mismatch increases significantly. Option D is opposite to what happens; the study indicates a change in amplitude, but not necessarily an increase, and ultimately leads to cessation of oscillations rather than increased amplitude.\n\nThis question requires careful reading and understanding of the complex dynamics described in the document, making it suitable for a challenging exam question."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Time delay effects in the control of synchronous electricity grids", "source": "Philipp C.

The expansion of inverter-connected generation facilities (i.e. wind and photovoltaics) and the removal of conventional power plants is necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Whereas conventional generation with large rotating generator masses provides stabilizing inertia, inverter-connected generation does not. Since the underlying power system and the control mechanisms that keep it close to a desired reference state, were not designed for such a low inertia system, this might make the system vulnerable to disturbances. In this paper, we will investigate whether the currently used control mechanisms are able to keep a low inertia system stable and how this is effected by the time delay between a frequency deviation and the onset of the control action. We integrate the control mechanisms used in continental Europe into a model of coupled oscillators which resembles the second order Kuramoto model. This model is then used to investigate how the interplay of changing inertia, network topology and delayed control effects the stability of the interconnected power system. To identify regions in parameter space that make stable grid operation possible, the linearized system is analyzed to create the system's stability chart.

In the edge computing paradigm, mobile devices offload the computational tasks to an edge server by routing the required data over the wireless network. The full potential of edge computing becomes realized only if a smart device selects the most appropriate server in terms of the latency and energy consumption, among many available ones. The server selection problem is challenging due to the randomness of the environment and lack of prior information about the environment. Therefore, a smart device, which sequentially chooses a server under uncertainty, aims to improve its decision based on the historical time and energy consumption. The problem becomes more complicated in a dynamic environment, where key variables might undergo abrupt changes. To deal with the aforementioned problem, we first analyze the required time and energy to data transmission and processing.
