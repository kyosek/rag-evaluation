Metabolites, small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions, provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually relies on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are found by combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. To obtain biochemically meaningful results requires an elaborate optimization function. We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a maximum a posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the superiority of the new scoring for two tasks: Both for the de novo identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for structurally similar compounds, our methods performs significantly better than the previous scoring, as well as other methods for this task.

To construct the likelihood model, we combined a mixture of a Markov-Gauss model and non-local means.

Power-law distributions in natural systems often indicate self-organizing criticality, a concept not explicitly mentioned in the text but relevant to solar physics.\n3.

The key to answering correctly lies in understanding the mismatching problem in predictor antenna systems and how it relates to real-world scenarios.\n\nThe correct answer is B because urban environments are more likely to cause greater spatial mismatch between the predictor antennas (PAs) and receive antennas (RAs).

The study concludes that \"retail investors act rational in this weakly regulated environment,\" which suggests that extensive new regulations (like options A, B, or C) might not be necessary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study is based on a context \"where personal interaction is absent,\" and the results suggest this absence doesn't impair rational decision-making.\n\nOption B contradicts the finding that investors are already pricing risk rationally, which doesn't support the need for strict interest rate limits.\n\nOption C, while potentially beneficial, doesn't directly address the main findings about economic status factors and loan-specific information being key to investor decisions.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple concepts from the study and applying them to a practical regulatory scenario."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Security Pricing with Information-Sensitive Discounting", "source": "Andrea Macrina and Priyanka A.

We introduce an interaction model that takes into account the chemical environment close to the diffusing atom to capture the effect of solute-host and solute-solute interactions on the diffusion barriers.

More precisely, we study how the capacity varies in terms of the OFDM block transmission time $T$, bandwidth $W$, amplitude $A$, and the noise spectral density $N_0$. We first find suitable discrete encoding spaces for both cases, and prove that they are convex sets that have a semi-definite programming (SDP) representation. Using tools from convex geometry, we find lower and upper bounds on the volume of these encoding sets, which we exploit to drive pretty sharp lower and upper bounds on the capacity.
