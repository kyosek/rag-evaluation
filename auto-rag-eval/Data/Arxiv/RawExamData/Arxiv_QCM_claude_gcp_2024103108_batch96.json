Domain mismatch often occurs in real applications and causes serious performance reduction on speaker verification systems. The common wisdom is to collect cross-domain data and train a multi-domain PLDA model, with the hope to learn a domain-independent speaker subspace. In this paper, we firstly present an empirical study to show that simply adding cross-domain data does not help performance in conditions with enrollment-test mismatch. Careful analysis shows that this striking result is caused by the incoherent statistics between the enrollment and test conditions. Based on this analysis, we present a decoupled scoring approach that can maximally squeeze the value of cross-domain labels and obtain optimal verification scores when the enrollment and test are mismatched.

The trapped mode (TE01 mode) is accessed by creating a round eccentric penetrating hole in each disk-shaped dielectric resonator. This structural modification is crucial for enabling the trapped mode excitation.

Our simulated galaxies reproduce the observed MZR in shape and normalization both at z=0 and z=2.

We find that the shape of the MZR is relatively constant with redshift, but that its normalization increases with time.
