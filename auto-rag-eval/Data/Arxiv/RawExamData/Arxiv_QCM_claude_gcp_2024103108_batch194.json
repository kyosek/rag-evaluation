In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied. We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models.

Although squaring integers is deterministic, squares modulo a prime, $p$, appear to be random. First, because they are all generated by the multiplicative linear congruential equation, $x_{i+1} = g^2 x_i \\mod p$, where $x_0 = 1$ and $g$ is any primitive root of $p$, a pseudorandom number heuristic suggests that they are, in fact, unpredictable.

Their small size and internal stability make them prospective objects for data storage but for this, the controlled switching between skyrmion states of opposite polarity and topological charge is essential. Here we present a study of magnetic skyrmion switching by an applied magnetic field pulse based on a discrete model of classical spins and atomistic spin dynamics. We found a finite range of coupling parameters corresponding to the coexistence of two degenerate isolated skyrmions characterized by mutually inverted spin structures with opposite polarity and topological charge. We demonstrate how for a wide range of material parameters a short inclined magnetic field pulse can initiate the reliable switching between these states at GHz rates.

The remarkable recent demonstrations in ultralow loss Inhibited-Coupling (IC) hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs) place them as serious candidates for the next-generation of long-haul fiber optics systems. A hindrance to this prospect, but also to short-haul applications such as micromachining, where stable and high-quality beam delivery is needed, is the challenge to design and fabricate an IC-guiding fiber that combines ultra-low loss, truly and robust single-modeness, and polarization-maintaining operation. Design solutions proposed up to now require a trade-off between low loss and truly single modeness.

This new concept of microstructured cladding allows to significantly reduce confinement loss and, at the same time, preserving a truly and robust single-mode operation. Experimental results show a HKT-IC-HCPCF with a minimum loss figure of 1.6 dB/km at 1050 nm and a higher-order modes extinction ratio as high as 47.0 dB for a 10 m long fiber.
