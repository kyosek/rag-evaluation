The liquidity risk factor of security market plays an important role in the formulation of trading strategies. A more liquid stock market means that the securities can be bought or sold more easily.

Virtual goals are randomly selected, irrespective of which are most instructive for the agent. In this paper, we present two improvements over the existing HER algorithm. First, we prioritize virtual goals from which the agent will learn more valuable information. We call this property the instructiveness of the virtual goal and define it by a heuristic measure, which expresses how well the agent will be able to generalize from that virtual goal to actual goals. Secondly, we reduce existing bias in HER by the removal of misleading samples. To test our algorithms, we built two challenging environments with sparse reward functions.

The study introduces a generalized maximum-entropy reconstruction method that \"preserves the production function of each firm in the data, i.e. the input and output flows of each node for each product type.\" This is a key advantage of the new method, as it allows for a more accurate representation of the inter-firm network structure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the method is not described as predicting economic crises, but rather as a tool for studying economic resilience.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the method still relies on some empirical data, even if it's not complete network data. It's a reconstruction method, not a replacement for all empirical data.\n\nOption D is actually described as a limitation of previous methods, not an advantage of the new one.

This paper shows how data science can contribute to improving empirical research in economics by leveraging on large datasets and extracting information otherwise unsuitable for a traditional econometric approach. As a test-bed for our framework, machine learning algorithms allow us to create a new holistic measure of innovation built on a 2012 Italian Law aimed at boosting new high-tech firms. We adopt this measure to analyse the impact of innovativeness on a large population of Italian firms which entered the market at the beginning of the 2008 global crisis. The methodological contribution is organised in different steps. First, we train seven supervised learning algorithms to recognise innovative firms on 2013 firmographics data and select a combination of those with best predicting power.

Such states exist with chemical potentials belonging to the semi-infinite gap in the band spectrum created by the periodically modulated SOC. All these states exist above a certain threshold value of the norm.
