In this paper, we present the results of the study on the development of social network analysis (SNA) discipline and its evolution over time, using the analysis of bibliographic networks. The dataset consists of articles from the Web of Science Clarivate Analytics database and those published in the main journals in the field (70,000+ publications), created by searching for the key word \"social network*.\" From the collected data, we constructed several networks (citation and two-mode, linking publications with authors, keywords and journals). Analyzing the obtained networks, we evaluated the trends in the field`s growth, noted the most cited works, created a list of authors and journals with the largest amount of works, and extracted the most often used keywords in the SNA field. Next, using the Search path count approach, we extracted the main path, key-route paths and link islands in the citation network. Based on the probabilistic flow node values, we identified the most important articles. Our results show that authors from the social sciences, who were most active through the whole history of the field development, experienced the \"invasion\" of physicists from 2000's. However, starting from the 2010's, a new very active group of animal social network analysis has emerged."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the findings of the bibliographic network analysis study on the evolution of social network analysis (SNA) as described in the text?\n\nA) The field of SNA has remained relatively stable, with social scientists consistently dominating the research landscape from its inception to the present day.\n\nB) Physicists began contributing significantly to SNA research in the 1980s, leading to a gradual decline in contributions from social scientists.\n\nC) The study revealed three distinct phases in SNA evolution: dominance by social scientists, followed by an influx of physicists in the 2000s, and then the emergence of animal social network analysis in the 2010s.\n\nD) The analysis showed that animal social network analysis has been a consistent and major subfield within SNA since its early development, with minimal influence from other disciplines.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately summarizes the key findings of the study regarding the evolution of the social network analysis field.

Biochemical oscillators also require a constant supply of free energy in order to break detailed balance and maintain their cyclic dynamics. For a given free energy budget, the recently discovered `thermodynamic uncertainty relation' yields the magnitude of period fluctuations in the most precise conceivable free-running clock. In this paper, we show that computational models of real biochemical clocks severely underperform this optimum, with fluctuations several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical minimum.

Low-rank matrix estimation plays a central role in various applications across science and engineering. Recently, nonconvex formulations based on matrix factorization are provably solved by simple gradient descent algorithms with strong computational and statistical guarantees. However, when the low-rank matrices are asymmetric, existing approaches rely on adding a regularization term to balance the scale of the two matrix factors which in practice can be removed safely without hurting the performance when initialized via the spectral method. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification to this for the matrix sensing problem, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix from a small number of linear measurements. As long as the measurement ensemble satisfies the restricted isometry property, gradient descent -- in conjunction with spectral initialization -- converges linearly without the need of explicitly promoting balancedness of the factors; in fact, the factors stay balanced automatically throughout the execution of the algorithm.

The documentation states that gradient descent, when used with spectral initialization, converges linearly for asymmetric low-rank matrix sensing problems without the need for explicit regularization to balance factors.
