The problems that are connected with Lagrangians which depend on higher order derivatives (namely additional degrees of freedom, unbound energy from below, etc.) are absent if effective Lagrangians are considered because the equations of motion may be used to eliminate all higher order time derivatives from the effective interaction term. The application of the equations of motion can be realized by performing field transformations that involve derivatives of the fields. Using the Hamiltonian formalism for higher order Lagrangians (Ostrogradsky formalism), Lagrangians that are related by such transformations are shown to be physically equivalent (at the classical and at the quantum level). The equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian path integral quantization (Matthews's theorem) is proven for effective higher order Lagrangians.

Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and lower-redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases, with large (>~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB detected by Swift and localized by the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec from our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments we suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc in projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset. Spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host show it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB 060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion since birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 Gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB progenitor is v_kick = 55 +- 15 km/s."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about GRB 060502B, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A team of astrophysicists is studying the implications of GRB 060502B's location relative to its putative host galaxy.

The correct answer (C) best synthesizes the observational data with current SHB theories:\n\n1. The documentation mentions a \"massive red galaxy\" as the putative host, suggesting an early-type galaxy with an old stellar population.\n2. The large offset of 73 \u00b1 19 kpc is noted as \"almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset,\" indicating a significant displacement from the host galaxy.\n3.

A minimum kick velocity of 55 \u00b1 15 km/s is calculated for the SHB progenitor.\n\nThese facts support a scenario where the SHB progenitor is a long-lived system (surviving ~1.3 Gyr since the starburst) that received a moderate kick velocity, allowing it to travel to its observed offset over this extended period. This aligns with theories that SHB progenitors might be compact object binaries, which have long merger timescales and can be displaced from their birth sites.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it acknowledges the large offset, it assumes an unrealistically high ejection velocity.

In everyday life, we often observe unusually frequent interactions among people before or during important events, e.g., we receive/send more greetings from/to our friends on Christmas Day, than usual. We also observe that some videos suddenly go viral through people's sharing in online social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a common structure? All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user activities in networks, which we call \"bursts\" in this work. We find that the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in networks. This finding motivates us to propose a new method to detect bursts in OSNs. We first introduce a new measure, \"triadic cardinality distribution\", corresponding to the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic cardinalities, within a network. We demonstrate that this distribution changes when a burst occurs, and is naturally immunized against spamming social-bot attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can reliably detect bursts in OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN users, we design an efficient sample-estimate solution to estimate the triadic cardinality distribution from sampled data. Extensive experiments conducted on real data demonstrate the usefulness of this triadic cardinality distribution and the effectiveness of our sample-estimate solution."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A social media platform is experiencing a sudden surge in user activity around a specific topic.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes the importance of flexible beam-user mapping, especially in highly asymmetric demand scenarios like hot-spots.

The correct answer, C, reflects the key finding of the mathematical approach described, which suggests that a group size of five people is optimal under certain conditions.\n\nThis optimal size likely results from the balance between two competing factors:\n\n1.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that when accounting for Boolean irreducibility, the phase transition curve shifts. Specifically, for pc = 1/2, the predicted value of Kc changes from 2 (as found by Derrida et al.) to approximately 2.62140224613. \n\nThis increase in Kc implies that the network requires a higher average connectivity to transition into the chaotic phase when Boolean irreducibility is considered.

This work explores a classical mechanical theory under two further assumptions: (a) there is a universal dry friction force (Aristotelian mechanics), and (b) the variation of the mass of a body due to wear is proportional to the work done by the friction force on the body (Reye's hypothesis). It is shown that mass depends on velocity as in Special Relativity, and that the velocity is constant for a particular characteristic value. In the limit of vanishing friction the theory satisfies a relativity principle as bodies do not decelerate and, therefore, the absolute frame becomes unobservable. However, the limit theory is not Newtonian mechanics, with its Galilei group symmetry, but rather Special Relativity. This result suggests to regard Special Relativity as the limit of a theory presenting universal friction and exchange of mass-energy with a reservoir (vacuum). Thus, quite surprisingly, Special Relativity follows from the absolute space (ether) concept and could have been discovered following studies of Aristotelian mechanics and friction.
