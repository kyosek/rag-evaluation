Ever since the disorder of proteins is the main cause for many diseases. As compared with other disorders, the major reason that causes disease is of structural inability of many proteins. The potentially imminent availability of recent datasets helps one to discover the protein disorders, however in majority of cases, the stability of proteins depend on the carbon content. Addressing this distinct feature, it is possible to hit upon the carbon distribution along the sequence and can easily recognize the stable nature of protein. There are certain reported mental disorders which fall in to this category.

According to the documentation, at the two-loop correction level, the degenerate vacuum energy density of the discrete confining vacua splits, and a potential is generated for the axion. This splitting causes discrete jumps in the energetically preferred confining vacuum when the relative positions of the S^2's are changed.

This significantly increases the lifetime of the corresponding non-supersymmetric vacua.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the vacuum energy density becomes discrete, not continuous. Option C is wrong because the effective potential is still computed by the planar limit of an auxiliary matrix model at leading order in 1/N.

In the context of network externalities, measuring the value of leading customers is chosen as the key to coping with the research problem by considering that leading customers take a critical stance in forming a referral network. Accordingly, two sequential-move game models (i.e., basic model and extended model) were established to measure the value of leading customers, and a skill of matrix transformation was adopted to solve the model by transforming a complicated multi-sequence game into a simple simultaneous-move game. Based on the defined value of leading customers, a network-based referral mechanism was proposed by exploring exactly how many awards are allocated along the customer sequence to encourage the leading customers' actions of successful recommendation and by demonstrating two general rules of awarding the referrals in our model setting.

The recent progress on capsule networks by Hinton et al. has generated considerable excitement in the machine learning community. The idea behind a capsule is inspired by a cortical minicolumn in the brain, whereby a vertically organised group of around 100 neurons receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computation unit of the cerebral cortex. However, Hinton's paper on \"Matrix Capsule with EM Routing'\" was unfortunately not accompanied by a release of source code, which left interested researchers attempting to implement the architecture and reproduce the benchmarks on their own.
