The relevance of chaos to evolution is discussed in the context of the origin and maintenance of diversity and complexity. Evolution to the edge of chaos is demonstrated in an imitation game.

The clustering is extended to nonlinear dynamics on hypercubic lattices, which enables us to construct a self-organizing genetic algorithm. A mechanism of maintenance of diversity, ``homeochaos\", is given in an ecological system with interaction among many species. Homeochaos provides a dynamic stability sustained by high-dimensional weak chaos. A novel mechanism of cell differentiation is presented, based on dynamic clustering.

This paper presents a theoretical model for GC formation motivated by observations of Milky Way star forming regions and simulations of star formation, where giant molecular clouds fragment into multiple clumps which undergo star formation at slightly different times. Core collapse supernovae from earlier-forming clumps can enrich later-forming clumps to the degree that the ejecta can be retained within the gravitational potential well, resulting in subpopulations with different total metallicities once the clumps merge to form the final cluster. The model matches the mass-metallicity relation seen in GC populations around massive elliptical galaxies, and predicts metallicity spreads within clusters in excellent agreement with those seen in Milky Way GCs, even for those whose internal abundance spreads are so large that their entire identity as a GC is in question.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a prominent way to measure the brain activity for studying epilepsy, thereby helping in predicting seizures. Seizure prediction is an active research area with many deep learning based approaches dominating the recent literature for solving this problem. But these models require a considerable number of patient-specific seizures to be recorded for extracting the preictal and interictal EEG data for training a classifier. The increase in sensitivity and specificity for seizure prediction using the machine learning models is noteworthy. However, the need for a significant number of patient-specific seizures and periodic retraining of the model because of non-stationary EEG creates difficulties for designing practical device for a patient. To mitigate this process, we propose a Siamese neural network based seizure prediction method that takes a wavelet transformed EEG tensor as an input with convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base network for detecting change-points in EEG. Compared to the solutions in the literature, which utilize days of EEG recordings, our method only needs one seizure for training which translates to less than ten minutes of preictal and interictal data while still getting comparable results to models which utilize multiple seizures for seizure prediction."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary limitation of traditional deep learning-based seizure prediction models, and how does the proposed Siamese neural network approach address this limitation?\n\n**A)** Traditional models require a large number of patient-specific seizures to train, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Adding a second noise with the opposite ITD (double-delayed noise) in most cases further reduces binaural unmasking. Thus far, modeling of these detection thresholds required both a mechanism for internal ITD compensation and an increased binaural bandwidth. An alternative explanation for the reduction is that unmasking is impaired by the lower interaural coherence in off-frequency regions caused by the second masker (Marquardt and McAlpine, 2009, JASA pp. EL177 - EL182).
