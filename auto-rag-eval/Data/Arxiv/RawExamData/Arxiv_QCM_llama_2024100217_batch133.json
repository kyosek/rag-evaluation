The conventional wisdom of mean-variance (MV) portfolio theory asserts that the nature of the relationship between risk and diversification is a decreasing asymptotic function, with the asymptote approximating the level of portfolio systematic risk or undiversifiable risk. This literature assumes that investors hold an equally-weighted or a MV portfolio and quantify portfolio diversification using portfolio size. However, the equally-weighted portfolio and portfolio size are MV optimal if and only if asset returns distribution is exchangeable or investors have no useful information about asset expected return and risk. Moreover, the whole of literature, absolutely all of it, focuses only on risky assets, ignoring the role of the risk free asset in the efficient diversification. Therefore, it becomes interesting and important to answer this question: how valid is this conventional wisdom when investors have full information about asset expected return and risk and asset returns distribution is not exchangeable in both the case where the risk free rate is available or not?

An essential problem in domain adaptation is to understand and make use of distribution changes across domains. For this purpose, we first propose a flexible Generative Domain Adaptation Network (G-DAN) with specific latent variables to capture changes in the generating process of features across domains. By explicitly modeling the changes, one can even generate data in new domains using the generating process with new values for the latent variables in G-DAN. In practice, the process to generate all features together may involve high-dimensional latent variables, requiring dealing with distributions in high dimensions and making it difficult to learn domain changes from few source domains. Interestingly, by further making use of the causal representation of joint distributions, we then decompose the joint distribution into separate modules, each of which involves different low-dimensional latent variables and can be learned separately, leading to a Causal G-DAN (CG-DAN). This improves both statistical and computational efficiency of the learning procedure. Finally, by matching the feature distribution in the target domain, we can recover the target-domain joint distribution and derive the learning machine for the target domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of both G-DAN and CG-DAN in domain generation and cross-domain prediction on both synthetic and real data experiments."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary advantage of decomposing the joint distribution into separate modules in the Causal Generative Domain Adaptation Network (CG-DAN), as opposed to the original Generative Domain Adaptation Network (G-DAN)?\n\n**A)** It allows for the generation of data in new domains using the same latent variables.\n**B)** It improves the statistical efficiency of the learning procedure by reducing the dimensionality of the latent variables.\n**C)** It enables the learning of domain changes from few source domains by leveraging the causal representation of joint distributions.\n**D)** It facilitates the recovery of the target-domain joint distribution by matching the feature distribution in the target domain.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) It enables the learning of domain changes from few source domains by leveraging the causal representation of joint distributions.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer, C, highlights the key benefit of decomposing the joint distribution into separate modules in CG-DAN.

In this work we continue our previous studies concerning the possibility of the existence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the interior of a static black hole, a possibility first advocated by Dvali and G\\'omez.

In a recent work (Chattopadhyay, A. K. et al, Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 91}, 58003, 2010) based on food consumption statistics, we showed how a stochastic agent based model could represent the time variation of the income distribution statistics in a developing economy, thereby defining an alternative \\enquote{poverty index} (PI) that largely agreed with poverty gap index data. This PI used two variables, the probability density function of the income statistics and a consumption deprivation (CD) function, representing the shortfall in the minimum consumption needed for survival. Since the time dependence of the CD function was introduced there through data extrapolation only and not through an endogenous time dependent series, this model left unexplained how the minimum consumption needed for survival varies with time. The present article overcomes these limitations and arrives at a new unified theoretical structure through time varying consumption and income distributions where trade is only allowed when the income exceeds consumption deprivation (CD). Our results reveal that such CD-dynamics reduces the threshold level of consumption of basic necessities, suggesting a possible dietary transition in terms of lower saturation level of food-grain consumption. The new poverty index conforms to recently observed trends more closely than conventional measures of poverty and allows probabilistic prediction of PI for future times."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The authors of the study \"Poverty Index With Time Varying Consumption and Income Distributions\" aimed to develop a new poverty index that takes into account the time variation of income and consumption distributions in a developing economy. According to the study, what is the key limitation of the original poverty index model, and how does the new model address this limitation?\n\n**A)** The original model did not account for the time dependence of the consumption deprivation function, whereas the new model introduces a time-varying consumption deprivation function through data extrapolation.\n\n**B)** The original model used a fixed consumption deprivation function, whereas the new model uses a time-varying consumption deprivation function that is endogenously determined.\n\n**C)** The original model did not consider the threshold level of consumption of basic necessities, whereas the new model introduces a threshold level of consumption that is reduced by the time-varying consumption deprivation function.\n\n**D)** The original model used a fixed probability density function of income statistics, whereas the new model uses a time-varying probability density function of income statistics.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) The original model did not consider the threshold level of consumption of basic necessities, whereas the new model introduces a threshold level of consumption that is reduced by the time-varying consumption deprivation function.\n\n**Explanation:** The original poverty index model used a consumption deprivation function to represent the shortfall in minimum consumption needed for survival, but this function was introduced through data extrapolation only and not through an endogenous time-dependent series. In contrast, the new model introduces a time-varying consumption deprivation function that is endogenously determined, which reduces the threshold level of consumption of basic necessities. This reduction in the threshold level of consumption is a key aspect of the new model, as it suggests a possible dietary transition in terms of lower saturation level of food-grain consumption."}, "37": {"documentation": {"title": "Modeling the flaring activity of the high z, hard X-ray selected blazar\n  IGR J22517+2217", "source": "G.

We present new Suzaku and Fermi data, and re-analyzed archival hard X-ray data from INTEGRAL and Swift-BAT survey, to investigate the physical properties of the luminous, high-redshift, hard X-ray selected blazar IGR J22517+2217, through the modelization of its broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) in two different activity states. Through the analysis of the new Suzaku data and the flux selected data from archival hard X-ray observations, we build the source SED in two different states, one for the newly discovered flare occurred in 2005 and one for the following quiescent period. Both SEDs are strongly dominated by the high energy hump peaked at 10^20 -10^22 Hz, that is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the low energy (synchrotron) one at 10^11 -10^14 Hz, and varies by a factor of 10 between the two states.

In ultrasound imaging, this burden is significant, especially when striving for low-cost systems, and has motivated the development of high-resolution and high-contrast adaptive beamforming methods.

One strategy for winning a coevolutionary struggle is to evolve rapidly. Most of the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and looks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative strategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid evolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we construct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process information, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing. In this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a way that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure of the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the adversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep fitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We suggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, we cite evidence that the immune control logic is phylogenetically conserved in mammalian lineages. Thus our model of defensive complexity suggests a new hypothesis for the lower rates of evolution for immune control logic compared to other immune structures."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of host-pathogen coevolution, what is the primary strategy employed by a controller to counter the rapid evolutionary change of an adversary, and how does this strategy relate to the phylogenetic conservation of immune control logic in mammalian lineages?\n\n**A)** The controller evolves rapidly to outcompete the adversary, leading to a coevolutionary arms race.\n**B)** The controller employs defensive complexity to deter the adversary's rapid evolutionary change, resulting in a slower pace of adaptation in the adversary population.\n**C)** The controller and adversary engage in a game of information processing, where the controller's ability to process information is the key to outcompeting the adversary.\n**D)** The controller and adversary coevolve in a neutral environment, with no selective pressure to adapt or evolve.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The controller employs defensive complexity to deter the adversary's rapid evolutionary change, resulting in a slower pace of adaptation in the adversary population.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the idea that the controller can deter the adversary's rapid evolutionary change by employing defensive complexity, which carves long, deep fitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. This is supported by the study mentioned in the documentation, which shows that complex processing logic can lead to a slower pace of adaptation in the adversary population. The phylogenetic conservation of immune control logic in mammalian lineages also suggests that this strategy may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their vertebrate hosts."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Phase liquid turbulence as novel quantum approach", "source": "Sergey Kamenshchikov", "docs_id": "1503.01359", "section": ["nlin.CD"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Phase liquid turbulence as novel quantum approach. In this paper we consider a nonlinear stochastic approach to the description of quantum systems.

Quantum peculiarities of considered systems have been strictly derived from markovian Fokker-Planck equation. It turned out that the positive zero point energy has volumetric properties and grows for higher time resolutions. We have shown that a quasi stable attractor may be applied as a satisfactory model of an elementary quantum system.

The stability of quasi-stable particles-attractors is also closely related to these transport properties, as they are able to preserve boundaries and exhibit fractal behavior.

A novel method for picosecond lifetime measurements of excited gamma-ray emitting nuclear states has been developed for fast beams from fragmentation reactions. A test measurement was carried out with a beam of 124Xe at an energy of ~55 MeV/u. The beam ions were Coulomb excited to the first 2+ state on a movable target. Excited nuclei emerged from the target and decayed in flight after a distance related to the lifetime. A stationary degrader positioned downstream with respect to the target was used to further reduce the velocity of the excited nuclei. As a consequence, the gamma-ray decays from the 2+ excited state that occurred before or after traversing the degrader were measured at a different Doppler shift. The gamma-ray spectra were analyzed from the forward ring of the Segmented Germanium Array; this ring positioned at 37 deg. simultaneously provides the largest sensitivity to changes in velocity and the best energy resolution. The ratio of intensities in the peaks at different Doppler shifts gives information about the lifetime if the velocity is measured. The results and range of the application of the method are discussed."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary advantage of using the stationary degrader positioned downstream with respect to the target in the Time of Flight Technique for Lifetime Measurements?\n\nA) To increase the energy of the excited nuclei\nB) To reduce the velocity of the excited nuclei and measure gamma-ray decays at different Doppler shifts\nC) To increase the sensitivity to changes in velocity\nD) To improve the energy resolution of the gamma-ray spectra\n\nCorrect Answer: B) To reduce the velocity of the excited nuclei and measure gamma-ray decays at different Doppler shifts\n\nExplanation: The stationary degrader is used to further reduce the velocity of the excited nuclei, allowing for the measurement of gamma-ray decays at different Doppler shifts.
