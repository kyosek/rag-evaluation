The RNN-Transducers and improved attention-based encoder-decoder models are widely applied to streaming speech recognition.

Inspired by the success of two-pass end-to-end models, we introduce a transformer decoder and the two-stage inference method into the streaming CTC model. During inference, the CTC decoder first generates many candidates in a streaming fashion. Then the transformer decoder selects the best candidate based on the corresponding acoustic encoded states.

We assume that a large enough number and enough diversity of candidates generated in the first stage can compensate the CTC model for the lack of language modeling ability.

The proposed model introduces a two-stage inference method for streaming speech recognition. In the first stage, a CTC decoder generates numerous candidates in a streaming fashion. Then, in the second stage, a transformer decoder selects the best candidate based on the corresponding acoustic encoded states. This approach combines the efficiency of CTC models with the language modeling capabilities of transformer decoders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the model uses a CTC decoder, not a transformer encoder, in the first stage.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the model doesn't use RNN-Transducers, but rather a combination of CTC and transformer components.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the model aims to address linguistic dependencies, it does not use an attention-based encoder-decoder model to do so.

Here we investigate the cosmological implications of CanDM and how it impacts CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum, by implementing the model within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver. We show that CanDM suppresses the small scale matter power spectrum in a way very similar to light Warm Dark Matter or Hot Dark Matter.

We put strong constraints on the interaction strength of CanDM as a function of its abundance for both constant and temperature-dependent thermally-averaged cross sections.

Indeed, it can accommodate values of $S_8$ of the order of 0.76 while being compatible with CMB+BAO data.

This is motivated by the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world sequential decision making problems, where protecting users' sensitive and private information is becoming paramount. We consider two variants of DP -- joint DP (JDP), where a centralized agent is responsible for protecting users' sensitive data and local DP (LDP), where information needs to be protected directly on the user side. We first propose two general frameworks -- one for policy optimization and another for value iteration -- for designing private, optimistic RL algorithms. We then instantiate these frameworks with suitable privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, and simultaneously obtain sublinear regret guarantees. The regret bounds show that under JDP, the cost of privacy is only a lower order additive term, while for a stronger privacy protection under LDP, the cost suffered is multiplicative.

Most past studies have either used simple analytic prescriptions or else full radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Here, we couple star formation histories and morphologies predicted by the semi-analytic galaxy formation model MORGANA with RT calculations from the spectrophotometric and dust code GRASIL to create a library of galaxy SEDs from the UV/optical through the far Infrared, and compare the predictions of the RT calculations with analytic prescriptions. We consider a low and high redshift sample, as well as an additional library constructed with empirical, non-cosmological star formation histories and simple (pure bulge or disc) morphologies. Based on these libraries, we derive fitting formulae for the effective dust optical depth as a function of galaxy physical properties such as metallicity, gas mass, and radius. We show that such fitting formulae can predict the V-band optical depth with a scatter smaller than 0.4 dex for both the low and high redshift samples, but that there is a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in the shapes of attenuation curves, probably due to geometrical variations, which our simple recipe does not capture well. However, our new recipe provides a better approximation to the GRASIL results at optical wavelength than standard analytic prescriptions from the literature, particularly at high redshift."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key findings and implications of the study comparing radiative transfer (RT) calculations with analytic prescriptions for dust attenuation in galaxy formation models?\n\nA) The study found that analytic prescriptions consistently outperform RT calculations in predicting dust attenuation across all wavelengths and redshifts.\n\nB) The research demonstrated that fitting formulae based on RT calculations can accurately predict V-band optical depth, but struggle to capture the variety in attenuation curve shapes due to geometrical variations.\n\nC) The study concluded that existing analytic prescriptions are sufficient for modeling dust attenuation in galaxies, especially at high redshifts.\n\nD) The research showed that RT calculations are unnecessary for accurate dust attenuation modeling, as simple analytic prescriptions provide equivalent results.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.
