Relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is a common tool to describe the space-time evolution of the strongly interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. For a proper comparison to experimental data, fluid-dynamical calculations have to be performed on an event-by-event basis. Therefore, fluid dynamics should be able to reproduce, not only the event-averaged momentum anisotropies, $<v_{n}>$, but also their distributions. In this paper, we investigate the event-by-event distributions of the initial-state and momentum anisotropies $\\epsilon_n$ and $v_n$, and their correlations.

These approaches can also be applied to various classes of machine learning models to reduce the prediction error of sales volume. In this study we construct two ensemble models for demand prediction with and without accounting for demand censorship. Accounting for sales censorship is based on the idea of censored quantile regression method where the model estimation is splitted on two separate parts: a) prediction of zero sales by classification model; and b) prediction of non-zero sales by regression model. Models with and without accounting for censorship are based on the predictions aggregations of Least squares, Ridge and Lasso regressions and Random Forest model.
