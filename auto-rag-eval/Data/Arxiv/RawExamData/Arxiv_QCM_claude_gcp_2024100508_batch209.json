The U-net is a deep-learning network model that has been used to solve a number of inverse problems. In this work, the concatenation of two-element U-nets, termed the W-net, operating in k-space (K) and image (I) domains, were evaluated for multi-channel magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction. The two element network combinations were evaluated for the four possible image-k-space domain configurations: a) W-net II, b) W-net KK, c) W-net IK, and d) W-net KI were evaluated.

One hundred and eleven volumetric, T1-weighted, 12-channel coil k-space datasets were used in the experiments. Normalized root mean squared error, peak signal to noise ratio, visual information fidelity and visual inspection were used to assess the reconstructed images against the fully sampled reference images. Our results indicated that networks that operate solely in the image domain are better suited when processing individual channels of multi-channel data independently.

This observation was performed with Suzaku in December 2009 and was targeted on IGRJ08408-4503, with a net exposure with the X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS, 0.4-10 keV) and the hard X-ray detector (HXD, 15-100 keV) of 67.4 ks and 64.7 ks, respectively, spanning about three days. The source was caught in a low intensity state characterized by an initially average X-ray luminosity level of 4E32 erg/s (0.5-10 keV) during the first 120 ks, followed by two long flares (about 45 ks each) peaking at a flux a factor of about 3 higher than the initial pre-flare emission.
