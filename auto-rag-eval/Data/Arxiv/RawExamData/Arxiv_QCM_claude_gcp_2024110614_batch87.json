THz band is envisioned to be used in 6G systems to meet the ever-increasing demand for data rate. However, before an eventual system design and deployment can proceed, detailed channel sounding measurements are required to understand key channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a first extensive set of channel measurements for urban outdoor environments that are ultra-wideband (1 GHz 3dB bandwidth), and double-directional where both the transmitter and receiver are at the same height. In all, we present measurements at 38 Tx/Rx location pairs, consisting of a total of nearly 50,000 impulse responses, at both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases in the 1-100 m range. We provide modeling for path loss, shadowing, delay spread, angular spread and multipath component (MPC) power distribution. We find, among other things, that outdoor communication over tens of meters is feasible in this frequency range even in NLoS scenarios, that omni-directional delay spreads of up to 100 ns, and directional delay spreads of up to 10 ns are observed, while angular spreads are also quite significant, and a surprisingly large number of MPCs are observed for 1 GHz bandwidth and 13 degree beamwidth.

The correct answer, C, reflects the multifaceted nature of stellification as described by both Roberts and Aveni.\n\nRoberts presents the sky as a mnemonic for remembering migrations and cultural heroes among the Tabwa people. Aveni expands on this, suggesting that sky stories have connections to celestial motions, serve as mnemonics for seasonal activities, and encode moral, ethical, and sociocultural codes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while these stories may be entertaining, the documentation emphasizes their deeper cultural significance beyond mere entertainment. Option B is too limited, focusing only on navigation, which is not mentioned as a primary function in the given text.

In principle, neural networks (NNs) could accomplish this task since they can model non-linear feature interactions very well.

As an extreme case of data with feature selection and feature interactions we study the XOR-like data with irrelevant variables.

Checkerboard patterns have been proposed in order to explain STM experiments on the cuprates BSCCO and Na-CCOC.

In particular, simple checkerboard patterns are inconsistent with neutron scattering data, in that they have low energy incommsensurate (IC) spin peaks rotated 45 degrees from the direction of the charge IC peaks. However, it is unclear whether other checkerboard patterns can solve the problem. In this paper, we have studied more complicated checkerboard patterns (\"modulated checkerboards\") by using spin wave theory and analyzed noncollinear checkerboards as well.

In this work we employ a pump-probe type SMS technique to observe the ultrafast energy relaxation in single light-harvesting complexes LH2 of purple bacteria.

The quality of robot vision greatly affects the performance of automation systems, where occlusions stand as one of the biggest challenges.

For example, when multiple robot arms cooperate in a single workplace, occlusions will be created under the robot arm itself and hide objects underneath. While occlusions can be greatly reduced by installing multiple sensors, the increase in sensor costs cannot be ignored. Moreover, the sensor placements must be rearranged every time the robot operation routine and layout change. To diminish occlusions, we propose the first robot vision system with tilt-type mirror reflection sensing. By instantly tilting the sensor itself, we obtain two sensing results with different views: conventional direct line-of-sight sensing and non-line-of-sight sensing via mirror reflections. Our proposed system removes occlusions adaptively by detecting the occlusions in the scene and dynamically configuring the sensor tilt angle to sense the detected occluded area. Thus, sensor rearrangements are not required even after changes in robot operation or layout.

Filtering out unrealistic images from trained generative adversarial networks (GANs) has attracted considerable attention recently. Two density ratio based subsampling methods---Discriminator Rejection Sampling (DRS) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN)---were recently proposed, and their effectiveness in improving GANs was demonstrated on multiple datasets. However, DRS and MH-GAN are based on discriminator based density ratio estimation (DRE) methods, so they may not work well if the discriminator in the trained GAN is far from optimal. Moreover, they do not apply to some GANs (e.g., MMD-GAN). In this paper, we propose a novel Softplus (SP) loss for DRE. Based on it, we develop a sample-based DRE method in a feature space learned by a specially designed and pre-trained ResNet-34 (DRE-F-SP). We derive the rate of convergence of a density ratio model trained under the SP loss.
