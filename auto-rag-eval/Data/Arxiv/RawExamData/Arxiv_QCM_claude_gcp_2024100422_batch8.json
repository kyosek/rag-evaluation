Exactly solvable models that exhibit quantum signatures of classical chaos are both rare as well as important - more so in view of the fact that the mechanisms for ergodic behavior and thermalization in isolated quantum systems and its connections to non-integrability are under active investigation. In this work, we study quantum systems of few qubits collectively modeled as a kicked top, a textbook example of quantum chaos. In particular, we show that the 3 and 4 qubit cases are exactly solvable and yet, interestingly, can display signatures of ergodicity and thermalization. Deriving analytical expressions for entanglement entropy and concurrence, we see agreement in certain parameter regimes between long-time average values and ensemble averages of random states with permutation symmetry. Comparing with results using the data of a recent transmons based experiment realizing the 3-qubit case, we find agreement for short times, including a peculiar step-like behaviour in correlations of some states.

Which of your team's possible lineups has the best chances against each of your opponents possible lineups? In order to answer this question we develop LinNet. LinNet exploits the dynamics of a directed network that captures the performance of lineups at their matchups. The nodes of this network represent the different lineups, while an edge from node j to node i exists if lineup i has outperformed lineup j. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute).

A popular choice for a loss is a pre-trained network, such as VGG, which is used as a feature extractor for computing the difference between restored and reference images.

Index insurance is a promising tool to reduce the risk faced by farmers, but high basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation between the index and individual farm yields, has limited its adoption to date. Basis risk arises from two fundamental sources: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design risk). Whereas previous work has focused almost exclusively on design risk, a theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of zonal risk is still lacking. Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, using the case of maize yields in Kenya. Our first contribution is to derive a formal decomposition of basis risk, providing a simple upper bound on the insurable basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone.

This result is a consequence of the relation $S_{1/2} \\propto |{\\bf q}|$, when $|{\\bf q}| \\to 0$, as suggested by the analysis of the transition form factors and by the orthogonality between the nucleon and $N(1535)$ states. We propose then new empirical parametrizations for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1535)$ helicity amplitudes, that are consistent with the data and the Siegert's theorem.

The problem of estimating subjective visual properties (SVP) of images (e.g., Shoes A is more comfortable than B) is gaining rising attention. Due to its highly subjective nature, different annotators often exhibit different interpretations of scales when adopting absolute value tests. Therefore, recent investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing platforms. However, crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes.

Such transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly categorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations, when discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of information theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous data without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters. Moreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall transformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping sophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated. In bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular non-parametric methods, showing the soundness of the approach. The paper also demonstrates its efficiency in multivariate problems, as well as provides an example analysis of a real-world data."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of the Kendall transformation for continuous data analysis?\n\nA) It converts continuous data into discrete categories, allowing for easier visualization of data distributions.\n\nB) It preserves the exact numerical values of the original data while reducing computational complexity.\n\nC) It maintains the ranking information of observations, enables categorical representation, and allows for the application of information theory methods without relying on differential entropy.\n\nD) It increases the sensitivity to complex interactions in the data, making it ideal for detecting subtle patterns in large datasets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the key benefits of the Kendall transformation as described in the given text. The Kendall transformation preserves the ranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form, which allows for the application of information theory methods to continuous data without relying on differential entropy or additional parameters. This transformation is particularly useful when dealing with a small number of observations where traditional discretization methods might be problematic.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the Kendall transformation does convert data into a categorical form, it's not primarily for visualization purposes and doesn't simply discretize the data into categories.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the Kendall transformation doesn't preserve exact numerical values. Instead, it focuses on preserving the ranking information.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Kendall transformation actually filters information to that contained in ranking, which can lead to better robustness by dropping sophisticated interactions that are unlikely to be correctly estimated in small datasets. It doesn't increase sensitivity to complex interactions."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Noise-Induced Synchronization, Desynchronization, and Clustering in\n  Globally Coupled Nonidentical Oscillators", "source": "Yi Ming Lai and Mason A.

The helium to proton ratio at ~100 TeV exceeds the Big Bang abundance Y=0.25 by several times, and the different spectrum is not reproduced within the diffusive shock acceleration theory.

The model suggests that cosmic rays are produced in chemically enriched regions such as superbubbles, where the helium abundance is higher than the Big Bang abundance. The outward-decreasing abundance of elements in these regions, combined with energy-dependent escape from supernova remnant shocks, naturally leads to a harder spectrum for helium compared to protons. This explanation accounts for both the helium spectrum hardening and the overall hardening of cosmic ray spectra at higher energies without introducing separate sources for different elements. Additionally, the model predicts that the decreasing Mach number in the hot superbubble environment contributes to the spectral hardening observed above 10^11 eV/n for all cosmic ray species."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "The Case for Formation of ISP-Content Providers Consortiums by Nash\n  Bargaining for Internet Content Delivery", "source": "Debasis Mitra, Abhinav Sridhar", "docs_id": "1810.10660", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "The Case for Formation of ISP-Content Providers Consortiums by Nash\n  Bargaining for Internet Content Delivery.
