Grundy functions have found many applications in a wide variety of games, in solving relevant problems in Game Theory. Many authors have been working on this topic for over many years. Since the existence of a Grundy function on a digraph implies that it must have a kernel, the problem of deciding if a digraph has a Grundy function is NP-complete, and how to calculate one is not clearly answered. In this paper, we introduce the concept: Semi-Grundy function, which arises naturally from the connection between kernel and semi-kernel and the connection between kernel and Grundy function. We explore the relationship of this concept with the Grundy function, proving that for digraphs with a defining hereditary property is sufficient to get a semi-grundy function to obtain a Grundy function.

This mechanism allows for the control of bubble stability, enabling the study of 2D flows in a controlled environment.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the authors explicitly state that they demonstrate how bubble stability can be dramatically tuned with the help of evaporation-driven flows, and that the spatial symmetry of thickness profiles evolves non-monotonically with the volatile species concentration. The authors also reveal that at 50% concentration, spatial symmetry breaks down and thickness fluctuations become chaotic everywhere in space, with the fluctuation statistics becoming spatially invariant and ergodic. This suggests that the volatile species concentration is the primary mechanism by which the authors demonstrate the tuning of bubble stability."}, "30": {"documentation": {"title": "Quantum Black Holes as Holograms in AdS Braneworlds", "source": "Roberto Emparan, Alessandro Fabbri, Nemanja Kaloper", "docs_id": "hep-th/0206155", "section": ["hep-th", "astro-ph", "gr-qc", "hep-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Quantum Black Holes as Holograms in AdS Braneworlds.
