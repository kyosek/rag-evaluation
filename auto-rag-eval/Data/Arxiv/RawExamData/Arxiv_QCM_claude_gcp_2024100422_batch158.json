Coronal magnetic fields are responsible for the onset of solar flares and solar eruptions. However, the type of magnetic field parameters that can be used to measure the critical condition for a solar eruption is still unclear. As an effort to understand the possible condition for a solar flare, we have examined the non-dimensional parameter $\\kappa$ introduced by Ishiguro & Kusano (2017), which contains information about magnetic twist distribution and magnetic flux in an active region (AR). We introduce a new parameter $\\kappa^\\ast$, as a proxy for $\\kappa$, and we have analyzed the evolution of $\\kappa^\\ast$ during the flaring period of an AR using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric vector magnetic field data. Using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have calculated $\\kappa^\\ast$ for the AR NOAA 11158 during its three-day flaring period. We found that $\\kappa^\\ast$ increased to a certain level before two large flares and decreased significantly after their onset. The results suggest that $\\kappa^\\ast$ may be used as an indicator of the necessary condition for the onset of a solar eruption in the AR.

Whenever customers' choices (e.g. to buy or not a given good) depend on others choices (cases coined 'positive externalities' or 'bandwagon effect' in the economic literature), the demand may be multiply valued: for a same posted price, there is either a small number of buyers, or a large one -- in which case one says that the customers coordinate. This leads to a dilemma for the seller: should he sell at a high price, targeting a small number of buyers, or at low price targeting a large number of buyers? In this paper we show that the interaction between demand and supply is even more complex than expected, leading to what we call the curse of coordination: the pricing strategy for the seller which aimed at maximizing his profit corresponds to posting a price which, not only assumes that the customers will coordinate, but also lies very near the critical price value at which such high demand no more exists.

According to the passage, the optimal pricing strategy for the seller to maximize profit involves posting a price that assumes customers will coordinate (i.e., a large number of buyers will purchase). However, this optimal price lies very close to the critical price value at which such high demand no longer exists.

The chiral polarization scale is described in the text as a non-zero physical scale in the spectrum of eigenvalues that separates two regimes:\n\n1. At smaller (fixed) eigenvalues, eigenmodes exhibit a convex X-distribution, indicating a positive correlation. This means the dynamics enhances chirality relative to statistical independence in this regime.\n\n2. At larger eigenvalues, the distribution is concave, indicating a negative correlation. Here, the dynamics suppresses chirality relative to statistical independence.\n\nThis scale provides an objective definition for \"low\" and \"high\" Dirac eigenmodes. The text also mentions that this scale separates a regime where dynamics enhances chirality from a regime where it suppresses it, relative to statistical independence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests uniform behavior across the spectrum, which contradicts the described separation of regimes.\nOption B is incorrect because it reverses the relationship between the X-distribution shape and the eigenvalue magnitude.\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests random behavior at the scale, which is not mentioned in the text and contradicts the described correlation patterns."}, "11": {"documentation": {"title": "SoK: Achieving State Machine Replication in Blockchains based on\n  Repeated Consensus", "source": "Silvia Bonomi and Antonella Del Pozzo and \\'Alvaro Garc\\'ia-P\\'erez\n  and Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni", "docs_id": "2105.13732", "section": ["cs.DC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "SoK: Achieving State Machine Replication in Blockchains based on\n  Repeated Consensus. This paper revisits the ubiquitous problem of achieving state machine replication in blockchains based on repeated consensus, like Tendermint.

A huge body of work has been carried out on the relation between state machine replication and consensus in the past years, in a variety of system models and with respect to varied problem specifications. We systematize this work by proposing novel and rigorous abstractions for state machine replication and repeated consensus in a system model that accounts for realistic blockchains in which blocks may contain several transactions issued by one or more users, and where validity and order of transactions within a block is determined by an external application-dependent function that can capture various approaches for order-fairness in the literature.
