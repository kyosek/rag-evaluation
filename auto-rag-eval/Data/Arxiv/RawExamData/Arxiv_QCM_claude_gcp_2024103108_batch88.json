In a laboratory experiment, round by round, individual interactions should lead to the social evolutionary rotation in population strategy state space. Successive switching the incentive parameter should lead to successive change of the rotation ---- both of its direction and its strength. In data from a switching payoff matrix experiment of extended 2x2 games (Binmore, Swierzbinski and Proulx, 2001 [1]), we find the changing of the social evolutionary rotation can be distinguished quantitatively. The evolutionary rotation can be captured by evolutionary dynamics. With eigenvalue from the Jacobian of a constrained replicator dynamics model, an interpretation for observed rotation strength is given. In addition, equality-of-populations rank test shows that relative response coefficient of a group could persist cross the switching parameter games.

The dissolution of porous media in a geologic formation induced by the injection of massive amounts of CO2 can undermine the mechanical stability of the formation structure before carbon mineralization takes place. The geomechanical impact of geologic carbon storage is therefore closely related to the structural sustainability of the chosen reservoir as well as the probability of buoyancy driven CO2 leakage through caprocks. Here we show, with a combination of ex situ nanotomography and in situ microtomography, that the presence of dissolved CO2 in water produces a homogeneous dissolution pattern in natural chalk microstructure. This pattern stems from a greater apparent solubility of chalk and therefore a greater reactive subvolume in a sample. When a porous medium dissolves homogeneously in an imposed flow field, three geomechanical effects were observed: material compaction, fracturing and grain relocation. These phenomena demonstrated distinct feedbacks to the migration of the dissolution front and severely complicated the infiltration instability problem. We conclude that the presence of dissolved CO2 makes the dissolution front less susceptible to spatial and temporal perturbations in the strongly coupled geochemical and geomechanical processes."

One direction is in the same universality class as the disordered XY model. The all orders beta function is computed for the network model of the spin Quantum Hall transition and the flows are shown to have similar properties. It is argued that fixed points of general current-current interactions in 2d should correspond to solutions of the Virasoro master equation. Based on this we identify two coset conformal field theories osp(2N|2N)_1 /u(1)_0 and osp(4N|4N)_1/su(2)_0 as possible fixed points and study the resulting multifractal properties.

Under coherent interactions, particles undergo correlated collisions with the crystal lattice and their motion result in confinement in the fields of atomic planes, i.e. particle channeling. Other than coherently interacting with the lattice, particles also suffer incoherent interactions with individual nuclei and may leave their bounded motion, i.e., they de-channel. This latter is the main limiting factor for applications of coherent interactions in crystal-assisted particle steering. We experimentally investigated the nature of dechanneling of 120 GeV/c $e^{-}$ and $e^{+}$ in a bent silicon crystal at H4-SPS external line at CERN. We found out that while channeling efficiency differs significantly for $e^{-}$ ($2\\pm2$ $\\%$) and $e^{+}$ ($54\\pm2$ $\\%$), their nuclear dechanneling length is comparable, $(0.6\\pm0.1)$ mm for $e^{-}$ and $(0.7\\pm0.3)$ mm for $e^{+}$.

By studying the temporal and spatial characteristics of short optical pulses diffusively transmitted through compacted granular materials, we show that powder compaction can also give rise to strongly anisotropic diffusion of light. Investigating technologically important materials such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and calcium phosphate, we report increasing optical anisotropy with compaction force and radial diffusion constants being up to 1.7 times the longitudinal. This open new and attractive routes to material characterization and investigation of compression-induced structural anisotropy.

Riemann's principle \"force equals geometry\" provided the basis for Einstein's General Relativity - the geometric theory of gravitation. In this paper, we follow this principle to derive the dynamics for any static, conservative force. The geometry of spacetime of a moving object is described by a metric obtained from the potential of the force field acting on it. We introduce a generalization of Newton's First Law - the \\emph{Generalized Principle of Inertia} stating that: \\emph{An inanimate object moves inertially, that is, with constant velocity, in \\emph{its own} spacetime whose geometry is determined by the forces affecting it}. Classical Newtonian dynamics is treated within this framework, using a properly defined \\emph{Newtonian metric} with respect to an inertial lab frame. We reveal a physical deficiency of this metric (responsible for the inability of Newtonian dynamics to account for relativistic behavior), and remove it. The dynamics defined by the corrected Newtonian metric leads to a new \\emph{Relativistic Newtonian Dynamics} for both massive objects and massless particles moving in any static, conservative force field, not necessarily gravitational. This dynamics reduces in the weak field, low velocity limit to classical Newtonian dynamics and also exactly reproduces the classical tests of General Relativity, as well as the post-Keplerian precession of binaries."

We investigate the dependence of the carbon and oxygen production in stars on the 3-alpha rate by varying the energy of the 02+-state of 12C and determine the resulting yields for a selection of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and massive stars. The yields are obtained using modern stellar evolution codes that follow the entire evolution of massive stars, including the supernova explosion, and consider in detail the 3rd dredge-up process during the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch of low-mass and intermediate-mass stars. Our results show that the C and O production in massive stars depends strongly on the initial mass, and that it is crucial to follow the entire evolution. A rather strong C production during the He-shell flashes compared to quiescent He burning leads to a lower sensitivity of the C and O production in low-mass and intermediate-mass stars on the 3-alpha-rate than predicted in our previous work. In particular, the C production of intermediate-mass stars seems to have a maximum close to the actual value of the 02+ energy level of 12C."

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is an effective approach for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We propose a low-cost miniature robot that can be easily assembled and remotely controlled. The system includes an active end-effector, a passive positioning arm, and a detachable swab gripper with integrated force sensing capability. The cost of the materials for building this robot is 55 USD and the total weight of the functional part is 0.23kg. The design of the force sensing swab gripper was justified using Finite Element (FE) modeling and the performances of the robot were validated with a simulation phantom and three pig noses. FE analysis indicated a 0.5mm magnitude displacement of the gripper's sensing beam, which meets the ideal detecting range of the optoelectronic sensor. Studies on both the phantom and the pig nose demonstrated the successful operation of the robot during the collection task. The average forces were found to be 0.35N and 0.85N, respectively.

This work presents a network-based data-driven study of the combination of factors that contribute to success in mountaineering. It simultaneously examines the effects of individual factors such as age, gender, experience etc., as well as expedition-wide factors such as number of camps, ratio of sherpas to paying climbers etc. Specifically, it combines the two perspectives into a multiscale network, i.e., a network of individual climber features within each expedition at the finer scale, and an expedition similarity network on the coarser scale. The latter is represented as a multiplex network where layers encode different factors. The analysis reveals that chances of failure to summit due to fatigue, altitude or logistical problems, drastically reduce when climbing with repeat partners, especially for experienced climbers. Additionally, node-centrality indicates that individual traits of youth and oxygen use are the strongest drivers of success. Further, the learning of network projections enables computation of correlations between intra-expedition networks and corresponding expedition success rates. Of expedition-wide factors, the expedition size and length layers are found to be strongly correlated with success rate. Lastly, community detection on the expedition-similarity network reveals distinct communities where a difference in success rates naturally emerges amongst the communities."

Objective: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a time-consuming process involving iterative adjustments of hyperparameters. To automate the treatment planning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner (MP). Methods: Our MP algorithm automates planning by performing optimization of treatment planning hyperparameters. The algorithm uses a derivative-free method (i.e. parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search) to search for weight configurations that minimize a meta-scoring function. Meta-scoring is performed by constructing a tier list of the relevant considerations (e.g. dose homogeneity, conformity, spillage, and OAR sparing) to mimic the clinical decision-making process. Additionally, we have made our source code publicly available via github. Results: The proposed MP method is evaluated on two datasets (21 prostate cases and 6 head and neck cases) collected as part of clinical workflow. MP is applied to both IMRT and VMAT planning and compared to a baseline of manual VMAT plans. MP in both IMRT and VMAT scenarios has comparable or better performance than manual VMAT planning for all evaluated metrics. Conclusion: Our proposed MP provides a general framework for fully automated treatment planning that produces high quality treatment plans. Significance: Our MP method promises to substantially reduce the workload of treatment planners while maintaining or improving plan quality."

After checking the kinematic energy distribution of \\rpi ratio, we found this transition of sensitivity of \\rpi ratio to symmetry energy is mainly from less energetic pions, i.e., the softer symmetry energy gets the less energetic pions to form a smaller \\rpi ratio in peripheral collisions while these pions generate a larger \\rpi ratio in central collisions. Undoubtedly, the softer symmetry energy can also lead more energetic pions to form a larger \\rpi ratio in peripheral collisions.

Our proposed system launches few rays when compared to a full ray-tracing based method, achieving a significant performance gain without quality loss in the final rendering. Resulting reflections are then characterized as two sonar parameters: Echo intensity and pulse distance.

With recent progress in algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of computation power, application of machine learning techniques is becoming a hot topic in the oil and gas industry. One of the most promising aspects to apply machine learning to the upstream field is the rock facies classification in reservoir characterization, which is crucial in determining the net pay thickness of reservoirs, thus a definitive factor in drilling decision making process. For complex machine learning tasks like facies classification, feature engineering is often critical. This paper shows the inclusion of physics-motivated feature interaction in feature augmentation can further improve the capability of machine learning in rock facies classification. We demonstrate this approach with the SEG 2016 machine learning contest dataset and the top winning algorithms. The improvement is roboust and can be $\\sim5\\%$ better than current existing best F-1 score, where F-1 is an evaluation metric used to quantify average prediction accuracy."

This paper proposes an asychronous distributed leader-follower control method to achieve conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in three-phase unbalanced distribution systems by optimally scheduling smart inverters of distributed energy resources (DERs). One feature of the proposed method is to consider integrated primary-secondary distribution networks and voltage dependent loads. To ease the computational complexity introduced by the large number of secondary networks, we partition a system into distributed leader-follower control zones based on the network connectivity. To address the non-convexity from the nonlinear power flow and load models, a feedback-based linear approximation using instantaneous power and voltage measurements is proposed. This enables the online implementation of the proposed method to achieve fast tracking of system variations led by DERs. Another feature of the proposed method is the asynchronous implementations of the leader-follower controllers, which makes it compatible with non-uniform update rates and robust against communication delays and failures. Numerical tests are performed on a real distribution feeder in Midwest U. S. to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

State-of-the-art performance on language understanding tasks is now achieved with increasingly large networks; the current record holder has billions of parameters. Given a language model pre-trained on massive unlabeled text corpora, only very light supervised fine-tuning is needed to learn a task: the number of fine-tuning steps is typically five orders of magnitude lower than the total parameter count. Does this mean that fine-tuning only introduces small differences from the pre-trained model in the parameter space? If so, can one avoid storing and computing an entire model for each task? In this work, we address these questions by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as an example. As expected, we find that the fine-tuned models are close in parameter space to the pre-trained one, with the closeness varying from layer to layer. We show that it suffices to fine-tune only the most critical layers. Further, we find that there are surprisingly many good solutions in the set of sparsified versions of the pre-trained model. As a result, fine-tuning of huge language models can be achieved by simply setting a certain number of entries in certain layers of the pre-trained parameters to zero, saving both task-specific parameter storage and computational cost."

The research described in the text suggests that fine-tuning only the most critical layers and sparsifying the pre-trained model by setting certain parameters to zero is an effective strategy.

We present the Neural Simplex Architecture (NSA), a new approach to runtime assurance that provides safety guarantees for neural controllers (obtained e.g. using reinforcement learning) of autonomous and other complex systems without unduly sacrificing performance. NSA is inspired by the Simplex control architecture of Sha et al., but with some significant differences. In the traditional approach, the advanced controller (AC) is treated as a black box; when the decision module switches control to the baseline controller (BC), the BC remains in control forever. There is relatively little work on switching control back to the AC, and there are no techniques for correcting the AC's behavior after it generates a potentially unsafe control input that causes a failover to the BC. Our NSA addresses both of these limitations. NSA not only provides safety assurances in the presence of a possibly unsafe neural controller, but can also improve the safety of such a controller in an online setting via retraining, without overly degrading its performance. To demonstrate NSA's benefits, we have conducted several significant case studies in the continuous control domain. These include a target-seeking ground rover navigating an obstacle field, and a neural controller for an artificial pancreas system."

The key advantage, as described in the text, is that NSA addresses two main limitations of the traditional approach:\n\n1.

In the traditional approach, once control is switched to the BC, it remains there permanently.\n\n2. NSA can improve the safety of the neural controller in an online setting through retraining, without significantly degrading its performance.

Here, we predict some additional magnetic-field-induced phenomena that can take place in the context of NFRHT between planar layered structures containing magneto-optical (MO) materials (mainly doped semiconductors like InSb). In particular, we predict the possibility of increasing the NFRHT upon applying an external magnetic field in an asymmetric structure consisting of two infinite plates made of InSb and Au. We also study the impact of a magnetic field in the NFRHT between structures containing MO thin films and show that the effect is more drastic than in their bulk counterparts. Finally, we systematically investigate the anisotropic thermal magnetoresistance, i.e., the dependence of the radiative heat conductance on the orientation of an external magnetic field, in the case of two infinite plates made of InSb and show that one can strongly modulate the NFRHT by simply changing the orientation of the magnetic field.

Travellers in autonomous vehicles (AVs) need not to walk to the destination any more after parking like those in conventional human-driven vehicles (HVs). Instead, they can drop off directly at the destination and AVs can cruise for parking autonomously. It is a revolutionary change that such parking autonomy of AVs may increase the potential parking span substantially and affect the spatial parking equilibrium. Given this, from urban planners' perspective, it is of great necessity to reconsider the planning of parking supply along the city. To this end, this paper is the first to examine the spatial parking equilibrium considering the mix of AVs and HVs with parking cruising effect. It is found that the equilibrium solution of travellers' parking location choices can be biased due to the ignorance of cruising effects. On top of that, the optimal parking span of AVs at given parking supply should be no less than that at equilibrium. Besides, the optimal parking planning to minimize the total parking cost is also explored in a bi-level parking planning design problem (PPDP).

We focus our analysis on distributed machine learning systems. Understanding the policy implications in this area is particularly urgent because such systems, which include autonomous vehicles, tend to be high-stakes and safety-critical.

They suggest drawing lessons from risk assessment practices in other domains (like law and public health) to guide the governance of computer systems, particularly distributed machine learning systems. The authors emphasize the need to reckon with these trade-offs in governing computer systems, especially for high-stakes and safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles. They also call for developing accountability mechanisms when risks related to these trade-offs result in real-world accidents. Option C best captures this main argument, while the other options either misrepresent the authors' position or oversimplify the complex issue presented in the text."

Stick-slip motion, a common phenomenon observed during crawling of cells, is found to be strongly sensitive to the substrate stiffness. Stick-slip behaviours have previously been investigated typically using purely elastic substrates. For a more realistic understanding of this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model to study the dynamics on a viscoelastic substrate. Our model based on a reaction-diffusion framework, incorporates known important interactions such as retrograde flow of actin, myosin contractility, force dependent assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions coupled with cell-substrate interaction. We show that consideration of a viscoelastic substrate not only captures the usually observed stick-slip jumps, but also predicts the existence of an optimal substrate viscosity corresponding to maximum traction force and minimum retrograde flow which was hitherto unexplored. Moreover, our theory predicts the time evolution of individual bond force that characterizes the stick-slip patterns on soft versus stiff substrates. Our analysis also elucidates how the duration of the stick-slip cycles are affected by various cellular parameters."

Cyclic, nonhierarchical interactions among biological species represent a general mechanism by which ecosystems are able to maintain high levels of biodiversity. However, species coexistence is often possible only in spatially extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to biological interactions are varied."

Many real-world solutions for image restoration are learning-free and based on handcrafted image priors such as self-similarity. Recently, deep-learning methods that use training data have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image restoration tasks (e.g., super-resolution and inpainting). Ulyanov et al. bridge the gap between these two families of methods (CVPR 18). They have shown that learning-free methods perform close to the state-of-the-art learning-based methods (approximately 1 PSNR). Their approach benefits from the encoder-decoder network. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the multi-level extensions of the encoder-decoder network, to investigate interesting aspects of the relationship between image restoration and network construction independent of learning. Our framework allows various network structures by modifying the following network components: skip links, cascading of the network input into intermediate layers, a composition of the encoder-decoder subnetworks, and network depth. These handcrafted network structures illustrate how the construction of untrained networks influence the following image restoration tasks: denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. We also demonstrate image reconstruction using flash and no-flash image pairs. We provide performance comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods for all the restoration tasks above."

Financial markets, being spectacular examples of complex systems, display rich correlation structures among price returns of different assets. The correlation structures change drastically, akin to phase transitions in physical phenomena, as do the influential stocks (leaders) and sectors (communities), during market events like crashes. It is crucial to detect their signatures for timely intervention or prevention. Here we use eigenvalue decomposition and eigen-entropy, computed from eigen-centralities of different stocks in the cross-correlation matrix, to extract information about the disorder in the market. We construct a `phase space', where different market events (bubbles, crashes, etc.) undergo phase separation and display order-disorder transitions. An entropy functional exhibits scaling behavior.

We derive the probability distribution of net baryon number in a restricted phase space from the canonical partition function that incorporates exact conservation of baryon number in the full system. Furthermore, we provide tools to compute cumulants of any order from the generating function of uncorrelated baryons constrained by exact baryon number conservation. The results are applied to quantify the non-critical baseline for cumulants of net proton number fluctuations obtained in heavy-ion collisions by the STAR collaboration at different RHIC energies and by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC. Furthermore, volume fluctuations are added by a Monte Carlo procedure based on the centrality dependence of charged particle production as measured experimentally. Compared to the predictions based on the hadron resonance gas model or Skellam distribution a clear suppression of fluctuations is observed due to exact baryon-number conservation.

Our method applies even when the extra sector is strongly coupled, and moreover does not require a microscopic Lagrangian description. Using constraints from holomorphy we fix the leading parametric form of the contributions to these Higgs processes, including the Higgs mixing angle dependence, up to an overall coefficient. Moreover, when the Higgs is the sole source of mass for a superconformal sector, we show that even this coefficient is often calculable. For appropriate mixing angles, the contribution of the extra states to h -> gg and h -> gamma gamma can vanish.

The experiments show that the novel RL methods are able to automatically generate well-performing policies which are at the same time human-interpretable. Furthermore, one of the methods is applied to automatically learn an equation-based policy for a hardware cart-pole demonstrator by using only human-player-generated batch data. The solution generated in the first attempt already represents a successful balancing policy, which demonstrates the methods applicability to real-world problems."

The study introduces three new RL methods that generate human-interpretable policies (fuzzy controllers and algebraic equations) and compares them with both classical and non-interpretable RL methods. The novel methods demonstrate the ability to create well-performing policies that are also interpretable, which is the key finding of the research. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the study compares three new RL methods with two classical methods and three non-interpretable RL methods (total of 8 methods, not 5 traditional methods). Also, it doesn't claim that interpretable policies always outperform non-interpretable ones.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the paper doesn't prove that offline learning is superior to online learning. It merely uses offline learning from batch data for all methods in the comparison.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the study does include an application to a hardware cart-pole demonstrator using human-player-generated data, this is only one part of the research and not its exclusive focus. The study also includes extensive comparisons using simulated data."

To indirectly evaluate the asymmetry of the radiation drive under limited measurement conditions in inertial confinement fusion research, we have proposed an integral method to approximate the three-dimensional self-radiation distribution of the compressed plasma core using only four pinhole images from a single laser entrance hole at a maximum projection angle of 10{\\deg}. The simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) that uses spatial constraints provided by the prior structural information and the central pinhole image is utilized in the simulation. The simulation results showed that the normalized mean square deviation between the original distribution and reconstruction results of the central radiation area of the simulated cavity was 0.4401, and the structural similarity of the cavity radiation distribution was 0.5566. Meanwhile, using more diagnostic holes could achieve better structural similarity and lower reconstruction error. In addition, the results indicated that our new proposed method could reconstruct the distribution of a compressed plasma core in a vacuum hohlraum with high accuracy."

This limitation is compensated for by using the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which incorporates spatial constraints provided by prior structural information and the central pinhole image.

            "text": "Mixed-Resolution Image Representation and Compression with Convolutional\n  Neural Networks. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end mixed-resolution image compression framework with convolutional neural networks. Firstly, given one input image, feature description neural network (FDNN) is used to generate a new representation of this image, so that this image representation can be more efficiently compressed by standard codec, as compared to the input image. Furthermore, we use post-processing neural network (PPNN) to remove the coding artifacts caused by quantization of codec. Secondly, low-resolution image representation is adopted for high efficiency compression in terms of most of bit spent by image's structures under low bit-rate. However, more bits should be assigned to image details in the high-resolution, when most of structures have been kept after compression at the high bit-rate. This comes from a fact that the low-resolution image representation can't burden more information than high-resolution representation beyond a certain bit-rate. Finally, to resolve the problem of error back-propagation from the PPNN network to the FDNN network, we introduce to learn a virtual codec neural network to imitate two continuous procedures of standard compression and post-processing. The objective experimental results have demonstrated the proposed method has a large margin improvement, when comparing with several state-of-the-art approaches."

The FDNN generates a new representation of the input image that can be more efficiently compressed by standard codecs. The PPNN is used to remove coding artifacts caused by quantization.\n\nAdditionally, the framework adapts the resolution of the image representation based on the bit-rate. At low bit-rates, it uses a low-resolution representation to efficiently compress image structures. At higher bit-rates, it shifts to a high-resolution representation to allocate more bits to image details.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the framework doesn't use a single network for all resolutions. Option C is wrong because the method still utilizes standard codecs rather than replacing them entirely. Option D is inaccurate as the framework adapts resolution based on bit-rate, not focusing solely on low-resolution compression."

Recent Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way have placed strong limits on the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. In order to produce the strongest limit on the dark matter annihilation cross-section, the observations of each dwarf galaxy have typically been \"stacked\" in a joint-likelihood analysis, utilizing optical observations to constrain the dark matter density profile in each dwarf. These limits have typically been computed only for singular annihilation final states, such as $b\\bar{b}$ or $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. In this paper, we generalize this approach by producing an independent joint-likelihood analysis to set constraints on models where the dark matter particle annihilates to multiple final state fermions. We interpret these results in the context of the most popular simplified models, including those with s- and t-channel dark matter annihilation through scalar and vector mediators. We present our results as constraints on the minimum dark matter mass and the mediator sector parameters. Additionally, we compare our simplified model results to those of Effective Field Theory contact interactions in the high-mass limit."

Transformers have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning-based transformer model for low-resource multilingual speech recognition for Indian languages. Our proposed model consists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders.

We consider the phoneme recognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We jointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks using Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme sequence. Our experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain significant improvement over previous approaches [4].

            "text": "A Spatial Analysis of Disposable Income in Ireland: A GWR Approach. This paper examines the spatial distribution of income in Ireland. Median gross household disposable income data from the CSO, available at the Electoral Division (ED) level, is used to explore the spatial variability in income. Geary's C highlights the spatial dependence of income, highlighting that the distribution of income is not random across space and is influenced by location. Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation, utilising a global OLS regression will lead to biased results. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used to examine the spatial heterogeneity of income and the impact of local demographic drivers on income. GWR results show the demographic drivers have varying levels of influence on income across locations. Lone parent has a stronger negative impact in the Cork commuter belt than it does in the Dublin commuter belt. The relationship between household income and the demographic context of the area is a complicated one. This paper attempts to examine these relationships acknowledging the impact of space."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between spatial analysis techniques and income distribution in Ireland, as presented in the paper?\n\nA) Geary's C indicates that income distribution is random across space, while GWR shows that demographic factors have a uniform impact on income throughout Ireland.\n\nB) OLS regression is the preferred method for analyzing income distribution due to the absence of spatial autocorrelation, as evidenced by Geary's C.\n\nC) GWR reveals that the impact of demographic drivers on income is spatially homogeneous, with lone parent status having an equally negative effect in both Cork and Dublin commuter belts.\n\nD) Geary's C demonstrates spatial dependence of income, and GWR illustrates that demographic drivers have varying levels of influence on income across different locations in Ireland.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the findings presented in the paper. Geary's C is used to highlight the spatial dependence of income, showing that income distribution is not random across space. This spatial autocorrelation makes global OLS regression unsuitable, as it would lead to biased results. The paper then employs Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to examine spatial heterogeneity of income and the impact of local demographic drivers. The GWR results show that demographic factors have varying levels of influence on income across different locations. For example, the paper specifically mentions that the negative impact of lone parent status is stronger in the Cork commuter belt compared to the Dublin commuter belt, illustrating the spatial variability in the relationship between demographic factors and income."

We present new measurements of the inclusive forward-backward ttbar production asymmetry, AFB, and its dependence on several properties of the ttbar system. The measurements are performed with the full Tevatron data set recorded with the CDF II detector during ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb^(-1). We measure the asymmetry using the rapidity difference Delta-y=y_(t)-y_(tbar). Parton-level results are derived, yielding an inclusive asymmetry of 0.164+/-0.047 (stat + syst). We observe a linear dependence of AFB on the top-quark pair mass M(ttbar) and the rapidity difference |Delta-y| at detector and parton levels. Assuming the standard model, the probabilities to observe the measured values or larger for the detector-level dependencies are 7.4*10^(-3) and 2.2*10^(-3) for M(ttbar) and |Delta-y| respectively. Lastly, we study the dependence of the asymmetry on the transverse momentum of the ttbar system at the detector level. These results are consistent with previous lower-precision measurements and provide additional quantification of the functional dependencies of the asymmetry."

In this paper a detailed numerical study (in frames of the Slonczewski formalism) of magnetization oscillations driven by a spin-polarized current through a thin elliptical nanoelement is presented.

Kiselev et al., Nature, vol. 425, p. 380 (2003), namely: existence of several equidistant spectral bands, sharp onset and abrupt disappearance of magnetization oscillations with increasing current, absence of the out-of-plane regime predicted by a macrospin model and the relation between frequencies of so called small-angle and quasichaotic oscillations. However, a quantitative agreement with experimental results (especially concerning the frequency of quasichaotic oscillations) could not be achieved in the region of reasonable parameter values, indicating that further model refinement is necessary for a complete understanding of the spin-driven magnetization precession even in this relatively simple experimental situation."

Increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) and responsive loads (RLs) in the electric power distribution systems calls for a mechanism for joint supply-demand coordination. Recently, several transactive/bilateral coordination mechanisms have been proposed for the distribution-level coordination of flexible resources. Implementing a transactive market coordination approach requires a secure, reliable, and computationally efficient multi-agent platform. An example of such a platform is VOLTTRON, developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL). The VOLTTRON platform allows the market actors to exchange information and execute proper control actions in a decentralized way. This paper aims to provide a proof-of-concept of the transactive market coordination approach via a small-scale demonstration on the VOLTTRON platform. The steps needed to implement the proposed market architecture using virtual machines and VOLTTRON are thoroughly described, and illustrative examples are provided to show the market-clearing process for different scenarios."

In this study we cover the current best practices regarding calibration for binary classification, and explore how different approaches yield different results on real world credit scoring data. The limitations of evaluating credit scoring models using only rank ability metrics are explored. A benchmark is run on 18 real world datasets, and results compared.

We describe here a SQUID in which the Josephson junctions are formed from strips of normal metal (N) in good electrical contact with the superconductor (S). Such SNS SQUIDs can be operated under a finite voltage bias with performance comparable or potentially better than conventional SIS SQUIDs. However, they also permit a novel mode of operation that is based on the unusual interplay of quasiparticle currents and supercurrents in the normal metal of the Josephson junction. The new method allows measurements of the flux dependence of the critical current of the SNS SQUID without applying a finite voltage bias across the SNS junction, enabling sensitive flux detection without generating microwave radiation."

We intend to study the multiplicity of this type of chemically peculiar stars, looking for visual companions in the range of angular separation between 0.05\" and 8\". We carried out a survey of 56 stars using diffraction-limited near-infrared imaging with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT. Thirty-three companion candidates in 24 binaries, three triples, and one quadruple system were detected. Nine companion candidates were found for the first time in this study.

A single-contact voltage sensor designed for accurate measurements of ac voltages across a pair of conductors is described. The sensor design is motivated by remote monitoring applications where accurate voltage measurement of high-voltage transmission lines is required. The body of the sensor is electrically and mechanically attached to a single conductor: either the neutral or high-voltage conductor. A capacitive sensing plate attached to the sensor creates a capacitive voltage divider using the stray capacitance to the non-contacted line. A very high-impedance buffer is used to measure the voltage across the divider output and estimate the line voltage. An important part of the work includes a method of calibrating the sensor such that blind voltage measurements can be made without knowing the exact geometry of the conductors. Other important aspects of the design include a two-stage voltage divider for retaining accuracy and increasing the voltage range of the sensor. The work is supported by extensive numerical simulation models which were used to determine the optimum design for the sensing plate and to evaluate the sensitivity to different configurations including conductor spacing and the height above ground. For calibration values which are accurate to 1%, the line voltage can be measured with an accuracy of 10%.

As one key enabler of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has received remarkable interest from academia and industry. The emerging vehicular applications and the exponential growing data have naturally led to the increased needs of communication, computation and storage resources, and also to strict performance requirements on response time and network bandwidth. In order to deal with these challenges, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising solution. MEC pushes powerful computational and storage capacities from the remote cloud to the edge of networks in close proximity of vehicular users, which enables low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption. Driven by the benefits of MEC, many efforts have been devoted to integrating vehicular networks into MEC, thereby forming a novel paradigm named as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of state-of-art research on VEC. First of all, we provide an overview of VEC, including the introduction, architecture, key enablers, advantages, challenges as well as several attractive application scenarios. Then, we describe several typical research topics where VEC is applied. After that, we present a careful literature review on existing research work in VEC by classification. Finally, we identify open research issues and discuss future research directions."

At the same time resonant anomalies (peaks) are observed in its weakly excited tail for long times preceding equipartition. We observe a similar resonant tail structure also for exact time-periodic Lyapunov orbits, coined q-breathers due to their exponential localization in modal space. We give a simple explanation for this structure in terms of superharmonic resonances. The resonance analysis agrees very well with numerical results and has predictive power. We extend a previously developed perturbation method, based essentially on a Poincare-Lindstedt scheme, in order to account for these resonances, and in order to treat more general model cases, including truncated Toda potentials.

We establish that this strong convergence is a multi-facetted phenomenon, in which the clustering is intense, widespread and balanced by lacunarity of other regions. Power laws, indicative of scale-free features, characterise the distribution of particles in the system. We use large-deviation and extreme-value statistics to explain the effect. Our results show that the interpretation of the 'butterfly effect' needs to be carefully qualified. We argue that the combination of mixing and clustering processes makes our specific model relevant to understanding the evolution of simple organisms.

            "text": "A New Perspective on the Role of A-site Cation in Perovskite Solar Cells. As the race towards higher efficiency for inorganic/organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is becoming highly competitive, a design scheme to maximize carrier transport towards higher power efficiency has been urgently demanded. Here, we unravel a hidden role of A-site cation of PSCs in carrier transport which has been largely neglected, i.e., tuning the Frohlich electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. The key for steering Frohlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ion. The coordination to I alleviates electron-phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective charge or absorbing the LO motion of I. This novel principle discloses lower electron-phonon coupling by several promising organic cations including hydroxyl-ammonium cation (NH$_3$OH$^+$) and possibly Li$^+$ solvating methylamine (Li$^+$NH$_2$CH$_3$) than methyl-ammonium cation. A new perspective on the role of A-site cation could help in improving power efficiency and accelerating the application of PSCs."

Dirac fermions have a central role in high energy physics but it is well known that they emerge also as quasiparticles in several condensed matter systems supporting topological order. We present a general method for deriving the topological effective actions of (3+1) massless Dirac fermions living on general backgrounds and coupled with vector and axial-vector gauge fields. The first step of our strategy is standard (in the Hermitian case) and consists in connecting the determinants of Dirac operators with the corresponding analytical indices through the zeta-function regularization. Then, we introduce a suitable splitting of the heat kernel that naturally selects the purely topological part of the determinant (i.e. the topological effective action). This topological effective action is expressed in terms of gauge fields using the Atiyah-Singer index theorem which computes the analytical index in topological terms. The main new result of this paper is to provide a consistent extension of this method to the non Hermitian case where a well-defined determinant does not exist. Quantum systems supporting relativistic fermions can thus be topologically classified on the basis of their response to the presence of (external or emergent) gauge fields through the corresponding topological effective field theories."

            "text": "Is It Safe to Uplift This Patch? An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox. In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by certain specific developers."
