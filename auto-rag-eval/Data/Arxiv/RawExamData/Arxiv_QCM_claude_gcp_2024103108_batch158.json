This paper discusses the short-maturity behavior of Asian option prices and hedging portfolios. We consider the risk-neutral valuation and the delta value of the Asian option having a H\\\"older continuous payoff function in a local volatility model. The main idea of this analysis is that the local volatility model can be approximated by a Gaussian process at short maturity $T.$ By combining this approximation argument with Malliavin calculus, we conclude that the short-maturity behaviors of Asian option prices and the delta values are approximately expressed as those of their European counterparts with volatility $$\\sigma_{A}(T):=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T^3}\\int_0^T\\sigma^2(t,S_0)(T-t)^2\\,dt}\\,,$$ where $\\sigma(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the local volatility function and $S_0$ is the initial value of the stock.

We consider the Gaussian \"diamond\" or parallel relay network, in which a source node transmits a message to a destination node with the help of N relays. Even for the symmetric setting, in which the channel gains to the relays are identical and the channel gains from the relays are identical, the capacity of this channel is unknown in general. The best known capacity approximation is up to an additive gap of order N bits and up to a multiplicative gap of order N^2, with both gaps independent of the channel gains. In this paper, we approximate the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian N-relay diamond network up to an additive gap of 1.8 bits and up to a multiplicative gap of a factor 14. Both gaps are independent of the channel gains and, unlike the best previously known result, are also independent of the number of relays N in the network. Achievability is based on bursty amplify-and-forward, showing that this simple scheme is uniformly approximately optimal, both in the low-rate as well as in the high-rate regimes. The upper bound on capacity is based on a careful evaluation of the cut-set bound. We also present approximation results for the asymmetric Gaussian N-relay diamond network. In particular, we show that bursty amplify-and-forward combined with optimal relay selection achieves a rate within a factor O(log^4(N)) of capacity with pre-constant in the order notation independent of the channel gains."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the symmetric Gaussian N-relay diamond network, which of the following statements is correct regarding the capacity approximation achieved in this paper?\n\nA) The capacity is approximated up to an additive gap of N bits and a multiplicative gap of order N^2.\nB) The capacity is approximated up to an additive gap of 1.8 bits and a multiplicative gap of a factor 14, both dependent on the number of relays N.\nC) The capacity is approximated up to an additive gap of 1.8 bits and a multiplicative gap of a factor 14, both independent of the number of relays N and channel gains.\nD) The capacity is exactly determined, eliminating any gaps in the approximation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, a lot of predictive epidemiological models have been proposed.

Assortment optimization is an important problem that arises in many industries such as retailing and online advertising where the goal is to find a subset of products from a universe of substitutable products which maximize seller's expected revenue. One of the key challenges in this problem is to model the customer substitution behavior. Many parametric random utility maximization (RUM) based choice models have been considered in the literature. However, in all these models, probability of purchase increases as we include more products to an assortment. This is not true in general and in many settings more choices hurt sales. This is commonly referred to as the choice overload. In this paper we attempt to address this limitation in RUM through a generalization of the Markov chain based choice model considered in Blanchet et al. (2016). As a special case, we show that our model reduces to a generalization of MNL with no-purchase attractions dependent on the assortment S and strictly increasing with the size of assortment S.
