For this reason, source separation algorithms have become an increasingly important tool in neuroscience and neuroengineering.

This paper considers a joint pollution-routing and speed optimization problem (PRP-SO) where fuel costs and $\\textit{CO}_2e$ emissions depend on the vehicle speed, arc payloads, and road grades. We present two methods, one approximate and one exact, for solving the PRP-SO. The approximate strategy solves large-scale instances of the problem with a tabu search-based metaheuristic coupled with an efficient fixed-sequence speed optimization algorithm. The second strategy consists of a tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm in which speed optimization is managed within the pricing problem. We test both methods on modified Solomon benchmarks and newly constructed real-life instance sets. Our BP algorithm solves most instances with up to 50 customers and many instances with 75 and 100 customers. The heuristic is able to find near-optimal solutions to all instances and requires less than one minute of computational time per instance. Results on real-world instances suggest several managerial insights. First, fuel savings of up to 53\\% are realized when explicitly taking into account arc payloads and road grades. Second, fuel savings and emissions reduction are also achieved by scheduling uphill customers later along the routes. Lastly, we show that ignoring elevation information when planning routes leads to highly inaccurate fuel consumption estimates."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A logistics company is implementing the Pollution-Routing Problem with Speed Optimization (PRP-SO) approach.

It is divided into two parts. The first part looks at what GAMMs are, how they work and why/when we should use them.

The paper describes a novel method that combines complex network measures with artificial neural networks for mild cognitive impairment detection. Specifically, it uses diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data and tractography algorithms to reconstruct the brain's structural connectivity. From this reconstruction, complex network measures are derived to describe altered brain connectivity. These measures, representing different \"perspectives\" of the brain's topology, are then used as input to artificial neural networks, which learn to map these topological properties to the presence or absence of cognitive decline.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it mentions complex network measures, it pairs them with support vector machines instead of artificial neural networks.\n\nOption B is partially correct in mentioning diffusion-weighted imaging, but it incorrectly specifies convolutional neural networks instead of the more general artificial neural networks mentioned in the paper.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while tractography algorithms are used in the brain reconstruction process, the classification is done using artificial neural networks, not random forest classifiers."}, "44": {"documentation": {"title": "String Propagation in the Presence of Cosmological Singularities", "source": "Ben Craps, David Kutasov, Govindan Rajesh", "docs_id": "hep-th/0205101", "section": ["hep-th"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "String Propagation in the Presence of Cosmological Singularities.

It is common for genomic data analysis to use $p$-values from a large number of permutation tests. The multiplicity of tests may require very tiny $p$-values in order to reject any null hypotheses and the common practice of using randomly sampled permutations then becomes very expensive. We propose an inexpensive approximation to $p$-values for two sample linear test statistics, derived from Stolarsky's invariance principle. The method creates a geometrically derived set of approximate $p$-values for each hypothesis. The average of that set is used as a point estimate $\\hat p$ and our generalization of the invariance principle allows us to compute the variance of the $p$-values in that set. We find that in cases where the point estimate is small the variance is a modest multiple of the square of the point estimate, yielding a relative error property similar to that of saddlepoint approximations. On a Parkinson's disease data set, the new approximation is faster and more accurate than the saddlepoint approximation.
