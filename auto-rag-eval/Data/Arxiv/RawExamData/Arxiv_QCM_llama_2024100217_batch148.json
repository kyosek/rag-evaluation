We present the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey (ATATS), a multi-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz. The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408 sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam. We compare the catalog generated from this 12-epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure source positions to better than ~20 arcsec. For sources above the ATATS completeness limit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSS sources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine the effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between ATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect no transients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS, and place a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 per square degree.

The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of almost global weak solutions for the unsteady nonlinear elastodynamics system in dimension $d=2$ or $3$, for a range of strain energy density functions satisfying some given assumptions. These assumptions are satisfied by the main strain energies generally considered. The domain is assumed to be bounded, and mixed boundary conditions are considered. Our approach is based on a nonlinear parabolic regularization technique, involving the $p$-Laplace operator. First we prove the existence of a local-in-time solution for the regularized system, by a fixed point technique. Next, using an energy estimate, we show that if the data are small enough, bounded by $\\varepsilon >0$, then the maximal time of existence does not depend on the parabolic regularization parameter, and the behavior of the lifespan $T$ is $\\gtrsim \\log (1/\\varepsilon)$, defining what we call here {\\it almost global existence}. The solution is thus obtained by passing this parameter to zero.

Bartik regressions use locations' differential exposure to nationwide sector-level shocks as an instrument to estimate the effect of a location-level treatment on an outcome. In the canonical Bartik design, locations' differential exposure to industry-level employment shocks are used as an instrument to measure the effect of their employment evolution on their wage evolution. Some recent papers studying Bartik designs have assumed that the sector-level shocks are exogenous and all have the same expectation. This second assumption may sometimes be implausible. For instance, there could be industries whose employment is more likely to grow than that of other industries. We replace that second assumption by parallel trends assumptions. Under our assumptions, Bartik regressions identify weighted sums of location-specific effects, with weights that may be negative. Accordingly, such regressions may be misleading in the presence of heterogeneous effects, an issue that was not present under the assumptions maintained in previous papers. Estimating the weights attached to Bartik regressions is a way to assess their robustness to heterogeneous effects. We also propose an alternative estimator that is robust to location-specific effects. Finally, we revisit two applications. In both cases, Bartik regressions have fairly large negative weights attached to them. Our alternative estimator is substantially different from the Bartik regression coefficient in one application."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of Bartik regressions, what assumption is challenged by the authors, and how does this challenge impact the interpretation of the results?\n\nA) The assumption that the treatment effect is constant across all locations, which is challenged by the authors' parallel trends assumption.

As a result, we construct an innovative fundamental model of a wholesale electricity market. First, our fundamental demand curve has a unique composition. The demand curve lies in between the wholesale demand curve and a perfectly inelastic demand curve. Second, our fundamental supply and demand curves contain only actual (i.e. non-arbitrage) transactions with physical assets on buy and sell sides.
