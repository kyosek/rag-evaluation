This paper studies the two-user Causal Cognitive Interference Channel (CCIC), where two transmitters aim to communicate independent messages to two different receivers via a common channel. One source, referred to as the cognitive, is capable of overhearing the other source, referred to as the primary, through a noisy in-band link and thus can assist in sending the primary's data. Two novel outer bounds of the type $2R_p+R_c$ and $R_p+2R_c$ are derived for the class of injective semi-deterministic CCICs where the noises at the different source-destination pairs are independent. An achievable rate region is derived based on Gelfand-Pinsker binning, superposition coding and simultaneous decoding at the receivers. The lower and outer bounds are then specialized to the practically relevant Gaussian noise case. The authors of this paper recently characterized to within a constant gap the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in (a) the strong interference regime, and (b) for a subset of the weak interference regime when the cooperation link is larger than a given threshold. This work characterizes to within a constant gap the capacity for the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in the regime that was still open.

The increased uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) leads to increased demand for electricity, and sometimes pressure on power grids. Uncoordinated charging of EVs may result in stress on distribution networks, and often some form of optimization is required in the charging process. Optimal coordinated charging is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) in nature, with objective functions such as minimum price charging and minimum disruptions to the grid. In this manuscript, we propose a general multi-objective EV charging/discharging schedule (MOEVCS) framework, where the time of use (TOU) tariff is designed according to the load request at each time stamp. To obtain the optimal scheduling scheme and balance the competing benefits from different stakeholders, such as EV owners, EV charging stations (EVCS), and the grid operator, we design three competing objective functions including EV owner cost, EVCS profit, and the network impact. Moreover, we create four application scenarios with different charging request distributions over the investigated periods.

As a means to support the access of massive machine-type communication devices, grant-free access and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have received great deal of attention in recent years.

An aim of this paper is to put forth a new type of AUD based on deep neural network (DNN). By applying the training data in the properly designed DNN, the proposed AUD scheme learns the nonlinear mapping between the received NOMA signal and indices of active devices.

Our disassortative scale-free network model behaves consistently with our expanded phenomenology observed in human aging, and so is a useful tool to explore mechanisms of and to develop new predictive measures for human aging and mortality."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the network model of human aging described in the study, which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between node connectivity and the timing of damage?\n\nA) The most-connected nodes (clinical measures) tend to show damage earlier than the least-connected nodes (laboratory measures).\n\nB) The least-connected nodes (laboratory measures) tend to show damage earlier than the most-connected nodes (clinical measures).\n\nC) There is no significant difference in the timing of damage between most-connected and least-connected nodes.\n\nD) The timing of damage is random and not related to node connectivity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states, \"Furthermore, in both model and observational data, we find that the least-connected (laboratory) nodes damage earlier than the most-connected (clinical) deficits.\" This finding is counterintuitive, which makes it a challenging question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the relationship described in the study.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the study clearly indicates a difference in the timing of damage between most-connected and least-connected nodes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the study demonstrates that the timing of damage is related to node connectivity, not random.\n\nThis question tests the reader's understanding of a key finding in the study and requires careful attention to detail, as the relationship between connectivity and damage timing is not what one might initially expect."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Improved Prosodic Clustering for Multispeaker and Speaker-independent\n  Phoneme-level Prosody Control", "source": "Myrsini Christidou, Alexandra Vioni, Nikolaos Ellinas, Georgios\n  Vamvoukakis, Konstantinos Markopoulos, Panos Kakoulidis, June Sig Sung,\n  Hyoungmin Park, Aimilios Chalamandaris, Pirros Tsiakoulis", "docs_id": "2111.10168", "section": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "eess.AS"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Improved Prosodic Clustering for Multispeaker and Speaker-independent\n  Phoneme-level Prosody Control. This paper presents a method for phoneme-level prosody control of F0 and duration on a multispeaker text-to-speech setup, which is based on prosodic clustering. An autoregressive attention-based model is used, incorporating multispeaker architecture modules in parallel to a prosody encoder. Several improvements over the basic single-speaker method are proposed that increase the prosodic control range and coverage. More specifically we employ data augmentation, F0 normalization, balanced clustering for duration, and speaker-independent prosodic clustering. These modifications enable fine-grained phoneme-level prosody control for all speakers contained in the training set, while maintaining the speaker identity. The model is also fine-tuned to unseen speakers with limited amounts of data and it is shown to maintain its prosody control capabilities, verifying that the speaker-independent prosodic clustering is effective. Experimental results verify that the model maintains high output speech quality and that the proposed method allows efficient prosody control within each speaker's range despite the variability that a multispeaker setting introduces."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of improvements does the paper propose to enhance prosodic control in a multispeaker text-to-speech system?\n\nA) F0 normalization, speaker-dependent clustering, and balanced clustering for duration\nB) Data augmentation, F0 normalization, balanced clustering for duration, and speaker-independent prosodic clustering\nC) Autoregressive attention-based modeling, parallel prosody encoding, and F0 augmentation\nD) Speaker-independent F0 control, duration balancing, and prosodic data synthesis\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The paper specifically mentions several improvements over the basic single-speaker method to increase prosodic control range and coverage in a multispeaker setup. These improvements are explicitly stated as data augmentation, F0 normalization, balanced clustering for duration, and speaker-independent prosodic clustering.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes speaker-dependent clustering, which is contrary to the paper's approach of using speaker-independent prosodic clustering.\n\nOption C is partially correct in mentioning autoregressive attention-based modeling, which is used in the system, but it doesn't list the specific improvements mentioned in the paper. Additionally, \"F0 augmentation\" is not mentioned; instead, the paper discusses F0 normalization.\n\nOption D contains some elements that are close to correct (like duration balancing), but it doesn't accurately represent the full set of improvements described in the paper. \"Prosodic data synthesis\" is not mentioned as one of the key improvements.\n\nThis question tests the reader's ability to identify and recall the specific technical improvements proposed in the paper for enhancing prosodic control in a multispeaker text-to-speech system."}}
