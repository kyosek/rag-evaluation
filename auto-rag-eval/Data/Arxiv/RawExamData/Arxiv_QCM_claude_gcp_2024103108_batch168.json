For a single hadron bunch in a circular accelerator at zero chromaticity, without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability, or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional {\\it absolute} meaning of the word.

Existing model learning tools for infinite state systems face scalability problems and can only be applied to restricted classes of systems (register automata with equality/inequality). In this article, we show how we can boost the performance of model learning techniques by extracting the constraints on input and output parameters from a run, and making this grey-box information available to the learner.

We extract the constraints from runs of Python programs using an existing tainting library for Python, and compare our grey-box version of RALib with the existing black-box version on several benchmarks, including some data structures from Python's standard library.

Wireless networking is becoming an increasingly important and popular way of providing global information access to users on the move. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust handoff algorithms, which allow a mobile node to roam among heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, the authors devise a scheme, A Novel Adaptive Channel Allocation Scheme (ACAS) where the number of guard channel(s) is adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in the past certain period of time. The handoff blocking rate is controlled under the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized. The performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes. The result shows that the ACAS scheme outperforms the Static Channel Allocation Scheme by controlling a hard constraint on the handoff rejection probability. The proposed scheme achieves the optimal performance by maximizing the resource utilization and adapts itself to changing traffic conditions automatically."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantage of the Novel Adaptive Channel Allocation Scheme (ACAS) as presented in the paper?\n\nA) It uses a fixed number of guard channels to prioritize handoff calls over new calls.\n\nB) It automatically adjusts the number of guard channels based on the average handoff blocking rate from a recent time period.\n\nC) It focuses solely on minimizing the new call blocking rate without considering handoff calls.\n\nD) It implements a static allocation of channels that remains constant regardless of traffic conditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The absence of an explicit attention matrix makes the inclusion of inductive biases relying on relative interactions between elements more challenging.
