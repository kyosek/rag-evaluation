The knowledge base paradigm aims to express domain knowledge in a rich formal language, and to use this domain knowledge as a knowledge base to solve various problems and tasks that arise in the domain by applying multiple forms of inference. As such, the paradigm applies a strict separation of concerns between information and problem solving. In this paper, we analyze the principles and feasibility of the knowledge base paradigm in the context of an important class of applications: interactive configuration problems. In interactive configuration problems, a configuration of interrelated objects under constraints is searched, where the system assists the user in reaching an intended configuration. It is widely recognized in industry that good software solutions for these problems are very difficult to develop. We investigate such problems from the perspective of the KB paradigm. We show that multiple functionalities in this domain can be achieved by applying different forms of logical inferences on a formal specification of the configuration domain.

Correlations in multifractal series have been investigated, extensively. Almost all approaches try to find scaling features of a given time series. However, the analysis of such scaling properties has some difficulties such as finding a proper scaling region. On the other hand, such correlation detection methods may be affected by the probability distribution function of the series. In this article, we apply the horizontal visibility graph algorithm to map stochastic time series into networks. By investigating the magnitude and sign of a multifractal time series, we show that one can detect linear as well as nonlinear correlations, even for situations that have been considered as uncorrelated noises by typical approaches like MFDFA. In this respect, we introduce a topological parameter that can well measure the strength of nonlinear correlations. This parameter is independent of the probability distribution function and calculated without the need to find any scaling region. Our findings may provide new insights about the multifractal analysis of time series in a variety of complex systems."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary limitation of traditional approaches to detecting correlations in multifractal time series, and how does the proposed visibility graph algorithm address this limitation?\n\nA) Traditional approaches are limited by the need to find a proper scaling region, whereas the visibility graph algorithm does not require this.\nB) Traditional approaches are limited by the probability distribution function of the series, whereas the visibility graph algorithm is independent of this function.\nC) Traditional approaches are limited by the need to calculate the probability distribution function of the series, whereas the visibility graph algorithm does not require this.\nD) Traditional approaches are limited by the need to find a proper scaling region and are affected by the probability distribution function of the series, whereas the visibility graph algorithm addresses both limitations.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) Traditional approaches are limited by the need to find a proper scaling region and are affected by the probability distribution function of the series, whereas the visibility graph algorithm addresses both limitations.\n\n**Explanation:** The documentation states that traditional approaches to detecting correlations in multifractal time series have difficulties in finding a proper scaling region, and that such approaches may be affected by the probability distribution function of the series.

The gambler understands that all opportunities for superior performance arise from suboptimal decisions by humans, but understands also that knowledge of human decision making alone is not enough to understand market behavior --- one must still model how those decisions lead to market prices. Thus are there three parts to the model: gambling theory, human decision making, and strategic problem solving. A new theory is necessary because at this writing in 2017, there is no theory of financial markets acceptable to both practitioners and theorists. Theorists' efficient market theory, for example, cannot explain bubbles and crashes nor the exceptional returns of famous investors and speculators such as Warren Buffett and George Soros.
