In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the problem. We do so by first defining robustness of a classifier to adversarial exploitation. Next, we show that the problem of adversarial example generation can be posed as learning problem. We also categorize attacks in literature into high and low perturbation attacks; well-known attacks like fast-gradient sign method (FGSM) and our attack produce higher perturbation adversarial examples while the more potent but computationally inefficient Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack is low perturbation.

Bacterial flagellar motor is one of the most complex and sophisticated nano machineries in nature. A duty ratio $D$ is a fraction of time that the stator and the rotor interact and is a fundamental property to characterize the motor but remains to be determined. It is known that the stator units of the motor bind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically to control the motor torque depending on the load on the motor. At low load where the kinetics such as a proton translocation speed limits the rotation rate, the dependency of the rotation rate on the number of stator units $N$ infers $D$; the dependency becomes larger for smaller $D$. Contradicting observations supporting both the small and large $D$ have been reported.

The passage states that cooling and compression can lead to a broad range of jamming packing fractions (\u03c6J), depending on cooling rate and initial configuration. In contrast, shearing disrupts particle clustering and leads to a much narrower range of \u03c6J as the shear strain rate varies.

The research quantifies, for the first time, the attractive forces between membrane-deforming objects.
