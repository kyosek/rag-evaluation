There are a huge number of features which are said to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accuracy.

We show the high performance of this algorithm by applying it on Time Delay Challenge (TDC1) simulated data. We apply then our proposed method on the light curves of the lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 since this system has been well studied by other groups to compare our results with their findings. In this work we propose a new estimator namely \"mirror\" estimator along with a list of criteria for reliability test of estimation. Our mirror estimator results to $-117.1^{+7.1}_{-3.7}$ and $-117.1^{+7.2}_{-8.8}$ using simple Monte Carlo simulations and simulated light curves provided by Rathna Kumar et al. (2013) respectively. Although TDC1 simulations do not reflect the properties of SDSS J1001+5027 light curves, using these simulations results to smaller uncertainty which shows the higher quality observations can lead to substantially more precise time delay estimation.

Such techniques are based on iterative algorithms, and often, cause a high processing time at the physical layer.

Consequently, the obtained channel coefficients can be exploited for deriving near-optimal transmission-schemes prior to the intended service-time, which enables real-time service.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction in the field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy in visual recognition.

With these improvements, many frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs on both CPUs and GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work we present a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized FPGA implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device when necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device, simple-to-use test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer implementations. To validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel environment to implement an FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and show that the FPGA layer can be used alongside other layers running on a host processor to run several popular CNNs (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A, Overfeat).

We propose three properties that are related to the stationary population identity (SPI) of population biology by connecting it with stationary populations and non-stationary populations which are approaching stationarity. One of these important properties is that SPI can be applied to partition a population into stationary and non-stationary components. These properties provide deeper insights into cohort formation in real-world populations and the length of the duration for which stationary and non-stationary conditions hold.
