Global concern regarding ultrafine particles (UFPs), which are particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 100nm, is increasing. These particles-with more serious health effects than PM less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)-are difficult to measure using the current methods because their characteristics are different from those of other air pollutants. Therefore, a new monitoring system is required to obtain accurate UFPs information, which will raise the financial burden of the government and people. In this study, we estimated the economic value of UFPs information by evaluating the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the UFPs monitoring and reporting system. We used the contingent valuation method (CVM) and the one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice (OOHBDC) spike model. We analyzed how the respondents' socio-economic variables, as well as their cognition level of PM, affected their WTP. Therefore, we collected WTP data of 1,040 Korean respondents through an online survey. The estimated mean WTP for building a UFPs monitoring and reporting system is KRW 6,958.55-7,222.55 (USD 6.22-6.45) per household per year.

We discuss a possible answer to the fundamental question of why nature would actually prefer low-scale supersymmetry, but end up with a supersymmetry scale that is not completely natural. This question is inevitable if we postulate that low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null observation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider.

Quality by design in pharmaceutical manufacturing hinges on computational methods and tools that are capable of accurate quantitative prediction of the design space. This paper investigates Bayesian approaches to design space characterization, which determine a feasibility probability that can be used as a measure of reliability and risk by the practitioner. An adaptation of nested sampling---a Monte Carlo technique introduced to compute Bayesian evidence---is presented. The nested sampling algorithm maintains a given set of live points through regions with increasing probability feasibility until reaching a desired reliability level. It furthermore leverages efficient strategies from Bayesian statistics for generating replacement proposals during the search. Features and advantages of this algorithm are demonstrated by means of a simple numerical example and two industrial case studies. It is shown that nested sampling can outperform conventional Monte Carlo sampling and be competitive with flexibility-based optimization techniques in low-dimensional design space problems. Practical aspects of exploiting the sampled design space to reconstruct a feasibility probability map using machine learning techniques are also discussed and illustrated.

In this paper, we propose a human-perception-based pseudo analog video transmission system named ROIC-Cast, which aims to intelligently enhance the transmission quality of the region-of-interest (ROI) parts.

Instead, the first layers of the network can better localize the object of interest but with a reduced recall. Based on this observation we design a method for proposing object locations that is based on CNN features and that combines the best of both worlds. We build an inverse cascade that, going from the final to the initial convolutional layers of the CNN, selects the most promising object locations and refines their boxes in a coarse-to-fine manner. The method is efficient, because i) it uses the same features extracted for detection, ii) it aggregates features using integral images, and iii) it avoids a dense evaluation of the proposals due to the inverse coarse-to-fine cascade. The method is also accurate; it outperforms most of the previously proposed object proposals approaches and when plugged into a CNN-based detector produces state-of-the- art detection performance."}, "answer": "Question: Which of the following best describes the key innovation of the DeepProposal method for object detection?\n\nA) It uses only the final convolutional layers of a CNN for high recall and precise localization.\n\nB) It relies solely on the initial convolutional layers of a CNN for better object localization.\n\nC) It employs an inverse cascade from final to initial CNN layers, combining high recall and refined localization.\n\nD) It utilizes a dense evaluation of all convolutional layers simultaneously for optimal object proposals.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key innovation of the DeepProposal method is its use of an inverse cascade that combines the strengths of different convolutional layers in a CNN. The final layers provide high recall but poor localization, while the initial layers offer better localization but reduced recall. By cascading from the final to the initial layers, the method refines object proposals in a coarse-to-fine manner, achieving both high recall and accurate localization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using only the final layers would result in poor localization. Option B is flawed because using only the initial layers would lead to reduced recall.

One of the important open questions in solar irradiance studies is whether long-term variability (i.e. on timescales of years and beyond) can be reconstructed by means of models that describe short-term variability (i.e. days) using solar proxies as inputs. Preminger and Walton (2005, GRL, 32, 14109) showed that the relationship between spectral solar irradiance and proxies of magnetic-flux emergence, such as the daily sunspot area, can be described in the framework of linear system theory by means of the impulse response.

Our results show that long-term variability cannot be reconstructed from the short-term response of the spectral irradiance, which cautions the extension of solar proxy models to these timescales.
