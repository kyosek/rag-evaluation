The role of phase space occupation effects for the formation of two- and three-particle bound states in a dense medium is investigated within an algebraic approach suitable for systems with short-range interactions. It is shown that for two-fermion bound states due to the account of the exchange symmetry (phase space occupation) effect (Pauli blocking) in a dense medium the binding energy is reduced and vanishes at a critical density (Mott effect). For three-fermion bound states, within a Faddeev equation approach, the intermediate formation of pair correlations leads to the representation as a suitably symmetrized fermion-boson bound state. It is shown that the Bose enhancement of fermion pairs can partially compensate the Pauli blocking between the fermions. This leads to the general result obtained by algebraic methods: three-fermion bound states in a medium with high phase space occupation appear necessarily as Borromean states beyond the Mott density of the two-fermion bound state."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the behavior of three-fermion bound states in a dense medium, as explained in the given passage?\n\nA) Three-fermion bound states always dissociate at the same critical density as two-fermion bound states due to Pauli blocking.\n\nB) Bose enhancement of fermion pairs completely negates the effects of Pauli blocking, allowing three-fermion bound states to exist at all densities.\n\nC) Three-fermion bound states can exist as Borromean states beyond the Mott density of two-fermion bound states, due to partial compensation of Pauli blocking by Bose enhancement of fermion pairs.\n\nD) The binding energy of three-fermion bound states increases linearly with density due to enhanced fermion-boson interactions in the medium.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Selecting skilled mutual funds through the multiple testing framework has received increasing attention from finance researchers and statisticians.

We observe that the standardized OLS estimates of $\\alpha$'s across the funds possess strong dependence and nonnormality structures, indicating that the conventional multiple testing methods are inadequate for selecting the skilled funds.
