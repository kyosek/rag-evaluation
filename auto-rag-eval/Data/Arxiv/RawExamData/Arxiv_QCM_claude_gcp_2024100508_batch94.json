Point-like scatterers randomly distributed throughout the sample serve as local probes of the downstream transmit-beam phase shifts caused by aberrating structures within the sample. Phase shifts are monitored in a differential manner, providing signatures of transverse gradients of the local sample SoS.

This greatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetric interaction terms. We show that these field redefinitions exist and are uniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrix itself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearised theory to be well-defined.

Via this connection, we show that optimal constant-dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over matrices with sufficiently many rows. As such, the two aforementioned problems are equivalent to determining the maximum cardinality of constant-rank codes and to constructing optimal constant-rank codes, respectively. To this end, we then derive bounds on the maximum cardinality of a constant-rank code with a given minimum rank distance, propose explicit constructions of optimal or asymptotically optimal constant-rank codes, and establish asymptotic bounds on the maximum rate of a constant-rank code."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between constant-dimension codes and constant-rank codes, as presented in the research?\n\nA) Constant-dimension codes are a subset of constant-rank codes, making them easier to optimize.\n\nB) Optimal constant-dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over matrices with sufficiently many columns.\n\nC) Optimal constant-dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over matrices with sufficiently many rows.\n\nD) Constant-rank codes and constant-dimension codes are unrelated, but both are important for error control in network coding.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.
