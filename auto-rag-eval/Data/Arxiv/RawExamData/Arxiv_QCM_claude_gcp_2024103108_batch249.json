Robots have potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. One of their largest potentials is in the domain of mobile health where they can be used to facilitate clinical interventions. However, to accomplish this, robots need to have access to our private data in order to learn from these data and improve their interaction capabilities. Furthermore, to enhance this learning process, the knowledge sharing among multiple robot units is the natural step forward. However, to date, there is no well-established framework which allows for such data sharing while preserving the privacy of the users (e.g., the hospital patients). To this end, we introduce RoboChain - the first learning framework for secure, decentralized and computationally efficient data and model sharing among multiple robot units installed at multiple sites (e.g., hospitals). RoboChain builds upon and combines the latest advances in open data access and blockchain technologies, as well as machine learning. We illustrate this framework using the example of a clinical intervention conducted in a private network of hospitals.

Main effects of IGW are following: the maximal value of the flux Richardson number (universal constant 0.2-0.25 in the no-IGW regime) becomes strongly variable. In the vertically homogeneous stratification, it increases with increasing wave energy and can even exceed 1. In the heterogeneous stratification, when IGW propagate towards stronger stratification, the maximal flux Richardson number decreases with increasing wave energy, reaches zero and then becomes negative. In other words, the vertical flux of potential temperature becomes counter-gradient. IGW also reduce anisotropy of turbulence and increase the share of TPE in the turbulent total energy. Depending on the direction (downward or upward), IGW either strengthen or weaken the total vertical flux of momentum.

Low-rank matrix estimation plays a central role in various applications across science and engineering. Recently, nonconvex formulations based on matrix factorization are provably solved by simple gradient descent algorithms with strong computational and statistical guarantees. However, when the low-rank matrices are asymmetric, existing approaches rely on adding a regularization term to balance the scale of the two matrix factors which in practice can be removed safely without hurting the performance when initialized via the spectral method. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification to this for the matrix sensing problem, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix from a small number of linear measurements. As long as the measurement ensemble satisfies the restricted isometry property, gradient descent -- in conjunction with spectral initialization -- converges linearly without the need of explicitly promoting balancedness of the factors; in fact, the factors stay balanced automatically throughout the execution of the algorithm.

Dimensionality reduction techniques have found great success in a wide range of fields requiring analysis of high-dimensional datasets. Time-lagged independent components analysis (TICA), which finds independent components (TICs) with maximal autocorrelation, is often applied to atomistic biomolecular simulations, where the full molecular configuration can be projected onto only a few TICs describing the slowest modes of motion. Recently, Sultan and Pande have proposed the use of TICs as collective variables for enhanced sampling. However, it is unclear what the best strategy for estimating the TICs of a system is a priori. In order to evaluate the utility of TICs calculated on one system to describe the slow dynamics of similar systems, we develop a methodology for measuring the transferability of TICs and apply it to a wide range of systems. We find that transferred TICs can approximate the slowest dynamics of some systems surprisingly well, while failing to transfer between other sets of systems, highlighting the inherent difficulties of predicting TIC transferability.
