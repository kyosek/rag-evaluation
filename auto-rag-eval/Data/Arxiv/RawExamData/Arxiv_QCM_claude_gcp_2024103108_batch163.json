In this paper we study long distance modifications of gravity obtained by considering actions that are singular in the limit of vanishing curvature. In particular, we showed in a previous publication that models that include inverse powers of curvature invariants that diverge for r->0 in the Schwarzschild geometry, recover an acceptable weak field limit at short distances from sources. We study then the linearisation of generic actions of the form L=F[R,P,Q] where P=R_{ab}R^{ab} and Q=R_{abcd}R^{abcd}. We show that for the case in which F[R,P,Q]=F[R,Q-4P], the theory is ghost free. Assuming this is the case, in the models that can explain the acceleration of the Universe without recourse to Dark Energy there is still an extra scalar field in the spectrum besides the massless spin two graviton. The mass of this extra excitation is of the order of the Hubble scale in vacuum. We nevertheless recover Einstein gravity at short distances because the mass of this scalar field depends on the background in such a way that it effectively decouples when one gets close to any source.

However, Boolean models allow variables to take only two values, which can be too simplistic in some cases. The present work proposes a modeling approach derived from Boolean networks where continuous logical operators are used and where edges can be tuned. Using continuous logical operators allows variables to be more finely valued while remaining qualitative. To consider that some biological interactions can be slower or weaker than other ones, edge states are also computed in order to modulate in speed and strength the signal they convey. The proposed formalism is illustrated on a toy network coming from the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway.

Even though some success has been reported with existing algorithms, they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic nature. Moreover, they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise, which are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study, we address these issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding (CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals containing potentially severe artifacts.

The maximization step boils down to a weighted CSC problem, for which we develop a computationally efficient optimization algorithm.

Amongst the available technologies for earthquake research, remote sensing has been commonly used due to its unique features such as fast imaging and wide image-acquisition range.
