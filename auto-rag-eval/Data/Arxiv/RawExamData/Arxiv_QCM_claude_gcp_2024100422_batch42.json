Financial markets are often driven by latent factors which traders cannot observe.

This leads to a large stochastic game with heterogeneous agents. We solve the stochastic game by investigating its mean-field game (MFG) limit, with sub-populations of heterogeneous agents, and, using a convex analysis approach, we show that the solution is characterized by a vector-valued forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE).

In our model, we strived to capture the most important characteristics of both aspects to create agents that employ strategies inspired on those used in real markets, and, at the same time, a more realistic trade mechanism based on a double auction order book. We study the role of the distinct types of trader on the return statistics: specifically, correlation properties (or lack thereof), volatilty clustering, heavy tails, and the degree to which the distribution can be described by a log-normal.

Large-scale regression problems where both the number of variables, $p$, and the number of observations, $n$, may be large and in the order of millions or more, are becoming increasingly more common. Typically the data are sparse: only a fraction of a percent of the entries in the design matrix are non-zero. Nevertheless, often the only computationally feasible approach is to perform dimension reduction to obtain a new design matrix with far fewer columns and then work with this compressed data. $b$-bit min-wise hashing (Li and Konig, 2011) is a promising dimension reduction scheme for sparse matrices which produces a set of random features such that regression on the resulting design matrix approximates a kernel regression with the resemblance kernel. In this work, we derive bounds on the prediction error of such regressions. For both linear and logistic models we show that the average prediction error vanishes asymptotically as long as $q \\|\\beta^*\\|_2^2 /n \\rightarrow 0$, where $q$ is the average number of non-zero entries in each row of the design matrix and $\\beta^*$ is the coefficient of the linear predictor.

While the number of node pairs that share neighbors is potentially enormous, only a relatively small proportion of them have many common neighbors. This motivates finding a weighted sampling approach to preferentially sample these node pairs.
