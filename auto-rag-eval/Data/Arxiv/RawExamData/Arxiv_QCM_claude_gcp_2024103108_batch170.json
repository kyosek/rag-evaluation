Time-independent Hamiltonian flows are viewed as geodesic flows in a curved manifold, so that the onset of chaos hinges on properties of the curvature two-form entering into the Jacobi equation. Attention focuses on ensembles of orbit segments evolved in 2-D potentials, examining how various orbital properties correlate with the mean value and dispersion, <K> and k, of the trace K of the curvature. Unlike most analyses, which have attributed chaos to negative curvature, this work exploits the fact that geodesics can be chaotic even if K is everywhere positive, chaos arising as a parameteric instability triggered by regular variations in K along the orbit. For ensembles of fixed energy, with both regular and chaotic segments, simple patterns connect the values of <K> and k for different segments, both with each other and with the short time Lyapunov exponent X. Often, but not always, there is a near one-to- one correlation between <K> and k, a plot of these quantities approximating a simple curve. X varies smoothly along this curve, chaotic segments located furthest from the regular regions tending systematically to have the largest X's. For regular orbits, <K> and k also vary smoothly with ``distance'' from the chaotic phase space regions, as probed, e.g., by the location of the initial condition on a surface of section.

While shaped APSK can provide significant gains when used with standard off-the-shelf LDPC codes, such as the codes in the DVB-S2 standard, additional non-negligible gains can be achieved by optimizing the LDPC code with respect to the shaped APSK modulation. In this paper, we optimize the degree distributions of the LDPC code used in conjunction with shaped APSK.

In this work we present a theoretical and numerical study of the behaviour of the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a generic coupled-map-lattice in the weak-coupling regime. We explain the observed results by introducing a suitable continuous-time formulation of the tangent dynamics. The first general result is that the deviation of the Lyapunov exponent from the uncoupled-limit limit is function of a single scaling parameter which, in the case of strictly positive multipliers, is the ratio of the coupling strength with the variance of local multipliers. Moreover, we find an approximate analytic expression for the Lyapunov exponent by mapping the problem onto the evolution of a chain of nonlinear Langevin equations, which are eventually reduced to a single stochastic equation. The probability distribution of this dynamical equation provides an excellent description for the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent.
