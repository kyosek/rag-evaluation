N-of-1 trials allow inference between two treatments given to a single individual. Most often, clinical investigators analyze an individual's N-of-1 trial data with usual t-tests or simple nonparametric methods. These simple methods do not account for serial correlation in repeated observations coming from the individual. Existing methods accounting for serial correlation require simulation, multiple N-of-1 trials, or both. Here, we develop t-tests that account for serial correlation in a single individual. The development includes effect size and precision calculations, both of which are useful for study planning. We then evaluate and compare their Type I and II errors and interval estimators to those of usual t-tests analogues via Monte Carlo simulation.
