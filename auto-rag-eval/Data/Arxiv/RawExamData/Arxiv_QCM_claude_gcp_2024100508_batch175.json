Our computational particle physics applications require machines that can support a wide range of granularities, but in general, compute-intensive state-of-the-art projects will require finely grained distributions. Of the different types of machines available for the task, we consider cluster computers. The use of clusters of commodity computers in high performance computing has many advantages including the raw price/performance ratio and the flexibility of machine configuration and upgrade.

The new N-body code GENGA developed at the UZH allows us to perform numerous N-body simulations in parallel on GPUs. With this numerical tool, we can study the stability of orbits of hypothetical planets in the semi-major axis and eccentricity parameter space in high resolution. Massless test particle simulations give good predictions on the extension of the stable region and show that HIP 14180 and HD 37124 do not provide stable orbits in the habitable zone. Based on these simulations, we carry out simulations of 10 Earth mass planets in several systems (HD 11964, HD 47186, HD 147018, HD 163607, HD 168443, HD 187123, HD 190360, HD 217107 and HIP 57274). They provide more exact information about orbits at the location of mean motion resonances and at the edges of the stability zones. Beside the stability of orbits, we study the secular evolution of the planets to constrain probable locations of hypothetical planets.

Coronal supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are observed as dark trails descending towards hot turbulent fan shaped regions.

While several models have been proposed to explain the triggering and the evolution of SADs, none of these scenarios address a systematic consideration of thermal conduction. Thus, we accomplish this task numerically simulating the evolution of SADs within this framework. That is, SADs are conceived as voided (subdense) cavities formed by non-linear waves triggered by downflowing bursty localized reconnection events in a perturbed hot fan. We generate a properly turbulent fan, obtained by a stirring force that permits control of the energy and vorticity input in the medium where SADs develop. We include anisotropic thermal conduction and consider plasma properties consistent with observations. Our aim is to study if it is possible to prevent SADs to vanish by thermal diffusion. We find that this will be the case, depending on the turbulence parameters.

Glacial-interglacial cycles are large variations in continental ice mass and greenhouse gases, which have dominated climate variability over the Quaternary.

In this paper, the dynamics of glacial-interglacial cycles are investigated using a phase oscillator model forced by the time-varying incoming solar radiation (insolation).

The bifurcation analysis indicates that mode-locking is likely to occur for the 41 kyr glacial cycles but not likely for the 100 kyr glacial cycles.

One specification is evolutionarily stable against another if, whenever sufficiently prevalent, its adherents obtain higher average payoffs than their counterparts.

Endogenous belief formation through the learning channel generates novel stability phenomena compared to frameworks where single beliefs are the heritable units of cultural transmission.
