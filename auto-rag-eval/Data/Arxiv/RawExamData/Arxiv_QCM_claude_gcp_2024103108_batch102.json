We present a new method to directly measure the opacity from HI Lyman limit (LL) absorption k_LL along quasar sightlines by the intergalactic medium (IGM). The approach analyzes the average (``stacked'') spectrum of an ensemble of quasars at a common redshift to infer the mean free path (MFP) to ionizing radiation. We apply this technique to 1800 quasars at z=3.50-4.34 drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), giving the most precise measurements on k_LL at any redshift. From z=3.6 to 4.3, the opacity increases steadily as expected and is well parameterized by MFP = (48.4 +/- 2.1) - (38.0 +/- 5.3)*(z-3.6) h^-1 Mpc (proper distance). The relatively high MFP values indicate that the incidence of systems which dominate k_LL evolves less strongly at z>3 than that of the Lya forest. We infer a mean free path three times higher than some previous estimates, a result which has important implications for the photo-ionization rate derived from the emissivity of star forming galaxies and quasars. Finally, our analysis reveals a previously unreported, systematic bias in the SDSS quasar sample related to the survey's color targeting criteria.

In this study, we propose an analytical framework for estimating seed demand with three major steps. First, we will estimate the yield and risk of each variety as if they were planted at each location. Since past experiments performed with different seed varieties are highly unbalanced across varieties, and the combination of growing conditions is sparse, we employ multi-task learning to borrow information from similar varieties. Second, we will determine the best mix of seeds for each location by seeking a tradeoff between yield and risk.

Although the Chinese government has taken numerous policies to mitigate the harmful emissions from road transport sector, it is still uncertain for both policy makers and researchers to know to what extent the policies are effective in the short and long terms. Inspired by the concept and empirical results from current literature on energy rebound effect (ERE), we first propose a new concept of pollution rebound effect (PRE).

It is pointed out that valuation risk can be reduced significantly by implementing a conventional two-step Kalman filter in the recursive FCFF model, thus improving its predictive power. Systematic errors of the Kalman filter, caused by intermediate changes in risk and hence in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), are detected by measuring the residuals.

The three-step adaptive Kalman filter plays a crucial role in improving the recursive FCFF model for business valuation. It combines the conventional two-step Kalman filter with an additional adjustment step to address multiple aspects of the valuation process:\n\n1. It reduces valuation risk significantly, thus improving the model's predictive power.\n2. It detects systematic errors caused by intermediate changes in risk and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by measuring residuals.\n3. It recursively adjusts the WACC to eliminate these systematic errors.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the adaptive Kalman filter addresses both random noise and systematic errors.

The documentation mentions a dynamic correction \u03b7(300 K) = -0.0015(7).\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the residual motion of the ion does yield the largest contribution (2.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078), the total systematic relative uncertainty of the clock is actually 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078, not 2.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Magnetic field generation by charge exchange in a supernova remnant in\n  the early universe", "source": "Shuhei Kashiwamura and Yutaka Ohira", "docs_id": "2106.09968", "section": ["astro-ph.HE"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Magnetic field generation by charge exchange in a supernova remnant in\n  the early universe.
