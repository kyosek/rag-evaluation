Robust heteroclinic networks are invariant sets that can appear as attractors in symmetrically coupled or otherwise constrained dynamical systems.

As these networks are of great interest as dynamical models of biological and cognitive processes, it is useful to understand how particular graphs can be realised as robust heteroclinic networks that are attracting. This paper presents two methods of realizing arbitrarily complex directed graphs as robust heteroclinic networks for flows generated by ODEs---we say the ODEs {\\em realise} the graphs as heteroclinic networks between equilibria that represent the vertices.

In order to study the related issues, we extend established epidemiological spreading models with a model of the measurement (i.e. testing) process, considering the problems of false positives and false negatives as well as biased sampling. Studying a model-generated ground truth in conjunction with simulated observation processes (virtual measurements) allows one to gain insights into the limitations of purely data-driven methods to assess the epidemic situation.

Indeed, considering a mixing of continuous, integer and ordinal variables (thus all having a cumulative distribution function), this copula mixture model defines intra-component dependencies similar to a Gaussian mixture, so with classical correlation meaning. Simultaneously, it preserves standard margins associated to continuous, integer and ordered features, namely the Gaussian, the Poisson and the ordered multinomial distributions.

We observed the nearby oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star IK Tau using the high-resolution HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel.
