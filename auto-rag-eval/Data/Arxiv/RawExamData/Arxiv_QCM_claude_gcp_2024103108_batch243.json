This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices vary in their response to financial disclosures across different topics. Thereby, we specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no a priori categorization of their content exists. For this purpose, we utilize an approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of topic modeling. This technique facilitates our task of automatically categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies. We then evaluate the subsequent stock market reaction. Our empirical evidence suggests a considerable discrepancy among various types of news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets. For instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business strategy, the health sector, as well as mergers and acquisitions.

Resource competition theory predicts coexistence and exclusion patterns based on species R*s, the minimum resource values required for a species to persist. A central assumption of the theory is that all species have equal access to resources. However, many systems are characterized by preemption exploitation, where some species deplete resources before their competitors can access them (e.g., asymmetric light competition, contest competition among animals). We hypothesize that coexistence under preemption requires an R*-preemption tradeoff, i.e., the species with the priority access should have a higher R* (lower efficiency). Thus, we developed an extension of resource competition theory to investigate partial and total preemption (in the latter, the preemptor is unaffected by species with lower preemption rank).

In this work, this problem is studied through the lens of compression which is captured by the low-rank structure of weight matrices. It is first shown that adversarial training tends to promote simultaneously low-rank and sparse structure in the weight matrices of neural networks. This is measured through the notions of effective rank and effective sparsity. In the reverse direction, when the low rank structure is promoted by nuclear norm regularization and combined with sparsity inducing regularizations, neural networks show significantly improved adversarial robustness.

Since many of these devices employ analog components, which cannot be perfectly controlled, finding ways to compensate for the resulting effects represents a key challenge. Here, we discuss three different strategies to address this problem: the addition of auxiliary network components for stabilizing activity, the utilization of inherently robust architectures and a training method for hardware-emulated networks that functions without perfect knowledge of the system's dynamics and parameters. For all three scenarios, we corroborate our theoretical considerations with experimental results on accelerated analog neuromorphic platforms."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following strategies is NOT mentioned in the paper as a way to compensate for the imperfections of analog components in neuromorphic hardware?\n\nA) Adding auxiliary network components for activity stabilization\nB) Utilizing inherently robust architectures\nC) Implementing error-correcting codes in the neural network\nD) Training hardware-emulated networks without perfect knowledge of system dynamics\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests the reader's understanding of the key challenges and strategies discussed in the paper for dealing with analog components in neuromorphic hardware.

Differences in interaural phase configuration between a target and a masker can lead to substantial binaural unmasking. This effect is decreased for masking noises with an interaural time difference (ITD). Adding a second noise with the opposite ITD (double-delayed noise) in most cases further reduces binaural unmasking. Thus far, modeling of these detection thresholds required both a mechanism for internal ITD compensation and an increased binaural bandwidth. An alternative explanation for the reduction is that unmasking is impaired by the lower interaural coherence in off-frequency regions caused by the second masker (Marquardt and McAlpine, 2009, JASA pp. EL177 - EL182). Based on this hypothesis, the current work proposes a quantitative multi-channel model using monaurally derived peripheral filter bandwidths and an across-channel incoherence interference mechanism. This mechanism differs from wider filters since it has no effect when the masker coherence is constant across frequency bands. Combined with a monaural energy discrimination pathway, the model predicts the differences between single- and double-delayed noise, as well as four other data sets.
