Two rays of different wavelengths reaching the plane of the color photographic film determine the stereo representation of an object point.

This shows that the H66{\\alpha} recombination line is not strongly masing as had previously been suggested, although a moderate maser contribution could be present. The He66{\\alpha} recombination line is also detected in our observations; the relative strengths of the two recombination lines yield an ionized helium to ionized hydrogen abundance ratio y+ = 0.12 $\\pm$ 0.02. The ionized helium appears to share the kinematics of the thermally excited ionized hydrogen gas, so the two species are likely to be well mixed.

We use a staggered event study design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. Importantly, we find extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways.
