Data cleaning, whether manual or algorithmic, is rarely perfect leaving a dataset with an unknown number of false positives and false negatives after cleaning. In many scenarios, quantifying the number of remaining errors is challenging because our data integrity rules themselves may be incomplete, or the available gold-standard datasets may be too small to extrapolate. As the use of inherently fallible crowds becomes more prevalent in data cleaning problems, it is important to have estimators to quantify the extent of such errors. We propose novel species estimators to estimate the number of distinct remaining errors in a dataset after it has been cleaned by a set of crowd workers -- essentially, quantifying the utility of hiring additional workers to clean the dataset. This problem requires new estimators that are robust to false positives and false negatives, and we empirically show on three real-world datasets that existing species estimators are unstable for this problem, while our proposed techniques quickly converge."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of data cleaning and quality assessment, what is the primary purpose of the proposed Data Quality Metric (DQM) as described in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) To eliminate all false positives and false negatives in a dataset\nB) To determine the optimal number of crowd workers for data cleaning\nC) To estimate the number of distinct remaining errors in a dataset after crowd-based cleaning\nD) To develop perfect data integrity rules for algorithmic cleaning\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Motivated by the recent photochlorination experiment [B. Li et al., ACS Nano 5, 5957 (2011)], we study theoretically the interaction of chlorine with graphene. In previous theoretical studies, covalent binding between chlorine and carbon atoms has been elusive upon adsorption to the graphene basal plane. Interestingly, in their recent experiment, Li et al. interpreted their data in terms of chemical bonding of chlorine on top of the graphene plane, associated with a change from sp2 to sp3 in carbon hybridization and formation of graphene nanodomains. We study the hypothesis that these domains are actually fractured graphene with chlorinated edges, and compare the energetics of chlorine-containing graphene edge terminations, both in zigzag and armchair directions, to chlorine adsorption onto infinite graphene. Our results indicate that edge chlorination is favored over adsorption in the experimental conditions with radical atomic chlorine and that edge chlorination with sp3-hybridized edge carbons is stable also in ambient conditions. An ab initio thermodynamical analysis shows that the presence of chlorine is able to break the pristine graphene layer. Finally, we discuss the possible effects of the silicon dioxide substrate on the chlorination of graphene."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the theoretical study described, which of the following statements best explains the observed chlorination of graphene in the experiment by Li et al.?\n\nA) Chlorine atoms form covalent bonds directly on top of the graphene basal plane, changing carbon hybridization from sp2 to sp3.\n\nB) Chlorine atoms preferentially bind to graphene edges, causing fracturing of the graphene sheet into nanodomains with chlorinated edges.\n\nC) Chlorine atoms intercalate between graphene layers, causing delamination and formation of nanodomains.\n\nD) Chlorine atoms catalyze the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the creation of new graphene nanodomains.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The theoretical study challenges the initial interpretation of Li et al.'s experimental data, which suggested chlorine bonding on top of the graphene plane (option A). Instead, the study proposes that chlorination occurs preferentially at graphene edges, causing fracturing into nanodomains with chlorinated edges (option B). This hypothesis is supported by energetic calculations showing that edge chlorination is favored over adsorption on infinite graphene under the experimental conditions.

Animal grouping behaviors have been widely studied due to their implications for understanding social intelligence, collective cognition, and potential applications in engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. An important biological aspect of these studies is discerning which selection pressures favor the evolution of grouping behavior. In the past decade, researchers have begun using evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group.

Virtual Compton scattering off the nucleon (VCS) is studied in the regime of low energy of the outgoing real photon. This regime allows one to directly access the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon in a VCS experiment. In the derivation of the low energy theorem for VCS that exists in the literature, the low energy limit taken for virtual initial photons does not match on that for real photons, when one approaches the initial photon's mass shell. While this problem has for a long time been attributed to the non-analyticity of the Compton amplitude with respect to the photon virtuality, I demonstrate that it is merely due to an ill-defined low energy limit for VCS, on one hand, and to a particular way of constructing the VCS amplitude, use in the literature, on the other. I provide a uniform description of low energy Compton scattering with real and virtual photons by defining a Lorentz-covariant operator sub-basis for Compton scattering in that regime, that has six independent structures. Correspondingly, six new generalized polarizabilities are introduced in the Breit frame.

The documentation explicitly states that the discrepancy between low energy limits for virtual and real initial photons is not due to the non-analyticity of the Compton amplitude, as previously thought.

This paper presents a partially parallel low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder designed for the 5G New Radio (NR) standard.

Fine-grained classification tasks such as identifying different breeds of dog are quite challenging as visual differences between categories is quite small and can be easily overwhelmed by external factors such as object pose, lighting, etc. This work focuses on the specific case of classifying rowing teams from various associations. Currently, the photos are taken at rowing competitions and are manually classified by a small set of members, in what is a painstaking process. To alleviate this, Deep learning models can be utilised as a faster method to classify the images. Recent studies show that localising the manually defined parts, and modelling based on these parts, improves on vanilla convolution models, so this work also investigates the detection of clothing attributes.

Several models have predicted that stars could form inside galactic outflows and that this would be a new major mode of galaxy evolution. Observations of galactic outflows have revealed that they host large amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, which provide conditions suitable for star formation. We have investigated the properties of the outflows in a large sample of galaxies by exploiting the integral field spectroscopic data of the large MaNGA-SDSS4 galaxy survey. We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the galactic outflows in our sample. We also show that even if star formation is prominent inside many other galactic outflows, this may have not been revealed as the diagnostics are easily dominated by the presence of even faint AGN and shocks. If very massive outflows typical of distant galaxies and quasars follow the same scaling relations observed locally, then the star formation inside high-z outflows can be up to several 100 Msun/yr and could contribute substantially to the early formation of the spheroidal component of galaxies. Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids.
