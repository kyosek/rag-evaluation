Compared with shallow domain adaptation, recent progress in deep domain adaptation has shown that it can achieve higher predictive performance and stronger capacity to tackle structural data (e.g., image and sequential data).

This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was mainly empirical.

In this work, we introduce a simple, yet accurate order statistical ordinal regression function that predicts relay race places with changeover-times.

Moreover, our key idea is to utilize Fenton-Wilkinson approximations of changeover-times alongside an estimator for the total number of teams as in the notorious German tank problem. This original place regression function is sigmoidal and thus correctly predicts the existence of a small number of elite teams that significantly outperform the rest of the teams.

In this paper, we firstly present an empirical study to show that simply adding cross-domain data does not help performance in conditions with enrollment-test mismatch. Careful analysis shows that this striking result is caused by the incoherent statistics between the enrollment and test conditions. Based on this analysis, we present a decoupled scoring approach that can maximally squeeze the value of cross-domain labels and obtain optimal verification scores when the enrollment and test are mismatched.

In terms of interpolation, the GAN-based medical image augmentation is reliable because medical modalities can display the human body's strong anatomical consistency at fixed position while clearly reflecting inter-subject variability; thus, we propose to use noise-to-image GANs (e.g., random noise samples to diverse pathological images) for (i) medical Data Augmentation (DA) and (ii) physician training.

It is shown that the optimal attractor-dimension estimate grows linearly with the domain area (suggestive of extensive chaos), for a sufficiently large domain, if the kinematic viscosity and the amplitude and length scale of the forcing are held fixed. For sufficiently small domain area, a slightly ``super-extensive'' estimate becomes optimal.
