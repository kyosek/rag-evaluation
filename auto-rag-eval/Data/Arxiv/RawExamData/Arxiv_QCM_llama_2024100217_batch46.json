Acquiring new robot motor skills is cumbersome, as learning a skill from scratch and without prior knowledge requires the exploration of a large space of motor configurations. Accordingly, for learning a new task, time could be saved by restricting the parameter search space by initializing it with the solution of a similar task. We present a framework which is able of such knowledge transfer from already learned movement skills to a new learning task. The framework combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of their effects for skill representation. New skills are first initialized with parameters inferred from related movement primitives and thereafter adapted to the new task through relative entropy policy search. We compare two different transfer approaches to initialize the search space distribution with data of known skills with a similar effect. We show the different benefits of the two knowledge transfer approaches on an object pushing task for a simulated 3-DOF robot.

Recently it has been shown that a large fraction of the dwarf satellite galaxies orbiting the Andromeda galaxy are surprisingly aligned in a thin, extended and kinematically coherent planar structure. The presence of such a structure seems to challenge the current Cold Dark Matter paradigm of structure formation, which predicts a more uniform distribution of satellites around central objects. We show that it is possible to obtain a thin, extended, rotating plane of satellites resembling the one in Andromeda in cosmological collisionless simulations based on the Cold Dark Matter model. Our new high resolution simulations show a correlation between the formation time of the dark matter halo and the thickness of the plane of satellites. Our simulations have a high incidence of satellite planes as thin, extended, and as rich as the one in Andromeda and with a very coherent kinematic structure when we select high concentration/early forming halos. By tracking the formation of the satellites in the plane we show that they have been mainly accreted onto the main object along thin dark matter filaments at high redshift. Our results show that the presence of a thin, extended, rotating plane of satellites is not a challenge for the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, but actually supports one of the predictions of this paradigm related to the presence of filaments of dark matter around galaxies at high redshift."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the main finding of the study on the Andromeda galaxy's thin plane of satellites, and how does it relate to the Cold Dark Matter paradigm of structure formation?\n\nA) The study shows that the thin plane of satellites is a challenge to the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, contradicting its predictions of a more uniform distribution of satellites around central objects.\n\nB) The study demonstrates that the thin plane of satellites is a result of the galaxy's gravitational interactions with the surrounding dark matter halo, rather than a prediction of the Cold Dark Matter paradigm.\n\nC) The study reveals that the formation time of the dark matter halo is correlated with the thickness of the plane of satellites, and that high concentration/early forming halos are more likely to produce thin, extended, and coherent satellite planes.\n\nD) The study shows that the presence of a thin plane of satellites is a prediction of the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, and that it supports the paradigm's prediction of the presence of filaments of dark matter around galaxies at high redshift.\n\nCorrect Answer: D) The study shows that the presence of a thin plane of satellites is a prediction of the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, and that it supports the paradigm's prediction of the presence of filaments of dark matter around galaxies at high redshift.\n\nExplanation: The study's findings suggest that the thin plane of satellites is not a challenge to the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, but rather a prediction of the paradigm's predictions.

Metabolic reactions of single-cell organisms are routinely observed to become dispensable or even incapable of carrying activity under certain circumstances.

The reduced number appears to be constant across the microbial species studied and just slightly larger than the minimum number required for the organism to grow at all.

In Greicius' thesis, he develops necessary and sufficient criteria for determining when this representation is actually surjective and exhibits such an example. However, verifying these criteria turns out to be difficult in practice; Greicius describes tests for them that apply only to semistable elliptic curves over a specific class of cubic number fields. In this paper, we extend Greicius' methods in several directions. First, we consider the analogous problem for elliptic curves with full 2-torsion. Following Greicius, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the associated adelic representation to be maximal and also develop a battery of computationally effective tests that can be used to verify these conditions. We are able to use our tests to construct an infinite family of curves over Q(alpha) with maximal image, where alpha is the real root of x^3 + x + 1.
