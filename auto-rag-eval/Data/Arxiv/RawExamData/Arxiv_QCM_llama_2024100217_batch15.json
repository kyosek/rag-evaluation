These properties produce mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) characterized by the combination of large amplitudes and alternate subthreshold or small amplitude oscillations. Considering the biophysically plausible, Izhikevich neuron model, we demonstrate that various MMOs, including MMBOs (mixed mode bursting oscillations) and synchronized tonic spiking appear in a randomly connected network of neurons, where a fraction of them is in a quiescent (silent) state and the rest in self-oscillatory (firing) states. We show that MMOs and other patterns of neural activity depend on the number of oscillatory neighbors of quiescent nodes and on electrical coupling strengths. Our results are verified by constructing a reduced-order network model and supported by systematic bifurcation diagrams as well as for a small-world network. Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the de-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks.

In the framework of the paradigmatic prisoner's dilemma, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas in the presence of \"cooperation facilitators\". In our model, cooperators and defectors interact as in the classical prisoner's dilemma game, where selection favors defection. However, here the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the fitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that of defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's dilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation takes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing states.

Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate that the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between their density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r.

In this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a bistable interstellar medium is investigated using two-dimensional simulations with a realistic cooling rate, thermal conduction, and physical viscosity. The calculations are performed using periodic boundary conditions without any external dynamical forcing. As the initial condition, a spatially uniform unstable gas under thermal equilibrium is considered. At the initial stage, the unstable gas quickly segregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM). Then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of $0.1-0.2\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}}$ is observed in which the CNM moves around in the WNM. We find that the interfacial medium (IFM) between the CNM and WNM plays an important role in sustaining the turbulence. The self-sustaining mechanism can be divided into two steps. First, thermal conduction drives fast flows streaming into concave CNM surfaces towards the WNM. The kinetic energy of the fast flows in the IFM is incorporated into that of the CNM through the phase transition.

As there may be unexplored links between the behavioral and rational approaches to option pricing, in this paper we revisit Shefrin (2008) option pricing model as an example and suggest one approach to modify this behavioral finance option pricing formula to be consistent with rational dynamic asset pricing theory by introducing arbitrage transaction costs which offset the gains from arbitrage trades."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** According to the Rational Finance Approach to Behavioral Option Pricing, what is the expected outcome when there are heterogeneous views on the instantaneous mean return of the underlying price process, as proposed by Black (1972)?\n\nA) Behavioral finance proponents argue that this will lead to a reduction in option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory.\nB) Behavioral finance proponents argue that this will result in arbitrage opportunities, which will not impact option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory.\nC) Behavioral finance proponents argue that this will lead to a volatility smile, which will not impact option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory.\nD) Behavioral finance proponents argue that this will lead to a reduction in the use of arbitrage transaction costs in option pricing models.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) Behavioral finance proponents argue that this will result in arbitrage opportunities, which will not impact option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the statement in the documentation that \"Behavioral finance proponents argue that such heterogeneous views are likely to occur and this will not impact option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory and will not give rise to volatility smiles.\" This implies that the presence of heterogeneous views on the instantaneous mean return will lead to arbitrage opportunities, which will not affect the option pricing models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Generalized correction to embedded-atom potentials for modeling\n  equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of metals", "source": "Alexey Verkhovtsev, Andrei V.

The polarization of light is utilized in many technologies throughout science and engineering. The ability to transform one state of polarization to another is a key enabling technology. Common polarization transformers are simple polarizers and polarization rotators. Simple polarizers change the intensity depending on the input state and can only output a fixed polarized state, while polarization rotators rotates the input Stokes vector in the 3D Stokes space. We experimentally demonstrate an all-optical input-agnostic polarization transformer (AI-APT), which transforms all input states of polarization to a particular state that can be polarized or partially polarized. The output state of polarization and intensity depends solely on setup parameters, and not on the input state, thereby the AI-APT functions differently from simple polarizers and polarization rotators. The AI-APT is completely passive, and thus can be used as a polarization controller or stabilizer for single photons and ultrafast pulses. To achieve this, we, for the first time, experimentally realize complete kinematic state controllability of an open single-qubit by Kraus maps put forth in [Wu et al. J. Phys. A 40, 5681 (2007)].

Researches have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks, where adversarial images are created to trick a network into misclassification even if the images may give rise to totally different labels by human eyes.
