Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular dimension reduction technique for vector data.

However, FPCA is based on the Gaussian assumption and thereby susceptible to outliers. Although the multivariate $t$ distribution as a robust modeling tool for vector data has a very long history, its application to matrix data is very limited. The main reason is that the dimension of the vectorized matrix data is often very high and the higher the dimension, the lower the breakdown point that measures the robustness.

Many complex networks are known to exhibit sudden transitions between alternative steady states with contrasting properties.

Although the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics in some nodes may advance or delay sudden transitions in networks and give early warning signals of an impending collapse, it has not been studied much in the context of network resilience. Here we bridge this gap by studying a neuronal network model with diverse topologies, in which non-equilibrium dynamics may appear in the network even before the transition to a resting state from an active state in response to environmental stress deteriorating their external conditions.
