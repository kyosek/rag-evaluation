Given an allocation, groups of agents who would prefer an alternative allocation might challenge it. An assignment is popular if it is not challenged by another one. By assuming that agents' ability to challenge allocations can be represented by weighted votes, we characterize the conditions under which popular allocations might exist and when these can be implemented via strategy-proof mechanisms. Serial dictatorships that use orderings consistent with the agents' weights are not only strategy-proof and Pareto efficient, but also popular, whenever these assignments exist. We also provide a new characterization for serial dictatorships as the only mechanisms that are popular, strategy-proof, non-wasteful, and satisfy a consistency condition."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between serial dictatorships and popular allocations in the context of strategy-proof mechanisms for indivisible object allocation?\n\nA) Serial dictatorships are always popular, regardless of the agents' weights.\n\nB) Serial dictatorships that use orderings consistent with agents' weights are popular only when popular assignments do not exist.\n\nC) Serial dictatorships that use orderings consistent with agents' weights are popular, strategy-proof, and Pareto efficient, whenever popular assignments exist.\n\nD) Serial dictatorships are the only mechanisms that are popular and strategy-proof, but they may be wasteful and inconsistent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that \"Serial dictatorships that use orderings consistent with the agents' weights are not only strategy-proof and Pareto efficient, but also popular, whenever these assignments exist.\" This directly corresponds to option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the popularity of serial dictatorships depends on their consistency with agents' weights and the existence of popular assignments.\n\nOption B is the opposite of what the documentation suggests. Serial dictatorships are popular when popular assignments exist, not when they don't exist.\n\nOption D is partially correct but misses key points.

Hard-magnetic soft active materials (hmSAMs) have attracted a great amount of research interests due to their fast-transforming, untethered control, as well as excellent programmability. However, the current direct-ink-write (DIW) printing-based fabrication of hmSAM parts and structures only permits programmable magnetic direction with a constant magnetic density. Also, the existing designs rely on the brute-force approach to generate the assignment of magnetization direction distribution, which can only produce intuitional deformations. These two factors greatly limit the design space and the application potentials of hmSAMs. In this work, we introduce a voxel-encoding DIW printing method to program both the magnetic density and direction distributions during the hmSAM printing. The voxel-encoding DIW printing is then integrated with an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based design strategy to achieve the desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry variations and curvature distributions. With the new EA-guided voxel-encoding DIW printing technique, we demonstrate the functional hmSAMs that produce complicated shape morphing with desired curvature distributions for advanced applications such as biomimetic motions.
