Aids starts, like most diseases, in a peak of virus expression (2,3), which is practically wiped out by the immune system. However it then remains in the body at a low level of expression until later (some time years later) when there is an outbreak of the disease which terminally cripples the immune system causing death from various common pathogens. In this paper we show, using a microscopic simulation, that the time course of AIDS is determined by the interactions of the virus and the immune cells in the shape space of antigens and that it is the virus's ability to move more rapidly in this space (it's high mutability) that causes the time course and eventual 'victory' of the disease.

In monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, the light helicity ($\\sigma^+$ or $\\sigma^-$) is locked to the valley degree of freedom, leading to the possibility of optical initialization of distinct valley populations. However, an extremely rapid valley pseudospin relaxation (at the time scale of picoseconds) occurring for optically bright (electric-dipole active) excitons imposes some limitations on the development of opto-valleytronics. Here we show that inter-valley scattering of excitons can be significantly suppressed in a $\\mathrm{WSe}_2$ monolayer, a direct-gap two-dimensional semiconductor with the exciton ground state being optically dark. We demonstrate that the already inefficient relaxation of the exciton pseudospin in such system can be suppressed even further by the application of a tiny magnetic field of $\\sim$100 mT. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the pseudospin dynamics to be a two-step relaxation process. An initial decay of the pseudospin occurs at the level of dark excitons on a time scale of 100 ps, which is tunable with a magnetic field. This decay is followed by even longer decay ($>1$ ns), once the dark excitons form more complex objects allowing for their radiative recombination.

As the second wave in India mitigates, COVID-19 has now infected about 29 million patients countrywide, leading to more than 350 thousand people dead. As the infections surged, the strain on the medical infrastructure in the country became apparent. While the country vaccinates its population, opening up the economy may lead to an increase in infection rates. In this scenario, it is essential to effectively utilize the limited hospital resources by an informed patient triaging system based on clinical parameters. Here, we present two interpretable machine learning models predicting the clinical outcomes, severity, and mortality, of the patients based on routine non-invasive surveillance of blood parameters from one of the largest cohorts of Indian patients at the day of admission. Patient severity and mortality prediction models achieved 86.3% and 88.06% accuracy, respectively, with an AUC-ROC of 0.91 and 0.92.

Precise gap structure in LiFeAs (Tc = 18 K) given by ARPES studies offers us significant information to understand the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors. The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs gap structure would be that \"the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z point\".

In this paper, we study the gap structure in LiFeAs by taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, motivated by the recent ARPES studies that revealed the significant SOI-induced modification of the Fermi surface topology. For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models with finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES groups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with finite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin fluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main characteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in the presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy) orbitals.

Tracking is equally difficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion estimation.

Recent progress in synthetic lattice systems has opened the door to novel explorations of topological matter. In particular, photonic devices and ultracold matter waves offer the unique possibility of studying the rich interplay between topological band structures and tunable nonlinearities. In this emerging field of nonlinear topological physics, a recent experiment revealed the quantized motion of localized nonlinear excitations (solitons) upon driving a Thouless pump sequence; the reported observations suggest that the quantized displacement of solitons is dictated by the Chern number of the band from which they emanate. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this intriguing nonlinear topological effect, by showing that the motion of solitons is established by the quantized displacement of Wannier functions. Our general theoretical approach, which fully clarifies the central role of the Chern number in solitonic pumps, provides a rigorous framework for describing the topological transport of nonlinear excitations in a broad class of physical systems.
