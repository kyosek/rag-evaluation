Dansgaard-Oeschger events are a prominent mode of variability in the records of the last glacial cycle. Various prototype models have been proposed to explain these rapid climate fluctuations, and no agreement has emerged on which may be the more correct for describing the paleoclimatic signal. In this work, we assess the bimodality of the system reconstructing the topology of the multi--dimensional attractor over which the climate system evolves. We use high-resolution ice core isotope data to investigate the statistical properties of the climate fluctuations in the period before the onset of the abrupt change. We show that Dansgaard-Oeschger events have weak early warning signals if the ensemble of events is considered. We find that the statistics are consistent with the switches between two different climate equilibrium states in response to a changing external forcing (e.g. solar, ice sheets...), either forcing directly the transition or pacing it through stochastic resonance. These findings are most consistent with a model that associates Dansgaard-Oeschger with changing boundary conditions, and with the presence of a bifurcation point."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the findings of the study on Dansgaard-Oeschger events as presented in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) Dansgaard-Oeschger events show strong early warning signals when considering individual events, suggesting a predictable pattern of occurrence.\n\nB) The study concludes that Dansgaard-Oeschger events are primarily caused by internal climate system dynamics, independent of external forcing.\n\nC) The statistical properties of climate fluctuations before Dansgaard-Oeschger events support a model of random transitions between multiple equilibrium states.\n\nD) The results indicate that Dansgaard-Oeschger events likely represent switches between two climate equilibrium states, influenced by changing external forcing and potentially involving a bifurcation point.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the key findings presented in the documentation. The study shows that Dansgaard-Oeschger events have weak early warning signals when considered as an ensemble, which contradicts option A. The results support a model where transitions occur between two different climate equilibrium states in response to changing external forcing (such as solar activity or ice sheet dynamics), rather than being solely driven by internal dynamics, which eliminates option B. The mention of \"switches between two different climate equilibrium states\" and the influence of \"changing external forcing\" directly aligns with the document's conclusions. Additionally, the reference to a potential bifurcation point is consistent with the study's findings. Option C is incorrect because it suggests random transitions between multiple states, whereas the study specifically mentions two states and the influence of external forcing, which implies a more structured system than purely random transitions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Network Slicing: Scalable Coexistence\n  of eMBB and URLLC", "source": "Eduardo Noboro Tominaga, Hirley Alves, Richard Demo Souza, Jo\\~ao Luiz\n  Rebelatto and Matti Latva-Aho", "docs_id": "2101.04605", "section": ["eess.SP"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Network Slicing: Scalable Coexistence\n  of eMBB and URLLC. The 5G systems will feature three generic services: enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). The diverse requirements of these services in terms of data-rates, number of connected devices, latency and reliability can lead to a sub-optimal use of the 5G network, thus network slicing is proposed as a solution that creates customized slices of the network specifically designed to meet the requirements of each service. Under the network slicing, the radio resources can be shared in orthogonal and non-orthogonal schemes. Motivated by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios where a large number of sensors may require connectivity with stringent requirements of latency and reliability, we propose the use of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to improve the number of URLLC users that are connected in the uplink to the same base station (BS), for both orthogonal and non-orthogonal network slicing with eMBB users. The multiple URLLC users transmit simultaneously and across multiple frequency channels. We set the reliability requirements for the two services and analyze their pair of sum rates.

By contrast, the proposed local mechanisms are multiscale interactions between cortical columns via short-ranged non-myelinated fibers.

Specifically, we leverage a parsimonious graphical representation that characterizes structural relationships over variables in the RL system. Such graphical representations provide a compact way to encode what and where the changes across domains are, and furthermore inform us with a minimal set of changes that one has to consider for the purpose of policy adaptation.

The quality of robot vision greatly affects the performance of automation systems, where occlusions stand as one of the biggest challenges. If the target is occluded from the sensor, detecting and grasping such objects become very challenging. For example, when multiple robot arms cooperate in a single workplace, occlusions will be created under the robot arm itself and hide objects underneath. While occlusions can be greatly reduced by installing multiple sensors, the increase in sensor costs cannot be ignored. Moreover, the sensor placements must be rearranged every time the robot operation routine and layout change. To diminish occlusions, we propose the first robot vision system with tilt-type mirror reflection sensing. By instantly tilting the sensor itself, we obtain two sensing results with different views: conventional direct line-of-sight sensing and non-line-of-sight sensing via mirror reflections. Our proposed system removes occlusions adaptively by detecting the occlusions in the scene and dynamically configuring the sensor tilt angle to sense the detected occluded area. Thus, sensor rearrangements are not required even after changes in robot operation or layout.

Filtering out unrealistic images from trained generative adversarial networks (GANs) has attracted considerable attention recently. Two density ratio based subsampling methods---Discriminator Rejection Sampling (DRS) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN)---were recently proposed, and their effectiveness in improving GANs was demonstrated on multiple datasets. However, DRS and MH-GAN are based on discriminator based density ratio estimation (DRE) methods, so they may not work well if the discriminator in the trained GAN is far from optimal. Moreover, they do not apply to some GANs (e.g., MMD-GAN). In this paper, we propose a novel Softplus (SP) loss for DRE. Based on it, we develop a sample-based DRE method in a feature space learned by a specially designed and pre-trained ResNet-34 (DRE-F-SP). We derive the rate of convergence of a density ratio model trained under the SP loss.
