The ST-based DSLF reconstruction typically relies on an iterative thresholding algorithm for Epipolar-Plane Image (EPI) sparse regularization in shearlet domain, involving dozens of transformations between image domain and shearlet domain, which are in general time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, a novel learning-based ST approach, referred to as Deep Residual Shearlet Transform (DRST), is proposed in this paper. Specifically, for an input sparsely-sampled EPI, DRST employs a deep fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the residuals of the shearlet coefficients in shearlet domain in order to reconstruct a densely-sampled EPI in image domain. The DRST network is trained on synthetic Sparsely-Sampled Light Field (SSLF) data only by leveraging elaborately-designed masks. Experimental results on three challenging real-world light field evaluation datasets with varying moderate disparity ranges (8 - 16 pixels) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed learning-based DRST approach over the non-learning-based ST method for DSLF reconstruction. Moreover, DRST provides a 2.4x speedup over ST, at least."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantage of the Deep Residual Shearlet Transform (DRST) approach for Densely-Sampled Light Field (DSLF) reconstruction?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for Epipolar-Plane Image (EPI) processing entirely, relying solely on raw light field data.\n\nB) It uses a deep fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict shearlet coefficient residuals in the shearlet domain, reducing computational time while maintaining reconstruction quality.\n\nC) It introduces a new non-iterative thresholding algorithm that outperforms traditional Shearlet Transform (ST) methods in terms of accuracy.\n\nD) It employs a hybrid approach combining both learning-based and non-learning-based ST methods to achieve optimal results.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the key innovation of DRST is its use of a deep fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the residuals of shearlet coefficients in the shearlet domain.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but their excessive computation results in long inference time.

Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in each layer for pruning. The limitations of these algorithms reduce the level of achievable sparsity. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint.

When we encounter a new person or place, we may easily encode it into our memories, or we may quickly forget it. Recent work finds that this likelihood of encoding a given entity - memorability - is highly consistent across viewers and intrinsic to an image; people tend to remember and forget the same images. However, several forces influence our memories beyond the memorability of the stimulus itself - for example, how attention-grabbing the stimulus is, how much attentional resources we dedicate to the task, or how primed we are for that stimulus. How does memorability interact with these various phenomena, and could any of them explain the effects of memorability found in prior work? This study uses five psychophysical experiments to explore the link between memorability and three attention-related phenomena: 1) bottom-up attention (through testing spatial cueing and visual search), 2) top-down attention (through testing cognitive control and depth of encoding), and 3) priming. These experiments find that memorability remains resilient to all of these phenomena - none are able to explain memorability effects or overcome the strong effects memorability has on determining memory performance.

The hybrid device optical responses, such as electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) and group delay, can be modulated in several ways.

For large portfolios, the number of available market returns is often of similar order to the number of assets, so that the sample covariance matrix performs poorly as a covariance estimator. Additionally, financial market data often contain outliers which, if not correctly handled, may further corrupt the covariance estimation. We address these shortcomings by studying the performance of a hybrid covariance matrix estimator based on Tyler's robust M-estimator and on Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator while assuming samples with heavy-tailed distribution. Employing recent results from random matrix theory, we develop a consistent estimator of (a scaled version of) the realized portfolio risk, which is minimized by optimizing online the shrinkage intensity.

Matrix factorization is a key component of collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems because it allows us to complete sparse user-by-item ratings matrices under a low-rank assumption that encodes the belief that similar users give similar ratings and that similar items garner similar ratings. This paradigm has had immeasurable practical success, but it is not the complete story for understanding and inferring the preferences of people. First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social connections.
