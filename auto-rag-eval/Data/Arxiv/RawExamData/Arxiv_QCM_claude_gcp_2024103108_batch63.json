Optical imaging of TMDs using photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy can reveal the effects of structure, strain, doping, defects, edge states, grain boundaries and surface functionalization.

I show that this expectation is realized for periods small compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~ 1.

Moreover, the deterioration is much less graceful. This qualitative difference carries over to the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored in the presence of a distant companion that generates an approximately uniform acceleration. The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors.

The document states that off-specular PNR with spin polarization showed the development of magnetic inhomogeneities (increase in magnetic roughness) in the central part of each Gd layer. These magnetic roughnesses are vertically correlated and result in a Bragg sheet in the spin-flip channel of off-specular PNR data, which contributes to the antisymmetric magnetoresistance at TComp. Additionally, the twisted helical magnetic structure with planar 2\u03c0 domain walls is observed below TComp, which complements the magnetic roughness in creating the unique magnetoresistance behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while planar 2\u03c0 domain walls are observed, they are more related to the positive exchange bias rather than directly causing the antisymmetric magnetoresistance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because positive exchange bias is a result of the planar 2\u03c0 domain walls, not a direct cause of the antisymmetric magnetoresistance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the question asks about antisymmetric magnetoresistance, which is related to the off-specular PNR data, not the specular reflectivity.

Unmeasured or latent variables are often the cause of correlations between multivariate measurements and are studied in a variety of fields such as psychology, ecology, and medicine. For Gaussian measurements, there are classical tools such as factor analysis or principal component analysis with a well-established theory and fast algorithms. Generalized Linear Latent Variable models (GLLVM) generalize such factor models to non-Gaussian responses. However, current algorithms for estimating model parameters in GLLVMs require intensive computation and do not scale to large datasets with thousands of observational units or responses. In this article, we propose a new approach for fitting GLLVMs to such high-volume, high-dimensional datasets. We approximate the likelihood using penalized quasi-likelihood and use a Newton method and Fisher scoring to learn the model parameters. Our method greatly reduces the computation time and can be easily parallelized, enabling factorization at unprecedented scale using commodity hardware. We illustrate application of our method on a dataset of 48,000 observational units with over 2,000 observed species in each unit, finding that most of the variability can be explained with a handful of factors."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing a large ecological dataset with 50,000 observational units, each containing measurements of 2,500 species.

The SRPA method, as described in the text, offers significant computational advantages by avoiding the diagonalization of high-rank RPA matrices through the factorization of the residual interaction. This is particularly crucial for systems with large configuration spaces, such as deformed nuclei. Additionally, the method self-consistently incorporates both time-even and time-odd Skyrme terms, as well as the Coulomb force and pairing effects. This comprehensive approach makes it well-suited for describing giant resonances in axially symmetric deformed nuclei, as demonstrated by its application to nuclei like $^{154}$Sm, $^{238}$U, and $^{254}$No."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "On the Double Descent of Random Features Models Trained with SGD", "source": "Fanghui Liu, Johan A.K.
