Although the combination of the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology can make communication systems perform better in high-mobility scenarios, there are still many challenges in downlink channel estimation owing to inaccurate modeling and high pilot overhead in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for downlink massive MIMO-OTFS in presence of the fractional Doppler, including deterministic pilot design and channel estimation algorithm. First, we analyze the input-output relationship of the single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modem and extend it to massive MIMO-OTFS. Moreover, we formulate an accurate model for the practical system in which the fractional Doppler is considered and the influence of subpaths is revealed. A deterministic pilot design is then proposed based on the model and the structure of the pilot matrix to reduce pilot overhead and save memory consumption. Since channel geometry changes very slowly relative to the communication timescale, we put forward a modified sensing matrix based channel estimation (MSMCE) algorithm to acquire the downlink CSI.

In his interviews with Eckermann in the 1820s, Goethe referred to his Theory of Colors as his greatest and ultimate achievement.

Even Hermann von Helmholtz, who in part modeled his scientific work after Goethe's, initially thought that Goethe's poetic genius prevented him from understanding physical science.

Multi-view time series classification (MVTSC) aims to improve the performance by fusing the distinctive temporal information from multiple views. Existing methods mainly focus on fusing multi-view information at an early stage, e.g., by learning a common feature subspace among multiple views. However, these early fusion methods may not fully exploit the unique temporal patterns of each view in complicated time series. Moreover, the label correlations of multiple views, which are critical to boost-ing, are usually under-explored for the MVTSC problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Correlative Channel-Aware Fusion (C2AF) network. First, C2AF extracts comprehensive and robust temporal patterns by a two-stream structured encoder for each view, and captures the intra-view and inter-view label correlations with a graph-based correlation matrix. Second, a channel-aware learnable fusion mechanism is implemented through convolutional neural networks to further explore the global correlative patterns.

We also introduce a new task-driven training strategy to robustly guide the high-level task model suitable for both high-quality restoration of images and highly accurate perception.

Existing universal style transfer methods successfully deliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a photo-realistic way.

Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization are established according to a predefined target domain.

In a certain class of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the black holes and the neutron stars can undergo spontaneous scalarization -- a strong gravity phase transition triggered by a tachyonic instability due to the nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the spacetime curvature. Studies of this phenomenon have, so far, been restricted mainly to the study of the tachyonic instability and stationary scalarized black holes and neutron stars. To date, no realistic physical mechanism for the formation of isolated scalarized black holes and neutron stars has been proposed. We study, for the first time, the spherically symmetric fully nonlinear stellar core collapse to a black hole and a neutron star in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories allowing for a spontaneous scalarization. We show that the core collapse can produce scalarized black holes and scalarized neutron stars starting with a nonscalarized progenitor star. The possible paths to reach the end (non)scalarized state are quite rich leading to interesting possibilities for observational manifestations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, which of the following statements accurately describes the process of spontaneous scalarization during stellar core collapse?\n\nA) Spontaneous scalarization occurs uniformly across all types of stellar collapse, regardless of the initial conditions of the progenitor star.\n\nB) The formation of scalarized black holes and neutron stars is impossible through stellar core collapse, as the process always results in non-scalarized end states.\n\nC) Spontaneous scalarization is a strong gravity phase transition triggered by a tachyonic instability, which can lead to the formation of scalarized black holes and neutron stars from non-scalarized progenitor stars.\n\nD) The end state of stellar core collapse in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories is predetermined by the initial scalar field configuration of the progenitor star.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The reduced dimensional controls are used interchangeably at fine and coarse scales to accumulate the optimization progress and mitigate side effects at both scales. Flexibility is achieved through the proposed procedure for calibrating certain parameters to enhance the performance of the optimization algorithm. Reduced size of control spaces supplied with adjoint-based gradients obtained at both scales facilitate the application of this algorithm to models of higher complexity and also to a broad range of problems in biomedical sciences. This technique is shown to outperform regular gradient-based methods applied to fine scale only in terms of both qualities of binary images and computing time. Performance of the complete computational framework is tested in applications to 2D inverse problems of cancer detection by the electrical impedance tomography (EIT).

Attempts to curb illegal activity by enforcing regulations gets complicated when agents react to the new regulatory regime in unanticipated ways to circumvent enforcement. We present a research strategy that uncovers such reactions, and permits program evaluation net of such adaptive behaviors. Our interventions were designed to reduce over-fishing of the critically endangered Pacific hake by either (a) monitoring and penalizing vendors that sell illegal fish or (b) discouraging consumers from purchasing using an information campaign. Vendors attempt to circumvent the ban through hidden sales and other means, which we track using mystery shoppers. Instituting random monitoring visits are much more effective in reducing true hake availability by limiting such cheating, compared to visits that occur on a predictable schedule. Monitoring at higher frequency (designed to limit temporal displacement of illegal sales) backfires, because targeted agents learn faster, and cheat more effectively. Sophisticated policy design is therefore crucial for determining the sustained, longer-term effects of enforcement. Data collected from fishermen, vendors, and consumers allow us to document the upstream, downstream, spillover, and equilibrium effects of enforcement on the entire supply chain. The consumer information campaign generates two-thirds of the gains compared to random monitoring, but is simpler for the government to implement and almost as cost-effective."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A government agency implements a program to reduce over-fishing of the critically endangered Pacific hake.

To understand the behavior of large dynamical systems like transportation networks, one must often rely on measurements transmitted by a set of sensors, for instance individual vehicles. Such measurements are likely to be incomplete and imprecise, which makes it hard to recover the underlying signal of interest.Hoping to quantify this phenomenon, we study the properties of a partially-observed state-space model. In our setting, the latent state $X$ follows a high-dimensional Vector AutoRegressive process $X_t = \\theta X_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t$.
