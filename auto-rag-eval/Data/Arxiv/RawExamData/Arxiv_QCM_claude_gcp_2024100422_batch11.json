Discrete Fourier transforms~(DFTs) over finite fields have widespread applications in digital communication and storage systems. Hence, reducing the computational complexities of DFTs is of great significance. Recently proposed cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due to their low multiplicative complexities. Unfortunately, there are two issues with CFFTs: (1) they rely on efficient short cyclic convolution algorithms, which has not been investigated thoroughly yet, and (2) they have very high additive complexities when directly implemented. In this paper, we address both issues. One of the main contributions of this paper is efficient bilinear 11-point cyclic convolution algorithms, which allow us to construct CFFTs over GF$(2^{11})$. The other main contribution of this paper is that we propose composite cyclotomic Fourier transforms (CCFTs). In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier transforms, our CCFTs achieve lower overall complexities for moderate to long lengths, and the improvement significantly increases as the length grows. Our 2047-point and 4095-point CCFTs are also first efficient DFTs of such lengths to the best of our knowledge. Finally, our CCFTs are also advantageous for hardware implementations due to their regular and modular structure."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the main contributions and advantages of Composite Cyclotomic Fourier Transforms (CCFTs) as presented in the paper?\n\nA) CCFTs primarily focus on reducing multiplicative complexities of DFTs over finite fields, with no significant impact on additive complexities.\n\nB) CCFTs introduce efficient 11-point cyclic convolution algorithms and achieve lower overall complexities for short-length transforms compared to previous FFTs.\n\nC) CCFTs address the high additive complexities of CFFTs, provide efficient bilinear 11-point cyclic convolution algorithms, and offer lower overall complexities for moderate to long length transforms with a regular and modular structure beneficial for hardware implementation.\n\nD) CCFTs are mainly advantageous for software implementations due to their irregular structure and are most efficient for short-length transforms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately summarizes the main contributions and advantages of CCFTs as described in the paper.

However, the results obtained from such an approach cannot be applied for design purpose. Alternatively, in this paper, the subharmonic oscillations in voltage mode controlled DC-DC buck converters are predicted by using a formal symbolic approach. This approach is based on expressing the subharmonic oscillation conditions in the frequency domain and then converting the results to generalized hypergeometric functions. The obtained expressions depend explicitly on the system parameters and the operating duty cycle making the results directly applicable for design purpose. Under certain practical conditions concerning these parameters, the hypergeometric functions can be approximated by polylogarithm and standard functions.

In many observational studies in social science and medical applications, subjects or individuals are connected, and one unit's treatment and attributes may affect another unit's treatment and outcome, violating the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) and resulting in interference. To enable feasible inference, many previous works assume the ``exchangeability'' of interfering units, under which the effect of interference is captured by the number or ratio of treated neighbors. However, in many applications with distinctive units, interference is heterogeneous. In this paper, we focus on the partial interference setting, and restrict units to be exchangeable conditional on observable characteristics.

In this article, we present the findings of our empirical evaluation on the APIs.guru directory and identify several schema translation challenges.

Here we address both these problems by demonstrating how random recurrent networks (RRN) that initially exhibit chaotic dynamics can be tuned through a supervised learning rule to generate locally stable neural patterns of activity that are both complex and robust to noise.

This forms the basis for the task-space adaptive control scheme that is robust against model parameter uncertainties and unknown input disturbances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the research does not simplify the model but rather makes it more accurate by eliminating simplifying assumptions.\n\nOption B is partially correct in mentioning robustness against disturbances, but it's incomplete and incorrect in stating that it's a joint-space control scheme and only robust against external disturbances. The presented controller is a task-space adaptive control scheme and is robust against both model parameter uncertainties and unknown input disturbances.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the control strategy is specifically developed for soft continuum manipulators, not adapted from rigid robot control strategies."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Pseudogap formation above the superconducting dome in iron-pnictides", "source": "T.

The nature of the pseudogap in high transition temperature (high-Tc) superconducting cuprates has been a major issue in condensed matter physics. It is still unclear whether the high-Tc superconductivity can be universally associated with the pseudogap formation. Here we provide direct evidence of the existence of the pseudogap phase via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in another family of high-Tc superconductor, iron-pnictides. Our results reveal a composition dependent pseudogap formation in the multi-band electronic structure of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2. The pseudogap develops well above the magnetostructural transition for low x, persists above the nonmagnetic superconducting dome for optimal x and is destroyed for x ~ 0.6, thus showing a notable similarity with cuprates. In addition, the pseudogap formation is accompanied by inequivalent energy shifts in xz/yz orbitals of iron atoms, indicative of a peculiar iron orbital ordering which breaks the four-fold rotational symmetry."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2, as observed in the study?\n\nA) The pseudogap only appears below the superconducting transition temperature and is confined to the superconducting dome.\n\nB) The pseudogap forms at temperatures well above the magnetostructural transition for low x compositions and persists above the nonmagnetic superconducting dome for optimal x.\n\nC) The pseudogap is present uniformly across all compositions (x values) of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 and is independent of the superconducting properties.\n\nD) The pseudogap exclusively forms within the superconducting dome and disappears immediately outside it for all compositions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the study directly states that \"The pseudogap develops well above the magnetostructural transition for low x, persists above the nonmagnetic superconducting dome for optimal x\". This indicates that the pseudogap formation occurs at temperatures higher than both the magnetostructural transition and the superconducting transition, and its behavior varies with composition. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the pseudogap forms above, not below, the superconducting transition temperature. \n\nAnswer C is wrong because the study shows that the pseudogap behavior is composition-dependent and is \"destroyed for x ~ 0.6\", so it's not present uniformly across all compositions. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the pseudogap exists outside and above the superconducting dome, not exclusively within it."}}
