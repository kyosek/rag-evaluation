Understanding mixing and transport of passive scalars in active fluids is important to many natural (e.g. algal blooms) and industrial (e.g. biofuel, vaccine production) processes. Here, we study the mixing of a passive scalar (dye) in dilute suspensions of swimming Escherichia coli in experiments using a two-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results show that the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce overall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured velocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and lowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be attributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high stretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye concentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales is also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average size and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity seems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability distribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a vanishing skewness.

Such commitments are possible only with practically CO2-free power generation based on variable renewable technologies. Historically, the main point of criticism regarding renewable power is the variability driven by weather dependence. Power-to-X systems, which convert excess power to other stores of energy for later use, can play an important role in offsetting the variability of renewable power production.
