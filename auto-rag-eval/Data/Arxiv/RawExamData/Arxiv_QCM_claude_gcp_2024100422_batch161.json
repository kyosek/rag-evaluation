Although the adverse effects of using power electronic conversion on the insulation systems used in different apparatuses have been investigated, they are limited to low slew rates and repetitions. These results cannot be used for next-generation wide bandgap (WBG) based conversion systems targeted to be fast (with a slew rate up to 100 kV/us) and operate at a high switching frequency up to 500 kHz. Frequency and slew rate are two of the most important factors of a voltage pulse, influencing the level of degradation of the insulation systems that are exposed to such voltage pulses. The paper reviews challenges concerning insulation degradation when benefitting from WBG-based conversion systems with the mentioned slew rate and switching frequency values and identifies technical gaps and future research needs.

However, at the cost of such noise robustness, the performance may degrade when such spurious observations are absent. Therefore, any inference engine should not only be robust to noise outlier, but also be adaptive to potentially unknown and time varying noise parameters; yet it should be scalable and easy to implement. To address them, we envisage here a new noise adaptive Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF), by leveraging a hierarchically Gaussian model as a proxy for any non-Gaussian (process or measurement) noise density. This leads to a conditionally linear Gaussian model (CLGM), that is tractable. However, this framework requires a valid transition kernel for the intractable state, targeted by the particle filter (PF). This is typically unknown.

In diverse biological applications, particle tracking of passive microscopic species has become the experimental measurement of choice -- when either the materials are of limited volume, or so soft as to deform uncontrollably when manipulated by traditional instruments. In a wide range of particle tracking experiments, a ubiquitous finding is that the mean squared displacement (MSD) of particle positions exhibits a power-law signature, the parameters of which reveal valuable information about the viscous and elastic properties of various biomaterials. However, MSD measurements are typically contaminated by complex and interacting sources of instrumental noise. As these often affect the high-frequency bandwidth to which MSD estimates are particularly sensitive, inadequate error correction can lead to severe bias in power law estimation and thereby, the inferred viscoelastic properties. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to filter high-frequency noise from particle tracking measurements. Our filters are shown theoretically to cover a broad spectrum of high-frequency noises, and lead to a parametric estimator of MSD power-law coefficients for which an efficient computational implementation is presented.

Genotypic fitness landscapes are constructed by assessing the fitness of all possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As fitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on simple measures of their structure, which can be used as statistics in empirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that explicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and constraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the correlation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural interpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained analytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to discriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of evolutionary constraints based on \"chains\" of forced mutations along fitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the amount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate values. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones that were previous proposed (e.g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of non-additive components, etc).
