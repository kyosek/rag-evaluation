Electric-field control of spin-dependent properties has become one of the most attractive phenomena in modern materials research due the promise of new device functionalities. One of the paradigms in this approach is to electrically toggle the spin polarization of carriers injected into a semiconductor using ferroelectric polarization as a control parameter. Using first-principles density functional calculations, we explore the effect of ferroelectric polarization of electron-doped BaTiO3 (n-BaTiO3) on the spin-polarized transmission across the SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface. Our study reveals that the interface transmission is negatively spin-polarized and that ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a change in the transport spin polarization from -65% to -98%. We show that this effect stems from the large difference in Fermi wave vectors between up- and down-spins in ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and a change in the transport regime driven by ferroelectric polarization switching. The predicted sizeable change in the spin polarization provides a non-volatile mechanism to electrically control spin injection in semiconductor-based spintronics devices."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary mechanism described in the study that allows for electrical control of spin injection, and what is the predicted range of change in spin polarization upon ferroelectric polarization reversal?\n\nA) Manipulation of Fermi wave vectors in SrRuO3, resulting in a spin polarization change from -50% to -80%\nB) Ferroelectric polarization switching in n-BaTiO3, leading to a spin polarization change from -65% to -98%\nC) Modulation of interface transmission in SrRuO3, causing a spin polarization change from 0% to -65%\nD) Electric field-induced phase transition in BaTiO3, resulting in a spin polarization change from -98% to +65%\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Companies do not operate in a vacuum. As companies move towards an increasingly specialized production function and their reach is becoming truly global, their aptitude in managing and shaping their inter-organizational network is a determining factor in measuring their health. Current models of company financial health often lack variables explaining the inter-organizational network, and as such, assume that (1) all networks are the same and (2) the performance of partners do not impact companies. This paper aims to be a first step in the direction of removing these assumptions. Specifically, the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer and supplier concentrations and partners' credit risk on credit-default swap (CDS) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size. We rely upon supply-chain data from Bloomberg that provides insight into companies' relationships. The empirical results show that a well diversified customer network lowers CDS spread, while having stable partners with low default probabilities increase spreads.

The research introduces a novel approach to the Graph Coloring Problem using an evolutionary algorithm. Unlike traditional methods that use a k-coloring approach and repeatedly run the algorithm, this method starts with the theoretical upper bound of the chromatic number (maximum out-degree + 1) and dynamically reduces the number of colors used during the evolutionary process. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes the traditional approach, which the paper explicitly contrasts with their new method. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the method starts with the upper bound, not the lower bound, and reduces colors rather than increasing them. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the method does not use a fixed number of colors but rather dynamically reduces the number of colors used.\n\nThe key innovation in this approach is the use of binary encoding for the Graph Coloring Problem, which facilitates mutation, evaluation, and dynamic color reduction throughout the evolutionary process."}, "22": {"documentation": {"title": "Gradient Tomography of Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions", "source": "Yayun He, Long-Gang Pang and Xin-Nian Wang", "docs_id": "2001.08273", "section": ["hep-ph", "nucl-th"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Gradient Tomography of Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions.

For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to a scalar reaction-diffusion equation, whose solution $C$ serves as a space-time smooth artificial viscosity indicator.

To test the methodology, we use a highly simplified WENO-based discretization scheme. We show that our scheme improves the order of accuracy of our WENO algorithm, handles extremely strong discontinuities (ranging up to nine orders of magnitude), allows for shock collision and bounce back, and removes high frequency noise.
