A highly reflective sail provides a way to propel a spacecraft out of the solar system using solar radiation pressure.

For a spacecraft starting on the Earth's orbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket engine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun.

Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions of microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod models have emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based description of microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations.

Detection of rare variants by resequencing is important for the identification of individuals carrying disease variants. Rapid sequencing by new technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it is still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve cost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which enable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals. However, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals in a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases. We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach, which is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental procedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially in situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual. Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance performance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing costs.

Gait recognition is one of the most important biometric technologies and has been applied in many fields. Recent gait recognition frameworks represent each gait frame by descriptors extracted from either global appearances or local regions of humans. However, the representations based on global information often neglect the details of the gait frame, while local region based descriptors cannot capture the relations among neighboring regions, thus reducing their discriminativeness. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction and fusion framework to achieve discriminative feature representations for gait recognition. Towards this goal, we take advantage of both global visual information and local region details and develop a Global and Local Feature Extractor (GLFE). Specifically, our GLFE module is composed of our newly designed multiple global and local convolutional layers (GLConv) to ensemble global and local features in a principle manner. Furthermore, we present a novel operation, namely Local Temporal Aggregation (LTA), to further preserve the spatial information by reducing the temporal resolution to obtain higher spatial resolution.

In noisy evolutionary optimization, sampling is a common strategy to deal with noise.

Previous studies on sampling are mainly empirical. In this paper, we first investigate the effect of sample size from a theoretical perspective. By analyzing the (1+1)-EA on the noisy LeadingOnes problem, we show that as the sample size increases, the running time can reduce from exponential to polynomial, but then return to exponential. This suggests that a proper sample size is crucial in practice. Then, we investigate what strategies can work when sampling with any fixed sample size fails.

In particular, streaming motions along spiral arms are expected to induce azimuthal variations in the chemical composition of a galaxy at a given galactic radius.
