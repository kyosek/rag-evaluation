Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have contributed many breakthroughs in segmentation tasks, especially in the field of medical imaging. However, \\textit{domain shift} and \\textit{corrupted annotations}, which are two common problems in medical imaging, dramatically degrade the performance of DCNNs in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel robust cross-denoising framework using two peer networks to address domain shift and corrupted label problems with a peer-review strategy. Specifically, each network performs as a mentor, mutually supervised to learn from reliable samples selected by the peer network to combat with corrupted labels. In addition, a noise-tolerant loss is proposed to encourage the network to capture the key location and filter the discrepancy under various noise-contaminant labels. To further reduce the accumulated error, we introduce a class-imbalanced cross learning using most confident predictions at the class-level.

Variational regularization has remained one of the most successful approaches for reconstruction in imaging inverse problems for several decades. With the emergence and astonishing success of deep learning in recent years, a considerable amount of research has gone into data-driven modeling of the regularizer in the variational setting. Our work extends a recently proposed method, referred to as adversarial convex regularization (ACR), that seeks to learn data-driven convex regularizers via adversarial training in an attempt to combine the power of data with the classical convex regularization theory. Specifically, we leverage the variational source condition (SC) during training to enforce that the ground-truth images minimize the variational loss corresponding to the learned convex regularizer.

The evolution is prominent even in massive galaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems.

In ultrasound imaging, this burden is significant, especially when striving for low-cost systems, and has motivated the development of high-resolution and high-contrast adaptive beamforming methods. Here we show that deep neural networks that adopt the algorithmic structure and constraints of adaptive signal processing techniques can efficiently learn to perform fast high-quality ultrasound beamforming using very little training data.
