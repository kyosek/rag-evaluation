Branching with immigration is one of the most common models for the stochastic processes observed in neuronal circuits. However, it is not observed directly and, in order to create branching-like processes, the observed spike time series is processed by attaching time bins to spikes. It has been shown that results such as criticality and size distributions depend on the chosen time bin. A different methodology whose results do not depend on the choice of time bin might therefore be useful and is proposed in this article. The new methodology circumvents using time bins altogether by replacing the previously used discrete-time models by continuous-time models. First, the article introduces and characterises a continuous-time version of the branching process with immigration, which will be called pumped branching process, and second, it presents an analytical derivation of the corresponding spike statistics, which can be directly compared to observed spike time series. The presented approach allows determining the degree of criticality, the average number of overlapping avalanches, and other observables without using a time bin. Furthermore, the effects caused by using time bins are analyzed and the influence of temporal and spatial subsampling discussed, all of which is compared to experimental data and supported by Monte Carlo simulations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A neuroscientist is studying neuronal avalanches and wants to avoid the limitations associated with time binning.

The presence of distinct metallicity zones, including a supersolar plateau in the core, followed by a decline and another plateau, suggests a two-phase formation process.

Instead of subtle schema variables and soundness-critical side conditions on the occurrence patterns of logical variables to restrict infinitely many axiom schema instances to sound ones, the resulting calculus adopts only a finite number of ordinary dL formulas as axioms, which uniform substitutions instantiate soundly. The static semantics of differential dynamic logic and the soundness-critical restrictions it imposes on proof steps is captured exclusively in uniform substitutions and variable renamings as opposed to being spread in delicate ways across the prover implementation. In addition to sound uniform substitutions, this article introduces differential forms for differential dynamic logic that make it possible to internalize differential invariants, differential substitutions, and derivatives as first-class axioms to reason about differential equations axiomatically. The resulting axiomatization of differential dynamic logic is proved to be sound and relatively complete."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of using uniform substitutions in the proof calculus for differential dynamic logic (dL) as presented in the article?\n\nA) Uniform substitutions allow for the use of infinitely many axiom schema instances, increasing the flexibility of the proof system.\n\nB) Uniform substitutions eliminate the need for any axioms in the proof calculus, relying solely on substitution rules.\n\nC) Uniform substitutions enable the use of a finite number of axioms instead of axiom schemata, simplifying implementation and concentrating soundness-critical restrictions in the substitution process.\n\nD) Uniform substitutions introduce new schema variables, making the proof system more expressive but more complex to implement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the article emphasizes that uniform substitutions allow the use of a finite number of ordinary dL formulas as axioms, replacing the need for axiom schemata. This simplifies implementation by eliminating the need for schema variables and complex side conditions. The soundness-critical restrictions are concentrated in the uniform substitution process and variable renamings, rather than being spread across the prover implementation.
