We investigate the exploration of an unknown environment when no reward function is provided. Building on the incremental exploration setting introduced by Lim and Auer [1], we define the objective of learning the set of $\\epsilon$-optimal goal-conditioned policies attaining all states that are incrementally reachable within $L$ steps (in expectation) from a reference state $s_0$. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based approach that interleaves discovering new states from $s_0$ and improving the accuracy of a model estimate that is used to compute goal-conditioned policies to reach newly discovered states. The resulting algorithm, DisCo, achieves a sample complexity scaling as $\\tilde{O}(L^5 S_{L+\\epsilon} \\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon} A \\epsilon^{-2})$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $S_{L+\\epsilon}$ is the number of states that are incrementally reachable from $s_0$ in $L+\\epsilon$ steps, and $\\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon}$ is the branching factor of the dynamics over such states. This improves over the algorithm proposed in [1] in both $\\epsilon$ and $L$ at the cost of an extra $\\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon}$ factor, which is small in most environments of interest.

The preliminary choice of the formulation for the time varying parameter reflecting the proportion of CU is critical in the context studied, due to the very limited amount of CU and HIV data available We consider various novel formulations to explore the trajectory of CU in time, based on diffusion-driven trajectories and smooth sigmoid curves. Extensive series of numerical simulations indicate that informative results can be obtained regarding the amplitude of the increase in CU during an intervention, with good levels of sensitivity and specificity performance in effectively detecting changes.

Realization and design of topological insulators emerging from electron correlations, called topological Mott insulators (TMIs), is pursued by using mean-field approximations as well as multi-variable variational Monte Carlo (MVMC) methods for Dirac electrons on honeycomb lattices. The topological insulator phases predicted in the previous studies by the mean-field approximation for an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice turn out to disappear, when we consider the possibility of a long-period charge-density-wave (CDW) order taking over the TMI phase. Nevertheless, we further show that the TMI phase is still stabilized when we are able to tune the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point of the electron band. Beyond the limitation of the mean-field calculation, we apply the newly developed MVMC to make accurate predictions after including the many-body and quantum fluctuations. By taking the extrapolation to the thermodynamic and weak external field limit, we present realistic criteria for the emergence of the topological insulator caused by the electron correlations. By suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the topological insulator emerges in an extended region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking surviving competitions with other orders. We discuss experimental ways to realize it in a bilayer graphenesystem."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism by which the topological insulator phase is stabilized in the context of electron correlations on a honeycomb lattice, and what is the key factor that enables its emergence?\n\nA) The application of a strong external magnetic field to suppress the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point.\nB) The tuning of the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point to a specific value that allows for the stabilization of the topological insulator phase.\nC) The introduction of a long-period charge-density-wave (CDW) order that competes with the topological insulator phase.\nD) The use of mean-field approximations to simplify the electron correlations and eliminate the topological insulator phase.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The tuning of the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point to a specific value that allows for the stabilization of the topological insulator phase.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the text states that \"we further show that the TMI phase is still stabilized when we are able to tune the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point of the electron band.\" This indicates that the tuning of the Fermi velocity is a key factor in stabilizing the topological insulator phase. The other options are incorrect because they either introduce external factors (A) or simplify the electron correlations (D), or they describe a competing order (C) that is not relevant to the stabilization of the topological insulator phase."}}
