The understanding of neural activity patterns is fundamentally linked to an understanding of how the brain's network architecture shapes dynamical processes. Established approaches rely mostly on deviations of a given network from certain classes of random graphs. Hypotheses about the supposed role of prominent topological features (for instance, the roles of modularity, network motifs, or hierarchical network organization) are derived from these deviations. An alternative strategy could be to study deviations of network architectures from regular graphs (rings, lattices) and consider the implications of such deviations for self-organized dynamic patterns on the network. Following this strategy, we draw on the theory of spatiotemporal pattern formation and propose a novel perspective for analyzing dynamics on networks, by evaluating how the self-organized dynamics are confined by network architecture to a small set of permissible collective states. In particular, we discuss the role of prominent topological features of brain connectivity, such as hubs, modules and hierarchy, in shaping activity patterns.

Competition is a main tenet of economics, and the reason is that a perfectly competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient in the absence of externalities and public goods. Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to its competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of competition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model by Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the {\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select seller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$ is the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce stochasticity. If $T$ decreases below a critical point $T_c$, the system undergoes a transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric one, in which only one of the two sellers is selected. In this work, we extend the model by incorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to control how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an oscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the $(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field approximations.

These expansion rates are quantified via certain divergences (pre-metrics) between probability measures induced by the laws of the stochastic flow associated with the underlying dynamics. We construct scalar fields of finite-time divergence/expansion rates, show their existence and space-time continuity for general stochastic flows. Combining these divergence rate fields with our 'information inequalities' derived in allows for quantification and mitigation of the uncertainty in path-based observables estimated from simplified models in a way that is amenable to algorithmic implementations, and it can be utilised in information-geometric analysis of statistical estimation and inference, as well as in a data-driven machine/deep learning of coarse-grained models.

The research develops a probabilistic characterisation of trajectorial expansion rates that can be defined over finite time intervals and used for uncertainty quantification in Lagrangian (trajectory-based) predictions in non-autonomous stochastic dynamical systems.

The work presented at this workshop is divided into two parts. In the first part, the mass and decay width of the $\\phi$-meson in cold nuclear matter are computed in an effective Lagrangian approach. The medium dependence of these properties are obtained by evaluating kaon-antikaon loop contributions to the $\\phi$-meson self-energy, employing medium-modified kaon masses calculated using the quark-meson coupling model. The loop integral is regularized with a dipole form factor, and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of cutoff mass in the form factor is investigated. At normal nuclear matter density, we find a downward shift of the $\\phi$ mass by a few percent, while the decay width is enhanced by an order of magnitude. Our results support the literature which suggest that one should observe a small downward mass shift and a large broadening of the decay width. In the second part, we present $\\phi$-meson--nucleus bound state energies and absorption widths for four selected nuclei, calculated by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with complex optical potentials. The attractive potential for the $\\phi$-meson in the nuclear medium originates from the in-medium enhanced KK loop in the $\\phi$-meson selfenergy. The results suggest that the $\\phi$-meson should form bound states with all the nuclei considered.

A swarm of preys when attacked by a predator is known to rely on their cooperative interactions to escape. Understanding such interactions of collectively moving preys and the emerging patterns of their escape trajectories still remain elusive. In this paper, we investigate how the range of cooperative interactions within a prey group affects the survival chances of the group while chased by a predator. As observed in nature, the interaction range of preys may vary due to their vision, age, or even physical structure. Based on a simple theoretical prey-predator model, here, we show that an optimality criterion for the survival can be established on the interaction range of preys. Very short range or long range interactions are shown to be inefficient for the escape mechanism. Interestingly, for an intermediate range of interaction, survival probability of the prey group is found to be maximum. Our analysis also shows that the nature of the escape trajectories strongly depends on the range of interactions between preys and corroborates with the naturally observed escape patterns. Moreover, we find that the optimal survival regime depends on the prey group size and also on the predator strength."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the study on prey swarm survival, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between the cooperative interaction range of prey and their survival chances when attacked by a predator?\n\nA) The survival probability of the prey group is highest when they have very short-range interactions.\n\nB) Long-range interactions among prey result in the most efficient escape mechanism.\n\nC) An intermediate range of interaction between prey leads to the maximum survival probability of the group.\n\nD) The cooperative interaction range has no significant impact on the survival chances of the prey group.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The study reveals that an optimal interaction range exists for prey survival.

The research demonstrates that an intermediate range of interaction between prey leads to the maximum survival probability of the group. This finding highlights the importance of balanced cooperative behavior in prey groups when faced with predator attacks.\n\nThe question tests the student's understanding of the key finding in the study and requires them to distinguish between different possible interpretations of the relationship between interaction range and survival probability.

Using the asymptotically flat solution for $n \\geq 7$ with a power-law form of the mass as a function of the null coordinate, we present a model for a gravitational collapse in which a null dust fluid radially injects into an initially flat and empty region.

Distributed estimation over networks draws much attraction in recent years. In many situations, due to imperfect information communication among nodes, the performance of traditional diffusion adaptive algorithms such as the diffusion LMS (DLMS) may degrade. To deal with this problem, several modified DLMS algorithms have been proposed. However, these DLMS based algorithms still suffer from biased estimation and are not robust to impulsive link noise. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of diffusion adaptation with noisy links from two aspects: accuracy and robustness.

The new algorithm is theoretically unbiased in Gaussian noise, and can efficiently handle the link noises in the presence of large outliers.
