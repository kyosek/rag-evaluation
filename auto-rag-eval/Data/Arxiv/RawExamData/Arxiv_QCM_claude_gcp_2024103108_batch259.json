Higgs inflation and $R^2$-inflation (Starobinsky model) are two limits of the same quantum model, hereafter called Starobinsky-Higgs. We analyse the two-loop action of the Higgs-like scalar $\\phi$ in the presence of: 1) non-minimal coupling ($\\xi$) and 2) quadratic curvature terms.

Most of the proposed associations between magnetars and supernova remnant suffer from age problems. Usually, supernova remnants ages are determined from an approximation of the Sedov-Taylor phase relation between radius and age, for a fixed energy of the explosion ~ 10^{51} erg. Those ages do not generally agree with the characteristic ages of the (proposed) associated magnetars. We show quantitatively that, by taking into account the energy injected on the supernova remnant by magnetar spin-down, a faster expansion results, improving matches between characteristic ages and supernova remnants ages. However, the magnetar velocities inferred from observations would inviabilize some associations. Since characteristic ages may not be good age estimators, their influence on the likelihood of the association may not be as important. In this work we present simple numerical simulations of supernova remnants expansion with internal magnetars, and apply it to the observed objects. A short initial spin period, thought to be important for the very generation of the magnetic field, is also relevant for the modified expansion of the remnant. We next analyze all proposed associations case-by-case, addressing the likelyhood of each one, according to this perspective.

These detectors work at temperatures as low as few tens of mK and exploit the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) effect.

We fabricated a batch of five prototypes and ran them in different facilities with dilution refrigerators. We carefully studied how impinging spurious infrared radiation impacts the detector performances, by shining infrared photons via optical-fiber-guided LED signals, in a controlled manner, into the bolometers. We hence demonstrated how the radiation-tightness of the test environment tremendously enhances the detector performances, allowing to set electrode voltage bias up to 90 volts without any leakage current and signal-to-noise gain as large as a factor 12 (for visible photons).
