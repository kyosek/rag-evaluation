Budker in connection with the development of the program of the VAPP-4 proton-antiproton collider.

Development of charge exchange injection with compensation of ionization energy loss by RF acceleration voltage up to the space charge limit is presented. Accumulation of coasting beam with space charge compensation with weak focusing and strong focusing is described.

With very large MIMO, we think of systems that use antenna arrays with an order of magnitude more elements than in systems being built today, say a hundred antennas or more. Very large MIMO entails an unprecedented number of antennas simultaneously serving a much smaller number of terminals. The disparity in number emerges as a desirable operating condition and a practical one as well. The number of terminals that can be simultaneously served is limited, not by the number of antennas, but rather by our inability to acquire channel-state information for an unlimited number of terminals. Larger numbers of terminals can always be accommodated by combining very large MIMO technology with conventional time- and frequency-division multiplexing via OFDM. Very large MIMO arrays is a new research field both in communication theory, propagation, and electronics and represents a paradigm shift in the way of thinking both with regards to theory, systems and implementation.

Estimation of losses is necessary to understand the depth of the problem and design preventive measures. How much is the economic loss due to MF? What will be the efficiency gain if MF is prevented at the advent of a technology? We answer these questions using survey data and official statistics employing economic surplus model. MF incidence in sample buffaloes and cows was 19% and 28%, respectively. Total economic losses were calculated as a sum total of losses from milk production, mortality of animals and treatment costs. Yearly economic loss due to MF was estimated to be INR 1000 crores (US$ 137 million) in Haryana. Value of milk lost had the highest share in total economic losses (58%), followed by losses due to mortality (29%) and treatment costs (13%). Despite lower MF incidence, losses were higher in buffaloes due to higher milk prices and market value of animals. The efficiency gain accruing to producers if MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs was estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion).

We study the global convergence and global optimality of actor-critic, one of the most popular families of reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing works on actor-critic employ bi-level or two-timescale updates, we focus on the more practical single-timescale setting, where the actor and critic are updated simultaneously. Specifically, in each iteration, the critic update is obtained by applying the Bellman evaluation operator only once while the actor is updated in the policy gradient direction computed using the critic. Moreover, we consider two function approximation settings where both the actor and critic are represented by linear or deep neural networks. For both cases, we prove that the actor sequence converges to a globally optimal policy at a sublinear $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate, where $K$ is the number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, we establish the rate of convergence and global optimality of single-timescale actor-critic with linear function approximation for the first time.

Several features along the prominence legs were reconstructed using a stereoscopic reconstruction technique developed by us.

The method not only reveals the existence or absence of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error floor (phase transition) but also provides insight into the MMSE decay via multivariate generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset, which are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of the kernel and the Gaussian mixture. These results apply not only to standard linear random Gaussian measurements but also to linear kernels that minimize the MMSE. It is shown that optimal kernels do not change the number of measurements associated with the MMSE phase transition, rather they affect the sensed power required to achieve a target MMSE in the low-noise regime.
