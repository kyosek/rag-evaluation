Mixing patterns in large self-organizing networks, such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, social and biological networks are often characterized by degree-degree dependencies between neighbouring nodes. In this paper we propose a new way of measuring degree-degree dependencies. One of the problems with the commonly used assortativity coefficient is that in disassortative networks its magnitude decreases with the network size. We mathematically explain this phenomenon and validate the results on synthetic graphs and real-world network data. As an alternative, we suggest to use rank correlation measures such as Spearman's rho. Our experiments convincingly show that Spearman's rho produces consistent values in graphs of different sizes but similar structure, and it is able to reveal strong (positive or negative) dependencies in large graphs. In particular, we discover much stronger negative degree-degree dependencies} in Web graphs than was previously thought. {Rank correlations allow us to compare the assortativity of networks of different sizes, which is impossible with the assortativity coefficient due to its genuine dependence on the network size.

To achieve optimal performance, which of the following statements is correct regarding the polarization state of light incident on the VVC mask?\n\nA) The incident light should be linearly polarized to maximize the phase ramp effect.\nB) Natural unpolarized light is ideal for the VVC mask to enable model-based focal plane wavefront sensing.\nC) The incident light must be circularly polarized, with the handedness matching the sign of the VVC's phase ramp.\nD) The polarization state is irrelevant as long as the deformable mirror is properly configured.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The VVC operates by manipulating the polarization state of incident light, with left- and right-circular polarizations receiving opposite phase ramps. To ensure proper functioning and enable wavefront sensing and control strategies, the light incident on the VVC mask must be circularly polarized with the correct handedness corresponding to the desired phase ramp direction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because linear polarization would not fully utilize the VVC's phase ramp capabilities. Option B is wrong because natural unpolarized light prevents model-based focal plane wavefront sensing and control strategies. Option D is incorrect because the polarization state is crucial for the VVC's operation, and the deformable mirror alone cannot compensate for improper polarization.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the VVC's operating principle and the importance of polarization control in high-contrast imaging systems, which are key concepts in the given text."}, "11": {"documentation": {"title": "Chemistry and line emission from evolving Herbig Ae disks", "source": "B.

Aims: To calculate chemistry and gas temperature of evolving protoplanetary disks with decreasing mass or dust settling, and to explore the sensitivity of gas-phase tracers. Methods: The density and dust temperature profiles for a range of models of flaring and self-shadowed disks around a typical Herbig Ae star are used together with 2-dimensional ultraviolet (UV) radiative transfer to calculate the chemistry and gas temperature.

A duty ratio $D$ is a fraction of time that the stator and the rotor interact and is a fundamental property to characterize the motor but remains to be determined. It is known that the stator units of the motor bind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically to control the motor torque depending on the load on the motor. At low load where the kinetics such as a proton translocation speed limits the rotation rate, the dependency of the rotation rate on the number of stator units $N$ infers $D$; the dependency becomes larger for smaller $D$.

Neural networks are commonly trained to make predictions through learning algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase, where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm, called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the proposed algorithm, and how it can give rise to better computational models for learning."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation of the Random Contrastive Hebbian Learning algorithm compared to traditional Contrastive Hebbian Learning?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for a forward phase in the learning process\nB) It uses random matrices to transform feedback signals during the clamped phase\nC) It introduces non-linear differential equations to describe neural dynamics\nD) It relies on synaptic weight symmetries for improved biological plausibility\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key innovation of the Random Contrastive Hebbian Learning algorithm is the use of random matrices to transform feedback signals during the clamped phase, instead of relying on symmetric synaptic weights.

This article deals with parameterisation, identifiability, and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of possibly non-invertible structural vector autoregressive moving average (SVARMA) models driven by independent and non-Gaussian shocks. In contrast to previous literature, the novel representation of the MA polynomial matrix using the Wiener-Hopf factorisation (WHF) focuses on the multivariate nature of the model, generates insights into its structure, and uses this structure for devising optimisation algorithms. In particular, it allows to parameterise the location of determinantal zeros inside and outside the unit circle, and it allows for MA zeros at zero, which can be interpreted as informational delays. This is highly relevant for data-driven evaluation of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. Typically imposed identifying restrictions on the shock transmission matrix as well as on the determinantal root location are made testable.

Accurate modeling of operational risk is important for a bank and the finance industry as a whole to prepare for potentially catastrophic losses. One approach to modeling operational is the loss distribution approach, which requires a bank to group operational losses into risk categories and select a loss frequency and severity distribution for each category. This approach estimates the annual operational loss distribution, and a bank must set aside capital, called regulatory capital, equal to the 0.999 quantile of this estimated distribution. In practice, this approach may produce unstable regulatory capital calculations from year-to-year as selected loss severity distribution families change. This paper presents truncation probability estimates for loss severity data and a consistent quantile scoring function on annual loss data as useful severity distribution selection criteria that may lead to more stable regulatory capital. Additionally, the Sinh-arcSinh distribution is another flexible candidate family for modeling loss severities that can be easily estimated using the maximum likelihood approach.

Hybrid nanowires with proximity-induced superconductivity in the topological regime host Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at their ends, and networks of such structures can produce topologically protected qubits.
