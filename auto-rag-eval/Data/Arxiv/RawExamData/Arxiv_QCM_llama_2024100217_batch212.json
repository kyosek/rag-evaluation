To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred.

In many fields such as bioinformatics, high energy physics, power distribution, etc., it is desirable to learn non-linear models where a small number of variables are selected and the interaction between them is explicitly modeled to predict the response. In principle, neural networks (NNs) could accomplish this task since they can model non-linear feature interactions very well. However, NNs require large amounts of training data to have a good generalization. In this paper we study the datastarved regime where a NN is trained on a relatively small amount of training data. For that purpose we study feature selection for NNs, which is known to improve generalization for linear models. As an extreme case of data with feature selection and feature interactions we study the XOR-like data with irrelevant variables. We experimentally observed that the cross-entropy loss function on XOR-like data has many non-equivalent local optima, and the number of local optima grows exponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. To deal with the local minima and for feature selection we propose a node pruning and feature selection algorithm that improves the capability of NNs to find better local minima even when there are irrelevant variables.

Approximately 10 years ago, the method of renormalization-group symmetries entered the field of boundary value problems of classical mathematical physics, stemming from the concepts of functional self-similarity and of the Bogoliubov renormalization group treated as a Lie group of continuous transformations. Overwhelmingly dominating practical quantum field theory calculations, the renormalization-group method formed the basis for the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of strong nuclear interactions and underlies the Grand Unification scenario. This paper describes the logical framework of a new algorithm based on the modern theory of transformation groups and presents the most interesting results of application of the method to differential and/or integral equation problems and to problems that involve linear functionals of solutions. Examples from nonlinear optics, kinetic theory, and plasma dynamics are given, where new analytical solutions obtained with this algorithm have allowed describing the singularity structure for self-focusing of a laser beam in a nonlinear medium, studying generation of harmonics in weakly inhomogeneous plasma, and investigating the energy spectra of accelerated ions in expanding plasma bunches."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary application of the renormalization-group method in the context of boundary value problems, and how does it relate to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions?\n\nA) The renormalization-group method is primarily used to solve differential equations, and its application to boundary value problems led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions.\n\nB) The renormalization-group method is primarily used to study the behavior of nonlinear systems, and its application to boundary value problems led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions.\n\nC) The renormalization-group method is primarily used to investigate the energy spectra of accelerated particles, and its application to boundary value problems led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions.\n\nD) The renormalization-group method is primarily used to describe the singularity structure of self-focusing in nonlinear optics, and its application to boundary value problems led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) The renormalization-group method is primarily used to describe the singularity structure of self-focusing in nonlinear optics, and its application to boundary value problems led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom in strong nuclear interactions.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is D) because the documentation states that the renormalization-group method has been applied to problems in nonlinear optics, kinetic theory, and plasma dynamics, and that it has allowed for the description of the singularity structure of self-focusing in nonlinear optics.

Topological entanglements severely interfere with important biological processes. For this reason, genomes must be kept unknotted and unlinked during most of a cell cycle. Type II Topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA in vivo are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) proteins -- such as cohesins and condensins -- can cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements. SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localisation of essential crossings in turn catalysing the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on SMC processivity; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary function of the synergy between Topoisomerase II (TopoII) enzymes and Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) proteins in resolving topological entanglements in genomes?\n\nA) To introduce new knots and links in DNA\nB) To maintain the stability of chromatin structures\nC) To catalyse the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes through SMC-driven loop extrusion\nD) To regulate the expression of genes involved in DNA replication\n\nCorrect Answer: C) To catalyse the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes through SMC-driven loop extrusion\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is based on the documentation, which states that SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localisation of essential crossings, which in turn catalyses the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes.

Using this formulation, the electric and magnetic fields gracefully decouple in the static limit, a behavior similar to that of the classical Lorenz-Debye-Mie representation of Maxwell fields in spherical geometries. We derive extensions of both the generalized Deybe source and Lorenz-Debye-Mie representations to planar geometries, as well as provide equations for the solution of scattering from a perfectly conducting half-space and in layered media using a Sommerfeld-like approach.
