We propose a simple model of inter-bank borrowing and lending where the evolution of the log-monetary reserves of $N$ banks is described by a system of diffusion processes coupled through their drifts in such a way that stability of the system depends on the rate of inter-bank borrowing and lending. Systemic risk is characterized by a large number of banks reaching a default threshold by a given time horizon. Our model incorporates a game feature where each bank controls its rate of borrowing/lending to a central bank. The optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from the central bank when its monetary reserve falls below a critical level or lend if it rises above this critical level which is chosen here as the average monetary reserve. Borrowing from or lending to the central bank is also subject to a quadratic cost at a rate which can be fixed by the regulator. We solve explicitly for Nash equilibria with finitely many players, and we show that in this model the central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. We also study the corresponding Mean Field Game in the limit of large number of banks in the presence of a common noise."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the proposed model of inter-bank borrowing and lending, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the role of the central bank and its impact on systemic risk?\n\nA) The central bank acts as a clearing house in the system.\nB) The central bank adds liquidity to the banking system.\nC) The central bank's actions directly reduce the systemic risk of the banking network.\nD) Banks can borrow from or lend to the central bank based on their monetary reserves.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is correct: The documentation explicitly states that \"the central bank acts as a clearing house.\"\n\nB is correct: The text mentions that the central bank adds liquidity to the system.\n\nC is incorrect: While the central bank adds liquidity, the documentation specifically states that it does so \"without affecting its systemic risk.\" This means the central bank's actions do not directly reduce systemic risk.\n\nD is correct: The model includes a game feature where banks control their rate of borrowing/lending to the central bank based on their monetary reserves relative to a critical level.\n\nThe key to this question is understanding that while the central bank plays an important role in the system, its actions do not directly mitigate systemic risk according to this model."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "The advantage of being slow: the quasi-neutral contact process", "source": "Marcelo Martins de Oliveira and Ronald Dickman", "docs_id": "1705.03819", "section": ["q-bio.PE", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "The advantage of being slow: the quasi-neutral contact process. According to the competitive exclusion principle, in a finite ecosystem, extinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same resources. An important question that arises is: when coexistence is not possible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the other(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher reproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such as asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been found to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine competitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models, including stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic (mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the \"biological clock\" of one species is a factor of $\\alpha$ slower than that of the other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and competition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems. We find that a species with a slower biological clock has an advantage if resources are limited, winning the competition against a species with a faster clock, in relatively small systems.

The question describes an energy-dependent attenuation in a galactic gamma-ray source's spectrum, which aligns with the key prediction of photon-ALP mixing theory described in the provided text. This phenomenon occurs due to the oscillation between photons and ALPs in the presence of galactic magnetic fields, leading to a characteristic modulation in the observed gamma-ray spectra. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while interstellar dust can cause absorption, it typically doesn't produce a strongly energy-dependent effect in the gamma-ray regime. \n\nOption C, Compton scattering, would affect lower-energy photons more than higher-energy ones, which is not consistent with the described observation. \n\nOption D, pair production, has an energy threshold and would primarily affect the highest-energy gamma rays, not producing the type of spectral modulation described.\n\nThe photon-ALP mixing explanation (B) is supported by recent research using Fermi-LAT data to search for these effects in galactic gamma-ray sources, as mentioned in the provided text."}, "3": {"documentation": {"title": "Solitons in a system of three linearly coupled fiber gratings", "source": "Arthur Gubeskys and Boris A.

The consistency of the species abundance distribution across diverse communities has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, I argue that the consistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a common symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that different ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and lose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed patterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the magnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear.

In focus of this study is the computation of homology of the invariant set of some well known dynamical systems which display chaotic behavior. Persistent homology of simplicial complex and its relationship with the embedding dimensions are examined by studying the lifetime of topological features and topological noise. The consistency of topological properties for different dynamic regimes and embedding dimensions is examined. The obtained results shed new light on the topological properties of the reconstructed phase space and open up new possibilities for application of advanced topological methods. the method presented here may be used as a generic method for constructing simplicial complex from a scalar time series which has a number of advantages compared to the mapping of the time series to a complex network."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between persistent homology and embedding dimensions in the context of the method presented for constructing simplicial complexes from time series data?\n\nA) Persistent homology is independent of embedding dimensions and remains constant across all reconstructions.\n\nB) The lifetime of topological features decreases monotonically as the embedding dimension increases.\n\nC) Persistent homology analysis reveals the consistency of topological properties across different dynamic regimes and embedding dimensions.\n\nD) Embedding dimensions have no impact on the topological noise observed in persistent homology calculations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

A predominant thesis in the ongoing debate on the drivers of this observed heterogeneity is that a key determinant of the swift and extensive vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify different aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measured through the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) the internal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) and investigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the initial period (up to 30th January 2021).

It is thereby in sharp contrast to the production function where the output of firms is completely deterministic.

Analysis of the data shows that there are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added and confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented by a production function.

This paper addresses this question and proposes a new methodology to estimate the correlation matrix which doesn't depend on the chosen sample period. This new methodology is based on tensor factorization techniques. In particular, combining and normalizing factor components, we build a correlation matrix which shows emerging structural dependency properties not affected by the sample period. To retrieve the factor components, we propose a new tensor decomposition (which we name Slice-Diagonal Tensor (SDT) factorization) and compare it to the two most used tensor decompositions, the Tucker and the PARAFAC.

Experimental results indicate that the new approach is able to highlight biologically relevant features that are not immediately apparent from the raw connectivity data."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages and implications of the new weighted network communicability measure for analyzing brain connectivity patterns?\n\nA) It requires invasive procedures to collect data and is primarily useful for identifying global differences between diseased patients and controls.\n\nB) It allows for the analysis of discretized adjacency matrices, making it easier to interpret binary connectivity data.\n\nC) It directly uses real-valued connectivity data, avoiding thresholding, and can highlight both local and global differences between diseased patients and controls.\n\nD) It is specifically designed to work with older brain imaging techniques and cannot be applied to new non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the passage explicitly states that one advantage of the new method is that \"it deals directly with the real-valued connectivity data, thereby avoiding the need to discretise the corresponding adjacency matrix.\" Additionally, the text mentions that this measure is successful in \"distinguishing local and global differences between diseased patients and controls.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage describes the technique as non-invasive, contradicting the statement about invasive procedures.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the method actually avoids discretization of the adjacency matrix, rather than requiring it.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage clearly states that this method works with new, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to construct snapshots of cortical networks in living human brains."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Hardware Accelerated SDR Platform for Adaptive Air Interfaces", "source": "Tarik Kazaz, Christophe Van Praet, Merima Kulin, Pieter Willemen,\n  Ingrid Moerman", "docs_id": "1705.00115", "section": ["cs.NI"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Hardware Accelerated SDR Platform for Adaptive Air Interfaces. The future 5G wireless infrastructure will support any-to-any connectivity between densely deployed smart objects that form the emerging paradigm known as the Internet of Everything (IoE). Compared to traditional wireless networks that enable communication between devices using a single technology, 5G networks will need to support seamless connectivity between heterogeneous wireless objects and IoE networks. To tackle the complexity and versatility of future IoE networks, 5G will need to guarantee optimal usage of both spectrum and energy resources and further support technology-agnostic connectivity between objects. One way to realize this is to combine intelligent network control with adaptive software defined air interfaces. In this paper, a flexible and compact platform is proposed for on-the-fly composition of low-power adaptive air interfaces, based on hardware/software co-processing. Compared to traditional Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems that perform computationally-intensive signal processing algorithms in software, consume significantly power and have a large form factor, the proposed platform uses modern hybrid FPGA technology combined with novel ideas such as RF Network-on-Chip (RFNoC) and partial reconfiguration.

We consider our universe as a 3d domain wall embedded in a 5d dimensional Minkowski space-time. We address the problem of inflation and late time acceleration driven by bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall. The expansion of our universe is mainly related to these bulk particles. Since our universe tends to be permeated by a large number of isolated structures, as temperature diminishes with the expansion, we model our universe with a 3d domain wall with increasing internal structures. These structures could be unstable 2d domain walls evolving to fermi-balls which are candidates to cold dark matter. The momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall is related to the reflection coefficient. We show a nontrivial dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark matter structures inside the 3d domain wall. As the population of such structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases. The expansion is exponential at early times and polynomial at late times.

The documentation states that there is a \"nontrivial dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark matter structures inside the 3d domain wall.\" It further explains that \"As the population of such structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases.\" This indicates that the reflection coefficient of bulk particles increases with the number of internal dark matter structures, leading to faster expansion as these structures become more numerous.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the opposite relationship between internal structures and expansion rate.
