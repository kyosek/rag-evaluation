Using real and synthetic Type Ia SNe (SNeIa) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data representing current observations forecasts, this paper investigates the tension between those probes in the dark energy equation of state (EoS) reconstruction considering the well known CPL model and Wang's low correlation reformulation. In particular, here we present simulations of BAO data from both the the radial and transverse directions. We also explore the influence of priors on Omega_m and Omega_b on the tension issue, by considering 1-sigma deviations in either one or both of them. Our results indicate that for some priors there is no tension between a single dataset (either SNeIa or BAO) and their combination (SNeIa+BAO). Our criterion to discern the existence of tension (sigma-distance) is also useful to establish which is the dataset with most constraining power; in this respect SNeIa and BAO data switch roles when current and future data are considered, as forecasts predict and spectacular quality improvement on BAO data. We also find that the results on the tension are blind to the way the CPL model is addressed: there is a perfect match between the original formulation and that by the low correlation optimized, but the errors on the parameters are much narrower in all cases of our exhaustive exploration, thus serving the purpose of stressing the convenience of this reparametrization."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Investigate the tension between Supernovae (SN) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data in the context of the CPL model and Wang's low correlation reformulation. How do the results of this study address the impact of prior constraints on the parameters Omega_m and Omega_b on the tension issue, and what implications do these findings have for the constraining power of SN and BAO data in the future?\n\nA) The study finds that the tension between SN and BAO data is exacerbated by prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b, leading to a widening of the uncertainty in the dark energy equation of state (EoS) reconstruction. The results suggest that the combination of SN and BAO data is less constraining than either dataset alone, particularly when prior constraints are relaxed.\n\nB) The study reveals that the tension between SN and BAO data is reduced by prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b, resulting in a more precise determination of the dark energy EoS. The results indicate that the combination of SN and BAO data is more constraining than either dataset alone, particularly when prior constraints are tightened.\n\nC) The study demonstrates that the tension between SN and BAO data is independent of prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b, and that the combination of SN and BAO data is equally constraining as either dataset alone. The results suggest that the use of prior constraints does not alleviate the tension between SN and BAO data.\n\nD) The study finds that Wang's low correlation reformulation has a negligible impact on the tension between SN and BAO data, and that the results are largely unaffected by the choice of prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b. The results indicate that the combination of SN and BAO data is more constraining than either dataset alone, particularly when the reformulation is used.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The study reveals that the tension between SN and BAO data is reduced by prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b, resulting in a more precise determination of the dark energy EoS. The results indicate that the combination of SN and BAO data is more constraining than either dataset alone, particularly when prior constraints are tightened.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the study finds that prior constraints on Omega_m and Omega_b reduce the tension between SN and BAO data, leading to a more precise determination of the dark energy EoS. The results also indicate that the combination of SN and BAO data is more constraining than either dataset alone, particularly when prior constraints are tightened.

Event study regression estimates indicate a significant jump, immediately after the auction format change, in revenue per sold impression (price) of the treated publishers relative to that of control publishers, ranging from 35% to 75% of pre-treatment price levels of the treated group. Further, we observe that in later auction format changes the lift in price relative to SPAs dissipates over time, reminiscent of the celebrated revenue equivalence theorem. We take this as evidence of initially insufficient bid shading after the format change rather than an immediate shift to a new Bayesian Nash equilibrium.

The corona virus is already spread around the world in many countries, and it has taken many lives. Furthermore, the world health organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 has reached the global epidemic stage. Early and reliable diagnosis using chest CT-scan can assist medical specialists in vital circumstances. In this work, we introduce a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) web service to detect COVID- 19 online. One of the largest public chest CT-scan databases, containing 746 participants was used in this experiment. A number of well-known deep neural network architectures consisting of ResNet, Inception and MobileNet were inspected to find the most efficient model for the hybrid system. A combination of the Densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) in order to reduce image dimensions and Nu-SVM as an anti-overfitting bottleneck was chosen to distinguish between COVID-19 and healthy controls. The proposed methodology achieved 90.80% recall, 89.76% precision and 90.61% accuracy. The method also yields an AUC of 95.05%. Ultimately a flask web service is made public through ngrok using the trained models to provide a RESTful COVID-19 detector, which takes only 39 milliseconds to process one image.

The effect of substrate thickness and its Debye temperature on the bolometric response of the freestanding-membrane type of superconductor transition-edge detectors is investigated. The investigation is based on the calculation of the variation of the specific heat per unit volume and the heat conductivity using the finite-size scaling method for different Debye temperatures and micron size thickness of substrate. We also calculated the heat capacity and time constant for various materials with Debye temperatures in the range of 600-1400K.

The IR response versus substrate thickness of these types of devices for different modulation frequencies is also presented.

Astrometric and radial-velocity planet detections track very similar motions, and one generally expects that the statistical properties of the detections would also be similar after they are scaled to the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying observations. I show that this expectation is realized for periods small compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~ 1. At longer periods, the fact that models of astrometric observations must take account of an extra nuisance parameter causes the mass error to begin deteriorating at P/T ~ 0.8, as compared to P/T ~ 1.0 for RV. Moreover, the deterioration is much less graceful. This qualitative difference carries over to the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored in the presence of a distant companion that generates an approximately uniform acceleration. The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors. These results imply that to preserve astrometric discovery space at the longest accessible orbits (which nominally have the lowest-mass sensitivity) requires supplementary observations to identify or rule out distant companions that could contribute quasi-uniform acceleration."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the key difference in the statistical behavior between astrometric and radial-velocity planet detections, and how does it impact the discovery space at the longest accessible orbits?\n\nA) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to mass errors, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to period errors.\nB) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to period errors, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to mass errors.\nC) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to mass errors, but only when the period is greater than 1, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to period errors, but only when the period is less than 1.\nD) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to period errors, but only when the period is greater than 1, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to mass errors, but only when the period is less than 1.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to period errors, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to mass errors.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Astrometric detections are more sensitive to period errors, while radial-velocity detections are more sensitive to mass errors.
