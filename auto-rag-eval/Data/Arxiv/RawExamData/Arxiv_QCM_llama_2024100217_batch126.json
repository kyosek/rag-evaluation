Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction in the field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy in visual recognition. Recent works have pushed the performance of GPU implementations of CNNs to significantly improve their classification and training times. With these improvements, many frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs on both CPUs and GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work we present a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized FPGA implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device when necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device, simple-to-use test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer implementations. To validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel environment to implement an FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and show that the FPGA layer can be used alongside other layers running on a host processor to run several popular CNNs (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A, Overfeat). The results show that our framework achieves 50 GFLOPS across 3x3 convolutions in the benchmarks.

We analyze the onset of itinerant ferromagnetism, pinpointing the critical attraction strength where partially and fully ferromagnetic states occur. In the cold-atom setup, where the two (pseudo) spin populations are separately conserved, ferromagnetism occurs with the nucleation of a fully imbalanced band-insulating domain hosting the attractive component only. The size of this domain grows with the attraction strength, therefore increasing the (opposite) imbalance of the other domain, until the two spin components are fully separated. In the presence of a harmonic trap, the ferromagnetic state hosts a partially imbalanced domain in the center with an excess of the attractive component and filling lower than one.
