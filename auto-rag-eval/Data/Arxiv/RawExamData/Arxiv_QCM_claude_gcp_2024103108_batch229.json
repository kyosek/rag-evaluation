This thesis focuses on the applications of mathematical tools and concepts brought from nonequilibrium statistical physics to the modeling of ecological problems. The first part provides a short introduction where the theoretical concepts and mathematical tools that are going to be used in subsequent chapters are presented. Firstly, the different levels of description usually employed in the models are explained. Secondly, the mathematical relationships among them are presented. Finally, the notation and terminology that will be used later on are explained. The second part is devoted to studying vegetation pattern formation in regions where precipitations are not frequent and resources for plant growth are scarce. This part comprises two chapters. The third part of the thesis develops a series of mathematical models describing the collective movement and behavior of some animal species. Its primary objective is to investigate the effect that communication among foragers has on searching times and the formation of groups. It consists of two chapters. The fourth part covers the effect of stochastic temporal disorder, mimicking climate and environmental variability, on systems formed by many interacting particles. These models may serve as an example of ecosystems.

The techniques of power recycling and signal recycling have proven as key concepts to increase the sensitivity of large-scale gravitational wave detectors by independent resonant enhancement of light power and signal sidebands within the interferometer. Developing the latter concept further, twin signal recycling was proposed as an alternative to conventional detuned signal recycling. Twin signal recycling features the narrow-band sensitivity gain of conventional detuned signal recycling but furthermore facilitates the injection of squeezed states of light, increases the detector sensitivity over a wide frequency band and requires a less complex detection scheme for optimal signal readout. These benefits come at the expense of an additional recycling mirror, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom in the interferometer which need to be controlled.

Earth has had oceans for nearly four billion years and Mars had lakes and rivers 3.5-3.8 billion years ago. However, it is still unknown whether water has ever condensed on the surface of Venus because the planet - now completely dry - has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history. The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds - which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption - have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325 W/m2, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun.

The authors investigated the application of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for different scenarios, especially to tackle the case of coherent sources and observed inconsistencies in the results.

Improving patient care safety is an ultimate objective for medical cyber-physical systems. A recent study shows that the patients' death rate can be significantly reduced by computerizing medical best practice guidelines. To facilitate the development of computerized medical best practice guidelines, statecharts are often used as a modeling tool because of their high resemblances to disease and treatment models and their capabilities to provide rapid prototyping and simulation for clinical validations. However, some implementations of statecharts, such as Yakindu statecharts, are priority-based and have synchronous execution semantics which makes it difficult to model certain functionalities that are essential in modeling medical guidelines, such as two-way communications and configurable execution orders. Rather than introducing new statechart elements or changing the statechart implementation's underline semantics, we use existing basic statechart elements to design model patterns for the commonly occurring issues. In particular, we show the design of model patterns for two-way communications and configurable execution orders and formally prove the correctness of these model patterns.
