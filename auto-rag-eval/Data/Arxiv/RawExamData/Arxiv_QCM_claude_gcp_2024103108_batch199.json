(Abridged) The formation of massive spheroidal galaxies is studied on a visually classified sample of 910 galaxies extracted from the ACS/HST images of the GOODS North and South fields (0.4<z<.5). Three key observables are considered: comoving number density, internal colour distribution; and the Kormendy relation. The comoving number density of the most massive galaxies is found not to change significantly with redshift. One quarter of the whole sample of early-types are photometrically classified as blue galaxies. On a volume-limited subset out to z<0.7, the average stellar mass of the blue ellipticals is 5E9Msun compared to 4E10Msun for red ellipticals. On a volume-limited subsample of bright galaxies (Mv<-21) out to z=1.4 we find only 4% are blue early-types, in contrast with 26% for the full sample. The intrinsic colour distribution correlates overall bluer colours with **blue cores** (positive radial gradients of colour), suggesting an inside-out process of formation.

However, the appearance of experimental TEM images often differs greatly from that of conventional molecular models, and the images are difficult to decipher unless we know in advance the structure of the specimen molecules. The difference arises from the fundamental design of the molecular models that represent atomic connectivity and/or the electronic properties of molecules rather than the nuclear charge of atoms and electrostatic potentials that are felt by the e-beam in TEM imaging.

FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme that provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for living cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits within the enzyme. Briefly, proton translocation through the membrane-bound Fo part of ATP synthase drives a 10-step rotary motion of the ring of c subunits with respect to the non-rotating subunits a and b.

Pinning-type magnets maintaining high coercivity, i.e. the ability to sustain magnetization, at high temperature are at the core of thriving clean-energy technologies. Among these, Sm2Co17-based magnets are excellent candidates owing to their high-temperature stability. However, despite decades of efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20~30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain-interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magneto-electric approach. Through hydrogen charging/discharging by applying voltages of only ~ 1 V, the coercivity is reversibly tuned by an unprecedented value of ~ 1.3 T. In situ magneto-structural measurements and atomic-scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen lowers the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries.

Instead, the framework uses a method called \"anchored walk forward training\" for stability and robustness testing, which is described as being similar to k-fold cross-validation for time series.\n\nTherefore, C is the correct answer as it is NOT a feature of the described DRL framework."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Age of Gossip in Networks with Community Structure", "source": "Baturalp Buyukates and Melih Bastopcu and Sennur Ulukus", "docs_id": "2105.02867", "section": ["cs.IT", "cs.NI", "eess.SP", "math.IT"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Age of Gossip in Networks with Community Structure.

This review investigates different methods of modelling the economic performance of tidal-stream arrays, for use within these optimisation tools. The different cost reduction pathways are discussed from costs falling as the global installed capacity increases, due to greater experience, improved power curves through larger-diameter higher-rated turbines, to economic efficiencies that can be found by moving to large-scale arrays. A literature review is conducted to establish the most appropriate input values for use in economic models. This includes finding a best case, worst case and typical values for costs and other related parameters. The information collated in this review can provide a useful steering for the many optimisation tools that have been developed, especially when cost information is commercially sensitive and a realistic parameter range is difficult to obtain."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current state and future direction of the tidal stream energy industry, according to the document?\n\nA) The industry is currently dominated by large-scale commercial arrays with hundreds of turbines.\n\nB) The industry is shifting from small demonstrator projects to commercially sized projects with tens of turbines or more.\n\nC) The industry has reached its peak and is no longer pursuing larger-scale projects.\n\nD) The industry is focused solely on improving individual turbine efficiency rather than expanding to larger arrays.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

In order to better understand the origin of multiple quantum transitions observed in superparamagnetic nanoparticles, electron magnetic resonance (EMR) studies have been performed on iron oxide nanoparticles assembled inside the anodic alumina membrane. The positions of both the main resonance and \"forbidden\" (double-quantum, 2Q) transitions observed at the half-field demonstrate the characteristic angular dependence with the line shifts proportional to 3cos2q-1, where q is the angle between the channel axis and external magnetic field B. This result can be attributed to the interparticle dipole-dipole interactions within elongated aggregates inside the channels.

We present a quaternion inspired formalism specifically developed to evaluate the intensity of the electrical current that traverses a single molecule connected to two semi-infinite electrodes as the applied external bias is varied. The self-adjustment of the molecular levels is fully described at a density functional ab initio quantum chemical level. Use of a quaternion approach allows for an integrated treatment of both coherent (ballistic) and non-coherent (co-tunneling) contributions to the effective charge transport, where the latter involve the existence of transient charged states of the corresponding molecular species. An expression for the net current is calculated by using second-order perturbation theory to take into account all possible transitions between states localized at the two different electrodes that involve intermediary levels in the so-called \"extended molecule\" complex that comprises the system of interest attached to two small metallic clusters. We show that by a judicious choice of the relevant molecular parameters, the formalism can be extended to describe the electronic transport both in conjugated as in saturated molecules, where localized orbitals are more likely to be found.
