The autoregressive (AR) model is a widely used model to understand time series data. Traditionally, the innovation noise of the AR is modeled as Gaussian. However, many time series applications, for example, financial time series data, are non-Gaussian, therefore, the AR model with more general heavy-tailed innovations is preferred. Another issue that frequently occurs in time series is missing values, due to system data record failure or unexpected data loss. Although there are numerous works about Gaussian AR time series with missing values, as far as we know, there does not exist any work addressing the issue of missing data for the heavy-tailed AR model. In this paper, we consider this issue for the first time, and propose an efficient framework for parameter estimation from incomplete heavy-tailed time series based on a stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. The proposed algorithm is computationally cheap and easy to implement. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the observed data likelihood is rigorously proved.

We develop a dynamic decomposition of the empirical Beveridge curve, i.e., the level of vacancies conditional on unemployment.

The nodes of this network represent the different lineups, while an edge from node j to node i exists if lineup i has outperformed lineup j. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute).

The researchers used various econometric methods to detect \"a long period of explosive behaviour in allowance prices, starting in March 2018 when the reform was adopted.\" This suggests that the price increase was not simply a reflection of tighter supply, as regulators claimed, but was driven by market speculation triggered by the reform.\n\nThis finding challenges the regulators' confidence in the long-term outcome of the reform and has broader implications. It raises questions about the effectiveness of emission trading schemes versus carbon taxes, and suggests that policymakers should be cautious about attributing market changes solely to policy reforms without considering speculative behavior.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they contradict the study's findings.

By assessing the stellar absorption, we derive the effective temperature, surface gravity, and photospheric abundances. For the first time, we report time variability of the central star's radial velocity, strongly indicating a binary central star. Comparison between the derived elemental abundances and those predicted values by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star nucleosynthesis models indicates that the progenitor is a star with initial mass of ~1.25 Msun and metallicity Z = 0.001/alpha-element/Cl-rich ([alpha,Cl/Fe] ~ +0.3-0.4).
