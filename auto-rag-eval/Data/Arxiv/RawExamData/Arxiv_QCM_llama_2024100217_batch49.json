Compared with shallow domain adaptation, recent progress in deep domain adaptation has shown that it can achieve higher predictive performance and stronger capacity to tackle structural data (e.g., image and sequential data). The underlying idea of deep domain adaptation is to bridge the gap between source and target domains in a joint space so that a supervised classifier trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain. This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the joint space can directly minimize the loss incurred for transfer learning between the two domains.

In this work, we introduce a simple, yet accurate order statistical ordinal regression function that predicts relay race places with changeover-times. We call this function the Fenton-Wilkinson Order Statistics model. This model is built on the following educated assumption: individual leg-times follow log-normal distributions. Moreover, our key idea is to utilize Fenton-Wilkinson approximations of changeover-times alongside an estimator for the total number of teams as in the notorious German tank problem. This original place regression function is sigmoidal and thus correctly predicts the existence of a small number of elite teams that significantly outperform the rest of the teams. Our model also describes how place increases linearly with changeover-time at the inflection point of the log-normal distribution function. With real-world data from Jukola 2019, a massive orienteering relay race, the model is shown to be highly accurate even when the size of the training set is only 5% of the whole data set.

Digital pathology is one of the most significant developments in modern medicine. Pathological examinations are the gold standard of medical protocols and play a fundamental role in diagnosis. Recently, with the advent of digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored as digital images. As a result, digitized histopathological tissues can be used in computer-aided image analysis programs and machine learning techniques. Detection and segmentation of nuclei are some of the essential steps in the diagnosis of cancers. Recently, deep learning has been used for nuclei segmentation. However, one of the problems in deep learning methods for nuclei segmentation is the lack of information from out of the patches. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for nuclei segmentation, which addresses the problem of misprediction in patch border areas.

Domain mismatch often occurs in real applications and causes serious performance reduction on speaker verification systems.

In this paper, we firstly present an empirical study to show that simply adding cross-domain data does not help performance in conditions with enrollment-test mismatch. Careful analysis shows that this striking result is caused by the incoherent statistics between the enrollment and test conditions. Based on this analysis, we present a decoupled scoring approach that can maximally squeeze the value of cross-domain labels and obtain optimal verification scores when the enrollment and test are mismatched.

This study is concerned with how the attractor dimension of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations depends on characteristic length scales, including the system integral length scale, the forcing length scale, and the dissipation length scale. Upper bounds on the attractor dimension derived by Constantin--Foias--Temam are analysed. It is shown that the optimal attractor-dimension estimate grows linearly with the domain area (suggestive of extensive chaos), for a sufficiently large domain, if the kinematic viscosity and the amplitude and length scale of the forcing are held fixed. For sufficiently small domain area, a slightly ``super-extensive'' estimate becomes optimal. In the extensive regime, the attractor-dimension estimate is given by the ratio of the domain area to the square of the dissipation length scale defined, on physical grounds, in terms of the average rate of shear. This dissipation length scale (which is not necessarily the scale at which the energy or enstrophy dissipation takes place) can be identified with the dimension correlation length scale, the square of which is interpreted, according to the concept of extensive chaos, as the area of a subsystem with one degree of freedom.
