The initial magnetic field of previous magnetorotational instability (MRI) simulations has always included a significant system-scale component, even if stochastic. However, it is of conceptual and practical interest to assess whether the MRI can grow when the initial field is turbulent. The ubiquitous presence of turbulent or random flows in astrophysical plasmas generically leads to a small-scale dynamo (SSD), which would provide initial seed turbulent velocity and magnetic fields in the plasma that becomes an accretion disc. Can the MRI grow from these more realistic initial conditions? To address this we supply a standard shearing box with isotropically forced SSD generated magnetic and velocity fields as initial conditions, and remove the forcing.

Here, we use the projection operator approach to extend DDFT into various directions: first, we generalize DDFT toward mixtures of $n$ different species of spherical colloidal particles. We show that there are in general nontrivial cross-coupling terms between the concentration fields and specify them explicitly for colloidal mixtures with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions. Secondly, we treat the energy density as an additional slow variable and derive formal expressions for an extended DDFT containing also the energy density.

The model involves two tasks: one is to prevent the binary classification of true and false information using adversarial networks guided by reinforcement learning, and another extracts credibility features (private features) from multiple types of credibility information and compares them with the common features using orthogonality constraints and KL-divergence. This makes option C the most accurate description of the primary goal of the ANSP model."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Sea Quark or Anomalous Gluon Interpretation for $g_1^p(x)$ ?", "source": "Hai-Yang Cheng", "docs_id": "hep-ph/9512267", "section": ["hep-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Sea Quark or Anomalous Gluon Interpretation for $g_1^p(x)$ ?. Contrary to what has been often claimed in the literature, we clarify that the hard photon-gluon cross section $\\gg_{\\rm hard}(x)$ in polarized deep inelastic scattering calculated in the gauge-invariant factorization scheme does {\\it not} involve any soft contributions and hence it is genuinely {\\it hard}.

Thereby, it is not pertinent to keep disputing which factorization prescription is correct or superior. The hard-gluonic contribution to $\\Gamma_1^p$, the first moment of $g_1^p(x)$, is purely factorization dependent. Nevertheless, we stress that even though hard gluons do not contribute to $\\Gamma_1^p$ in the gauge-invariant scheme, the gluon spin component in a proton, which is factorization independent, should be large enough to perturbatively generate a negative sea polarization via the axial anomaly.

We hypothesize that individual differences in how information is encoded in the brain are task-specific and predict different behavior measures. We propose a framework using encoding-models to identify individual differences in brain encoding and test if these differences can predict behavior.
