Fetal ultrasound screening during pregnancy plays a vital role in the early detection of fetal malformations which have potential long-term health impacts. The level of skill required to diagnose such malformations from live ultrasound during examination is high and resources for screening are often limited. We present an interpretable, atlas-learning segmentation method for automatic diagnosis of Hypo-plastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) from a single `4 Chamber Heart' view image. We propose to extend the recently introduced Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks (Atlas-ISTN) into a framework that enables sensitising atlas generation to disease. In this framework we can jointly learn image segmentation, registration, atlas construction and disease prediction while providing a maximum level of clinical interpretability compared to direct image classification methods.

We focus on the set of wave modes which can interact quasi-resonantly at a particular level of resonance broadening and aim to characterise how the structure of this set changes as the level of resonance broadening is varied. The commonly held view that resonance broadening can be thought of as a thickening of the resonant manifold is misleading.

The statics, stability and dynamical properties of dark-bright soliton pairs are investigated motivated by applications in a homogeneous system of two-component repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. One of the intra-species interaction coefficients is used as the relevant parameter controlling the deviation from the integrable Manakov limit. Two different families of stationary states are identified consisting of dark-bright solitons that are either antisymmetric (out-of-phase) or asymmetric (mass imbalanced) with respect to their bright soliton. Both of the above dark-bright configurations coexist at the integrable limit of equal intra- and inter-species repulsions and are degenerate in that limit. However, they are found to bifurcate from it in a transcritical bifurcation. The latter interchanges the stability properties of the bound dark-bright pairs rendering the antisymmetric states unstable and the asymmetric ones stable past the associated critical point (and vice versa before it). Finally, on the dynamical side, it is found that large kinetic energies and thus rapid soliton collisions are essentially unaffected by the intra-species variation, while cases involving near equilibrium states or breathing dynamics are significantly modified under such a variation."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a study of dark-bright soliton pairs in a two-component repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, which of the following statements is correct regarding the behavior of antisymmetric and asymmetric configurations as the system deviates from the integrable Manakov limit?\n\nA) Antisymmetric configurations remain stable while asymmetric configurations become unstable.\n\nB) Both antisymmetric and asymmetric configurations maintain their stability properties.\n\nC) Antisymmetric configurations become unstable while asymmetric configurations become stable.\n\nD) The stability properties of both configurations oscillate periodically as the system deviates from the Manakov limit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex behavior of dark-bright soliton pairs as the system deviates from the integrable Manakov limit.
