The dynamic behavior of scalp potentials (EEG) is apparently due to some combination of global and local processes with important top-down and bottom-up interactions across spatial scales. In treating global mechanisms, we stress the importance of myelinated axon propagation delays and periodic boundary conditions in the cortical-white matter system, which is topologically close to a spherical shell. By contrast, the proposed local mechanisms are multiscale interactions between cortical columns via short-ranged non-myelinated fibers. A mechanical model consisting of a stretched string with attached nonlinear springs demonstrates the general idea. The string produces standing waves analogous to large-scale coherence EEG observed in some brain states. The attached springs are analogous to the smaller (mesoscopic) scale columnar dynamics. Generally, we expect string displacement and EEG at all scales to result from both global and local phenomena.

Steps of a task may have precedence constraints among them. Moreover, there are variations in loads of different types of tasks requiring different skill-sets and availabilities of different types of agents with different skill-sets. Considering these constraints together necessitates the design of novel schemes to allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require allocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized and offer customers (task requesters) the freedom to choose agents.

The recent hardware upgrade in data acquisition systems results in significant increase in data complexity, including their sizes and dimensions. Measurements of densely sampled data higher than three dimensions, usually composed of 3D data as a function of external parameters, are becoming commonplace in various applications in the natural sciences and engineering. The initial understanding of these complex multidimensional datasets often requires human intervention through visual examination, which may be hampered by the varying levels of contrast permeating through the dimensions. We show both qualitatively and quantitatively that using our multidimensional extension of CLAHE (MCLAHE) simultaneously on all dimensions of the datasets allows better visualization and discernment of multidimensional image features, as demonstrated using cases from 4D photoemission spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy.

Here's why:\n\n1. The data is 4D, and MCLAHE is specifically designed to handle multidimensional data higher than three dimensions, which is exactly the case with 4D photoemission spectroscopy data.\n\n2. MCLAHE applies the contrast enhancement simultaneously on all dimensions of the dataset, which allows for better visualization and discernment of multidimensional image features.\n\n3.

Traditional 2D CLAHE (option A) is not suitable for 4D data as it's designed for 2D images.\n\n5.

This paper establishes a relaxed formulation of the harvesting model in such a manner that existence of an optimal relaxed harvesting policy can not only be proven but also identified.

The paper introduces a relaxed formulation of the harvesting model and embeds it in an infinite-dimensional linear program over occupation measures.
