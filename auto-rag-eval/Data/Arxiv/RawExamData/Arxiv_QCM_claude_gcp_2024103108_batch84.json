In this work we present a theoretical and numerical study of the behaviour of the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a generic coupled-map-lattice in the weak-coupling regime. We explain the observed results by introducing a suitable continuous-time formulation of the tangent dynamics. The first general result is that the deviation of the Lyapunov exponent from the uncoupled-limit limit is function of a single scaling parameter which, in the case of strictly positive multipliers, is the ratio of the coupling strength with the variance of local multipliers. Moreover, we find an approximate analytic expression for the Lyapunov exponent by mapping the problem onto the evolution of a chain of nonlinear Langevin equations, which are eventually reduced to a single stochastic equation. The probability distribution of this dynamical equation provides an excellent description for the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent.

In general, real world signals are analog in nature. To capture these signals for further processing, or transmission, signals are converted into digital bits using analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

In this paper, we propose a Two-Stage Network with Channel Attention (denoted as TSN-CA) to enhance the brightness of the low-light image and restore the enhanced images from various kinds of degradation.

Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) has emerged as a key MCMC algorithm for Bayesian learning from large scale datasets.
