We consider a two-level profit-maximizing strategy, including planning and control, for battery energy storage system (BESS) owners that participate in the primary frequency control (PFC) market. Specifically, the optimal BESS control minimizes the operating cost by keeping the state of charge (SoC) in an optimal range. Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the optimal BESS control is a \"state-invariant\" strategy in the sense that the optimal SoC range does not vary with the state of the system. As such, the optimal control strategy can be computed offline once and for all with very low complexity. Regarding the BESS planning, we prove that the the minimum operating cost is a decreasing convex function of the BESS energy capacity. This leads to the optimal BESS sizing that strikes a balance between the capital investment and operating cost.

We present a multiband optical light curve, covering the time from the onset of the gamma-ray event to several months after, when we only detect the host galaxy. Together with X-ray, millimetre and radio observations we compile what, to our knowledge, is the most complete multiband coverage of an XRR burst afterglow to date. Results.

Therefore, quantification of the transition of T_c to early hypothermia is of great clinical interest. Conceptually, T_c may exhibit an either gradual or abrupt transition.

For large-scale industrial processes under closed-loop control, process dynamics directly resulting from control action are typical characteristics and may show different behaviors between real faults and normal changes of operating conditions. However, conventional distributed monitoring approaches do not consider the closed-loop control mechanism and only explore static characteristics, which thus are incapable of distinguishing between real process faults and nominal changes of operating conditions, leading to unnecessary alarms. In this regard, this paper proposes a distributed monitoring method for closed-loop industrial processes by concurrently exploring static and dynamic characteristics. First, the large-scale closed-loop process is decomposed into several subsystems by developing a sparse slow feature analysis (SSFA) algorithm which capture changes of both static and dynamic information. Second, distributed models are developed to separately capture static and dynamic characteristics from the local and global aspects. Based on the distributed monitoring system, a two-level monitoring strategy is proposed to check different influences on process characteristics resulting from changes of the operating conditions and control action, and thus the two changes can be well distinguished from each other.

Single cell experiments of simple regulatory networks can markedly differ from cell population experiments. Such differences arise from stochastic events in individual cells that are averaged out in cell populations. For instance, while individual cells may show sustained oscillations in the concentrations of some proteins, such oscillations may appear damped in the population average. In this paper we investigate the role of RNA stochastic fluctuations as a leading force to produce a sustained excitatory behavior at the single cell level. Opposed to some previous models, we build a fully stochastic model of a negative feedback loop that explicitly takes into account the RNA stochastic dynamics. We find that messenger RNA random fluctuations can be amplified during translation and produce sustained pulses of protein expression. Motivated by the recent appreciation of the importance of non--coding regulatory RNAs in post--transcription regulation, we also consider the possibility that a regulatory RNA transcript could bind to the messenger RNA and repress translation.
