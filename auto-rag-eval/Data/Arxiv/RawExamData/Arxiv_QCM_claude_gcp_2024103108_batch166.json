Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This paper addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgements these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets, to reflect equity choices, while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions.

Either the species surviving competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum, or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space. Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel, which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard competition model with constant carrying capacity.

With the advent of high-resolution infrared spectrographs, Radial Velocity (RV) searches enter into a new domain. As of today, the most important technical question to address is which wavelength reference is the most suitable for high-precision RV measurements. In this work we explore the usage of atmospheric absorption features. We make use of CRIRES data on two programs and three different targets. We re-analyze the data of the TW Hya campaign, reaching a dispersion of about 6 m/s on the RV standard in a time scale of roughly 1 week. We confirm the presence of a low-amplitude RV signal on TW Hya itself, roughly 3 times smaller than the one reported at visible wavelengths. We present RV measurements of Gl 86 as well, showing that our approach is capable of detecting the signal induced by a planet and correctly quantifying it. Our data show that CRIRES is capable of reaching a RV precision of less than 10 m/s in a time-scale of one week. The limitations of this particular approach are discussed, and the limiting factors on RV precision in the IR in a general way.

The performances of optical fibre-based quantum information systems are limited by the intrinsic properties of silica glass materials, e.g. high latency, Rayleigh-scattering loss wavelength scaling law, and cross-coupling induced modal impurity. Hollow-core optical fibre (HCF) promises to unify air-borne light propagation and non-line-of-sight transmission, thus holding great potentials for versatile photonics-based quantum infor-mation applications. The early version of HCF based on photonic-bandgap guidance has not proven itself as a reliable quantum channel because of the poor modal purity in both spatial and polarization domains, as well as significant difficulty in fabrication when the wavelength shifts to the visible region. In this work, based on the polarization degree of freedom, we first, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrate high-fidelity (~0.98) single-photon transmission and distribution of entangled photons over a conjoined-tube hollow-core fibre (CTF) by using commercial silicon single-photon avalanche photodiodes. Our CTF realized the combined merits of low loss, high spatial mode purity, low polarization degradation, and low chromatic dispersion.

We propose Network Enhancement (NE), a method for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of undirected, weighted networks. NE uses a doubly stochastic matrix operator that induces sparsity and provides a closed-form solution that increases spectral eigengap of the input network. As a result, NE removes weak edges, enhances real connections, and leads to better downstream performance.

A procedure is set up in order to identify the parameters of our model by superimposing the experimentally-based profile of the reflection coefficient (plotted as function of the frequency of the traveling waves) with the analogous profile obtained via simulations based upon the relaxed micromorphic model.
