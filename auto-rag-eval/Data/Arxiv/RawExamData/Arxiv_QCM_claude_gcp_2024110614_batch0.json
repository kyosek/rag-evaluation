In this work we study analytically and numerically the transport properties of non-interacting active particles moving on a $d$-dimensional disordered media. The disorder in the space is modeled by means of a set of non-overlapping spherical obstacles. We assume that obstacles are reactive in the sense that they react in the presence of the particles in an attractive manner: when the particle collides with an obstacle, it is attached during a random time (adsorption time), i.e., it gets adsorbed by an obstacle; thereafter the particle is detached from the obstacle and continues its motion in a random direction. We give an analytical formula for the effective diffusion coefficient when the mean adsorption time is finite. When the mean adsorption time is infinite, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a normal to anomalous diffusion regime. We also show that another transition takes place in the mean number of adsorbed particles: in the anomalous diffusion phase all the particles become adsorbed in the average. We show that the fraction of adsorbed particles, seen as an order parameter of the system, undergoes a second-order-like phase transition, because the fraction of adsorbed particles is not differentiable but changes continuously as a function of a parameter of the model."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about active particles in reactive disordered media, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In a study of active particles moving through a disordered medium with reactive obstacles, researchers observe a sudden change in the system's behavior as they vary a certain parameter.

We compute the distributions of charged particles at large transverse momenta in $p\\bar p(p)$, $pA$ and $AA$ collisions in the framework of perturbative QCD, by using collinear factorization and the modern PDFs and fragmentation functions. At the highest cms-energies the shape of the spectra measured in $p\\bar p(p)$ collisions at large $q_T$ can be well explained. The difference between the data and the lowest-order computation is quantified in terms of a constant $K$-factor for each energy. The $K$-factor is found to systematically decrease with growing $\\sqrt s$. Also a lower limit for the partonic transverse momentum, $p_0$, is extracted for each $\\sqrt s$ based on the comparison with the measurements.

In this type of applications, detection delay is of paramount importance. We model this problem as quickest change detection problem with a stochastic energy constraint. In particular, a wireless sensor powered by renewable energy takes observations from a random sequence, whose distribution will change at a certain unknown time. Such a change implies events of interest. The energy in the sensor is consumed by taking observations and is replenished randomly. The sensor cannot take observations if there is no energy left in the battery. Our goal is to design a power allocation scheme and a detection strategy to minimize the worst case detection delay, which is the difference between the time when an alarm is raised and the time when the change occurs. Two types of average run length (ARL) constraint, namely an algorithm level ARL constraint and an system level ARL constraint, are considered.

The Van der Pol equation is a paradigmatic model of relaxation oscillations. This remarkable nonlinear phenomenon of self-sustained oscillatory motion underlies important rhythmic processes in nature and electrical engineering. Relaxation oscillations in a real system are usually coupled to environmental noise, which further enriches their dynamics, but makes theoretical analysis of such systems and determination of the equation's parameter values a difficult task. In a companion paper we have proposed an analytic approach to a similar problem for another classical nonlinear model, the bistable Duffing oscillator. Here we extend our techniques to the case of the Van der Pol equation driven by white noise. We analyze the statistics of solutions and propose a method to estimate parameter values from the oscillator's time series.
