We focus first on the cavity method, showing that it quickly provides the correct recursion equations both for single instances and at the ensemble level. We also describe an alternative replica solution that proves to be equivalent to the cavity method. Both the cavity and the replica derivations allow us to obtain the spectral density via the solution of an integral equation for an auxiliary probability density function. We show that this equation can be solved using a stochastic population dynamics algorithm, and we provide its implementation. In this formalism, the spectral density is naturally written in terms of a superposition of local contributions from nodes of given degree, whose role is thoroughly elucidated.

Over the last decades, images have become an important source of information in many domains, thus their high quality has become necessary to acquire better information. One of the important issues that arise is image denoising, which means recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples. This interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory, which is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then the original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much less, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling theories.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning architecture widely applied in different domains, in particular in classifying over images, for which the concept of convolution with a filter comes naturally. Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood function) in the input feature space has so far prevented its direct use on data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable, i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene co-expression. As a general tool, feature distance on omics data is enabled by OmicsConv, a novel Keras layer, obtaining OmicsCNN, a dedicated deep learning framework.

A plasma window (PW) is a device for separating two areas of different pressures while letting particle beams pass with little to no loss. It has been introduced by A. Hershcovitch. In the course of this publication, the properties of a PW with apertures of 3.3 mm and 5.0 mm are presented. Especially the link between the pressure properties relevant for applications in accelerator systems and the underlying plasma properties depending on external parameters are presented. At the low pressure side around some mbar, high-pressure values reached up to 750 mbar while operating with volume flows between 1 slm and 4 slm (standard liter per minute) and discharge currents ranging from 45 A to 60 A. Unique features of the presented PW include simultaneous plasma parameter determination and the absence of ceramic insulators between the cooling plates. Optical analysis reveals no significant damage or wear to the components after an operation time well over 10 h, whereas the cathode needle needs replacement after 5 h."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary function of a plasma window (PW) in separating two areas of different pressures, and how does it relate to the properties of a plasma window?\n\nA) To create a vacuum environment by removing particles from the high-pressure side, allowing for efficient particle beam transmission.\nB) To maintain a constant pressure difference between the two areas, while minimizing particle losses and maximizing transmission efficiency.\nC) To generate a high-voltage discharge to ionize the gas and create a plasma, which then acts as a membrane to separate the two areas.\nD) To utilize the plasma properties to create a pressure gradient, which drives the particle beam through the plasma window.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) To maintain a constant pressure difference between the two areas, while minimizing particle losses and maximizing transmission efficiency.\n\nExplanation: The plasma window is designed to separate two areas of different pressures, allowing for efficient transmission of particle beams while minimizing losses. The properties of the plasma window, such as the pressure properties and plasma parameters, are crucial in determining its performance and efficiency. The correct answer highlights the primary function of the plasma window, which is to maintain a constant pressure difference between the two areas, while minimizing particle losses and maximizing transmission efficiency.\n\nNote: The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA) The plasma window does not create a vacuum environment by removing particles from the high-pressure side.\n\nC) The plasma window does not generate a high-voltage discharge to ionize the gas and create a plasma.\n\nD) The plasma window does not utilize the plasma properties to create a pressure gradient, but rather relies on the plasma properties to maintain a constant pressure difference between the two areas."}}
