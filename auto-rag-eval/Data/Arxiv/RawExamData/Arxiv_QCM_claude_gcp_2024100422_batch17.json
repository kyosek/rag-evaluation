In this particular case, we find that the parameters which dominate the limit-cycle properties are the mass-supply rate and the value of the alpha-viscosity parameter.

Prior work has shown that the data and hyperparameters can be quantized heavily without incurring much penalty in classification accuracy when compared to floating point implementations.

Unfortunately, pristine PS has limited wettability and poor chemical stability in electrolytes and the high resistance of the PS matrix severely limits the power efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that excellent wettability and electro-chemical properties in aqueous and organic electrolytes can be obtained by coating the PS matrix with an ultra-thin layer of titanium nitride by atomic layer deposition. Our approach leads to very high specific capacitance (15 F/cm$^3$), energy density (1.3 mWh/cm$^3$), power density (up to 214 W/cm$^3$) and excellent stability (more than 13,000 cycles). Furthermore, we show that the PS-TiN nanomaterial can be integrated inside a silicon chip monolithically by combining MEMS and nanofabrication techniques.

Recent breakthroughs in object detection and image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are revolutionizing the state of the art in medical imaging, and microscopy in particular presents abundant opportunities for computer vision algorithms to assist medical professionals in diagnosis of diseases ranging from malaria to cancer. High resolution scans of microscopy slides called Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offer enough information for a cancer pathologist to come to a conclusion regarding cancer presence, subtype, and severity based on measurements of features within the slide image at multiple scales and resolutions.

Resource competition theory predicts coexistence and exclusion patterns based on species R*s, the minimum resource values required for a species to persist. A central assumption of the theory is that all species have equal access to resources. However, many systems are characterized by preemption exploitation, where some species deplete resources before their competitors can access them (e.g., asymmetric light competition, contest competition among animals). We hypothesize that coexistence under preemption requires an R*-preemption tradeoff, i.e., the species with the priority access should have a higher R* (lower efficiency). Thus, we developed an extension of resource competition theory to investigate partial and total preemption (in the latter, the preemptor is unaffected by species with lower preemption rank). We found that an R*-preemption tradeoff is a necessary condition for coexistence in all models. Moreover, under total preemption, the tradeoff alone is sufficient for coexistence. In contrast, under partial preemption, more conditions are needed, which restricts the parameter space of coexistence.
