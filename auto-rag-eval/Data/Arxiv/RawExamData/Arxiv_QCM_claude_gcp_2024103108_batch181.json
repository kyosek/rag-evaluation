This paper studies the finite horizon portfolio management by optimally tracking a ratcheting capital benchmark process. It is assumed that the fund manager can dynamically inject capital into the portfolio account such that the total capital dominates a non-decreasing benchmark floor process at each intermediate time. The tracking problem is formulated to minimize the cost of accumulated capital injection. We first transform the original problem with floor constraints into an unconstrained control problem, however, under a running maximum cost. By identifying a controlled state process with reflection, the problem is further shown to be equivalent to an auxiliary problem, which leads to a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with a Neumann boundary condition. By employing the dual transform, the probabilistic representation and some stochastic flow analysis, the existence of the unique classical solution to the HJB equation is established. The verification theorem is carefully proved, which gives the complete characterization of the feedback optimal portfolio.

Option A is correct because it directly addresses the paradox of lower detection rates despite higher radio core luminosities.

Entrepreneurship is often touted for its ability to generate economic growth. Through the creative-destructive process, entrepreneurs are often able to innovate and outperform incumbent organizations, all of which is supposed to lead to higher employment and economic growth. Although some empirical evidence supports this logic, it has also been the subject of recent criticisms. Specifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries; it only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to 2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth. Our evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously undiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages economic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence finds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in more developed countries but not in developing countries.

Computer-aided drug discovery is an essential component of modern drug development. Therein, deep learning has become an important tool for rapid screening of billions of molecules in silico for potential hits containing desired chemical features. Despite its importance, substantial challenges persist in training these models, such as severe class imbalance, high decision thresholds, and lack of ground truth labels in some datasets. In this work we argue in favor of directly optimizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in such cases, due to its robustness to class imbalance, its ability to compromise over different decision thresholds, certain freedom to influence the relative weights in this compromise, fidelity to typical benchmarking measures, and equivalence to positive/unlabeled learning. We also propose new training schemes (coherent mini-batch arrangement, and usage of out-of-batch samples) for cost functions based on the ROC, as well as a cost function based on the logAUC metric that facilitates early enrichment (i.e. improves performance at high decision thresholds, as often desired when synthesizing predicted hit compounds).
