This refined Martini model was reported to reproduce experimental phase diagrams for a ternary DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol mixture, including the coexistence of two liquid phases. However, we demonstrate that this coexistence only emerged due to an unfortunate choice of simulation parameters, which leads to poor energy conservation. Specifically, the constraints on the cholesterol model drained energy out from the membrane, resulting in two coexisting phases at drastically different temperatures. Using the simulation parameters recommended for the used cholesterol model, this artefact is eliminated, yet so is phase coexistence, i.e. experimental phase diagrams are no longer reproduced. It is important to highlight that the present comment was submitted to Chemical Theory and Computation.

Which of the following best describes the problem with the original study and its implications?\n\nA) The model only worked due to an error in data analysis, but when corrected, still accurately reproduced experimental results.\n\nB) The simulation parameters led to poor energy conservation, creating artificial phase coexistence.

The matching game is a cooperative game where the value of every coalition is the maximum revenue of players in the coalition can make by forming pairwise disjoint partners.

In this paper, we study profit-sharing in multiple partners matching games. A central concept for profit-sharing is the core which consists of all possible ways of distributing the profit among individual players such that the grand coalition remains intact. The core of multiple partners matching games may be empty [Deng et al., Algorithmic aspects of the core of combinatorial optimization games, Math. Oper.

In particular, we treat the residual as a probability density function and approximate it with a deep generative model, called KRnet. The new samples from KRnet are consistent with the distribution induced by the residual, i.e., more samples are located in the region of large residual and less samples are located in the region of small residual. Analogous to classical adaptive methods such as the adaptive finite element, KRnet acts as an error indicator that guides the refinement of the training set.

We propose a novel framework of the model specification test in regression using unlabeled test data. In many cases, we have conducted statistical inferences based on the assumption that we can correctly specify a model. However, it is difficult to confirm whether a model is correctly specified. To overcome this problem, existing works have devised statistical tests for model specification. Existing works have defined a correctly specified model in regression as a model with zero conditional mean of the error term over train data only. Extending the definition in conventional statistical tests, we define a correctly specified model as a model with zero conditional mean of the error term over any distribution of the explanatory variable. This definition is a natural consequence of the orthogonality of the explanatory variable and the error term. If a model does not satisfy this condition, the model might lack robustness with regards to the distribution shift.
