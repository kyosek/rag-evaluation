A statistical functional, such as the mean or the median, is called elicitable if there is a scoring function or loss function such that the correct forecast of the functional is the unique minimizer of the expected score. Such scoring functions are called strictly consistent for the functional. The elicitability of a functional opens the possibility to compare competing forecasts and to rank them in terms of their realized scores. In this paper, we explore the notion of elicitability for multi-dimensional functionals and give both necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions. We cover the case of functionals with elicitable components, but we also show that one-dimensional functionals that are not elicitable can be a component of a higher order elicitable functional. In the case of the variance this is a known result. However, an important result of this paper is that spectral risk measures with a spectral measure with finite support are jointly elicitable if one adds the `correct' quantiles.

While it's capable of handling various scenarios, option D presents the most challenging case for several reasons:\n\n1. Complex interactions: The approach aims to analyze relationships between multiple variables (returns, trading volume, transaction numbers) across different stocks.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that the researchers \"give an efficient algorithm for computing the revenue-optimal pricing curve.\" This pricing curve is described as a \"sequence of (price, time) pairs,\" which aligns with the strategy of developing a deterministic pricing curve that sets specific prices at different points in time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the research doesn't suggest that randomization improves revenue. In fact, it shows that deterministic pricing curves are optimal among a broader class of mechanisms.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on the mention that adaptive mechanisms can earn higher revenue. However, the question asks for the strategy most likely to be revenue-optimal according to the main findings, which focus on the efficiency and optimality of pricing curves.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the research explicitly states that \"mechanisms that allow the seller to post a menu of lotteries at each point of time cannot get any higher revenue than pricing curves.\"\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and differentiate between the optimal strategy and other related but less effective approaches mentioned in the research."}, "10": {"documentation": {"title": "First Extended Catalogue of Galactic Bubbles InfraRed Fluxes from WISE\n  and Herschel Surveys", "source": "F.

Here, we report the discovery of a long-period planet candidate, called HD 283869 b, orbiting a member of the Hyades cluster.

In the important case of Laplacian coupling, additional synchronization patterns can exist that would not be predicted from the group theory analysis alone.

Numerous methods for alleviating catastrophic forgetting are currently being proposed, but differences in evaluation protocols make it difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred.

Addressing the issue of efficiency, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback or backward connections.

Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to train models locally and formulate a global model, without sharing the clients' local data. A federated learning system can be viewed as a large-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders with diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated learning system requires both software system design thinking and machine learning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning from the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature review on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for software architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose FLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a template design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA reference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of federated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial implementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of architectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design problems in federated learning architectures.

This result is then extended to generalized Nash games, where we deduce two vector optimization problems providing necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for generalized Nash equilibria. Finally, we show that all prior results hold for vector-valued games as well.

This paper exploits the idea of computation replication in MEC networks to speed up the downloading phase. Computation replication allows each user to offload its task to multiple ENs for repetitive execution so as to create multiple copies of the computed result at different ENs which can then enable transmission cooperation and hence reduce the communication latency for result downloading.

The main contribution of this work is to characterize asymptotically an order-optimal upload-download communication latency pair for a given computation load in a multi-user multi-server MEC network.

In practice, however, the dynamical dependence across different curves may exist and the parametric assumption on the error covariance structure could be unrealistic. In this paper, we consider functional linear regression with serially dependent observations of the functional predictor, when the contamination of the predictor by the white noise is genuinely functional with fully nonparametric covariance structure.

The study shows that an attacker can build a Gabidulin code with the same dimension but lower length, so increasing the dimension alone wouldn't solve the problem.\n\nOption C is actually part of the attack method described in the documentation. The study shows that \"by applying the Frobenius operator appropriately on the public key, it is possible to build a Gabidulin code having the same dimension as the original secret Gabidulin code but with a lower length,\" which enables the attack.\n\nOption D is the most promising approach because the documentation concludes that \"all the existing techniques aiming to hide the inherent algebraic structure of Gabidulin codes have failed.\" This implies that a fundamentally new approach, not based on Gabidulin codes, would be necessary to overcome the vulnerabilities exposed by this cryptanalysis.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario (improving cryptosystem security), and think critically about potential solutions beyond what's explicitly stated in the text."}, "98": {"documentation": {"title": "Energy Dependence of Moments of Net-Proton, Net-Kaon, and Net-Charge\n  Multiplicity Distributions at STAR", "source": "Ji Xu (for the STAR Collaboration)", "docs_id": "1611.07134", "section": ["hep-ex", "nucl-ex"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Energy Dependence of Moments of Net-Proton, Net-Kaon, and Net-Charge\n  Multiplicity Distributions at STAR. One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program is to study the QCD phase structure, which includes the search for the QCD critical point, over a wide range of chemical potential. Theoretical calculations predict that fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon number (B), charge (Q), and strangeness (S), are sensitive to the correlation length of the dynamical system. Experimentally, higher moments of multiplicity distributions have been utilized to search for the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we report recent efficiency-corrected cumulants and cumulants ratios of the net- proton, net-kaon, and net-charge multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV collected in the years 2010, 2011, and 2014 with STAR at RHIC.

Which of the following conclusions is most supported by this observation?\n\nA) The collision energy corresponds to the critical point in the QCD phase diagram\nB) There is a technical malfunction in the detector system at this energy level\nC) The fluctuations are solely due to statistical fluctuations in the number of participants\nD) The system has reached the deconfinement phase transition at this energy\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The study aims to search for the QCD critical point using fluctuations of conserved quantities.\n2. Higher moments of multiplicity distributions (including the fourth-order cumulant) are used to search for the QCD critical point.\n3. The energy dependence of cumulants up to the fourth order is being studied.\n\nOption A is the most supported conclusion because:\n- Unexpected fluctuations in higher-order cumulants, especially the fourth-order, are theoretically predicted to be sensitive to the correlation length of the system, which diverges at the critical point.\n- The observation of such fluctuations at a specific energy could indicate proximity to the critical point in the QCD phase diagram.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no indication of detector malfunction in the documentation, and such technical issues would likely affect all measurements, not just one specific observable.\n\nOption C is unlikely because while statistical fluctuations do occur, the study uses efficiency-corrected cumulants and compares with baseline (Poisson) calculations, which would account for purely statistical effects.\n\nOption D is less likely because while the deconfinement phase transition is related to the QCD phase diagram, the specific signature of unexpected fluctuations in the fourth-order cumulant is more closely associated with critical point phenomena rather than the deconfinement transition itself.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a hypothetical scenario, and make a reasoned judgment based on the provided information, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "An Analytical Model for CBAP Allocations in IEEE 802.11ad", "source": "Chiara Pielli, Tanguy Ropitault, Nada Golmie, Michele Zorzi", "docs_id": "1906.07097", "section": ["cs.NI"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "An Analytical Model for CBAP Allocations in IEEE 802.11ad. The IEEE 802.11ad standard extends WiFi operation to the millimeter wave frequencies, and introduces novel features concerning both the physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. However, while there are extensive research efforts to develop mechanisms for establishing and maintaining directional links for mmWave communications, fewer works deal with transmission scheduling and the hybrid MAC introduced by the standard. The hybrid MAC layer provides for two different kinds of resource allocations: Contention Based Access Periods (CBAPs) and contention free Service Periods (SPs). In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain model to represent CBAPs, which takes into account operation interruptions due to scheduled SPs and the deafness and hidden node problems that directional communication exacerbates. We also propose a mathematical analysis to assess interference among stations. We derive analytical expressions to assess the impact of various transmission parameters and of the Data Transmission Interval configuration on some key performance metrics such as throughput, delay and packet dropping rate. This information may be used to efficiently design a transmission scheduler that allocates contention-based and contention-free periods based on the application requirements."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about IEEE 802.11ad and CBAP allocations, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a scheduling algorithm for an IEEE 802.11ad network in a busy office environment. The network needs to support both high-priority video conferencing and general web browsing. Given the hybrid MAC layer of 802.11ad, which approach would most effectively balance performance and fairness?\n\nA) Allocate all available time to Contention Based Access Periods (CBAPs) to maximize channel utilization\nB) Use only Service Periods (SPs) to eliminate interference between stations\nC) Implement a dynamic scheduling system that adjusts the ratio of CBAPs to SPs based on real-time network analysis\nD) Assign fixed-length SPs to all stations and use remaining time for CBAPs\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the IEEE 802.11ad standard, specifically the hybrid MAC layer with CBAPs and SPs. The correct answer (C) is the most effective approach because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the need for both CBAPs and SPs, as mentioned in the documentation. CBAPs allow for contention-based access suitable for general web browsing, while SPs provide contention-free periods ideal for high-priority traffic like video conferencing.\n\n2. A dynamic scheduling system addresses the real-world scenario of a busy office with varying traffic patterns. It can adapt to changes in network load and application requirements, which is crucial for maintaining performance.\n\n3. The approach takes into account the potential issues mentioned in the documentation, such as \"deafness and hidden node problems that directional communication exacerbates.\" By adjusting the ratio of CBAPs to SPs in real-time, the system can mitigate these issues as they arise.\n\n4. It aligns with the documentation's suggestion of \"efficiently design[ing] a transmission scheduler that allocates contention-based and contention-free periods based on the application requirements.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because using only CBAPs would not provide the necessary QoS for high-priority traffic. Option B is too restrictive and would not efficiently use the channel for general web browsing. Option D lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to changing network conditions. The correct answer requires integration of multiple concepts and consideration of real-world application, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}}
