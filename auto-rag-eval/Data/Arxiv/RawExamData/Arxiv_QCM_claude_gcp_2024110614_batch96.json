The documentation states that SU(3) symmetry can be realized in a truncated shell-model space if constructed with a sufficient number of collective pairs (S, D, G, etc.).\n2. It specifically mentions that for 6 protons and 6 neutrons in the pf shell, SDG pairs can exactly reproduce the level energies and electric quadrupole properties of the ground-state rotational band.\n3. The structure of the pairs needs to be optimally determined, with one method being conjugate-gradient minimization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the SD-pair approximation without significant renormalization cannot describe the full SU(3) collectivity.\n\nOption C, while potentially accurate, would be computationally intensive and unnecessary given the effectiveness of the truncated space with optimized pairs.\n\nOption D is incorrect for two reasons: first, it mentions SDGI pairs, which are used for the sdg shell, not the pf shell specified in the question.

This co-designed framework is able to adapt during acquisition in order to capture the most informative measurements for a particular target (Figure 1).

The dual formulation of this problem has been solved previously by Zhao et al. in a decentralized manner for consumer disutilities that are twice continuously differentiable with respect to consumption changes. In this work, we propose a decentralized multi-block alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (DM-ADMM) algorithm to solve this problem.

This makes it particularly suitable for scenarios where consumer behavior or load characteristics may not be smooth or continuous.\n\nOption C, involving discrete on/off loads like refrigeration units, represents a scenario where the disutility function would likely be non-smooth or discontinuous. Refrigeration units typically operate in binary states (on or off) rather than with continuous power adjustment. This creates step changes in power consumption, leading to non-smooth disutility functions that are challenging for algorithms requiring continuous differentiability.\n\nOption A (thermostats with small increments) and B (continuously variable motors) both represent scenarios with relatively smooth and continuous power adjustments, which could be handled effectively by the dual ascent algorithm.

The purpose of this study is to describe the failure of concrete around dowel bars in jointed rigid pavements, and the resulting effect on the pavement performance. In fact, under repetitive vehicle loading, concrete in contact with the dowel bar deteriorates, particularly at the joint face. The degradation of concrete around the dowel negatively affects the latter's performance in terms of transferring wheel loads through vertical shear action. In this context, a nonlinear 3D Finite Element analysis was performed using the commercial FE code Abaqus (v-6.11). The FE model was validated with classical analytical solutions of shear and moment along the dowel. A concrete damaged plasticity model was used for the PCC slab to model the degradation of concrete matrix around the dowels under incremental loading. Results obtained show, among other things, that the degradation of concrete matrix around the dowel was found to initiate at the face of the joint and propagate towards the interior of the dowel. Also, results obtained confirmed the decrease in load transfer capability of the dowels as the PCC matrix deteriorates.

We present a formalism for constructing schematic diagrams to depict chaotic three-body interactions in Newtonian gravity. This is done by decomposing each interaction in to a series of discrete transformations in energy- and angular momentum-space. Each time a transformation is applied, the system changes state as the particles re-distribute their energy and angular momenta. These diagrams have the virtue of containing all of the quantitative information needed to fully characterize most bound or unbound interactions through time and space, including the total duration of the interaction, the initial and final stable states in addition to every intervening temporary meta-stable state. As shown via an illustrative example for the bound case, prolonged excursions of one of the particles, which by far dominates the computational cost of the simulations, are reduced to a single discrete transformation in energy- and angular momentum-space, thereby potentially mitigating any computational expense. We further generalize our formalism to sequences of (unbound) three-body interactions, as occur in dense stellar environments during binary hardening. Finally, we provide a method for dynamically evolving entire populations of binaries via three-body scattering interactions, using a purely analytic formalism.

This approach excels at representing sequences of three-body interactions, which are common in dense stellar environments during binary hardening.\n\nThe method decomposes each interaction into discrete transformations in energy- and angular momentum-space.

It can efficiently represent multiple three-body interactions over time, which is exactly what happens when a binary system encounters multiple passing stars in a dense cluster.\n\n2.

Adaptive nuclear-norm penalization is proposed for low-rank matrix approximation, by which we develop a new reduced-rank estimation method for the general high-dimensional multivariate regression problems.

For example, the pre-specified weights may be some negative power of the singular values of the data matrix (or its projection in regression setting). The adaptive nuclear norm is generally non-convex under the natural restriction that the weight decreases with the singular value.

Dynamic models of biochemical networks typically consist of sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations involving states (concentrations or amounts of the components of the network) and parameters describing the reaction kinetics.

In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models are universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In this work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of identifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of examples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness inherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data or noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and iv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design? Our results indicate that sloppiness is not equivalent to lack of structural or practical identifiability (although they can be related), so sloppy models can be identifiable.

Weak interaction charged current transition strengths from highly excited nuclear states are fundamental ingredients for accurate modeling of compact object composition and dynamics, but are difficult to obtain either from experiment or theory. For lack of alternatives, calculations have often fallen back upon a generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis, that is, assuming the strength function (transition probability) is independent of the initial nuclear state but depends only upon the transition energy and the weak interaction properties of the parent nucleus ground state. Here we present numerical evidence for a modified `local' Brink-Axel hypothesis for Gamow-Teller transitions for $pf$-shell nuclei relevant to astrophysical applications. Specifically, while the original Brink-Axel hypothesis does not hold globally, strength functions from initial states nearby in energy are similar within statistical fluctuations. This agrees with previous work on strength function moments. Using this modified hypothesis, we can tackle strength functions at previously intractable initial energies, using semi-converged initial states at arbitrary excitation energy. Our work provides a well-founded method for computing accurate thermal weak transition rates for medium-mass nuclei at temperatures occurring in stellar cores near collapse.
