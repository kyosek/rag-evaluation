Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions of microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod models have emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based description of microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we present a two-step inverse method for estimating the constitutive law using rod theory and data generated from discrete-structure simulations. We illustrate the method on a filament with an artificial and simplistic discrete-structure. We simulate its deformation in response to a prescribed loading using a multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. Using data generated from the MBD solver, we first estimate the curvature of the filament and subsequently use it in the two-step method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between the restoring moment and curvature. Finally, we also illustrate how the estimated constitutive law can be tested under independent loading conditions."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a new computational model for DNA dynamics.

Detection of rare variants by resequencing is important for the identification of individuals carrying disease variants. Rapid sequencing by new technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it is still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve cost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which enable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals. However, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals in a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases. We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach, which is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental procedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially in situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual. Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance performance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing costs.

This conclusion is based on several key points:\n\n1. Despite having a prominent main sequence in its color-magnitude diagram, Cetus II shows no evidence of a concentrated stellar overdensity.\n2. The stellar population properties of Cetus II (age, metallicity, and alpha-element abundance) match well with the Sagittarius galaxy's Population B stars.\n3. Cetus II is spatially located within the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Cetus II does have an unusual stellar distribution, the evidence points to it not being a dwarf galaxy at all. Option C is a distractor based on the misconception that the lack of overdensity implies a transition between object types, which is not supported by the documentation. Option D is tempting because Cetus II is described as occupying a transition zone in size between dwarf galaxies and star clusters, but the evidence suggests it's not a distinct class of object, rather part of a tidal stream.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a real-world astronomical scenario, and draw accurate conclusions about the nature of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "On the robustness of q-expectation values and Renyi entropy", "source": "Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner, Constantino Tsallis", "docs_id": "0812.3855", "section": ["cond-mat.stat-mech"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "On the robustness of q-expectation values and Renyi entropy.

Gait recognition is one of the most important biometric technologies and has been applied in many fields. Recent gait recognition frameworks represent each gait frame by descriptors extracted from either global appearances or local regions of humans. However, the representations based on global information often neglect the details of the gait frame, while local region based descriptors cannot capture the relations among neighboring regions, thus reducing their discriminativeness. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction and fusion framework to achieve discriminative feature representations for gait recognition. Towards this goal, we take advantage of both global visual information and local region details and develop a Global and Local Feature Extractor (GLFE). Specifically, our GLFE module is composed of our newly designed multiple global and local convolutional layers (GLConv) to ensemble global and local features in a principle manner. Furthermore, we present a novel operation, namely Local Temporal Aggregation (LTA), to further preserve the spatial information by reducing the temporal resolution to obtain higher spatial resolution.

We propose a new class of models, which describe the individuals as \\emph{agents}, capable of deciding for themselves how to act and learning from their experiences. The local interaction rules do not need to be postulated in this model, since they \\emph{emerge} from the learning process. We apply this ansatz to a concrete scenario involving marching locusts, in order to model the phenomenon of density-dependent alignment. We show that our learning agent-based model can account for a Fokker-Planck equation that describes the collective motion and, most notably, that the agents can learn the appropriate local interactions, requiring no strong previous assumptions on their form. These results suggest that learning agent-based models are a powerful tool for studying a broader class of problems involving collective motion and animal agency in general."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about collective motion and agent-based modeling, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In a study of locust marching behavior, researchers want to model density-dependent alignment without making strong assumptions about local interaction rules.

This choice aligns with the key principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. It doesn't require strong previous assumptions about the form of local interactions, which is a limitation of traditional models (eliminating option C).\n\n2. The model allows for the emergence of interaction rules through the learning process, rather than imposing predetermined rules. This is crucial for studying density-dependent alignment without bias.\n\n3. It incorporates the concept of agency, where individuals can decide for themselves how to act and learn from experiences. This is more realistic for modeling animal behavior than fixed rules or probabilities (ruling out option D).\n\n4. While the model can account for a Fokker-Planck equation (mentioned in option A), starting with the equation would be a top-down approach that doesn't capture the underlying individual behaviors and learning processes.\n\n5. This approach integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including collective motion, agency, learning, and emergent behavior, making it a more comprehensive solution.\n\nBy choosing the learning agent-based model, researchers can study how local interactions emerge from individual learning processes, providing insights into density-dependent alignment without imposing preconceived notions about the rules governing locust behavior.

At the transmitters, the SM scheme is employed, i.e., only one transmitter is active at each time instant. To choose the active transmitter, a uniform selection (US) scheme is utilized. Two scenarios are considered: one is with non-negativity and average optical intensity constraints, the other is with non-negativity, average optical intensity and peak optical intensity constraints.

The documentation states that the greedy selection (GS) scheme has the best performance in terms of secrecy rate, followed by the channel adaptive selection (CAS) scheme, and then the uniform selection (US) scheme.\n\n2.

However, it then reveals that the TMI phase can be stabilized by tuning the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point of the electron band.\n\nSpecifically, the text mentions that \"By suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the topological insulator emerges in an extended region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking surviving competitions with other orders.\" This directly supports option C as the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply increasing electron-electron interactions doesn't guarantee TMI stability; the documentation emphasizes the importance of tuning specific parameters like Fermi velocity.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on the common misconception that topological states always require strong magnetic fields. The document doesn't suggest this as a solution for stabilizing the TMI phase.\n\nOption D is incorrect and represents a misconception. The documentation actually states that the CDW order competes with and can overtake the TMI phase, so enhancing it would likely further destabilize the TMI.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a hypothetical scenario, and identify the most effective strategy for achieving a specific outcome, aligning with higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "83": {"documentation": {"title": "On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Fairness", "source": "Hongyan Chang, Reza Shokri", "docs_id": "2011.03731", "section": ["stat.ML", "cs.CR", "cs.CY", "cs.LG"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Fairness.

Inverter based renewable generation (RG), especially at the distribution level, is supposed to trip offline during an islanding situation. However, islanding detection is done by comparing the voltage and frequency measurements at the point of common coupling (PCC), with limits defined in the form of ride-through curves. Current practice is to use the same limit throughout the year independent of the operating conditions. This could result in the tripping of RG at times when the system is already weak, thereby posing a threat to voltage security by heavily limiting the load margin (LM). Conversely, heavily relaxing these limits would result in scenarios where the generation does not go offline even during an islanding situation. The proposed methodology focuses on optimizing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) settings at selective RGs as a preventive control for maintaining a desired steady-state voltage stability margin while not sacrificing dependability during islanding.
