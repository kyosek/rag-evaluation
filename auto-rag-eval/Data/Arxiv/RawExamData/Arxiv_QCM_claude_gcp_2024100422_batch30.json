The recent growth in the number of satellite images fosters the development of effective deep-learning techniques for Remote Sensing (RS). However, their full potential is untapped due to the lack of large annotated datasets. Such a problem is usually countered by fine-tuning a feature extractor that is previously trained on the ImageNet dataset. Unfortunately, the domain of natural images differs from the RS one, which hinders the final performance. In this work, we propose to learn meaningful representations from satellite imagery, leveraging its high-dimensionality spectral bands to reconstruct the visible colors. We conduct experiments on land cover classification (BigEarthNet) and West Nile Virus detection, showing that colorization is a solid pretext task for training a feature extractor. Furthermore, we qualitatively observe that guesses based on natural images and colorization rely on different parts of the input.

The text states that given an invertible endofunctor of a triangulated category with a sufficiently nice collection of eigenmaps, idempotent functors are constructed which project to eigencategories.

Robust support vector machine (RSVM) has been shown to perform remarkably well to improve the generalization performance of support vector machine under the noisy environment. Unfortunately, in order to handle the non-convexity induced by ramp loss in RSVM, existing RSVM solvers often adopt the DC programming framework which is computationally inefficient for running multiple outer loops. This hinders the application of RSVM to large-scale problems. Safe sample screening that allows for the exclusion of training samples prior to or early in the training process is an effective method to greatly reduce computational time. However, existing safe sample screening algorithms are limited to convex optimization problems while RSVM is a non-convex problem. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose two safe sample screening rules for RSVM based on the framework of concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Specifically, we provide screening rule for the inner solver of CCCP and another rule for propagating screened samples between two successive solvers of CCCP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of safe sample screening to a non-convex optimization problem.

A market-oriented pricing of energy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal local market based on the marginal pricing scheme.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves arriving from cosmological distances. Some have been seen to repeat. A leading model for repeating FRBs is that they are extragalactic magnetars, powered by their intense magnetic fields.

In the multidimensional stable roommate problem, agents have to be allocated to rooms and have preferences over sets of potential roommates. We study the complexity of finding good allocations of agents to rooms under the assumption that agents have diversity preferences [Bredereck et al., 2019]: each agent belongs to one of the two types (e.g., juniors and seniors, artists and engineers), and agents' preferences over rooms depend solely on the fraction of agents of their own type among their potential roommates. We consider various solution concepts for this setting, such as core and exchange stability, Pareto optimality and envy-freeness. On the negative side, we prove that envy-free, core stable or (strongly) exchange stable outcomes may fail to exist and that the associated decision problems are NP-complete.

An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox. In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by certain specific developers."}, "answer": "Question: Which of the following statements best describes the primary risk associated with patch uplift in rapid release development processes?\n\nA) It may lead to increased development time for new features\nB) It can potentially introduce regressions in the code\nC) It might cause conflicts between different development channels\nD) It could result in delayed release schedules\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary risk associated with patch uplift, as described in the text, is that it can potentially introduce regressions in the code.

Experiment 1, conducted using an online sample of social media users, analyzes the effect of incentivizing senders to be perceived as truthful. These incentives cause senders to send less truthful messages. When incentivized, senders send more false information when it aligns with receivers' politically-motivated beliefs, controlling for receivers' current beliefs.

Experiment 2 further isolates the role that information processing plays by analyzing an environment in which receivers assess the truthfulness of messages from a computer and senders choose one of the computer's messages to determine their earnings.

Our results suggest that the LMC's stellar bar is chemically similar to the bars found in large spiral galaxies. The LMC's radial metallicity gradient is asymmetric. It is metal-poor and flatter towards the southwest, in the direction of the Bridge. This hints at mixing and/or distortion of the spatial metallicity distribution, presumably caused by tidal interactions between the Magellanic Clouds."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the metallicity mapping of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using near-infrared passbands, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the metallicity distribution and its implications?\n\nA) The LMC exhibits a uniform metallicity distribution across its entire structure, with no significant gradients observed.\n\nB) The bar of the LMC is significantly more metal-rich than the outer disc, showing a steep metallicity gradient of -0.08 dex kpc^-1.\n\nC) The radial metallicity gradient of the LMC is symmetrical, with consistent trends observed in all directions from the galaxy's center.\n\nD) The LMC shows an asymmetric radial metallicity gradient, with a metal-poor and flatter distribution towards the southwest, suggesting potential tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation states that \"The LMC's radial metallicity gradient is asymmetric. It is metal-poor and flatter towards the southwest, in the direction of the Bridge. This hints at mixing and/or distortion of the spatial metallicity distribution, presumably caused by tidal interactions between the Magellanic Clouds.\" This directly supports the statement in option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study found a shallow gradient in metallicity, not a uniform distribution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the bar is described as \"mildly metal-rich compared with the outer disc,\" the gradient is reported as shallow (-0.008 \u00b1 0.001 dex kpc^-1), not steep as stated in this option.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the gradient is explicitly described as asymmetric, not symmetrical."}}
