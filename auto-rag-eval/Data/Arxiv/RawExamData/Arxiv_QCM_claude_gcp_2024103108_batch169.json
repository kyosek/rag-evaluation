The DG algorithm is a powerful method for solving pdes, especially for evolution equations in conservation form.

We show how to formulate the algorithm in such spacetimes for applications in relativistic astrophysics. We also show how to formulate the algorithm for equations in non-conservative form, such as Einstein's field equations themselves. We find two computationally distinct formulations in both cases, one of which has seldom been used before for flat space in curvilinear coordinates but which may be more efficient. We also give a new derivation of the ALE algorithm (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) using 4-vector methods that is much simpler than the usual derivation and explains why the method preserves the conservation form of the equations.

As the achieved solution, the characteristic curve of state is demonstrated to be a useful tool for determining the operation point, waveform and saturation level. By using this characterizing tool, it is revealed that the same input signal can output completely different u-i orbital dynamics under different initial conditions, which is the uniqueness of memristors. The approach can be regarded as an analogy to using the characteristic curve for the BJT or MOS transisitors. Based on this model, we further propose a class of analytically solvable class of memristive systems that conform to Abel Differential Equations. The equations of state (EOS) of the titanium dioxide memristor based on both linear and nonlinear ionic drift models are typical integrable examples, which can be categorized into this Abel memristor class.

We interpret multi-product supply chains (SCs) as coordinated markets; under this interpretation, a SC optimization problem is a market clearing problem that allocates resources and associated economic values (prices) to different stakeholders that bid into the market (suppliers, consumers, transportation, and processing technologies). The market interpretation allows us to establish fundamental properties that explain how physical resources (primal variables) and associated economic values (dual variables) flow in the SC. We use duality theory to explain why incentivizing markets by forcing stakeholder participation (e.g., by imposing demand satisfaction or service provision constraints) yields artificial price behavior, inefficient allocations, and economic losses. To overcome these issues, we explore market incentive mechanisms that use bids; here, we introduce the concept of a stakeholder graph (a product-based representation of a supply chain) and show that this representation allows us to naturally determine minimum bids that activate the market. These results provide guidelines to design SC formulations that properly remunerate stakeholders and to design policy that foster market transactions.

Learning language of protein sequences, which captures non-local interactions between amino acids close in the spatial structure, is a long-standing bioinformatics challenge, which requires at least context-free grammars.

Using structural information to constrain the syntactic trees proved effective in learning probabilistic natural and RNA languages. In this work, we establish a framework for learning probabilistic context-free grammars for protein sequences from syntactic trees partially constrained using amino acid contacts obtained from wet experiments or computational predictions, whose reliability has substantially increased recently. Within the framework, we implement the maximum-likelihood and contrastive estimators of parameters for simple yet practical grammars.

Classifying consistent effective field theories for the gravitational interaction has recently been the subject of intense research. Demanding the absence of causality violation in high energy graviton scattering processes has led to a hierarchy of constraints on higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian. Most of these constraints have relied on analysis that is performed in general relativistic backgrounds, as opposed to a generic solution to the equations of motion which are perturbed by higher curvature operators. Hence, these constraints are necessary but may not be sufficient to ensure that the theory is consistent.

In the 70's Smith and Tassie, and Bell and Ruegg independently found SU(2) symmetries of the Dirac equation with scalar and vector potentials.

Twenty years after, in 1997, the pseudospin symmetry has been revealed by Ginocchio as a relativistic symmetry of the atomic nuclei when it is described by relativistic mean field hadronic models. The main feature of these symmetries is the suppression of the spin-orbit coupling either in the upper or lower components of the Dirac spinor, thereby turning the respective second-order equations into Schr\\\"odinger-like equations, i.e, without a matrix structure.
