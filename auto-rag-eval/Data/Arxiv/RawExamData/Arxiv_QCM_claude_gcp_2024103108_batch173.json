Many ion channels spontaneously switch between different levels of activity. Although this behaviour known as modal gating has been observed for a long time it is currently not well understood. Despite the fact that appropriately representing activity changes is essential for accurately capturing time course data from ion channels, systematic approaches for modelling modal gating are currently not available. In this paper, we develop a modular approach for building such a model in an iterative process. First, stochastic switching between modes and stochastic opening and closing within modes are represented in separate aggregated Markov models. Second, the continuous-time hierarchical Markov model, a new modelling framework proposed here, then enables us to combine these components so that in the integrated model both mode switching as well as the kinetics within modes are appropriately represented. A mathematical analysis reveals that the behaviour of the hierarchical Markov model naturally depends on the properties of its components. We also demonstrate how a hierarchical Markov model can be parameterised using experimental data and show that it provides a better representation than a previous model of the same data set.

A key problem in computational material science deals with understanding the effect of material distribution (i.e., microstructure) on material performance. The challenge is to synthesize microstructures, given a finite number of microstructure images, and/or some physical invariances that the microstructure exhibits. Conventional approaches are based on stochastic optimization and are computationally intensive. We introduce three generative models for the fast synthesis of binary microstructure images. The first model is a WGAN model that uses a finite number of training images to synthesize new microstructures that weakly satisfy the physical invariances respected by the original data. The second model explicitly enforces known physical invariances by replacing the traditional discriminator in a GAN with an invariance checker.

This work is associated with the use of parallel feedforward compensators (PFCs) for the problem of output synchronization over heterogeneous agents and the benefits this approach can provide. Specifically, it addresses the addition of stable PFCs on agents that interact with each other using diffusive couplings. The value in the application of such PFC is twofold. Firstly, it has been an issue that output synchronization among passivity-short systems requires global information for the design of controllers in the cases when initial conditions need to be taken into account, such as average consensus and distributed optimization. We show that a stable PFC can be designed to passivate a passivity-short system while its output asymptotically vanishes as its input tends to zero. As a result, output synchronization is achieved among these systems by fully distributed controls without altering the original consensus results. Secondly, it is generally required in the literature that the graph Laplacian be positive semidefinite, i.e., $L \\geq 0$ for undirected graphs or $L + L^T \\geq 0$ for balanced directed graphs, to achieve output synchronization over signed weighted graphs.

This mixing is quantified by a parameter (usually denoted b), introduced in [V. Gurarie, Nucl. Phys.

Motivation: Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key step in drug repositioning. In recent years, the accumulation of a large number of genomics and pharmacology data has formed mass drug and target related heterogeneous networks (HNs), which provides new opportunities of developing HN-based computational models to accurately predict DTIs. The HN implies lots of useful information about DTIs but also contains irrelevant data, and how to make the best of heterogeneous networks remains a challenge. Results: In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph automatic meta-path learning based DTI prediction method (HampDTI). HampDTI automatically learns the important meta-paths between drugs and targets from the HN, and generates meta-path graphs. For each meta-path graph, the features learned from drug molecule graphs and target protein sequences serve as the node attributes, and then a node-type specific graph convolutional network (NSGCN) which efficiently considers node type information (drugs or targets) is designed to learn embeddings of drugs and targets. Finally, the embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs are combined to predict novel DTIs. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed HampDTI achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art DTI prediction methods.

This is superior to methods that rely on pre-defined meta-paths or ignore the complex structure of HNs. \n\nHampDTI generates meta-path graphs based on these learned paths. It then uses features from drug molecule graphs and target protein sequences as node attributes in these meta-path graphs. A node-type specific graph convolutional network (NSGCN) is applied to each meta-path graph to learn embeddings of drugs and targets. \n\nThe critical advantage comes from combining embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs to predict novel drug-target interactions. This approach allows HampDTI to leverage the complex information in heterogeneous networks more effectively than methods that use only molecular data or pre-defined network structures.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they describe only partial aspects of the method.
