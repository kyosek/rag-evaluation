Computing expected predictions of discriminative models is a fundamental task in machine learning that appears in many interesting applications such as fairness, handling missing values, and data analysis. Unfortunately, computing expectations of a discriminative model with respect to a probability distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such as logistic regression and a naive Bayes distribution. In this paper, we identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations, as well as moments of any order, of the latter with respect to the former in case of regression. Specifically, we consider expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that support tractable probabilistic inference. Moreover, we exploit the tractable computation of high-order moments to derive an algorithm to approximate the expectations for classification scenarios in which exact computations are intractable. Our framework to compute expected predictions allows for handling of missing data during prediction time in a principled and accurate way and enables reasoning about the behavior of discriminative models. We empirically show our algorithm to consistently outperform standard imputation techniques on a variety of datasets. Finally, we illustrate how our framework can be used for exploratory data analysis."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and contribution of the research described in the Arxiv documentation \"On Tractable Computation of Expected Predictions\"?\n\nA) It proves that computing expectations of discriminative models is always tractable for any generative model.\n\nB) It introduces a novel pair of generative and discriminative models that allows for tractable computation of expectations and moments of any order for regression tasks.\n\nC) It develops a new imputation technique that outperforms all existing methods for handling missing data.\n\nD) It presents a universal algorithm for exact computation of expected predictions in classification scenarios.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key innovation described in the documentation is the identification of a specific pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations and moments of any order for regression tasks.

Competing firms can increase profits by setting prices collectively, imposing significant costs on consumers.

Here we present a network-based framework to detect potential cartels in bidding markets based on the idea that the chance a group of firms can overcome this obstacle and sustain cooperation depends on the patterns of its interactions.

It emphasizes that the sustainability of a cartel depends on the patterns of interactions between firms. The method focuses on two key group-level features: cohesion and exclusivity.\n\nHigh cohesion indicates that the firms within the group frequently interact with each other in bidding processes. This suggests a strong internal connection and potential for coordinated behavior.\n\nHigh exclusivity means that the firms in the group tend to interact more with each other than with firms outside the group. This characteristic reduces the likelihood of external interference or competition.\n\nThe combination of high cohesion and high exclusivity creates an ideal environment for cartel formation and sustainability. The study found that groups with these characteristics were more likely to display traditional markers of cartel behavior in the analysis of public contracts in Georgia.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't represent the optimal combination for cartel formation as described in the study.

Optimization methods complement those models to design ideotypes, i.e. ideal values of a set of plant traits resulting in optimal adaptation for given combinations of environment and management, mainly through the maximization of a performance criteria (e.g. yield, light interception). As use of simulation models gains momentum in plant breeding, numerical experiments must be carefully engineered to provide accurate and attainable results, rooting them in biological reality. Here, we propose a multi-objective optimization formulation that includes a metric of performance, returned by the numerical model, and a metric of feasibility, accounting for correlations between traits based on field observations. We applied this approach to two contrasting models: a process-based crop model of sunflower and a functional-structural plant model of apple trees. In both cases, the method successfully characterized key plant traits and identified a continuum of optimal solutions, ranging from the most feasible to the most efficient.

To quantify this heterogeneity we bring a novel approach to restart: the methodology of inequality indices, which is widely applied in economics and in the social sciences to measure income and wealth disparity. Using this approach we establish an `inequality roadmap' for the mean-performance of sharp restart: a whole new set of universal inequality criteria that determine when restart with sharp timers (i.e. with fixed deterministic timers) decreases/increases mean completion.

It also mentions that the \"Ra extraction efficiency is >95%\" and \"the counting efficiency is 24% for 214Po\". 214Po is in the decay chain of 226Ra, so this counting efficiency is relevant for 226Ra detection. Option B correctly combines these three pieces of information. Options A and C are incorrect because they state the detection limit as \"a few atoms of 226Ra per m^3\", which is actually the detection limit for 224Ra, not 226Ra. Option D is incorrect because it uses the counting efficiency for 216Po (6%), which is not relevant for 226Ra detection."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Multistate Nested Canalizing Functions and Their Networks", "source": "Claus Kadelka, Yuan Li, Jack Kuipers, John O.

This paper provides a collection of mathematical and computational tools for the study of robustness in nonlinear gene regulatory networks, represented by time- and state-discrete dynamical systems taking on multiple states.

We derive a formula for the normalized average $c$-sensitivities of multistate NCFs, which enables the calculation of the Derrida plot, a popular measure of network stability. We also provide a unique canonical parametrized polynomial form of NCFs. This form has several consequences. We can easily generate NCFs for varying parameter choices, and derive a closed form formula for the number of such functions in a given number of variables, as well as an asymptotic formula.

In this paper, we focus on this aspect for D2D users that belong to different tenants (virtual network operators), assuming virtualized and programmable future 5G wireless networks. Under the assumption of a cross-tenant orchestrator, we show that significant gains can be achieved in terms of network performance by optimizing resource sharing from the different tenants, i.e., slices of the substrate physical network topology.

To uncover the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for improving both early diagnosis and therapy, it is increasingly recognized that we need a better understanding of how the brain's functional connections are altered. A new brain wide association study (BWAS) has been developed and used to investigate functional connectivity changes in the brains of patients suffering from ADHD using resting state fMRI data. To reliably find out the most significantly altered functional connectivity links and associate them with ADHD, a meta-analysis on a cohort of ever reported largest population comprising 249 patients and 253 healthy controls is carried out.

Some of the knots are now seen associated with small bow shocks, with their bow wings curving back to the jet axis, as seen in pulsed jet simulations. Two of them are reasonably resolved, showing kinematics consistent with sideways ejection, possibly tracing the internal working surfaces formed by a temporal variation in the jet velocity. In addition, nested shells are seen in CO around the jet axis connecting to the knots and bow shocks, driven by them. The proper motion of the jet is estimated to be ~ 115+-50 km/s, comparing to our previous observations. The jet has a small semi-periodical wiggle, with a period of ~ 93 yrs.
