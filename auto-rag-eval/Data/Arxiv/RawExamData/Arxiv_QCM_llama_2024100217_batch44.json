We continue our study of geometric transitions in type II and heterotic theories.

We also point out the subtle differences between global and local metrics, and show that in many cases the global descriptions are far more complicated than discussed earlier. We determine the full global description in type I/heterotic theory. In type IIA, our analysis gives rise to a local non-Kahler metric whose global description involves a particular orientifold action with gauge fluxes localised on branes. We are also able to identify the three form fields that allow for a smooth flop in the M-theory lift.

Depending on the relevance they give to beliefs, they select the best performing strategy in an evolutionary perspective. The real side of the economy is described within a multiplier-accelerator framework with a nonlinear, bounded investment function. We show that strongly polarized beliefs in an evolutionary framework can introduce multiplicity of steady states, which, consisting in enhanced or depressed levels of income, reflect and reproduce the optimistic or pessimistic nature of the agents' beliefs. The polarization of these steady states, which coexist with an unbiased steady state, positively depends on that of the beliefs and on their relevance.

Coordinate descent algorithms that enjoy a low per-iteration complexity have been employed to solve the detection problem, but previous works typically employ a random coordinate selection policy which leads to slow convergence. In this paper, we develop multi-armed bandit approaches for more efficient detection via coordinate descent, which make a delicate trade-off between exploration and exploitation in coordinate selection. Specifically, we first propose a bandit based strategy, i.e., Bernoulli sampling, to speed up the convergence rate of coordinate descent, by learning which coordinates will result in more aggressive descent of the objective function. To further improve the convergence rate, an inner multi-armed bandit problem is established to learn the exploration policy of Bernoulli sampling. Both convergence rate analysis and simulation results are provided to show that the proposed bandit based algorithms enjoy faster convergence rates with a lower time complexity compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.

Hydrodynamic electron flow is experimentally observed in the differential resistance of electrostatically defined wires in the two-dimensional electron gas in (Al,Ga)As heterostructures.

The interplay between the partly diffusive wire-boundary scattering and the electron-electron scattering leads first to an increase and then to a decrease of the resistance of the wire with increasing current. These effects are the electronic analog of Knudsen and Poiseuille flow in gas transport, respectively.

Machine learning models are commonly applied to human brain imaging datasets in an effort to associate function or structure with behaviour, health, or other individual phenotypes. Such models often rely on low-dimensional maps generated by complex processing pipelines. However, the numerical instabilities inherent to pipelines limit the fidelity of these maps and introduce computational bias. Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a technique for introducing controlled amounts of numerical noise, was used to perturb a structural connectome estimation pipeline, ultimately producing a range of plausible networks for each sample. The variability in the perturbed networks was captured in an augmented dataset, which was then used for an age classification task. We found that resampling brain networks across a series of such numerically perturbed outcomes led to improved performance in all tested classifiers, preprocessing strategies, and dimensionality reduction techniques.
