In this letter, we propose a joint CSIT acquisition scheme to reduce the overhead.

Visual dialog is a task of answering a series of inter-dependent questions given an input image, and often requires to resolve visual references among the questions. This problem is different from visual question answering (VQA), which relies on spatial attention (a.k.a. visual grounding) estimated from an image and question pair. We propose a novel attention mechanism that exploits visual attentions in the past to resolve the current reference in the visual dialog scenario. The proposed model is equipped with an associative attention memory storing a sequence of previous (attention, key) pairs. From this memory, the model retrieves the previous attention, taking into account recency, which is most relevant for the current question, in order to resolve potentially ambiguous references. The model then merges the retrieved attention with a tentative one to obtain the final attention for the current question; specifically, we use dynamic parameter prediction to combine the two attentions conditioned on the question.

This paper proves that local projection inference robustly handles two issues that commonly arise in applications: highly persistent data and the estimation of impulse responses at long horizons. We consider local projections that control for lags of the variables in the regression. We show that lag-augmented local projections with normal critical values are asymptotically valid uniformly over (i) both stationary and non-stationary data, and also over (ii) a wide range of response horizons. Moreover, lag augmentation obviates the need to correct standard errors for serial correlation in the regression residuals. Hence, local projection inference is arguably both simpler than previously thought and more robust than standard autoregressive inference, whose validity is known to depend sensitively on the persistence of the data and on the length of the horizon."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of lag-augmented local projections for impulse response inference, as discussed in the paper?\n\nA) They require complex adjustments to standard errors to account for serial correlation in regression residuals.\n\nB) They are only valid for stationary data and short response horizons.\n\nC) They provide asymptotically valid inference uniformly over both stationary and non-stationary data, as well as a wide range of response horizons.\n\nD) They are less robust than standard autoregressive inference when dealing with highly persistent data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

For $q$-dimensional data, penalized versions of the sample covariance matrix are important when the sample size is small or modest relative to $q$. Since the negative log-likelihood under multivariate normal sampling is convex in $\\Sigma^{-1}$, the inverse of its covariance matrix, it is common to add to it a penalty which is also convex in $\\Sigma^{-1}$. More recently, Deng-Tsui (2013) and Yu et al.(2017) have proposed penalties which are functions of the eigenvalues of $\\Sigma$, and are convex in $\\log \\Sigma$, but not in $\\Sigma^{-1}$. The resulting penalized optimization problem is not convex in either $\\log \\Sigma$ or $\\Sigma^{-1}$. In this paper, we note that this optimization problem is geodesically convex in $\\Sigma$, which allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding penalized covariance matrices.

In addition, when using such penalties, we show that the resulting optimization problem reduces to to a $q$-dimensional convex optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $\\Sigma$, which can then be readily solved via Newton-Raphson.

Thus intervention controls, such as vaccination of susceptible individuals and/or treatment of infectives, are typically based on a deterministic schedule, such as periodically vaccinating susceptible children based on school calendars. In reality, however, such policies are administered as a random process, while still possessing a mean period.
