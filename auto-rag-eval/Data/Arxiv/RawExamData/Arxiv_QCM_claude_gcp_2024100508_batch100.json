By using holographic methods, the radii of convergence of the hydrodynamic shear and sound dispersion relations were previously computed in the ${\\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at infinite 't Hooft coupling and infinite number of colours. Here, we extend this analysis to the domain of large but finite 't Hooft coupling. To leading order in the perturbative expansion, we find that the radii grow with increasing inverse coupling, contrary to naive expectations. However, when the equations of motion are solved using a qualitative non-perturbative resummation, the dependence on the coupling becomes piecewise continuous and the initial growth is followed by a decrease. The piecewise nature of the dependence is related to the dynamics of branch point singularities of the energy-momentum tensor finite-temperature two-point functions in the complex plane of spatial momentum squared. We repeat the study using the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a model where the equations can be solved fully non-perturbatively, and find the expected decrease of the radii of convergence with the effective inverse coupling which is also piecewise continuous. Finally, we provide arguments in favour of the non-perturbative approach and show that the presence of non-perturbative modes in the quasinormal spectrum can be indirectly inferred from the analysis of perturbative critical points."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In the context of hydrodynamic dispersion relations at finite coupling, which of the following statements is correct regarding the radii of convergence of the shear and sound dispersion relations as the 't Hooft coupling decreases from infinity?\n\nA) The radii of convergence decrease monotonically as predicted by naive expectations.\n\nB) The radii of convergence increase monotonically, contradicting naive expectations.\n\nC) The radii of convergence exhibit a piecewise continuous behavior, initially increasing and then decreasing.\n\nD) The radii of convergence remain constant, independent of the 't Hooft coupling.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex behavior of hydrodynamic dispersion relations at finite coupling. According to the text, when a qualitative non-perturbative resummation is used to solve the equations of motion, the dependence of the radii of convergence on the coupling becomes piecewise continuous. Initially, as the inverse coupling increases (i.e., as the 't Hooft coupling decreases from infinity), the radii grow, contrary to naive expectations. However, this initial growth is followed by a decrease. This piecewise continuous behavior is related to the dynamics of branch point singularities in the complex plane of spatial momentum squared for the energy-momentum tensor finite-temperature two-point functions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it only reflects the naive expectation, which is contradicted by the actual findings.

The annealing-induced changes in structural and magnetic properties of the layers were examined with high-resolution X-ray diffractometry and SQUID magnetometery, respectively.

One particular way of tackling this is grounded in an algorithmic description of life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse.

We find that the shape of the MZR is relatively constant with redshift, but that its normalization increases with time. Simulations with no energy feedback from supernovae overproduce metals at low galaxy masses by rapidly transforming a large fraction of their gas into stars.

The successive evolution of quasar luminosities follows a universal light curve form: an initial exponential growth at constant Eddington ratio of order unity until it reaches the peak luminosity, followed by a power-law decay. Assuming that the peak luminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the light curve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasar luminosity function (LF). Our model reproduces the observed LF at 0.5<z<4.5 for the full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and X-ray surveys. Our model reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependence of the linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering. Due to the scatter between instantaneous luminosity and halo mass, quasar/AGN clustering weakly depends on luminosity at low to intermediate luminosities; but the linear bias rises rapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift. In our model, the Eddington ratio distribution is roughly log-normal, which broadens and shifts to lower mean values from high luminosity quasars (L_bol>~10^46 erg s^-1) to low luminosity AGNs (L_bol<~ 10^45 erg s^-1), in good agreement with observations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the model presented in the paper, which of the following statements about quasar/AGN clustering is NOT correct?\n\nA) The linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering shows both redshift evolution and luminosity dependence.\nB) Quasar/AGN clustering weakly depends on luminosity at low to intermediate luminosities.\nC) The linear bias increases rapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift.\nD) The model predicts a constant linear bias across all luminosities and redshifts due to the universal light curve form.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it contradicts the information provided in the document.
