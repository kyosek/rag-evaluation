There is evidence, however, that RR is sensitive to small or sparse data situations, yielding poor performance in individual datasets. In this paper, we elaborate this issue further by performing a comprehensive simulation study, investigating the performance of RR in comparison to Firth's correction that has been shown to perform well in low-dimensional settings. Performance of RR strongly depends on the choice of complexity parameter that is usually tuned by minimizing some measure of the out-of-sample prediction error or information criterion.

Solving long-tail large vocabulary object detection with deep learning based models is a challenging and demanding task, which is however under-explored.In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis on the underperformance of state-of-the-art models in front of long-tail distribution. We find existing detection methods are unable to model few-shot classes when the dataset is extremely skewed, which can result in classifier imbalance in terms of parameter magnitude.

It implicitly modulates the training process for the head and tail classes and ensures they are both sufficiently trained, without requiring any extra sampling for the instances from the tail classes.Extensive experiments on the very recent long-tail large vocabulary object recognition benchmark LVIS show that our proposed BAGS significantly improves the performance of detectors with various backbones and frameworks on both object detection and instance segmentation.

In typical sensor networks, data collection and processing are separated. A sink collects data from all nodes sequentially, which is very time consuming. Over-the-air computation, as a new diagram of sensor networks, integrates data collection and processing in one slot: all nodes transmit their signals simultaneously in the analog wave and the processing is done in the air. This method, although efficient, requires that signals from all nodes arrive at the sink, aligned in signal magnitude so as to enable an unbiased estimation. For nodes far away from the sink with a low channel gain, misalignment in signal magnitude is unavoidable. To solve this problem, in this paper, we investigate the amplify-and-forward based relay, in which a relay node amplifies signals from many nodes at the same time. We first discuss the general relay model and a simple relay policy. Then, a coherent relay policy is proposed to reduce relay transmission power. Directly minimizing the computation error tends to over-increase node transmission power. Therefore, the two relay policies are further refined with a new metric, and the transmission power is reduced while the computation error is kept low.

The passage emphasizes that Dynamic Accuracy Estimation (DAE) is an important feature that provides users with information about the level of uncertainty in position estimates. This additional information helps users better utilize the position estimates provided by positioning systems.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the text suggests that DAE is a more modern, data-driven approach, contrasting it with the earlier handcrafted rules.\n\nAnswer B is not accurate because DAE doesn't improve the accuracy of position estimates itself; rather, it provides an estimate of the accuracy or uncertainty of those estimates.\n\nAnswer D is too narrow. While the text mentions LPWANs and IoT devices as facilitating data-driven methods for DAE, it doesn't restrict DAE's use to these networks exclusively.\n\nThe correct answer captures the essence of DAE as described in the passage: a method to provide users with an assessment of the uncertainty in position estimates, which enhances the overall utility of the positioning data."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Automatic segmentation of vertebral features on ultrasound spine images\n  using Stacked Hourglass Network", "source": "Hong-Ye Zeng, Song-Han Ge, Yu-Chong Gao, De-Sen Zhou, Kang Zhou,\n  Xu-Ming He, Edmond Lou, Rui Zheng", "docs_id": "2105.03847", "section": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Automatic segmentation of vertebral features on ultrasound spine images\n  using Stacked Hourglass Network.

We propose an automatic segmentation method based on Stacked Hourglass Network (SHN) to detect the spinous processes (SP) on ultrasound (US) spine images and to measure the SPAs of clinical scoliotic subjects. Methods: The network was trained to detect vertebral SP and laminae as five landmarks on 1200 ultrasound transverse images and validated on 100 images. All the processed transverse images with highlighted SP and laminae were reconstructed into a 3D image volume, and the SPAs were measured on the projected coronal images. The trained network was tested on 400 images by calculating the percentage of correct keypoints (PCK); and the SPA measurements were evaluated on 50 scoliotic subjects by comparing the results from US images and radiographs. Results: The trained network achieved a high average PCK (86.8%) on the test datasets, particularly the PCK of SP detection was 90.3%. The SPAs measured from US and radiographic methods showed good correlation (r>0.85), and the mean absolute differences (MAD) between two modalities were 3.3{\\deg}, which was less than the clinical acceptance error (5{\\deg}).

Road information such as road profile and traffic density have been widely used in intelligent vehicle systems to improve road safety, ride comfort, and fuel economy. However, vehicle heterogeneity and parameter uncertainty make it extremely difficult for a single vehicle to accurately and reliably measure such information. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning-based collaborative estimation to fuse local road estimation from a fleet of connected heterogeneous vehicles. The collaborative estimation scheme exploits the sequential measurements made by multiple vehicles traversing the same road segment and let these vehicles relay a learning signal to iteratively refine local estimations. Given that the privacy of individual vehicles' identity must be protected in collaborative estimation, we directly incorporate privacy-protection design into the collaborative estimation design and establish a unified framework for privacy-preserving collaborative estimation. Different from patching conventional privacy mechanisms like differential privacy which will compromise algorithmic accuracy or homomorphic encryption which will incur heavy communication/computational overhead, we leverage the dynamical properties of collective estimation to enable inherent privacy protection without sacrificing accuracy or significantly increasing communication/computation overhead.

Multi-view time series classification (MVTSC) aims to improve the performance by fusing the distinctive temporal information from multiple views. Existing methods mainly focus on fusing multi-view information at an early stage, e.g., by learning a common feature subspace among multiple views. However, these early fusion methods may not fully exploit the unique temporal patterns of each view in complicated time series. Moreover, the label correlations of multiple views, which are critical to boost-ing, are usually under-explored for the MVTSC problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Correlative Channel-Aware Fusion (C2AF) network. First, C2AF extracts comprehensive and robust temporal patterns by a two-stream structured encoder for each view, and captures the intra-view and inter-view label correlations with a graph-based correlation matrix. Second, a channel-aware learnable fusion mechanism is implemented through convolutional neural networks to further explore the global correlative patterns.
