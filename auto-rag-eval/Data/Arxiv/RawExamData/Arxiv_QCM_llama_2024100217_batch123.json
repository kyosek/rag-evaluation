The coexistence of different viral strains (quasispecies) within the same host are nowadays observed for a growing number of viruses, most notably HIV, Marburg and Ebola, but the conditions for the formation and survival of new strains have not yet been understood. We present a model of HIV quasispecies competition, that describes the conditions of viral quasispecies coexistence under different immune system conditions. Our model incorporates both T and B cells responses, and we show that the role of B cells is important and additive to that of T cells. Simulations of coinfection (simultaneous infection) and superinfection (delayed secondary infection) scenarios in the early stages (days) and in the late stages of the infection (years) are in agreement with emerging molecular biology findings. The immune response induces a competition among similar phenotypes, leading to differentiation (quasi-speciation), escape dynamics and complex oscillations of viral strain abundance. We found that the quasispecies dynamics after superinfection or coinfection has time scales of several months and becomes even slower when the immune system response is weak. Our model represents a general framework to study the speed and distribution of HIV quasispecies during disease progression, vaccination and therapy."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism by which the immune system induces competition among similar viral phenotypes, leading to the emergence of new viral strains in HIV-infected individuals?\n\nA) Antibody-dependent viral neutralization\nB) T cell-mediated viral clearance\nC) Quasi-speciation through viral mutation and selection\nD) Immune system exhaustion due to chronic infection\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) Quasi-speciation through viral mutation and selection\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is C) Quasi-speciation through viral mutation and selection. The documentation states that the immune response induces a competition among similar viral phenotypes, leading to differentiation (quasi-speciation), escape dynamics, and complex oscillations of viral strain abundance. This suggests that the primary mechanism by which the immune system induces competition among similar viral phenotypes is through the process of quasi-speciation, where viral mutations and selection drive the emergence of new viral strains.\n\n**Candidate A (Antibody-dependent viral neutralization)** is incorrect because while antibodies do play a role in viral neutralization, they are not the primary mechanism by which the immune system induces competition among similar viral phenotypes.\n\n**Candidate B (T cell-mediated viral clearance)** is incorrect because while T cells do play a role in viral clearance, they are not the primary mechanism by which the immune system induces competition among similar viral phenotypes.\n\n**Candidate D (Immune system exhaustion due to chronic infection)** is incorrect because while chronic infection can lead to immune system exhaustion, this is not the primary mechanism by which the immune system induces competition among similar viral phenotypes."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Calibration of Machine Learning Classifiers for Probability of Default\n  Modelling", "source": "Pedro G.

In chiral materials the microscopic anomaly leads to nontrivial macroscopic transport processes such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), which has been in the spotlight lately across disciplines of physics. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic nuclear collisions provides the unique example of a chiral material consisting of intrinsically relativistic chiral fermions.

Calabi-Yau spaces, or Kahler spaces admitting zero Ricci curvature, have played a pivotal role in theoretical physics and pure mathematics for the last half-century. In physics, they constituted the first and natural solution to compactification of superstring theory to our 4-dimensional universe, primarily due to one of their equivalent definitions being the admittance of covariantly constant spinors. Since the mid-1980s, physicists and mathematicians have joined forces in creating explicit examples of Calabi-Yau spaces, compiling databases of formidable size, including the complete intersecion (CICY) dataset, the weighted hypersurfaces dataset, the elliptic-fibration dataset, the Kreuzer-Skarke toric hypersurface dataset, generalized CICYs etc., totaling at least on the order of 10^10 manifolds.

The IR shows that for look-back periods of a few months, the investor is more likely to tap into autocorrelation.

Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), the procedure of raising the temperature of tumor cells using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as heating agents, has proven successful in treating some types of cancer. However, the low heating power generated under physiological conditions makes necessary a high local concentration of MNPs at tumor sites. Here, we report how the in vitro heating power of magnetically soft MnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles can be enhanced by intracellular low-dimensional clusters through a strategy that includes: a) the design of the MNPs to retain N\\'eel magnetic relaxation in high viscosity media, and b) culturing MNP-loaded cells under magnetic fields to produce elongated intracellular agglomerates. Our direct in vitro measurements demonstrated that the specific loss power (SLP) of elongated agglomerates ($SLP=576\\pm33$ W/g) induced by culturing BV2 cells in situ under a dc magnetic field was increased by a factor of 2 compared to the $SLP=305\\pm25$ W/g measured in aggregates freely formed within cells. A numerical mean-field model that included dipolar interactions quantitatively reproduced the SLPs of these clusters both in phantoms and in vitro, suggesting that it captures the relevant mechanisms behind power losses under high-viscosity conditions. These results indicate that in situ assembling of MNPs into low-dimensional structures is a sound possible way to improve the heating performance in MFH."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary advantage of culturing magnetically soft MnFe2O4 nanoparticles into low-dimensional clusters within cells for magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) treatment?\n\nA){The formation of elongated intracellular agglomerates enhances the specific loss power (SLP) of MNPs, leading to increased heating power.}\nB){The use of low-dimensional clusters allows for more efficient targeting of tumor cells, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue.}\nC){The in situ assembly of MNPs into clusters enables the retention of N\u00e9el magnetic relaxation in high viscosity media, improving the heating performance.}\nD){The culturing of MNPs into clusters facilitates the production of a uniform magnetic field, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of MFH.}\n\nCorrect Answer: C){The in situ assembly of MNPs into clusters enables the retention of N\u00e9el magnetic relaxation in high viscosity media, improving the heating performance.}\n\nExplanation: The correct answer, C, is supported by the text, which states that the design of the MNPs to retain N\u00e9el magnetic relaxation in high viscosity media is a key strategy for enhancing the heating power of magnetically soft MnFe2O4 nanoparticles.

Methods. We cross-match the 60-um selected Revised IRAS Faint Source Survey Redshift (RIFSCz) catalogue and the 150-MHz selected LOFAR value-added source catalogue in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring Field.

We find a tight linear correlation between log L150 and log LIR for star-forming galaxies, with a slope of 1.37.
