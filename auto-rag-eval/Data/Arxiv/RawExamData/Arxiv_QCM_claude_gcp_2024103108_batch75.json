Corporate failure resonates widely leaving practitioners searching for understanding of default risk.

Applying Topological Data Analysis tools this paper explores whether failing firms from the United States organise neatly along the five predictors of default proposed by the Z-score models.

In each model the line profiles and intensities for the fine structure lines of [O I], [C II] and [C I] and the pure rotational lines of CO, CN, HCN and HCO+ are determined.

The documentation explicitly states that this is \"the first observation of a two-quasiparticle t-band in the A=130 mass region.\" This t-band has a band-head spin of 8+ and is consistent with the Fermi-aligned \u03bdh11/2^2, 7/2+[523] \u2297 9/2-[514] Nilsson configuration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the t-band observed is a two-quasiparticle band, not a three-quasiparticle band.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the documentation mentions the coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes, it does not claim this as the first instance in barium isotopes.\n\nOption D is incorrect and contradicts the information provided.

Contemporary debates on filter bubbles and polarization in public and social media raise the question to what extent news media of the past exhibited biases.

We measure bias related to gender by comparing local changes in word embedding models trained on newspapers with divergent ideological backgrounds. We demonstrate clear differences in gender bias and changes within and between newspapers over time. In relation to themes such as sexuality and leisure, we see the bias moving toward women, whereas, generally, the bias shifts in the direction of men, despite growing female employment number and feminist movements. Even though Dutch society became less stratified ideologically (depillarization), we found an increasing divergence in gender bias between religious and social-democratic on the one hand and liberal newspapers on the other.

We study actual bidding behavior when a new auction format gets introduced into the marketplace. More specifically, we investigate this question using a novel data set on internet display ad auctions that exploits a staggered adoption by different publishers (sellers) of first-price auctions (FPAs), in place for the traditional second-price auctions (SPAs). Event study regression estimates indicate a significant jump, immediately after the auction format change, in revenue per sold impression (price) of the treated publishers relative to that of control publishers, ranging from 35% to 75% of pre-treatment price levels of the treated group. Further, we observe that in later auction format changes the lift in price relative to SPAs dissipates over time, reminiscent of the celebrated revenue equivalence theorem. We take this as evidence of initially insufficient bid shading after the format change rather than an immediate shift to a new Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Prices then went down as bidders learned to shade their bids. We also show that bidders sophistication impacted their response to the auction format change.

A mathematical program for global optimization of the cable layout of Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) is presented. The model consists on a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Modern branch-and-cut solvers are able to solve large-scale instances, defined by more than hundred Wind Turbines (WTs), and a reasonable number of Offshore Substations (OSSs).
