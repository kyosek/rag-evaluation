Restarting a deterministic process always impedes its completion. However, it is known that restarting a random process can also lead to an opposite outcome -- expediting completion.

To quantify this heterogeneity we bring a novel approach to restart: the methodology of inequality indices, which is widely applied in economics and in the social sciences to measure income and wealth disparity. Using this approach we establish an `inequality roadmap' for the mean-performance of sharp restart: a whole new set of universal inequality criteria that determine when restart with sharp timers (i.e. with fixed deterministic timers) decreases/increases mean completion.

Cross-situational word learning is based on the notion that a learner can determine the referent of a word by finding something in common across many observed uses of that word. Here we propose an adaptive learning algorithm that contains a parameter that controls the strength of the reinforcement applied to associations between concurrent words and referents, and a parameter that regulates inference, which includes built-in biases, such as mutual exclusivity, and information of past learning events. By adjusting these parameters so that the model predictions agree with data from representative experiments on cross-situational word learning, we were able to explain the learning strategies adopted by the participants of those experiments in terms of a trade-off between reinforcement and inference. These strategies can vary wildly depending on the conditions of the experiments. For instance, for fast mapping experiments (i.e., the correct referent could, in principle, be inferred in a single observation) inference is prevalent, whereas for segregated contextual diversity experiments (i.e., the referents are separated in groups and are exhibited with members of their groups only) reinforcement is predominant.

The study describes an adaptive learning algorithm with parameters controlling both reinforcement and inference in cross-situational word learning. The key finding is that the balance between these two factors varies significantly depending on the experimental conditions. \n\nFor example, in fast mapping experiments where the correct referent could potentially be inferred from a single observation, inference plays a more dominant role.

Ultra-high energy cosmic rays interacting with the radiation fields in the universe cause electromagnetic cascades resulting in a flux of extragalactic gamma rays, detectable to some 100 GeV. Recent precise measurements of the extragalactic gamma ray flux by Fermi-LAT, coupled with estimates of the background from active galactic nuclei of various types, allows limits to be set on the cascade component. By comparison with prediction and, making various assumptions, ie taking a particular model, limits can be set on the maximum energy to which ultra-high energy particle can be accelerated.

While auction theory views bids and valuations as continuous variables, real-world auctions are necessarily discrete. In this paper, we use a combination of analytical and computational methods to investigate whether incorporating discreteness substantially changes the predictions of auction theory, focusing on the case of uniformly distributed valuations so that our results bear on the majority of auction experiments. In some cases, we find that introducing discreteness changes little. For example, the first-price auction with two bidders and an even number of values has a symmetric equilibrium that closely resembles its continuous counterpart and converges to its continuous counterpart as the discretisation goes to zero. In others, however, we uncover discontinuity results. For instance, introducing an arbitrarily small amount of discreteness into the all-pay auction makes its symmetric, pure-strategy equilibrium disappear; and appears (based on computational experiments) to rob the game of pure-strategy equilibria altogether.
