An exact solution of the low-energy string theory representing static, spherical symmetric dyonic black hole is found. The solution is labeled by their mass, electric charge, magnetic charge and asymptotic value of the scalar dilaton. Some interesting properties of the dyonic black holes are studied. In particular, the Hawking temperature of dyonic black holes depends on both the electric and magnetic charges, and the extremal ones, which have nonzero electric and magnetic charges, have zero temperature but nonzero entropy. These properties are quite different from those of electrically (or magnetically) charged dilaton black holes found by Gibbons {\\it et al.} and Garfinkle {\\it et al.}, but are the same as those of the dyonic black holes found by Gibbons and Maeda.

Tensor operations, such as matrix multiplication, are central to large-scale machine learning applications.

For distributed platforms, it has been recently shown that coding over the input data matrices can reduce the computational delay, yielding a trade-off between recovery threshold and communication load. In this paper we impose an additional security constraint on the data matrices and assume that workers can collude to eavesdrop on the content of these data matrices. Specifically, we introduce a novel class of secure codes, referred to as secure generalized PolyDot codes, that generalizes previously published non-secure versions of these codes for matrix multiplication.

We divided the time series of the Nikkei 225 index into two periods, an inflationary period and a deflationary period. We have previously [18] found that the distribution of absolute log-returns can be approximated by the power-law distribution in the inflationary period, while the distribution of absolute log-returns is well described by the exponential distribution in the deflationary period.\\par To further explore these empirical findings, we have introduced a model of stock markets which was proposed in [19,20].

During cell division each mini-circle is removed from the network, duplicated and then re-attached, along with its progeny.

In addition, it is well known that setting the drift of the Lyapunov function equal to zero in steady-state provides bounds on the expected queue lengths. However, such bounds are often very loose due to the fact that they fail to capture resource pooling effects. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the approach of \"setting the drift of a Lyapunov function equal to zero\" can be used to obtain bounds on the steady-state queue lengths which are tight in the heavy-traffic limit.

The correct answer, B, accurately describes the physics behind the observed transition. In zero magnetic field, the charge stability diagram shows 2e-2e periodicity, indicative of Cooper pair tunneling in a superconducting system. As a magnetic field is applied along the nanowire, the system transitions to a 1e-1e periodic charge stability diagram. This transition is explained by the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at the ends of each island segment in the topological regime.\n\nThe MZMs create zero-energy subgap states, allowing single-electron tunneling processes to occur.

We consider interacting quantum particles in two dimensions in a strong magnetic field such that the Hilbert space is restricted to the Lowest Landau Level (LLL).

Which of the following best explains this phenomenon and its potential implications for biosensing?\n\nA) The nanoparticles alter the refractive index of the fluid, causing shifts in the optical whispering gallery modes only\nB) The nanoparticles increase the fluid's viscosity, damping all mechanical vibrations of the OMFR\nC) The nanoparticles modify the hybrid fluid-shell modes, reflecting their acoustic properties in the optomechanical vibrational spectrum\nD) The nanoparticles induce localized heating, causing thermal expansion of the OMFR structure\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately describes the unique capability of OMFRs to detect acoustic properties of bioanalytes, as explained in the documentation. OMFRs use ultra-high-Q whispering gallery modes to actuate and sense structural mechanical vibrations, which are hybrid fluid-shell modes that entrain any bioanalyte present inside. This allows bioanalytes to reflect their acoustic properties on the optomechanical vibrational spectrum of the device.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while changes in refractive index can affect optical modes, the question specifically mentions changes in the vibrational spectrum, which involves mechanical properties.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it oversimplifies the interaction. While nanoparticles might affect fluid viscosity, the documentation doesn't suggest they would uniformly damp all vibrations. Instead, they contribute to the hybrid fluid-shell modes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because localized heating and thermal expansion are not mentioned as primary mechanisms in the OMFR sensing process described in the documentation.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the principles of OMFR operation, the nature of hybrid fluid-shell modes, and the interaction between bioanalytes and the device's vibrational spectrum.

The aim of this article is to study the effect of an Event Horizon on the entanglement of the Quantum Vacuum and how entanglement, together with the Holographic Principle, may explain the current value of the Cosmological Constant, in light of recent theories. Entanglement is tested for vacuum states very near and very far from the Horizon of a de Sitter Universe, using the Peres-Horodecki (PPT) criterion. A scalar vacuum field ($\\hat{\\phi}$) is averaged inside two boxes of volume $V$ in different spatial positions such that it acquires the structure of a bipartite Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, for which the PPT criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition of separability. Entanglement is found between states obtained from boxes shaped as spherical shells with thickness of the order of one Planck distance ($l_p$), when one of the states is near the Horizon, and the other state is anywhere in the Universe. Entanglement disappears when the distance of the state near the horizon and the Horizon increases to around $5l_p$.

Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) has broad application in open-set verification tasks, such as speaker verification. A key concern for PLDA is that the model is too simple (linear Gaussian) to deal with complicated data; however, the simplicity by itself is a major advantage of PLDA, as it leads to desirable generalization. An interesting research therefore is how to improve modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global and local models. The new model, which we call decoupled PLDA, is tested on a speaker verification task. Experimental results show that it consistently outperforms the vanilla PLDA when the model is based on raw speaker vectors.

The correct answer, B, relates to the \"symmetry-breaking collisions\" mentioned in the documentation. \n\nWhile true solitons in one-dimensional systems would emerge unchanged from collisions (option D), the documentation emphasizes that these bright solitary matter waves are \"strictly distinct objects to the true soliton solutions\" due to the presence of three spatial dimensions and trapping. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while collapse instability is mentioned as a possibility for bright solitary waves, it typically results in the destruction of the wave rather than a change in amplitude and velocity.\n\nOption C is a plausible distractor based on the attractive interactions that form these waves, but it doesn't align with the observed outcome of two distinct waves with altered properties.\n\nThe symmetry-breaking collision (B) explains the observed changes in amplitude and velocity, showcasing the \"rich behaviour\" of bright solitary waves that differs from true solitons. This phenomenon arises from the complex interplay of the three-dimensional nature of the waves, the trapping potential, and the nonlinear interactions, demonstrating the higher-level analysis required to understand these systems."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "Testing Holographic Conjectures of Complexity with Born-Infeld Black\n  Holes", "source": "Jun Tao, Peng Wang, and Haitang Yang", "docs_id": "1703.06297", "section": ["hep-th", "gr-qc"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Testing Holographic Conjectures of Complexity with Born-Infeld Black\n  Holes. In this paper, we use Born-Infeld black holes to test two recent holographic conjectures of complexity, the \"Complexity = Action\" (CA) duality and \"Complexity = Volume 2.0\" (CV) duality. The complexity of a boundary state is identified with the action of the Wheeler-deWitt patch in CA duality, while this complexity is identified with the spacetime volume of the WdW patch in CV duality. In particular, we check whether the Born-Infeld black holes violate the Lloyd bound: $\\mathcal{\\dot{C}\\leq}\\frac{2}{\\pi\\hbar}\\left[ \\left( M-Q\\Phi\\right) -\\left( M-Q\\Phi\\right) _{\\text{gs}}\\right] $, where gs stands for the ground state for a given electrostatic potential. We find that the ground states are either some extremal black hole or regular spacetime with nonvanishing charges. Near extremality, the Lloyd bound is violated in both dualities. Near the charged regular spacetime, this bound is satisfied in CV duality but violated in CA duality.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the implications of their findings for the Lloyd bound?\n\nA) The Lloyd bound is consistently satisfied in both dualities, supporting the universal applicability of holographic complexity conjectures.\n\nB) The CA duality shows Lloyd bound violation near extremality, while the CV duality consistently satisfies it, suggesting CV duality may be more physically relevant.\n\nC) Both dualities violate the Lloyd bound near extremality, but the CV duality tends towards saturation as the system moves away from the ground state.\n\nD) Near extremality, both dualities violate the Lloyd bound, but the CA duality tends to saturate it from below when moving away from the ground state on a constant potential curve.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, testing the understanding of both CA and CV dualities in the context of Born-Infeld black holes and their relationship to the Lloyd bound. The correct answer, D, accurately reflects the complex behavior described in the documentation.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Near extremality, both CA and CV dualities violate the Lloyd bound: \"Near extremality, the Lloyd bound is violated in both dualities.\"\n2. The CA duality's behavior when moving away from the ground state: \"When moving away from the ground state on a constant potential curve, the Lloyd bound tend to be saturated from below in CA duality.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the documented violations of the Lloyd bound. Option B is partially correct about the CA duality but misrepresents the CV duality's behavior. Option C incorrectly attributes the saturation tendency to the CV duality, when it's actually observed in the CA duality.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of information about both dualities and their behavior in different scenarios. It also incorporates real-world application by framing the question in the context of a researcher's investigation, reflecting how these theoretical concepts might be studied in practice."}}
