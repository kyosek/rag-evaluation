In this article we will propose a completely new point of view for solving one of the most important paradoxes concerning game theory. The solution develop shifts the focus from the result to the strategy s ability to operate in a cognitive way by exploiting useful information about the system. In order to determine from a mathematical point of view if a strategy is cognitive, we use Von Mises' axiom of randomness. Based on this axiom, the knowledge of useful information consequently generates results that cannot be reproduced randomly. Useful information in this case may be seen as a significant datum for the recipient, for their present or future decision-making process. Finally, by resolving the paradox from this new point of view, we will demonstrate that an expected gain that tends toward infinity is not always a consequence of a cognitive and non-random strategy. Therefore, this result leads us to define a hierarchy of values in decision-making, where the cognitive aspect, whose statistical consequence is a divergence from random behaviour, turns out to be more important than the expected gain."

Suppose that $E=\\cup_{i\\in I} E_i$ is a partition, where each $E_i$ is infinite. Suppose also that, in each $E_i$, the number of elements satisfying $(\\bf P)$ is finite. Then, clearly the density of the elements satisfying $(\\bf P)$ is 0 in every $E_i$. Is it possible that the density of the subset of $E$ containing all the elements satisfying $(\\bf P)$ will be at least equal to $ 1/2$?} We were first confronted with this situation while reading the paper of Arno et al. [1]. In fact, it is in the paper [1] where it is shown that the density of certain algebraic numbers in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$, which we will call Arno et al. numbers in section 5, is equal to $1/\\zeta(3)$. We have partitioned $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ in a way that suggests these Arno et al. numbers are rare. This phenomenom struck us as contradictory, which lead us to consider the situation in greater detail. We will show in the sequel, through two examples, that the answer to the above question may be positive.

While it may seem counterintuitive, option C is correct. The document states that it is possible for the density of elements satisfying property (P) in the entire set E to be at least 1/2, even though the density in each subset E_i is 0. This phenomenon is illustrated by the example of Arno et al. numbers in algebraic numbers, where the density in the entire set is 1/\u03b6(3), despite appearing rare in certain partitions. This counterintuitive result demonstrates the complex nature of infinite sets and their partitions, showing that local properties (density in E_i) don't always directly translate to global properties (density in E)."

We develop a non-parametric multivariate time series model that remains agnostic on the precise relationship between a (possibly) large set of macroeconomic time series and their lagged values. The main building block of our model is a Gaussian Process prior on the functional relationship that determines the conditional mean of the model, hence the name of Gaussian Process Vector Autoregression (GP-VAR). We control for changes in the error variances by introducing a stochastic volatility specification. To facilitate computation in high dimensions and to introduce convenient statistical properties tailored to match stylized facts commonly observed in macro time series, we assume that the covariance of the Gaussian Process is scaled by the latent volatility factors. We illustrate the use of the GP-VAR by analyzing the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty, with a particular emphasis on time variation and asymmetries in the transmission mechanisms. Using US data, we find that uncertainty shocks have time-varying effects, they are less persistent during recessions but their larger size in these specific periods causes more than proportional effects on real growth and employment."

Compressed sensing (CS) shows that a signal having a sparse or compressible representation can be recovered from a small set of linear measurements. In classical CS theory, the sampling matrix and representation matrix are assumed to be known exactly in advance. However, uncertainties exist due to sampling distortion, finite grids of the parameter space of dictionary, etc. In this paper, we take a generalized sparse signal model, which simultaneously considers the sampling and representation matrix uncertainties. Based on the new signal model, a new optimization model for robust sparse signal reconstruction is proposed. This optimization model can be deduced with stochastic robust approximation analysis. Both convex relaxation and greedy algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. For the convex relaxation method, a sufficient condition for recovery by convex relaxation is given; For the greedy algorithm, it is realized by the introduction of a pre-processing of the sensing matrix and the measurements. In numerical experiments, both simulated data and real-life ECG data based results show that the proposed method has a better performance than the current methods."

Most real optimization problems are defined over a mixed search space where the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications, the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly black-box simulation.General mixed and costly optimization problems are therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local and a global estimation techniques are studied. The comparisons are based on the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design problem."

This study investigates whether a uni-directional or bi-directional causal relationship exists between financial development and international trade for Indian economy, during the time period from 1980 to 2019. Three measures of financial development created by IMF, namely, financial institutional development index, financial market development index and a composite index of financial development is utilized for the empirical analysis. Johansen cointegration, vector error correction model and vector auto regressive model are estimated to examine the long run relationship and short run dynamics among the variables of interest. The econometric results indicate that there is indeed a long run association between the composite index of financial development and trade openness. Cointegration is also found to exist between trade openness and index of financial market development. However, there is no evidence of cointegration between financial institutional development and trade openness. Granger causality test results indicate the presence of uni-directional causality running from composite index of financial development to trade openness. Financial market development is also found to Granger cause trade openness.

In this study, we will discuss recent developments in risk management of the global financial and insurance business with respect to sustainable development. So far climate change aspects have been the dominant aspect in managing sustainability risks and opportunities, accompanied by the development of several legislative initiatives triggered by supervisory authorities. However, a sole concentration on these aspects misses out other important economic and social facets of sustainable development goals formulated by the UN. Such aspects have very recently come into the focus of the European Committee concerning the Solvency II project for the European insurance industry. Clearly the new legislative expectations can be better handled by larger insurance companies and holdings than by small- and medium-sized mutual insurance companies which are numerous in central Europe, due to their historic development starting in the late medieval ages and early modern times. We therefore also concentrate on strategies within the risk management of such small- and medium-sized enterprises that can be achieved without much effort, in particular those that are not directly related to climate change."

Here we apply the new algorithm to the whole sample of 2580 binaries found in the OGLE LMC photometric survey and derive the orbital elements for 1931 systems. To obtain the statistical properties of the short-period binaries of the LMC we construct a well defined subsample of 938 eclipsing binaries with main-sequence B-type primaries. Correcting for observational selection effects, we derive the distributions of the fractional radii of the two components and their sum, the brightness ratios and the periods of the short-period binaries. Somewhat surprisingly, the results are consistent with a flat distribution in log P between 2 and 10 days. We also estimate the total number of binaries in the LMC with the same characteristics, and not only the eclipsing binaries, to be about 5000. This figure leads us to suggest that 0.7 +- 0.4 percent of the main-sequence B-type stars in the LMC are found in binaries with periods shorter than 10 days. This frequency is substantially smaller than the fraction of binaries found by small Galactic radial-velocity surveys of B stars. On the other hand, the binary frequency found by HST photometric searches within the late main-sequence stars of 47 Tuc is only slightly higher and still consistent with the frequency we deduced for the B stars in the LMC."

Quantum random number generators (QRNG) based on continuous variable (CV) quantum fluctuations offer great potential for their advantages in measurement bandwidth, stability and integrability. More importantly, it provides an efficient and extensible path for significant promotion of QRNG generation rate. During this process, real-time randomness extraction using information theoretically secure randomness extractors is vital, because it plays critical role in the limit of throughput rate and implementation cost of QRNGs. In this work, we investigate parallel and real-time realization of several Toeplitz-hashing extractors within one field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for parallel QRNG. Elaborate layout of Toeplitz matrixes and efficient utilization of hardware computing resource in the FPGA are emphatically studied. Logic source occupation for different scale and quantity of Toeplitz matrices is analyzed and two-layer parallel pipeline algorithm is delicately designed to fully exploit the parallel algorithm advantage and hardware source of the FPGA. This work finally achieves a real-time post-processing rate of QRNG above 8 Gbps. Matching up with integrated circuit for parallel extraction of multiple quantum sideband modes of vacuum state, our demonstration shows an important step towards chip-based parallel QRNG, which could effectively improve the practicality of CV QRNGs, including device trusted, device-independent, and semi-device-independent schemes."

In the $\\alpha \\to\\infty$ limit we recover the original FPU model.

A methodology of adaptive time series analysis based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been employed to investigate $^{7}$Be activity concentration variability, along with temperature. Analysed data were sampled at ground level by 28 different stations of the CTBTO-IMS network. The adaptive nature of the EMD algorithm allows it to deal with data that are both nonlinear and non-stationary, making no a priori assumptions on the expansion basis. Main purpose of the adopted methodology is to characterise the possible presence of a trend, occurrence of AM-FM modulation of relevant oscillatory modes, residuals distributions and outlier occurrence. Trend component is first estimated via simple EMD and removed. The recent time varying filter EMD (tvf-EMD) technique is then employed to extract local narrow band oscillatory modes from the data. To establish their relevance, a denoising step is then carried out, employing both the Hurst exponent as a thresholding parameter and further testing their statistical significance against white noise. The ones that pass the denoising step are considered to be meaningful oscillatory modes of the data, and their AM-FM modulation is investigated.

Their decay, which injects entropy in the thermal bath, is responsible for a second reheating, dubbed re-reheating, that could substantially dilute the matter-antimatter asymmetry created before. In this paper we analyze such late re-reheating and entropy dilution. It turns out that in some cases the usual analytic calculation badly fails if it is not rectified by some corrective factors that we provide. We also determine the parameter space where the entropy dilution compromises models of baryogenesis. This region can be obtained by imposing some generic constraints that are applicable to any baryogenesis mechanism and long-lived field satisfying a few assumptions. For instance, by applying them to MSSM electroweak baryogenesis, thermal non-resonant leptogenesis and thermal resonant leptogenesis, we obtain that the initial abundances of long-lived fields with lifetime longer than respectively 5*10^13, 10^-2 and 10^15 GeV^-1 are strongly constrained. Similarly, the same baryogenesis scenarios are incompatible with large oscillations of moduli with mass smaller than O(10^8), O(10^13) and O(10^7) GeV that are naturally coupled to the visible sector via gravitational dimension-five operators."

The documentation states that the decay of long-lived fields injects entropy into the thermal bath, causing a second reheating (re-reheating) that \"could substantially dilute the matter-antimatter asymmetry created before.\" This directly supports option C, which accurately describes the potential impact of re-reheating on pre-existing baryogenesis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the re-reheating is said to potentially dilute, not increase, the matter-antimatter asymmetry.\n\nOption B is wrong because the entropy injection does have an effect, potentially compromising baryogenesis models.\n\nOption D is too extreme. While re-reheating can constrain or compromise some baryogenesis scenarios, the text does not suggest it's incompatible with all known mechanisms.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex interplay between theoretical particle physics concepts, early Universe cosmology, and baryogenesis models."

            "text": "Correlated Mixed Membership Modeling of Somatic Mutations. Recent studies of cancer somatic mutation profiles seek to identify mutations for targeted therapy in personalized medicine. Analysis of profiles, however, is not trivial, as each profile is heterogeneous and there are multiple confounding factors that influence the cause-and-effect relationships between cancer genes such as cancer (sub)type, biological processes, total number of mutations, and non-linear mutation interactions. Moreover, cancer is biologically redundant, i.e., distinct mutations can result in the alteration of similar biological processes, so it is important to identify all possible combinatorial sets of mutations for effective patient treatment. To model this phenomena, we propose the correlated zero-inflated negative binomial process to infer the inherent structure of somatic mutation profiles through latent representations. This stochastic process takes into account different, yet correlated, co-occurring mutations using profile-specific negative binomial dispersion parameters that are mixed with a correlated beta-Bernoulli process and a probability parameter to model profile heterogeneity. These model parameters are inferred by iterative optimization via amortized and stochastic variational inference using the Pan Cancer dataset from The Cancer Genomic Archive (TCGA). By examining the the latent space, we identify biologically relevant correlations between somatic mutations."

Solution: Utilize a standard Poisson process for mutation counting.\n\nD) Challenge: Cancer types are easily distinguishable.

Through the creative-destructive process, entrepreneurs are often able to innovate and outperform incumbent organizations, all of which is supposed to lead to higher employment and economic growth. Although some empirical evidence supports this logic, it has also been the subject of recent criticisms. Specifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries; it only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to 2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth. Our evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously undiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages economic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence finds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in more developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market institutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing countries.

We investigate the complexity of computing an optimal repair of an inconsistent database, in the case where integrity constraints are Functional Dependencies (FDs). We focus on two types of repairs: an optimal subset repair (optimal S-repair) that is obtained by a minimum number of tuple deletions, and an optimal update repair (optimal U-repair) that is obtained by a minimum number of value (cell) updates. For computing an optimal S-repair, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that succeeds on certain sets of FDs and fails on others. We prove the following about the algorithm. When it succeeds, it can also incorporate weighted tuples and duplicate tuples. When it fails, the problem is NP-hard, and in fact, APX-complete (hence, cannot be approximated better than some constant). Thus, we establish a dichotomy in the complexity of computing an optimal S-repair. We present general analysis techniques for the complexity of computing an optimal U-repair, some based on the dichotomy for S-repairs. We also draw a connection to a past dichotomy in the complexity of finding a \"most probable database\" that satisfies a set of FDs with a single attribute on the left hand side; the case of general FDs was left open, and we show how our dichotomy provides the missing generalization and thereby settles the open problem."

Animal telemetry data are often analysed with discrete time movement models assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant distant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed irregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised first-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than the regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain telemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine animals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular data directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of several animals."

Experiments on single crystals are highly desired. In this paper, we report the successful growth of the NdO1-xFxBi1-yS2 single crystals. Resistive and magnetic measurements reveal that the bulk superconducting transition occurs at about 5 K, while an unexpected giant superconducting fluctuation appears at temperatures as high as 2-4 kBTC. Analysis based on the anisotropic Ginzbaug-Landau theory gives an anisotropy of 30-45. Two gap features with magnitudes of about 3.5+-0.3 meV and 7.5+-1 meV were observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The smaller gap is associated with the bulk superconducting transition at about 5 K yielding a huge ratio 2Delta_s/kBTc =16.8, the larger gap remains up to about 26 K.

The phenomenon accentuates with stronger correlation between the random variables. A precise quantification characterizing the role of the dimension as well as the dependence is provided. This surprising behavior has serious implications towards Bayesian constrained estimation and inference, where the prior, in addition to having a full support, is required to assign a substantial probability near the origin to capture at parts of the true function of interest. Without further modification, we show that truncated normal priors are not suitable for modeling at regions and propose a novel alternative strategy based on shrinking the coordinates using a multiplicative scale parameter.

We study the global convergence and global optimality of actor-critic, one of the most popular families of reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing works on actor-critic employ bi-level or two-timescale updates, we focus on the more practical single-timescale setting, where the actor and critic are updated simultaneously. Specifically, in each iteration, the critic update is obtained by applying the Bellman evaluation operator only once while the actor is updated in the policy gradient direction computed using the critic. Moreover, we consider two function approximation settings where both the actor and critic are represented by linear or deep neural networks. For both cases, we prove that the actor sequence converges to a globally optimal policy at a sublinear $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate, where $K$ is the number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, we establish the rate of convergence and global optimality of single-timescale actor-critic with linear function approximation for the first time. Moreover, under the broader scope of policy optimization with nonlinear function approximation, we prove that actor-critic with deep neural network finds the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate for the first time."

In particular, we incorporate auxiliary deterministic processes, governed by recurrent neural networks, into the conditional variance of the traditional conditional heteroskedastic models, e.g. the GARCH-type models, to flexibly capture the dynamics of the underlying volatility. The RECH models can detect interesting effects in financial volatility overlooked by the existing conditional heteroskedastic models such as the GARCH (Bollerslev, 1986), GJR (Glosten et al., 1993) and EGARCH (Nelson, 1991).

Speech separation has been successfully applied as a frontend processing module of conversation transcription systems thanks to its ability to handle overlapped speech and its flexibility to combine with downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, a speech separation model often introduces target speech distortion, resulting in a sub-optimum word error rate (WER). In this paper, we describe our efforts to improve the performance of a single channel speech separation system. Specifically, we investigate a two-stage training scheme that firstly applies a feature level optimization criterion for pretraining, followed by an ASR-oriented optimization criterion using an end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition model. Meanwhile, to keep the model light-weight, we introduce a modified teacher-student learning technique for model compression. By combining those approaches, we achieve a absolute average WER improvement of 2.70% and 0.77% using models with less than 10M parameters compared with the previous state-of-the-art results on the LibriCSS dataset for utterance-wise evaluation and continuous evaluation, respectively"

An attractive class of materials for photo(electro)chemical reactions are hybrids based on semiconducting metal oxides and nanocarbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene), where the nanocarbon acts as a highly-stable conductive scaffold onto which the nanostructured inorganic phase can be immobilised; an architecture that maximises surface area and minimises charge transport/transfer resistance. TiO$_{2}$/CNT photoanodes produced by atomic layer deposition on CNT fabrics are shown to be efficient for H$_{2}$ production ($0.07 \\mu mol/min$ $H_{2}$ at $0.2V$ $vs Ag/AgCl$), nearly doubling the performance of TiO$_{2}$ deposited on planar substrates, with $100 \\%$ Faradaic efficiency. The results are rationalised based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements showing a large reduction in photoelectron transport resistance compared to control samples and a higher surface area. The low TiO$_{2}$/CNT interfacial charge transfer resistance ($10 \\Omega$) is consistent with the presence of an interfacial Ti-O-C bond and corresponding electronic hybridisation determined by spatially-resolved Scanning Photoelectron Microscopy (SPEM) using synchrotron radiation."

The relationship between observed tracers such as galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution is crucial in extracting cosmological information. As the linear bias model breaks down at quasi-linear scales, the standard perturbative approach of the nonlinear Eulerian bias model (EBM) is not accurate enough in describing galaxy clustering. In this paper, we discuss such a model in the context of resummed perturbation theory, and further generalize it to incorporate the subsequent gravitational evolution by combining with a Lagrangian description of galaxies' motion. The multipoint propagators we constructed for such model also exhibit exponential damping similar to their dark matter counterparts, therefore the convergence property of statistics built upon these quantities is improved. This is achieved by applying both Eulerian and Lagrangian resummation techniques of dark matter field developed in recent years. As inherited from the Lagrangian description of galaxy density evolution, our approach automatically incorporates the non-locality induced by gravitational evolution after the formation of the tracer, and also allows us to include a continuous galaxy formation history by temporally weighted-averaging relevant quantities with the galaxy formation rate."

In this sense, we characterize Poisson structures around the typical zero-Hopf singularity in dimension 3 under the assumption of having a local analytic first integral with non-vanishing first jet by connecting with the classical Poincar\\'e center problem. From the global point of view, we connect the property of being strictly conservative (the invariant measure must be positive) with the existence of a Poisson structure depending on the phase space dimension. Finally, weak conservativeness in dimension two is introduced by the extension of inverse Jacobi multipliers as weak solutions of its defining partial differential equation and some of its applications are developed.

Because of this, one important question is how much better the algorithms can be as the amount of information increases. To address this question for forming high-utility matchings between agents in $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$, we consider three ordinal information types: when we know the preference order of only nodes in $\\mathcal{X}$ for nodes in $\\mathcal{Y}$, when we know the preferences of both $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$, and when we know the total order of the edge weights in the entire graph, although not the weights themselves.

In general this model can be seen as a possible extension of the time-varying AT1P model in Brigo and Tarenghi (2004). The calibration capability of the Scenario Volatility/Barrier model (SVBAT1P), when keeping time-constant volatility, appears inferior to the one of AT1P with time-varying deterministic volatility. The SVBAT1P model, however, maintains the benefits of time-homogeneity and can lead to satisfactory calibration results, as we show in a case study where we compare different choices on scenarios and parameters. Similarly to AT1P, SVBAT1P is suited to pricing hybrid equity/credit derivatives and to evaluate counterparty risk in equity payoffs, and more generally to evaluate hybrid credit/equity payoffs. We consider the equity return swap in Brigo and Tarenghi (2004) and show its valuation under SVBAT1P with the same CDS and equity calibration input used earlier for AT1P, and further we hint at equity default swap valuation in the conclusions."

The last years, researchers have demonstrated memristive chips as accelerators in computing, following new in-memory and neuromorphic computational approaches. Many different metal oxides have been used as resistance switching materials in MIM or MIS structures. Understanding of the mechanism and the dynamics of resistance switching is very critical for the modeling and use of memristors in different applications. Here, we demonstrate the bipolar resistance switching of silicon nitride thin films using heavily doped Si and Cu as bottom and top-electrodes, respectively. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics reveal that under space-charge limited conditions and appropriate current compliance setting, multi-level resistance operation can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible tuning protocol for multi-level resistance switching was developed applying appropriate SET/RESET pulse sequences.

The cilia are fabricated using a lithographic process in conjunction with deposition of magnetic nickel-iron permalloy to create flexible filaments that can be manipulated by varying an external magnetic field. A rotating permanent magnet is used to actuate the cilia. We examine the kinematics of a cilium and demonstrate that the cilium motion is defined by an interplay among elastic, magnetic, and viscous forces. Specifically, the forward stroke is induced by the rotation of the magnet which bends the cilium, whereas the recovery stroke is defined by the straightening of the deformed cilium, releasing the accumulated elastic potential energy. This difference in dominating forces acting during the forward stroke and the recovery stroke leads to an asymmetrical beating pattern of the cilium.

There are three key factors of a system of coupled oscillators that characterize the interaction among them: coupling (how to affect), delay (when to affect) and topology (whom to affect). For each of them, the existing work has mainly focused on special cases. With new angles and tools, this paper makes progress in relaxing some assumptions of these factors. There are three main results in this paper. First, by using results from algebraic graph theory, a sufficient condition is obtained which can be used to check equilibrium stability. This condition works for arbitrary topology. It generalizes existing results and also leads to a sufficient condition on the coupling function with which the system is guaranteed to reach synchronization. Second, it is known that identical oscillators with sin() coupling functions are guaranteed to synchronize in phase on a complete graph. Using our results, we demonstrate that for many cases certain structures instead of exact shape of the coupling function such as symmetry and concavity are the keys for global synchronization. Finally, the effect of heterogenous delays is investigated. We develop a new framework by constructing a non-delayed phase model that approximates the original one in the continuum limit. We further derive how its stability properties depend on the delay distribution. In particular, we show that heterogeneity, i.e. wider delay distribution, can help reach in-phase synchronization."

We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of our indirect effect estimators. Under complete mediation, where the indirect effect is equivalent to the total effect, we further prove that our approach gives a more powerful test compared to directly testing for the total effect. We confirm our theoretical results in simulations, as well as in an integrative analysis of gene expression and genotype data from a pharmacogenomic study of drug response. We present a novel analysis of gene sets to understand the molecular mechanisms of drug response, and also identify a genome-wide significant noncoding genetic variant that cannot be detected using standard analysis methods."

RGB-D semantic segmentation methods conventionally use two independent encoders to extract features from the RGB and depth data. However, there lacks an effective fusion mechanism to bridge the encoders, for the purpose of fully exploiting the complementary information from multiple modalities. This paper proposes a novel bottom-up interactive fusion structure to model the interdependencies between the encoders. The structure introduces an interaction stream to interconnect the encoders. The interaction stream not only progressively aggregates modality-specific features from the encoders but also computes complementary features for them. To instantiate this structure, the paper proposes a residual fusion block (RFB) to formulate the interdependences of the encoders. The RFB consists of two residual units and one fusion unit with gate mechanism. It learns complementary features for the modality-specific encoders and extracts modality-specific features as well as cross-modal features. Based on the RFB, the paper presents the deep multimodal networks for RGB-D semantic segmentation called RFBNet. The experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling the interdependencies and that the RFBNet achieved state-of-the-art performance."

Corruption is an endemic societal problem with profound implications in the development of nations. In combating this issue, cross-national evidence supporting the effectiveness of the rule of law seems at odds with poorly realized outcomes from reforms inspired in such literature. This paper provides an explanation for such contradiction. By taking a computational approach, we develop two methodological novelties into the empirical study of corruption: (1) generating large within-country variation by means of simulation (instead of cross-national data pooling), and (2) accounting for interactions between covariates through a spillover network. The latter (the network), seems responsible for a significant reduction in the effectiveness of the rule of law; especially among the least developed countries. We also find that effectiveness can be boosted by improving complementary policy issues that may lie beyond the governance agenda. Moreover, our simulations suggest that improvements to the rule of law are a necessary yet not sufficient condition to curve corruption."

In particular, we reveal a novel {\\em intrinsic} contribution to the bulk magnetisation due to the amorphous structure itself, a contribution that is peculiar both in its temperature and magnetic-field dependence and represents the first true magnetic effect in nominally non-magnetic glasses.

However, in the non-linear extension $f(\\Q)$, it is promoted to a dynamical field which changes the physics. Starting from a general metric-affine geometry, we construct the most general static and spherically symmetric forms of the metric and the affine connection. We then use these symmetry reduced geometric objects to prove that the field equations of $f(\\Q)$ gravity admit GR solutions as well as beyond-GR solutions, contrary to what has been claimed in the literature. We formulate precise criteria, under which conditions it is possible to obtain GR solutions and under which conditions it is possible to obtain beyond-GR solutions. We subsequently construct several perturbative corrections to the Schwarzschild solution for different choices of $f(\\Q)$, which in particular include a hair stemming from the now dynamical affine connection.

In this paper, using an envelope model for the microswimmer, we numerically optimize the ciliary motion of a ciliate with an arbitrary axisymmetric shape. The forward solutions are found using a fast boundary integral method, and the efficiency sensitivities are derived using an adjoint-based method. Our results show that a prolate microswimmer with a 2:1 aspect ratio shares similar optimal ciliary motion as the spherical microswimmer, yet the swimming efficiency can increase two-fold.

The origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in rotating shear flow is a long standing puzzle.

Hence, any viscosity in such systems must be due to turbulence, arguably governed by magnetorotational instability especially when temperature T >~ 10^5. However, such disks around quiescent cataclysmic variables, protoplanetary and star-forming disks, the outer regions of disks in active galactic nuclei are practically neutral in charge because of their low temperature, and thus expected not to be coupled with the magnetic field appropriately to generate any transport due to the magnetorotational instability. This flow is similar to plane Couette flow including the Coriolis force, at least locally. What drives their turbulence and then transport, when such flows do not exhibit any unstable mode under linear hydrodynamic perturbation?
