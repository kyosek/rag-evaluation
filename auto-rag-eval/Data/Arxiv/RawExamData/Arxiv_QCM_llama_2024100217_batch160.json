It is an open question how well tensor network states in the form of an infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) tensor network can approximate gapless quantum states of matter. Here we address this issue for two different physical scenarios: i) a conformally invariant $(2+1)d$ quantum critical point in the incarnation of the transverse field Ising model on the square lattice and ii) spontaneously broken continuous symmetries with gapless Goldstone modes exemplified by the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models on the square lattice. We find that the energetically best wave functions display {\\em finite} correlation lengths and we introduce a powerful finite correlation length scaling framework for the analysis of such finite-$D$ iPEPS states. The framework is important i) to understand the mild limitations of the finite-$D$ iPEPS manifold in representing Lorentz-invariant, gapless many body quantum states and ii) to put forward a practical scheme in which the finite correlation length $\\xi(D)$ combined with field theory inspired formulae can be used to extrapolate the data to infinite correlation length, i.e. to the thermodynamic limit.

We propose a very general and fully analytical option pricing framework, encompassing a wide class of discrete time models featuring multiple-component structure in both volatility and leverage, and a flexible pricing kernel with multiple risk premia. Although the proposed framework is general enough to include either GARCH-type volatility, Realized Volatility or a combination of the two, in this paper we focus on realized volatility option pricing models by extending the Heterogeneous Autoregressive Gamma (HARG) model of Corsi, Fusari, La Vecchia (2012) to incorporate heterogeneous leverage structures with multiple components, while preserving closed-form solutions for option prices.

This paper presents a classical estimation problem for calculating the energy generated by photovoltaic solar energy systems in the Netherlands, on a daily, annual and regional basis. We identify two data sources to construct our methodology: pvoutput, an online portal with solar energy yield measurements, and modelled irradiance data, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Combining these, we obtain probability functions of observing energy yields, given the irradiance, which we then apply to our PV systems database, allowing us to calculate daily and annual solar energy yields. We examine the variation in our daily and annual estimates as a result of taking different subsets of pvoutput systems with certain specifications such as orientation, tilt and inverter to PV capacity ratio. Hence we obtain specific annual energy yields in the range of 877-946 kWh/kWp and 838-899 kWh/kWp for 2016 and 2017 respectively. The current method used at Statistics Netherlands assumes this to be 875 kWh/kWp, meaning the yields were underestimated and overestimated for 2016 and 2017 respectively. Finally, we translate our national estimates into solar energy yields per municipality. This research demonstrates that an irradiance based measure of solar energy generation is necessary to obtain more accurate energy yields on both a national and regional level."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary limitation of the current method used at Statistics Netherlands for estimating solar energy yields in the Netherlands, according to the study, and how does the proposed methodology address this limitation?\n\n**A)** The current method assumes a uniform irradiance across the country, leading to underestimated energy yields in the north and overestimated energy yields in the south.

Matching neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests that coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm surge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when using flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of originations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains.

Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) allow for remote sensing of plasma properties in distant regions of the heliosphere. So far, most of the observations have concerned only hydrogen atoms. In this paper, we present perspectives for observations of helium energetic neutral atoms (He ENAs). We calculated the expected intensities of He ENAs created by the neutralization of helium ions in the inner heliosheath and through the secondary ENA mechanism in the outer heliosheath. We found that the dominant source region for He ENAs is the inner heliosheath. The obtained magnitudes of intensity spectra suggest that He ENAs can be observed with future ENA detectors, as those planned on Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. Observing He ENAs is most likely for energies from a few to a few tens of keV/nuc. Estimates of the expected count rates show that the ratio of helium to hydrogen atoms registered in the detectors can be as low as 1:10^4. Consequently, the detectors need to be equipped with an appropriate mass spectrometer capability, allowing for recognition of chemical elements. Due to the long mean free paths of helium ions in the inner heliosheath, He ENAs are produced also in the distant heliospheric tail. This implies that observations of He ENAs can resolve its structure, which seems challenging from observations of hydrogen ENAs since energetic protons are neutralized before they progress deeper in the heliospheric tail."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary source region for helium energetic neutral atoms (He ENAs) in the heliosphere, and how does this differ from observations of hydrogen ENAs?\n\nA) The inner heliosheath is the primary source region for He ENAs, and this is due to the secondary ENA mechanism in the outer heliosheath.\nB) The outer heliosheath is the primary source region for He ENAs, and this is due to the neutralization of helium ions in the inner heliosheath.\nC) The inner heliosheath is the primary source region for He ENAs, and this is due to the long mean free paths of helium ions in the inner heliosheath.\nD) The outer heliosheath is the primary source region for He ENAs, and this is due to the neutralization of helium ions in the inner heliosheath.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The inner heliosheath is the primary source region for He ENAs, and this is due to the long mean free paths of helium ions in the inner heliosheath.\n\nExplanation: According to the paper, the dominant source region for He ENAs is the inner heliosheath, and this is due to the long mean free paths of helium ions in the inner heliosheath.

These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E and M steps.
