The documentation states that \"A spin vortex in momentum space generated in a kagome lattice antiferromagnet has the winding number Q=-2, while the typical one observed in topological insulator surface states is characterized by Q=+1.\" This difference in winding numbers (Q = -2 for the kagome lattice vs. Q = +1 for topological insulator surface states) indicates a higher degree of topological complexity in the kagome system.

Conformational barcodes are modified by all co-occurring allosteric events induced by post-translational modifications, pathogen, drug binding, etc. We argue that fuzziness (plasticity) of conformational barcodes may be increased by disordered protein structures, by integrative plasticity of multi-phosphorylation events, by increased intracellular water content (decreased molecular crowding) and by increased action of molecular chaperones.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a likelihood-free approach for Bayesian inferences based on a rejection algorithm method that applies a tolerance of dissimilarity between summary statistics from observed and simulated data. Although several improvements to the algorithm have been proposed, none of these improvements avoid the following two sources of approximation: 1) lack of sufficient statistics: sampling is not from the true posterior density given data but from an approximate posterior density given summary statistics; and 2) non-zero tolerance: sampling from the posterior density given summary statistics is achieved only in the limit of zero tolerance. The first source of approximation can be improved by adding a summary statistic, but an increase in the number of summary statistics could introduce additional variance caused by the low acceptance rate. Consequently, many researchers have attempted to develop techniques to choose informative summary statistics.

In this paper, we improve the performance of MPEG-2 encoder and n-body simulation by employing the hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming paradigm on SMP clusters. The hierarchical image data structure of the MPEG bit-stream is eminently suitable for the hybrid model to achieve multiple levels of parallelism: MPI for parallelism at the group of pictures level across SMP nodes and OpenMP for parallelism within pictures at the slice level within each SMP node. Similarly, the work load of the force calculation which accounts for upwards of 90% of the cycles in typical computations in the n-body simulation is shared among OpenMP threads after ORB domain decomposition among MPI processes. Besides, loop scheduling of OpenMP threads is adopted with appropriate chunk size to provide better load balance of work, leading to enhanced performance. With the n-body simulation, experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid MPI-OpenMP program outperforms the corresponding pure MPI program by average factors of 1.52 on a 4-way cluster and 1.21 on a 2-way cluster.

At the same time the wide spectrum poses intrinsic difficulties in the chaotic decoding if the chaotic signal is transmitted over real communication channels with limited bandwidth. We address this problem both numerically and experimentally. Two alternative ways to improve communication with chaos over band-limited channels are investigated. The first method employs a matching filter in the decoder which compensates channel distortions of the transmitted signal.

Oscillating circuits are interesting as neuristors, emulating the firing of action potentials. We present room-temperature self-oscillating devices fabricated from epitaxial thin films of semiconducting TbMnO3. We show that these electrical oscillations induce concomitant mechanical oscillations that produce audible sound waves, offering an additional degree of freedom to interface with other devices. The intrinsic nature of the mechanism governing the oscillations gives rise to a high degree of control and repeatability. Obtaining such properties in an epitaxial perovskite oxide, opens the way towards combining self-oscillating properties with those of other piezoelectric, ferroelectric, or magnetic perovskite oxides to achieve hybrid neuristor-memristor functionality in compact heterostuctures."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the significance of the self-oscillating devices fabricated from epitaxial thin films of semiconducting TbMnO3, as discussed in the article?\n\nA) They primarily function as memristors, mimicking synaptic connections in neuromorphic computing.\n\nB) They exhibit electrical oscillations that induce mechanical oscillations, producing audible sound waves and offering an additional interface option.\n\nC) They are solely focused on improving the energy efficiency of traditional computing systems.\n\nD) They demonstrate the ability to store and process information simultaneously, like biological neurons.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model.

People are living longer than ever due to advances in healthcare, and this has prompted many healthcare providers to look towards remote patient care as a means to meet the needs of the future. It is now a priority to enable people to reside in their own homes rather than in overburdened facilities whenever possible. The increasing maturity of IoT technologies and the falling costs of connected sensors has made the deployment of remote healthcare at scale an increasingly attractive prospect. In this work we demonstrate that we can measure the consistency and regularity of the behaviour of a household using sensor readings generated from interaction with the home environment. We show that we can track changes in this behaviour regularity longitudinally and detect changes that may be related to significant life events or trends that may be medically significant.

This paper presents an overview of the most relevant results previously obtained with the model, highlighting the influence of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation on them. For 95% CO2 emissions reduction, relative to 1990 level, PV generation supplies in average 33% of the electricity demand. Southern European countries install large PV capacities together with electric batteries, while northern countries install onshore and offshore wind capacities and use hydrogen storage and reinforced interconnections to deal with wind fluctuations.
