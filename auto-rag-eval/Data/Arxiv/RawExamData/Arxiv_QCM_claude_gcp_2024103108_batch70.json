We develop a machine-learning-based method, Principal Smooth-Dynamics Analysis (PriSDA), to identify patterns in economic development and to automate the development of new theory of economic dynamics.

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field that has attracted considerable research interest over the past few years. Previous review articles in CS limit their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including continuous-time signals.

In most cities, transit consists of fixed-route transportation only, whence the inherent limited Quality of Service for travellers in sub-urban areas and during off-peak periods.

It is still unclear how to ingrate DR transportation into current transit systems to take full advantage of it. We propose a Continuous Approximation model of a transit system that gets the best from fixed-route and DR transit. Our model allows to decide, in each area and time of day, whether to deploy a fixed-route or a DR feeder, and to redesign line frequencies and stop spacing of the main trunk service accordingly. Since such a transit design can adapt to the spatial and temporal variation of the demand, we call it Adaptive Transit.
