The project OptoTracker aims to investigate a new approach to track charged particles in a scintillating material, by using the optical signal. Our idea is to reconstruct the trajectory of a charged particle by collecting the scintillation light emitted along the path with pixelized photo-detectors. This would permit to obtain an image of the track, similarly to what is done in a photographic camera. Full 3D reconstruction is performed by using both the charge distribution and the hit time information folded in a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm. This solution, compared to \"traditional\" tracking methods, exploits the fastest information carrier within a material: the light. Therefore, an optical tracking detector would be intrinsically capable of sustaining a very high interaction rate. Moreover, the intrinsic resolution would not be limited by carriers diffusion, as happens in charge-transport based detectors. This new technology could have a very large impact both on beam experiments, thanks to the possible increase in the acquisition rate, and in rare-physics experiments (double-$\\beta$ decay, dark-matter searches, neutrino oscillation searches), where the enhanced particle-id and directionality capability can provide significant background reduction.

What is the primary advantage of using optical signals for tracking charged particles, and how does it compare to traditional tracking methods?\n\n**A)** The primary advantage is that optical signals can be detected at very high rates, making it suitable for high-energy particle collisions. However, this comes at the cost of lower spatial resolution compared to traditional methods.\n\n**B)** The primary advantage is that optical signals can provide high spatial resolution and directionality, allowing for precise tracking of charged particles.

To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols. Also, DeepRx outputs soft bits that are compatible with the channel coding used in 5G systems. Using 3GPP-defined channel models, we demonstrate that DeepRx outperforms traditional methods.

The ongoing net neutrality debate has generated a lot of heated discussions on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing' has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs (zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs. This allows the possibility for Content Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to zero-rate their content and attract more user traffic.

We first consider a model with a monopolistic ISP and multiple CPs where users select CPs based on the quality of service (QoS) and data access charges.
