Bayesian experimental design (BED) aims at designing an experiment to maximize the information gathering from the collected data. The optimal design is usually achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the data and the model parameters. When the analytical expression of the MI is unavailable, e.g., having implicit models with intractable data distributions, a neural network-based lower bound of the MI was recently proposed and a gradient ascent method was used to maximize the lower bound. However, the approach in Kleinegesse et al., 2020 requires a pathwise sampling path to compute the gradient of the MI lower bound with respect to the design variables, and such a pathwise sampling path is usually inaccessible for implicit models. In this work, we propose a hybrid gradient approach that leverages recent advances in variational MI estimator and evolution strategies (ES) combined with black-box stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) to maximize the MI lower bound. This allows the design process to be achieved through a unified scalable procedure for implicit models without sampling path gradients. Several experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the scalability of BED for implicit models in high-dimensional design space."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantage of the hybrid gradient approach proposed in this work for Bayesian experimental design with implicit models?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for mutual information estimation entirely, relying solely on evolution strategies.\n\nB) It combines variational mutual information estimation with evolution strategies and black-box stochastic gradient ascent, allowing for design optimization without requiring pathwise sampling gradients.\n\nC) It introduces a new analytical expression for mutual information that works specifically for implicit models.\n\nD) It improves upon previous methods by developing a more efficient pathwise sampling technique for gradient computation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a contact angle of a soft silicone substrate on rigid silica spheres that depends on the surface functionalization but not the sphere size.

Firms are represented as a point cloud in a five dimensional space, one axis for each predictor. Visualising that cloud using Ball Mapper reveals failing firms are not often neighbours. As new modelling approaches vie to better predict firm failure, often using black boxes to deliver potentially over-fitting models, a timely reminder is sounded on the importance of evidencing the identification process. Value is added to the understanding of where in the parameter space failure occurs, and how firms might act to move away from financial distress. Further, lenders may find opportunity amongst subsets of firms that are traditionally considered to be in danger of bankruptcy but actually sit in characteristic spaces where failure has not occurred."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to examine corporate failure predictions using Altman's Z-Score model.

The result is a set of decomposed directional waves that are separately analyzed to construct shear modulus fields that are then combined through compounding. Instead, PWE relies on a rigorous representation of the wave propagation using the frequency-domain scalar wave equation to automatically select appropriate propagation directions and simultaneously reconstruct shear modulus fields. Specifically, assuming a homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, linear-elastic medium, we represent the solution of the wave equation using a linear combination of plane waves propagating in arbitrary directions. Given this closed-form solution, we formulate the SWE problem as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem which can be solved very efficiently.

In this work, the aim is to study the diffusion of innovation of two competing products. The main focus has been to understand the effects of the competitive dynamic market on the diffusion of innovation. The global smartphone operating system sales are chosen as an example. The availability of the sales and the number of users data, as well as the predictions for the future number of users, make the smartphone diffusion a new laboratory to test the innovation of diffusion models for the competitive markets. In this work, the Bass model and its extensions which incorporate the competition between the brands are used. The diffusion of smartphones can be considered on two levels: the product level and the brand level. The diffusion of the smartphone as a category is studied by using the Bass equation (category-level diffusion). The diffusion of each competing operating system (iOS and Android) are considered as the competition of the brands, and it is studied in the context of competitive market models (product-level diffusion).

The utility of DNA sequence substrings (k-mers) in alignment-free phylogenetic classification, including that of bacteria and viruses, is increasingly recognized. However, its biological basis eludes many twenty-first century practitioners. A path from the nineteenth century recognition of the informational basis of heredity to the modern era can be discerned. Crick's DNA \"unpairing postulate\" predicted that recombinational pairing of homologous DNAs during meiosis would be mediated by short k-mers in the loops of stem-loop structures extruded from classical duplex helices. The complementary \"kissing\" duplex loops - like tRNA anticodon-codon k-mer duplexes - would seed a more extensive pairing that would then extend until limited by lack of homology or other factors. Indeed, this became the principle behind alignment-based methods that assessed similarity by degree of DNA-DNA reassociation in vitro. These are now seen as less sensitive than alignment-free methods that are closely consistent, both theoretically and mechanistically, with chromosomal anti-recombination models for the initiation of divergence into new species. The analytical power of k-mer differences supports the theses that evolutionary advance sometimes serves the needs of nucleic acids (genomes) rather than proteins (genes), and that such differences have often played a role in early speciation events."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between k-mer analysis, alignment-free phylogenetic classification, and the historical understanding of DNA's role in heredity and speciation?\n\nA) K-mer analysis is a modern technique that contradicts Crick's DNA \"unpairing postulate\" and has no connection to earlier theories of DNA pairing during meiosis.\n\nB) Alignment-free methods using k-mers are less sensitive than traditional DNA-DNA reassociation techniques for assessing similarity between species.\n\nC) K-mer analysis in alignment-free phylogenetic classification is consistent with historical models of DNA pairing during meiosis and supports the idea that genomes, rather than genes, play a crucial role in speciation events.\n\nD) The success of k-mer analysis in phylogenetic classification is primarily due to its focus on protein-coding regions rather than whole-genome comparisons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the passage indicates that k-mer analysis in alignment-free phylogenetic classification is consistent with historical understanding of DNA's role in heredity and speciation. Specifically, it mentions that this method aligns with Crick's DNA \"unpairing postulate\" which predicted that short k-mers in stem-loop structures would mediate recombinational pairing of homologous DNAs during meiosis. Furthermore, the passage states that k-mer differences support the idea that evolutionary advances sometimes serve the needs of genomes rather than genes, and that these differences have often played a role in early speciation events.

Machine learning relies on the availability of a vast amount of data for training. However, in reality, most data are scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated under many legal and practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical models under a data federation. The federation allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy, and enables complimentary knowledge to be transferred in the network. As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. A secure transfer cross validation approach is also proposed to guard the FTL performance under the federation.
