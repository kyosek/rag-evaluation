I find that T_tot ~ r_max^{-2}, where r_max is the maximum radius to which candidates are searched, or T_tot ~ \\mu_min^2, where \\mu_min is the minimum proper motion to which candidates are searched. I show that T_tot can be reduced by a factor 4 if source availability is extended from V_s=17 to V_s=19. Increasing r_max and V_s and decreasing \\mu_min all require a significantly more agressive approach to finding candidates. A search for candidates can begin by making use of the Luyton proper motion catalog together with the USNO-A2.0 all-sky astrometric catalog.

At the beginning, the definitions of a subriemannian geometry, horizontal vector fields and horizontal curves are given. Then the question arises: Can any two points be connected by a horizontal curve? Chow's Theorem gives an affirmative answer for bracket generating distributions. (A distribution is called bracket generating if horizontal vector fields and their iterated Lie brackets span the whole tangent space.)

The first proof is based on the theory of Stefan and Sussmann regarding integrability of singular distributions. The second proof is elementary and gives some insight in the shape of subriemannian balls. The third proof is based on infinite dimensional analysis of the endpoint map.

Certain applications require the use of signals that combine both the capability to operate with low signal-to-noise ratios and the ability to support multiple users without interference. In the case where many users have very different signal-to-noise ratios, it is necessary to consider coding schemes that can be used in a multi-user environment but with different noise immunity levels.

In this work an algorithm to generate binary sequences completely uncorrelated with certain sets of complementary sequences is presented.

The lyric-to-template module is made up of some rules and a lyric-to-rhythm model, which is trained with paired lyric-rhythm data that is easier to obtain than paired lyric-melody data.

We demonstrate that $N_c=3$ (our world) is not large with respect to the other dimensionless scale relevant to baryonic matter, the number of neighbors in a dense system $N_N$. Consequently, we show that the liquid-gas phase transition looks dramatically different at $N_c \\to \\infty$ with respect of our world: The critical point temperature becomes of the order of $\\lqcd$ rather than below it. The critical point density becomes of the order of the baryonic density, rather than an order of magnitude below it. These are precisely the characteristics usually associated with the \"Quarkyonic phase\". We therefore conjecture that quarkyonic matter is simply the large $N_c$ limit of the nuclear liquid, and the interplay between $N_c$ and $N_N$ is the reason why the nuclear liquid in our world is so different from quarkyonic matter.
