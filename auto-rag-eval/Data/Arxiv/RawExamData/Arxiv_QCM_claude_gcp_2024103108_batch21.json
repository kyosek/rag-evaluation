Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with synthetic and real-world maps.

Deep learning has proved to be very effective in learning with a large amount of labelled data. Few-shot learning in contrast attempts to learn with only a few labelled data.

We employ the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a metric to compute a structural distance between dense image representations to determine image relevance. The EMD generates the optimal matching flows between structural elements that have the minimum matching cost, which is used to calculate the image distance for classification. To generate the important weights of elements in the EMD formulation, we design a cross-reference mechanism, which can effectively alleviate the adverse impact caused by the cluttered background and large intra-class appearance variations.

The passage emphasizes that mechanical forces and principles of thermodynamics also play a role in neuronal excitability and signaling, which are not accounted for in the HH model. The text suggests that to advance our understanding of neural function and dysfunction, we need to integrate compartmentalized analyses of electrical, chemical, and mechanical processes into more comprehensive theories.

Social learning is defined as the ability of a population to aggregate information, a process which must crucially depend on the mechanisms of social interaction. Consumers choosing which product to buy, or voters deciding which option to take respect to an important issues, typically confront external signals to the information gathered from their contacts. Received economic models typically predict that correct social learning occurs in large populations unless some individuals display unbounded influence. We challenge this conclusion by showing that an intuitive threshold process of individual adjustment does not always lead to such social learning. We find, specifically, that three generic regimes exist. And only in one of them, where the threshold is within a suitable intermediate range, the population learns the correct information. In the other two, where the threshold is either too high or too low, the system either freezes or enters into persistent flux, respectively.

We present finite temperature Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov (FTDHB) calculations for the tin isotope chain to study the dependence of pseudospin on the nuclear temperature. In the FTDHB calculation, the density dependence of the self-consistent relativistic mean fields, the pairing, and the vapor phase that takes into account the unbound nucleon states are considered self-consistently. The mean field potentials obtained in the FTDHB calculations are fit by Woods-Saxon (WS) potentials to examine how the WS parameters are related to the energy splitting of the pseudospin pairs as the temperature increases. We find that the nuclear potential surface diffuseness is the main driver for the pseudospin splittings and that it increases as the temperature grows. We conclude that pseudospin symmetry is better realized when the nuclear temperature increases. The results confirm the findings of previous works using RMF theory at $T=0$, namely that the correlation between the pseudospin splitting and the parameters of the Woods-Saxon potentials implies that pseudospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in nuclei. We show that the dynamical nature of the pseudospin symmetry remains when the temperature is considered in a realistic calculation of the tin isotopes, such as that of the Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov formalism."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: How does increasing nuclear temperature affect pseudospin symmetry according to the Finite Temperature Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov (FTDHB) calculations for tin isotopes?\n\nA) It decreases pseudospin symmetry due to increased nuclear potential surface diffuseness\nB) It improves pseudospin symmetry realization as the nuclear potential surface diffuseness increases\nC) It has no significant effect on pseudospin symmetry\nD) It decreases pseudospin symmetry due to decreased nuclear potential surface diffuseness\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex relationship between nuclear temperature, potential surface diffuseness, and pseudospin symmetry as described in the FTDHB calculations. The correct answer is B because the text states that \"pseudospin symmetry is better realized when the nuclear temperature increases\" and that \"the nuclear potential surface diffuseness is the main driver for the pseudospin splittings and that it increases as the temperature grows.\" This implies that increasing temperature leads to increased surface diffuseness, which in turn improves pseudospin symmetry realization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the findings by suggesting that increased diffuseness decreases symmetry. Option C is wrong because the text clearly indicates that temperature does have a significant effect. Option D is incorrect on both counts - it suggests a decrease in symmetry and in diffuseness, both of which contradict the findings."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Challenges and opportunities for heavy scalar searches in the $t\\bar t$\n  channel at the LHC", "source": "Marcela Carena, Zhen Liu", "docs_id": "1608.07282", "section": ["hep-ph", "hep-ex"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Challenges and opportunities for heavy scalar searches in the $t\\bar t$\n  channel at the LHC.

As a result, the exhaustive modeling of such problem is an involved task. Lattice Boltzmann simulations in 2D for capillary infiltration are carried out in the isothermal regime taking into account surface reaction and subsequent surface growth.

Graph embeddings, a class of dimensionality reduction techniques designed for relational data, have proven useful in exploring and modeling network structure. Most dimensionality reduction methods allow out-of-sample extensions, by which an embedding can be applied to observations not present in the training set. Applied to graphs, the out-of-sample extension problem concerns how to compute the embedding of a vertex that is added to the graph after an embedding has already been computed. In this paper, we consider the out-of-sample extension problem for two graph embedding procedures: the adjacency spectral embedding and the Laplacian spectral embedding.

Models of global climate phenomena of low to intermediate complexity are very useful for providing an understanding at a conceptual level. An important aspect of such models is the presence of a number of feedback loops that feature considerable delay times, usually due to the time it takes to transport energy (for example, in the form of hot/cold air or water) around the globe. In this paper we demonstrate how one can perform a bifurcation analysis of the behaviour of a periodically-forced system with delay in dependence on key parameters. As an example we consider the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a sea surface temperature oscillation on a multi-year scale in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. One can think of ENSO as being generated by an interplay between two feedback effects, one positive and one negative, which act only after some delay that is determined by the speed of transport of sea-surface temperature anomalies across the Pacific. We perform here a case study of a simple delayed-feedback oscillator model for ENSO (introduced by Tziperman et al, J. Climate 11 (1998)), which is parametrically forced by annual variation.
