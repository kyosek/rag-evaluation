Transient networks comprised of polymers connected by short-lived bonds are a common design theme for both biological and synthetic materials. Transient bonds can provide mechanical rigidity, while still allowing for visco-elastic flows on timescales longer than the bond lifetime. In many biological polymer networks such as the actin cytoskeleton, the short-lived bonds are formed by accessory proteins that diffuse away after unbinding. By contrast, bonds in synthetic networks, such as the pendant groups of telechelic polymers, can only rebind in the same location. Using a recently developed theoretical model of the fracturing of visco-elastic materials, we here investigate the effect of linker mobility on the bond dynamics of a network under stress. We find that although mean field properties such as the average bond linker lifetime are barely affected by bond mobility, networks cross linked by mobile bonds fracture more readily due to 'leaking' of linkers from crack areas to less stressed regions within the network. We propose a theoretical model to describe the redistribution of mobile linkers, which we validate by simulations. Our work offers insight into a potential trade-off that cells face, between fracture strength versus the modularity and tight dynamic control offered by mobile linkers."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of transient polymer networks, what is the primary consequence of using mobile crosslinkers compared to immobile ones?\n\nA) Mobile crosslinkers significantly increase the average bond lifetime\nB) Networks with mobile crosslinkers have higher fracture strength\nC) Mobile crosslinkers cause networks to fracture more easily\nD) Immobile crosslinkers allow for more visco-elastic flows\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C: Mobile crosslinkers cause networks to fracture more easily.

For wide networks, the trajectory under gradient descent is governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and for deep networks the NTK itself maintains only weak data dependence. By analyzing the spectrum of the NTK, we formulate necessary conditions for trainability and generalization across a range of architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In such cases, the designer is forced to decide on heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not comparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a Bayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable controllers prior to data collection: Nothing, except that it should be a somewhat large number. The resulting Bayesian model, approximated with a Gaussian process, predicts high cost values in regions where failures are likely to occur. In this way, the model guides the BO exploration toward regions of stability.

Indeed, empirical studies have found peaks of putatively adaptive differentiation. These are highly variable in length, some of them extending over several hundreds of thousands of base pairs. How can such 'islands of divergence' be explained? Physical linkage produces elevated levels of differentiation at loci close to genes under selection. However, whether this is enough to account for the observed patterns of divergence is not well understood.

In this work we propose the use of an attention mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non fixed length speech utterances. Our system is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encodes short-term speaker features from the spectrogram and a self multi-head attention model that maps these representations into a long-term speaker embedding. The attention model that we propose produces multiple alignments from different subsegments of the CNN encoded states over the sequence. Hence this mechanism works as a pooling layer which decides the most discriminative features over the sequence to obtain an utterance level representation.

The key innovation described in the document is the use of a self multi-head attention mechanism that produces multiple alignments from different subsegments of the CNN-encoded states over the sequence.

Our study utilized regression models and attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms and a multi-clinical information system large-scale database to build models that can predict the successful response to FBT among hypotensive patients in ICUs. We investigated both time-aggregated modeling using logistic regression algorithms with regularization and time-series modeling using the long short term memory network (LSTM) and the gated recurrent units network (GRU) with the attention mechanism for clinical interpretability. Among all modeling strategies, the stacked LSTM with the attention mechanism yielded the most predictable model with the highest accuracy of 0.852 and area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.925.

It is highly important for governments and health organizations to monitor the prevalence of breast cancer as a leading source of cancer-related death among women. However, the accurate diagnosis of this disease is expensive, especially in developing countries. This article concerns a cost-efficient method for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a comprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is utilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs some visually assessed cytological covariates, which are pertinent to determination of breast cancer, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are explored. Evidence from numerical studies is reported. The developed procedure can be substantially more efficient than its competitor in simple random sampling (SRS). In some situations, the proportion estimation in MSRSS needs around 76% fewer observations than that in SRS, given a precision level. Thus, using MSRSS may lead to a considerable reduction in cost with respect to SRS. In many medical studies, e.g. diagnosing breast cancer based on a full biopsy procedure, exact quantification is difficult (costly and/or time-consuming), but the potential sample units can be ranked fairly accurately without actual measurements.

Accordingly, we consider iterated random operators over a Polish space that simulate iterated contraction operator over that Polish space. Assume that the iterated random operators are indexed by certain batch sizes such that as batch sizes grow to infinity, each realization of the random operator converges (in some sense) to the contraction operator it is simulating.

The Simultaneous Long-Short(SLS) controller for trading a single stock is known to guarantee positive expected value of the resulting gain-loss function with respect to a large class of stock price dynamics. In the literature, this is known as the Robust Positive Expectation(RPE)property. An obvious way to extend this theory to the trading of two stocks is to trade each one of them using its own independent SLS controller. Motivated by the fact that such a scheme does not exploit any correlation between the two stocks, we study the case when the relative sign between the drifts of the two stocks is known. The main contributions of this paper are three-fold: First, we put forward a novel architecture in which we cross-couple two SLS controllers for the two-stock case. Second, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of the gain-loss function. Third, we use this closed-form expression to prove that the RPE property is guaranteed with respect to a large class of stock-price dynamics. When more information over and above the relative sign is assumed, additional benefits of the new architecture are seen.
