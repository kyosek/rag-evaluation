Cluster structure in cognitive radio networks facilitates cooperative spectrum sensing, routing and other functionalities.

This paper analyses the problem that how to form robust clusters in cognitive radio network, so that more cognitive radio users can get benefits from cluster structure even when the primary users' operation are intense. We provide a formal description of robust clustering problem, prove it to be NP-hard and propose a centralized solution, besides, a distributed solution is proposed to suit the dynamics in the ad hoc cognitive radio network. Congestion game model is adopted to analyze the process of cluster formation, which not only contributes designing the distributed clustering scheme directly, but also provides the guarantee of convergence into Nash Equilibrium and convergence speed. Our proposed clustering solution is versatile to fulfill some other requirements such as faster convergence and cluster size control.

Death of a cell occurs in the model when an essential gene loses all of its interactions to other genes, equivalent to the deletion of an essential gene.

The given text states that the solutions are stable in a larger class of weak solutions, which may not even be BV (bounded variation). Furthermore, it mentions that the Tame Oscillation Condition and the Bounded Variation Condition on space-like curves are not necessary for the uniqueness of solutions in the BV theory for systems with 2 unknowns. This extends the classical weak-strong uniqueness results to a weak-BV uniqueness result, where only one solution needs to be small BV, and the other can come from a larger class.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown huge potentials in building financial market simulators recently.

Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are among the most enigmatic sources known today. Exhibiting huge X- and Gamma-ray bursts and flares, as well as soft quiescent X-ray emission, their energy source remains a mystery. Just as mysterious are the Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), which share many of the same characteristics. Thanks to recent Chandra observations, SGR 0526-66, the first SGR, now appears to be a transition object bridging the two classes, and therefore observations of it have implications for both SGRs and AXPs. The two most popular current models for their persistent emission are accretion of a fossil disk or decay of an enormous (~10^15 G) magnetic field in a magnetar. We show how deep optical observations of SGR 0526-66, the only SGR with small enough optical extinction for meaningful observations, show no evidence of an optical counterpart. These observation place strong new constraints on both accretion disk and magnetar models, and suggest that the spectral energy distribution may peak in the hard-UV.
