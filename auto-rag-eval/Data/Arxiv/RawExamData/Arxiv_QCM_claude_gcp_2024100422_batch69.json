In this work, we are interested in the question - what content in a scene causes it to be funny? As a first step towards understanding visual humor, we analyze the humor manifested in abstract scenes and design computational models for them. We collect two datasets of abstract scenes that facilitate the study of humor at both the scene-level and the object-level. We analyze the funny scenes and explore the different types of humor depicted in them via human studies.

Cancer cells are known to modify their micro-environment such that it can sustain a larger population, or, in ecological terms, they construct a niche which increases the carrying capacity of the population. It has however been argued that niche construction, which benefits all cells in the tumour, would be selected against since cheaters could reap the benefits without paying the cost. We have investigated the impact of niche specificity on tumour evolution using an individual based model of breast tumour growth, in which the carrying capacity of each cell consists of two components: an intrinsic, subclone-specific part and a contribution from all neighbouring cells. Analysis of the model shows that the ability of a mutant to invade a resident population depends strongly on the specificity. When specificity is low selection is mostly on growth rate, while high specificity shifts selection towards increased carrying capacity.

By comparing the results from a spatially structured vs.\\ well-mixed population we show that spatial structure restores selection for carrying capacity even at zero specificity, which a poses solution to the niche construction dilemma.

Although the consensus is that massive stars were commonly formed in the first cosmic structures, our calculations show that their actual formation depends sensitively on the mass accretion rate and its time variation.

While all these mechanisms play a role, steric interception and inertial impaction are typically the most significant for filtering larger droplets and particles, which are the primary carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n\nSteric interception occurs when particles are large enough to be physically blocked by the fibers of the mask. Inertial impaction happens when particles are unable to follow the airflow around mask fibers due to their inertia and collide with the fibers instead. These two mechanisms are particularly effective for the droplet sizes most relevant to COVID-19 transmission.\n\nDiffusion is more effective for very small particles, while electrostatic capture can enhance filtration but is not typically the primary mechanism in cloth or surgical masks.

For this, we herein propose a fully-convolutional Siamese network that learns the similarity between pairs of image regions containing the same landmark.
