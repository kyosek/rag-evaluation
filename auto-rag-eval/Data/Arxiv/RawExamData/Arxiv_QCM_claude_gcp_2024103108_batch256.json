The measured rate is 0.223 cpd/100 t (counts per day per 100 metric tons)\n2. The active volume is 278 metric tons\n3.

When searching over a large parameter space for anomalies such as events, peaks, objects, or particles, there is a large probability that spurious signals with seemingly high significance will be found. This is known as the look-elsewhere effect and is prevalent throughout cosmology, (astro)particle physics, and beyond. To avoid making false claims of detection, one must account for this effect when assigning the statistical significance of an anomaly. This is typically accomplished by considering the trials factor, which is generally computed numerically via potentially expensive simulations. In this paper we develop a continuous generalization of the Bonferroni and Sidak corrections by applying the Laplace approximation to evaluate the Bayes factor, and in turn relating the trials factor to the prior-to-posterior volume ratio. We use this to define a test statistic whose frequentist properties have a simple interpretation in terms of the global $p$-value, or statistical significance. We apply this method to various physics-based examples and show it to work well for the full range of $p$-values, i.e. in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes. We also show that this method naturally accounts for other model complexities such as additional degrees of freedom, generalizing Wilks' theorem.

In this case, while the local p-value of 0.0001 (3.9\u03c3) seems impressive, the global significance will be lower due to the look-elsewhere effect. This is because when searching over a wide mass range, there's a higher probability of finding spurious signals that appear significant by chance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the global significance is almost always lower than the local significance due to the look-elsewhere effect. Option B is wrong as the look-elsewhere effect decreases, not increases, the significance. Option D is not the best answer because while the Bonferroni correction is related to this problem, the question mentions a continuous parameter space (mass range), for which a direct application of the Bonferroni correction is not appropriate without modification.\n\nThe correct answer, C, acknowledges that the global significance will be lower and emphasizes the need for careful quantification.

We study differentially private (DP) algorithms for stochastic convex optimization: the problem of minimizing the population loss given i.i.d. samples from a distribution over convex loss functions. A recent work of Bassily et al. (2019) has established the optimal bound on the excess population loss achievable given $n$ samples. Unfortunately, their algorithm achieving this bound is relatively inefficient: it requires $O(\\min\\{n^{3/2}, n^{5/2}/d\\})$ gradient computations, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem. We describe two new techniques for deriving DP convex optimization algorithms both achieving the optimal bound on excess loss and using $O(\\min\\{n, n^2/d\\})$ gradient computations. In particular, the algorithms match the running time of the optimal non-private algorithms. The first approach relies on the use of variable batch sizes and is analyzed using the privacy amplification by iteration technique of Feldman et al. (2018). The second approach is based on a general reduction to the problem of localizing an approximately optimal solution with differential privacy. Such localization, in turn, can be achieved using existing (non-private) uniformly stable optimization algorithms. As in the earlier work, our algorithms require a mild smoothness assumption. We also give a linear-time algorithm achieving the optimal bound on the excess loss for the strongly convex case, as well as a faster algorithm for the non-smooth case."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the main contribution of the research presented in the document?\n\nA) It introduces a new differentially private algorithm that achieves optimal excess population loss with O(n^3/2) gradient computations.\n\nB) It proposes two new techniques that achieve optimal excess population loss with O(min{n, n^2/d}) gradient computations, matching non-private algorithms' running time.\n\nC) It develops a linear-time algorithm for strongly convex cases without considering differential privacy.\n\nD) It improves upon Bassily et al.'s (2019) work by reducing the number of gradient computations to O(n) for all problem dimensions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the document explicitly states that the researchers describe \"two new techniques for deriving DP convex optimization algorithms both achieving the optimal bound on excess loss and using O(min{n, n^2/d}) gradient computations.\" It also mentions that these algorithms \"match the running time of the optimal non-private algorithms.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes a less efficient algorithm with O(n^3/2) gradient computations, which is not the main contribution of this research.\n\nOption C is partially correct in mentioning a linear-time algorithm for strongly convex cases, but this is not the main contribution and ignores the crucial aspect of differential privacy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the new techniques improve upon Bassily et al.'s work, they don't reduce gradient computations to O(n) for all problem dimensions.

Secondly, $\\theta$ activation functions for neural networks and $\\theta$ compositional kernels are introduced by building upon the theory of branching processes, and more specifically upon $\\theta$ PGFs. While $\\theta$ compositional kernels are recursive, they are expressed in closed form. It is shown that $\\theta$ compositional kernels have non-degenerate asymptotic properties under certain conditions. Thus, GPs with $\\theta$ compositional kernels do not require non-explicit recursive kernel evaluations and have controllable infinite-depth asymptotic properties.
