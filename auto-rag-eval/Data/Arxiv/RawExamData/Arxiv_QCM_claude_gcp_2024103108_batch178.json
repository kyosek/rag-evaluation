Theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that electrons in condensed matter can behave hydrodynamically, exhibiting fluid phenomena such as Stokes flow and vortices. Unlike classical fluids, preferred directions inside crystals lift isotropic restrictions, necessitating a generalized treatment of electron hydrodynamics. We explore electron fluid behaviors arising from the most general viscosity tensors in two and three dimensions, constrained only by thermodynamics and crystal symmetries. Hexagonal 2D materials such as graphene support flows indistinguishable from those of an isotropic fluid. By contrast 3D materials including Weyl semimetals, exhibit significant deviations from isotropy. Breaking time-reversal symmetry, for example in magnetic topological materials, introduces a non-dissipative Hall component to the viscosity tensor. While this vanishes by isotropy in 3D, anisotropic materials can exhibit nonzero Hall viscosity components.

Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep neural networks, are enabling a range of emerging applications. One such example is autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. However, deep learning-based perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images. Nevertheless, the vast majority of such demonstrations focus on perception that is disembodied from end-to-end control. We present novel end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective. We define several objective functions that quantify the success of an attack and develop techniques based on Bayesian Optimization to efficiently traverse the search space of higher dimensional attacks. Additionally, we define a novel class of hijacking attacks, where painted lines on the road cause the driver-less car to follow a target path.

An accurate and efficient event reconstruction is required to realize the full scientific capability of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs). The current and future neutrino experiments that rely on massive LArTPCs create a need for new ideas and reconstruction approaches. Wire-Cell, proposed in recent years, is a novel tomographic event reconstruction method for LArTPCs. The Wire-Cell 3D imaging approach capitalizes on charge, sparsity, time, and geometry information to reconstruct a topology-agnostic 3D image of the ionization electrons prior to pattern recognition. A second novel method, the many-to-many charge-light matching, then pairs the TPC charge activity to the detected scintillation light signal, thus enabling a powerful rejection of cosmic-ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector. A robust processing of the scintillation light signal and an appropriate clustering of the reconstructed 3D image are fundamental to this technique. In this paper, we describe the principles and algorithms of these techniques and their successful application in the MicroBooNE experiment. A quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques is presented. Using these techniques, a 95% efficient pre-selection of neutrino charged-current events is achieved with a 30-fold reduction of non-beam-coincident cosmic-ray muons, and about 80\\% of the selected neutrino charged-current events are reconstructed with at least 70% completeness and 80% purity."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of techniques does Wire-Cell employ to achieve efficient neutrino event selection in the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber?\n\nA) 2D imaging, particle identification, and time-of-flight measurements\nB) 3D imaging, clustering, and charge-light matching\nC) Track reconstruction, calorimetry, and neural network classification\nD) Topological pattern recognition, pulse-shape discrimination, and vertex finding\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) 3D imaging, clustering, and charge-light matching.

One of the exciting recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the development of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that can autonomously handle conversion between different cryptocurrencies. Decentralized exchange protocols such as Uniswap, Curve and other types of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) maintain a liquidity pool (LP) of two or more assets constrained to maintain at all times a mathematical relation to each other, defined by a given function or curve. Examples of such functions are the constant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from several challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of tokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially drain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price changes can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets and reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to constructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input from a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the assets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be identical to the market price.
