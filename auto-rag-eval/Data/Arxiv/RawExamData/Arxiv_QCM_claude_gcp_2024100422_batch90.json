Dynamic models of biochemical networks typically consist of sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations involving states (concentrations or amounts of the components of the network) and parameters describing the reaction kinetics.

In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models are universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In this work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of identifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of examples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness inherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data or noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and iv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design?

Attempts to allocate capital across a selection of different investments are often hampered by the fact that investors' decisions are made under limited information (no historical return data) and during an extremely limited timeframe. Nevertheless, in some cases, rational investors with a certain level of experience are able to ordinally rank investment alternatives through relative assessments of the probabilities that investments will be successful. However, to apply traditional portfolio optimization models, analysts must use historical (or simulated/expected) return data as the basis for their calculations. This paper develops an alternative portfolio optimization framework that is able to handle this kind of information (given by an ordinal ranking of investment alternatives) and to calculate an optimal capital allocation based on a Cobb-Douglas function, which we call the Sorted Weighted Portfolio (SWP). Considering risk-neutral investors, we show that the results of this portfolio optimization model usually outperform the output generated by the (intuitive) Equally Weighted Portfolio (EWP) of different investment alternatives, which is the result of optimization when one is unable to incorporate additional data (the ordinal ranking of the alternatives).

The functionality of soft interfaces is crucial to many applications in biology and surface science. Recent studies have used liquid drops to probe the surface mechanics of elastomeric networks. Experiments suggest an intricate surface elasticity, also known as the Shuttleworth effect, where surface tension is not constant but depends on substrate deformation. However, interpretations have remained controversial due to singular elastic deformations, induced exactly at the point where the droplet pulls the network. Here we reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic substrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy. First, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive finite element simulations. This confirms the universal validity, also at large elastic deformations, of the previously disputed Neumann's law for the contact angles. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that describe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement with numerics, and show that the stretch at the contact line, as previously measured experimentally, consistently points to a strong Shuttleworth effect.

Causal decomposition analyses can help build the evidence base for interventions that address health disparities (inequities).

Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This paper addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgements these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets, to reflect equity choices, while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions.

However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the stochastic nature of particles' movement and the sampling noise. In this paper, we adopt a deep-learning method known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify modes of diffusion from given trajectories. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results it follows that CNN is usually slightly better than the feature-based methods, but at the costs of much longer processing times. Moreover, there are still some borderline cases, in which the classical methods perform better than CNN."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of analyzing single-particle tracking data, which of the following statements most accurately describes the comparison between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and classical machine learning techniques?\n\nA) CNNs consistently outperform classical methods in all scenarios, making them the clear choice for diffusion mode classification.\n\nB) Classical methods require feature extraction but are faster to process, while CNNs work with raw data but have longer processing times.\n\nC) CNNs and classical methods perform equally well, with no significant differences in accuracy or processing time.\n\nD) Classical methods always yield better results than CNNs, especially in borderline cases of diffusion mode classification.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key differences and trade-offs between CNN and classical machine learning approaches for classifying diffusion modes in single-particle tracking data. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage states that CNN is \"usually slightly better\" but not consistently superior in all cases.

Training a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for a new domain from scratch requires an enormous amount of training data and days of training time. To this end, we propose DAWSON, a Domain Adaptive FewShot Generation FrameworkFor GANs based on meta-learning. A major challenge of applying meta-learning GANs is to obtain gradients for the generator from evaluating it on development sets due to the likelihood-free nature of GANs. To address this challenge, we propose an alternative GAN training procedure that naturally combines the two-step training procedure of GANs and the two-step training procedure of meta-learning algorithms. DAWSON is a plug-and-play framework that supports a broad family of meta-learning algorithms and various GANs with architectural-variants. Based on DAWSON, We also propose MUSIC MATINEE, which is the first few-shot music generation model. Our experiments show that MUSIC MATINEE could quickly adapt to new domains with only tens of songs from the target domains. We also show that DAWSON can learn to generate new digits with only four samples in the MNIST dataset.

If stars at the lower end of the main sequence are responsible for the microlensing events observed in the Galactic bulge, then light from the lensing star contributes to the observed brightness.

Therefore, microlensing light curves are not perfectly achromatic if hydrogen-burning stars are the lenses. In most cases, the color shift will be too small to be observable, but we argue that given the current microlensing rates, it is plausible that a few color-shifted microlensing events could be observed in the near future, especially if strategies are optimized to search for them.
