Rod-shaped bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, commonly live forming mounded colonies. They initially grow two-dimensionally on a surface and finally achieve three-dimensional growth, which was recently reported to be promoted by +1/2 topological defects in motile populations. In contrast, how cellular alignment plays a role in non-motile cases is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the relevance of topological defects in colony formation processes of non-motile E. coli populations, which is regarded as an active nematic system driven by cellular growth. We show that while only +1/2 topological defects promote the three-dimensional growth in the early stage, cells gradually flow toward -1/2 defects as well, which leads to vertical growth around both defects. To explain our findings, we investigate three-dimensional cell orientations by confocal microscopy. We find that cells are strongly verticalized around defects and exhibit polar order characterized by asymmetric tilting of cells. We finally construct an active nematic theory by taking into account the three-dimensional orientation, and successfully explain the influx toward -1/2 defects.

The documentation states that \"while only +1/2 topological defects promote the three-dimensional growth in the early stage, cells gradually flow toward -1/2 defects as well, which leads to vertical growth around both defects.\" This indicates a dynamic process where the role of -1/2 defects in promoting 3D growth emerges over time, which was an unexpected finding compared to previous understanding of topological defects in bacterial colony formation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it states that only -1/2 defects promoted 3D growth, which contradicts the information provided.

For a single hadron bunch in a circular accelerator at zero chromaticity, without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability, or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional {\\it absolute} meaning of the word.

The paper challenges the conventional understanding that strong space charge always increases beam stability. While it's true that SC suppresses the mode-coupling instability (TMCI) and the instability threshold increases linearly with SC tune shift (as mentioned in option B), this leads to a paradoxical situation. The paper resolves this paradox by introducing the concept that SC, while suppressing TMCI, also introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications. These amplifications can make the beam less stable than it would be without SC, even when all the coherent tunes are real (i.e., when all modes appear stable in the conventional sense).

Anti-patterns and code-smells are signs in the source code which are not defects (does not prevent the program from functioning and does not cause compile errors) and are rather indicators of deeper and bigger problems. Exception handling is a programming construct de- signed to handle the occurrence of anomalous or exceptional conditions (that changes the normal flow of program execution). In this paper, we present an Eclipse plug-in (called as Parichayana) for detecting exception handling anti-patterns and code smells in Java programs. Parichayana is capable of automatically detecting several commonly occurring excep- tion handling programming mistakes. We extend the Eclipse IDE and create new menu entries and associated action via the Parichayana plug- in (free and open-source hosted on GitHub). We compare and contrast Parichayana with several code smell detection tools and demonstrate that our tool provides unique capabilities in context to existing tools. We have created an update site and developers can use the Eclipse up- date manager to install Parichayana from our site.

Estimation of the covariance matrix of asset returns from high frequency data is complicated by asynchronous returns, market mi- crostructure noise and jumps. One technique for addressing both asynchronous returns and market microstructure is the Kalman-EM (KEM) algorithm. However the KEM approach assumes log-normal prices and does not address jumps in the return process which can corrupt estimation of the covariance matrix. In this paper we extend the KEM algorithm to price models that include jumps. We propose two sparse Kalman filtering approaches to this problem. In the first approach we develop a Kalman Expectation Conditional Maximization (KECM) algorithm to determine the un- known covariance as well as detecting the jumps. For this algorithm we consider Laplace and the spike and slab jump models, both of which promote sparse estimates of the jumps. In the second method we take a Bayesian approach and use Gibbs sampling to sample from the posterior distribution of the covariance matrix under the spike and slab jump model. Numerical results using simulated data show that each of these approaches provide for improved covariance estima- tion relative to the KEM method in a variety of settings where jumps occur."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary advantage of the proposed sparse Kalman filtering approaches over the traditional Kalman-EM (KEM) algorithm in estimating covariance matrices from high-frequency financial data?\n\nA) They can handle asynchronous returns more effectively than KEM.\nB) They are computationally less expensive than the KEM algorithm.\nC) They can account for jumps in the return process, which KEM assumes absent.\nD) They eliminate the need for addressing market microstructure noise.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key advantage of the proposed sparse Kalman filtering approaches is their ability to account for jumps in the return process, which the traditional KEM algorithm does not address.

Influencing (and being influenced by) others through social networks is fundamental to all human societies.

Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes.
