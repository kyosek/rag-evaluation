Matrix factorization is a key component of collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems because it allows us to complete sparse user-by-item ratings matrices under a low-rank assumption that encodes the belief that similar users give similar ratings and that similar items garner similar ratings. This paradigm has had immeasurable practical success, but it is not the complete story for understanding and inferring the preferences of people. First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social connections. In this paper, we develop a unified process model for both types of dynamics within a state space approach, together with an efficient optimization scheme for estimation within that model. The model combines elements from recent developments in dynamic matrix factorization, opinion dynamics and social learning, and trust-based recommendation.

Surface roughness is primary measure of pavement performance that has been associated with ride quality and vehicle operating costs.

However, it is costly to measure IRI, and for this reason, certain road classes are excluded from IRI measurements at a network level. Higher levels of distresses are generally associated with higher roughness. However, for a given roughness level, pavement data typically exhibits a great deal of variability in the distress types, density, and severity.

It is shown that mass depends on velocity as in Special Relativity, and that the velocity is constant for a particular characteristic value.

One of the exciting recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the development of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that can autonomously handle conversion between different cryptocurrencies.

In this work, we investigate the role of multivalued fields in the formulation of monopole operators and their connection with topological states of matter. In quantum field theory it is known that certain states describe collective modes of the fundamental fields and are created by operators that are often non-local, being defined over lines or higher-dimensional surfaces. For this reason, they may be sensitive to global, topological, properties of the system and depend on nonperturbative data. Such operators are generally known as monopole operators. Sometimes they act as disorder operators because their nonzero expectation values define a disordered vacuum associated with a condensate of the collective modes, also known as defects. In this work we investigate the definition of these operators and their relation to the multivalued properties of the fundamental fields. We study several examples of scalar field theories and generalize the discussion to $p$-forms, with the main purpose of studying new field configurations that may be related to topological states of matter.
