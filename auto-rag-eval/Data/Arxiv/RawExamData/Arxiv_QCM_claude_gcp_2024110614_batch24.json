We find that informed traders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges, traders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak signals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on price discovery.

For this purpose, we introduce several anomaly detection measures: Spatial, Shape and Area anomaly, that successfully detect the most anomalous objects based on their objective, given that the impurities were already labeled. The first two measures quantify the degree of anomaly of each object by how each object is distant and big compared to its neighborhood, and by the abnormally of its own shape respectively.

This practice thus incentivizes researchers to select covariates which maximize treatment effect statistical significance rather than precision.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The mass hierarchy of radiative energy loss depends solely on properties of the projectile, while the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss significantly depends on properties of the medium.\n\n2. The capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic projectile is an independent signature that may differ for different media at the same density.\n\n3. By varying medium properties, the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be modified considerably and even inverted compared to radiative energy loss.\n\nOption C is correct because an inversion of the mass hierarchy in collisional energy loss suggests that the medium has unique properties that enhance its ability to absorb recoil from heavier projectiles.

The mechanism of atrial fibrillation (AF) is poorly understood, resulting in disappointing success rates of ablative treatment. Different mechanisms defined largely by different atrial activation patterns have been proposed and, arguably, this dispute has slowed the progress of AF research. Recent clinical evidence suggests a unifying mechanism based on sustained re-entrant circuits in the complex atrial architecture. Here, we present a simple computational model showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a theoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation. We show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct consequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells through which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface. The model naturally follows the clinical spectrum of AF spanning sinus rhythm, paroxysmal and persistent AF as the decoupling of myocardial cells results in the lattice approaching the percolation threshold. This allows the model to make additional predictions beyond the current clinical understanding, showing that for paroxysmal AF re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium, but in persistent AF they emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall where endocardial ablation is less effective.

For paroxysmal AF, the model predicts that re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium (inner surface of the heart). In contrast, for persistent AF, these circuits are predicted to emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall.\n\nThis depth difference has significant implications for the efficacy of endocardial ablation, which targets the inner surface of the heart. Since the re-entrant circuits in persistent AF are located deeper in the atrial wall, they are less accessible to endocardial ablation. This explains why the model predicts that endocardial ablation would be less effective in persistent AF compared to paroxysmal AF, where the circuits are closer to the surface.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the difference between paroxysmal and persistent AF, the location of re-entrant circuits, and the implications for treatment.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. Tensor product interactions are suitable for modeling interactions between multiple continuous predictors (in this case, F1, F2, and time).

But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis.

Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for {\\em de novo} assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for {\\em de novo} assembly of metagenomes. On one soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A bioinformatician is working on assembling a complex soil metagenome with limited computational resources.

Such events are seen as cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other galaxies when their beamed radiation happens to point towards Earth. This source of CRs is located in the Galactic halo. It therefore explains the absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff in the spectrum of the ultra-high energy CRs. The position in energy of the ``ankle'' in the CR energy spectrum is shown to arise in a natural way.

Which of the following explanations best accounts for these discrepancies and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the galaxy's properties?\n\nA) The discrepancy is primarily due to the difference between rest-frame optical and UV observations, with UV continuum luminosity overestimating the SFR due to the presence of an older stellar population.\n\nB) The variation in SFR measurements is likely caused by the strong gravitational lensing effect, which amplifies certain regions of the galaxy more than others, leading to inconsistent results across different observational methods.\n\nC) The differences in SFR estimates can be attributed to the combined effects of dust extinction, metallicity variations, and potential contributions from an older stellar population, highlighting the complexity of accurately measuring SFR in high-redshift galaxies.\n\nD) The discrepancy is mainly a result of instrumental limitations in measuring emission lines at different wavelengths, with near-IR spectroscopy providing the most accurate SFR estimate due to its ability to detect Balmer lines directly.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the ability to analyze complex astrophysical data.

Dust extinction: The documentation mentions an extinction of E(B-V)=0.27, which affects the observed luminosity and thus the SFR estimates.\n\n2.

Since the duration of the heavy-mode oscillations is finite, the effect of the resonance is localized in momentum space. In this paper, we show that the bispectrum is amplified when such a resonance occurs, and that the peak amplitude of the feature can be O(10^{1-2}), or as large as O(10^5) depending on the type of interactions. In particular, the resonance can give large contributions in finitely squeezed configurations, while the bispectrum cannot be large in the exact squeezed limit.

By semi-parametrically combining incomplete observed data from three different sources, namely, the Monthly Longitudinal Labour Force Survey, the Survey of Income and Housing and the administrative payroll data, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 and the associated policy responses on the Australian income distribution between February and June 2020, covering the immediate periods before and after the initial outbreak. Our results suggest that despite the growth in unemployment, the Gini of the equalised disposable income inequality dropped by nearly 0.03 point since February.

Additionally, the poverty rate, which could have been doubled in the absence of the government response, also reduced by 3 to 4 percentage points.
