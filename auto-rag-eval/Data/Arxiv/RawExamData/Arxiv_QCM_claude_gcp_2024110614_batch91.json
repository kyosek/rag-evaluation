An absent factor of a string $w$ is a string $u$ which does not occur as a contiguous substring (a.k.a. factor) inside $w$.

Of particular interest to us are minimal absent subsequences, i.e., absent subsequences whose every subsequence is not absent, and shortest absent subsequences, i.e., absent subsequences of minimal length. We show a series of combinatorial and algorithmic results regarding these two notions. For instance: we give combinatorial characterisations of the sets of minimal and, respectively, shortest absent subsequences in a word, as well as compact representations of these sets; we show how we can test efficiently if a string is a shortest or minimal absent subsequence in a word, and we give efficient algorithms computing the lexicographically smallest absent subsequence of each kind; also, we show how a data structure for answering shortest absent subsequence-queries for the factors of a given string can be efficiently computed."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about absent subsequences in words, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A bioinformatics researcher is developing an algorithm to identify unique genetic markers in a population.

The discovery of dark matter (DM) at XENONnT or LZ would place constraints on DM particle mass and coupling constants.

We address this question within the most general set of renormalisable models that preserve Lorentz and gauge symmetry, and that extend the Standard Model by one DM candidate of mass $m_{\\rm DM}$ and one particle of mass $M_{med}$ mediating DM-quark interactions.

Such switching chimeras consist of two symmetric configurations, which we refer to as subchimeras, in which one cluster is synchronized and the other is incoherent. Despite each subchimera being linearly stable, switching chimeras are extremely sensitive to noise: arbitrarily small noise triggers and sustains persistent switching between the two symmetric subchimeras.

The documentation states that both revenue sharing and linear two-part tariff contracts coordinate the decentralized airport-airline channel, which is generally more efficient than a non-coordinated approach.\n\n2.

This method aligns with the grey-box identification approach described in the documentation and offers several advantages:\n\n1. It addresses the limitation of narrow-range data by exploiting the known static behavior of the buck converter as a priori knowledge.\n2.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur if the platform implements a more stringent content moderation policy?\n\nA) The platform will definitely increase its revenue due to a larger user base attracted by the moderated content.\nB) The platform may lose extreme content creators but gain moderate users, potentially affecting ad revenue in complex ways.\nC) The platform will need to switch to a subscription model to compensate for the loss of engagement from extreme content.\nD) The platform's technology sophistication will automatically improve, leading to more accurate content moderation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer, B, reflects the complex interplay between content moderation, user base, and revenue in an advertising-based model.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a more stringent moderation policy might attract more users, the impact on revenue is not guaranteed to be positive. The documentation suggests that the relationship between moderation and platform success is nuanced.\n\nOption B is correct because it captures the trade-off described in the paper. A stricter moderation policy may indeed drive away users who prefer extreme content, while attracting those who prefer a more moderate environment. This shift in user base composition can have complex effects on ad revenue, as different user groups may have different values for advertisers.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation does not suggest that stricter moderation necessitates a switch to a subscription model. In fact, the paper indicates that advertising and subscription models have different optimal moderation strategies.\n\nOption D is incorrect because technological sophistication is presented as an independent factor affecting moderation effectiveness, not an automatic result of policy changes.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (revenue models, user base composition, content moderation strategies) and apply them to a realistic scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere recall of facts."}, "84": {"documentation": {"title": "Large Language Models Can Be Strong Differentially Private Learners", "source": "Xuechen Li, Florian Tram\\`er, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto", "docs_id": "2110.05679", "section": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Large Language Models Can Be Strong Differentially Private Learners.

Here we address this problem using a microscopic multiscale model, which couples physically realistic molecular descriptions of proteins and their interactions with population genetics of carrier organisms without assuming any a priori fitness landscape. We found that both pleiotropy and second order selection play a crucial role at different stages of adaptation: the supply of mutators is provided through destabilization of error correction complexes or fluctuations of production levels of prototypic mismatch repair proteins (pleiotropic effects), while rise and fixation of mutators occur when there is a sufficient supply of beneficial mutations in replication-controlling genes.
