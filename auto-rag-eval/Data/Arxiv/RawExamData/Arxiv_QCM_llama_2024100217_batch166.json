To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the phase-problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom derivative crystals and concomitantly the determination of the heavy atom substructure. This is customarily done by direct methods or Patterson-based approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative crystals are available, as often the case for e.g. membrane proteins. Here we present an approach for heavy atom site identification based on a Molecular Replacement Parameter Matrix (MRPM) search. It involves an n-dimensional search to test a wide spectrum of molecular replacement parameters, such as clusters of different conformations. The result is scored by the ability to identify heavy-atom positions, from anomalous difference Fourier maps, that allow meaningful phases to be determined. The strategy was successfully applied in the determination of a membrane protein structure, the CopA Cu+-ATPase, when other methods had failed to resolve the heavy atom substructure.

DNA strand displacement is a key reaction in DNA homologous recombination and DNA mismatch repair and is also heavily utilized in DNA-based computation and locomotion.

Here, we measured toehold-mediated strand displacement kinetics using single-molecule fluorescence in the presence of a single base pair mismatch. The apparent displacement rate varied significantly when the mismatch was introduced in the invading DNA strand. The rate generally decreased as the mismatch in the invader was encountered earlier in displacement. Our data indicate that a single base pair mismatch in the invader stalls branch migration, and displacement occurs via direct dissociation of the destabilized incumbent strand from the substrate strand. We combined both branch migration and direct dissociation into a model, which we term, the concurrent displacement model, and used the first passage time approach to quantitatively explain the salient features of the observed relationship.

Our framework consists of a standard repeated sequential Prisoner's Dilemma, where the second mover can observe the choices made by first movers either exogenously or endogenously. We show that mutual cooperation occurs significantly more frequently when monitoring is made transparent. Additionally, our results highlight the key role of conditional cooperators (who are more likely to monitor) in promoting teamwork. Overall, the observed cooperation enhancing effects are due to monitoring actions that carry information about first movers who use it to better screen the type of their co-player and thereby reduce the risk of being exploited."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nShould transparency be (in-)transparent?

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a sudden need for a wider uptake of home-based telework as means of sustaining the production. Generally, teleworking arrangements impacts directly worker's efficiency and motivation. The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance between positive effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and autonomy) and its downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work life). Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of workers, such as women. The first step in understanding the implications of teleworking on women is to have timely information on the extent of teleworking by age and gender.

An ion beam can destabilize Alfv\\'en/ion-cyclotron waves and magnetosonic/whistler waves if the beam speed is sufficiently large. Numerical solutions of the hot-plasma dispersion relation have previously shown that the minimum beam speed required to excite such instabilities is significantly smaller for oblique modes with $\\vec k \\times \\vec B_0\\neq 0$ than for parallel-propagating modes with $\\vec k \\times \\vec B_0 = 0$, where $\\vec k$ is the wavevector and $\\vec B_0$ is the background magnetic field.

We begin by deriving, in the cold-plasma approximation, the dispersion relation and polarization properties of both oblique and parallel-propagating waves in the presence of an ion beam. We then show how the instability thresholds of the different wave branches can be deduced from the wave--particle resonance condition, the conservation of particle energy in the wave frame, the sign (positive or negative) of the wave energy, and the wave polarization. We also provide a graphical description of the different conditions under which Landau resonance and cyclotron resonance destabilize Alfv\\'en/ion-cyclotron waves in the presence of an ion beam.

This is because the oblique modes have a more favorable resonance condition, allowing them to be excited at lower beam speeds."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Deep Autotuner: a Pitch Correcting Network for Singing Performances", "source": "Sanna Wager, George Tzanetakis, Cheng-i Wang, Minje Kim", "docs_id": "2002.05511", "section": ["cs.SD", "cs.LG", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Deep Autotuner: a Pitch Correcting Network for Singing Performances. We introduce a data-driven approach to automatic pitch correction of solo singing performances. The proposed approach predicts note-wise pitch shifts from the relationship between the respective spectrograms of the singing and accompaniment. This approach differs from commercial systems, where vocal track notes are usually shifted to be centered around pitches in a user-defined score, or mapped to the closest pitch among the twelve equal-tempered scale degrees. The proposed system treats pitch as a continuous value rather than relying on a set of discretized notes found in musical scores, thus allowing for improvisation and harmonization in the singing performance. We train our neural network model using a dataset of 4,702 amateur karaoke performances selected for good intonation. Our model is trained on both incorrect intonation, for which it learns a correction, and intentional pitch variation, which it learns to preserve.

This allows for improvisation and harmonization in singing performances, which is a key advantage of the proposed system.

Dark energy must cluster in order to be consistent with the equivalence principle. The background evolution can be effectively modelled by either a scalar field or by a barotropic fluid.The fluid model can be used to emulate perturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks down at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy perturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and freezing models.The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes.In freezing models, the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times.For thawing models, the dark energy equation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times and begins to deviate from it only at late times.Since the dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes,the dark energy perturbations too evolve differently. In freezing models, since the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant difference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological constant model.In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ from the cosmological constant only at late times.
