The primary expectation from positioning systems is for them to provide the users with reliable estimates of their position. An additional piece of information that can greatly help the users utilize position estimates is the level of uncertainty that a positioning system assigns to the position estimate it produced. The concept of dynamically estimating the accuracy of position estimates of fingerprinting positioning systems has been sporadically discussed over the last decade in the literature of the field, where mainly handcrafted rules based on domain knowledge have been proposed. The emergence of IoT devices and the proliferation of data from Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have facilitated the conceptualization of data-driven methods of determining the estimated certainty over position estimates. In this work, we analyze the data-driven approach of determining the Dynamic Accuracy Estimation (DAE), considering it in the broader context of a positioning system. More specifically, with the use of a public LoRaWAN dataset, the current work analyses: the repartition of the available training set between the tasks of determining the location estimates and the DAE, the concept of selecting a subset of the most reliable estimates, and the impact that the spatial distribution of the data has to the accuracy of the DAE.

In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning-based collaborative estimation to fuse local road estimation from a fleet of connected heterogeneous vehicles. The collaborative estimation scheme exploits the sequential measurements made by multiple vehicles traversing the same road segment and let these vehicles relay a learning signal to iteratively refine local estimations. Given that the privacy of individual vehicles' identity must be protected in collaborative estimation, we directly incorporate privacy-protection design into the collaborative estimation design and establish a unified framework for privacy-preserving collaborative estimation. Different from patching conventional privacy mechanisms like differential privacy which will compromise algorithmic accuracy or homomorphic encryption which will incur heavy communication/computational overhead, we leverage the dynamical properties of collective estimation to enable inherent privacy protection without sacrificing accuracy or significantly increasing communication/computation overhead.

Multi-view time series classification (MVTSC) aims to improve the performance by fusing the distinctive temporal information from multiple views. Existing methods mainly focus on fusing multi-view information at an early stage, e.g., by learning a common feature subspace among multiple views. However, these early fusion methods may not fully exploit the unique temporal patterns of each view in complicated time series. Moreover, the label correlations of multiple views, which are critical to boost-ing, are usually under-explored for the MVTSC problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Correlative Channel-Aware Fusion (C2AF) network. First, C2AF extracts comprehensive and robust temporal patterns by a two-stream structured encoder for each view, and captures the intra-view and inter-view label correlations with a graph-based correlation matrix. Second, a channel-aware learnable fusion mechanism is implemented through convolutional neural networks to further explore the global correlative patterns. These two steps are trained end-to-end in the proposed C2AF network.
