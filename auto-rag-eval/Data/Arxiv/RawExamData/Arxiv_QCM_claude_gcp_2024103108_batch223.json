Recently, several studies have investigated the transcription process associated to specific genetic regulatory networks. In this work, we present a stochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics and effect of negative feedback loops (FBL) on the transcriptional noise. First, our analysis allows us to identify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression coupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the transcriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described earlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of regulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is computed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be independent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally observed values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is significantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong coupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in FBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the repression level D is very strong."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a negative feedback loop (FBL) with strong self-repression coupling (D>>1), which of the following statements is NOT true according to the stochastic analysis described?\n\nA) The variance of transcriptional noise is reduced by approximately 28% more than previously reported.\n\nB) The coefficient of variation becomes independent of all parameters in the strong coupling region.\n\nC) The regulating protein is significantly suppressed by intrinsic and external noise.\n\nD) A basal amount of proteins can be produced even with very strong repression levels due to inherent noise in the FBL.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is true according to the passage, which states that \"the variance of the transcriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described earlier\" in the strong coupling region.\n\nOption B is correct as the passage mentions that \"In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be independent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally observed values.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect and thus the correct answer to our question.

This tool is particularly useful for evaluating the demand response potential and system reliability.

As a result, communication sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the accuracy of the average belief in a group.

By applying displacement fields reliably estimated by tracing high quality fingerprint videos to challenging fingerprints, we synthesize a large number of training fingerprint pairs with ground truth displacement fields. In addition, based on the proposed registration algorithm, we propose a fingerprint mosaicking method based on optimal seam selection. Registration and matching experiments on FVC2004 databases, Tsinghua Distorted Fingerprint (TDF) database, and NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database show that our registration method outperforms previous dense registration methods in accuracy and efficiency.

The key innovation described in the text is the use of an end-to-end network that directly outputs pixel-wise displacement fields between two fingerprints.
