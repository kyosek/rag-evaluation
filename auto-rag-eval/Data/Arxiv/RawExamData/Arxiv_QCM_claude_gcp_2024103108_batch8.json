In this work, we study the thermo-mechanical behavior of metallic structures designed to significantly change shape in response to thermal stimuli. This behavior is achieved by arranging two metals with different coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Aluminum and Titanium, as to create displacement-amplifying units that can expand uniaxially. In particular, our design comprises a low-CTE bar surrounded by a high-CTE frame that features flexure hinges and thicker links. When the temperature increases, the longitudinal expansion of the high-CTE portion is geometrically constrained by the low-CTE bar, resulting in a large tangential displacement. Our design is guided by theoretical models and numerical simulations. We validate our approach by fabricating and characterizing individual units, one dimensional arrays and three-dimensional structures.

The primary mechanism allowing for significant shape change in this bi-metallic structure is the geometrical constraint of the high-CTE frame's expansion by the low-CTE bar. When the temperature increases, the high-CTE frame (made of Aluminum) wants to expand more than the low-CTE bar (made of Titanium). However, the low-CTE bar constrains this expansion longitudinally, forcing the structure to deform tangentially, resulting in a large displacement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the design relies on two metals with different coefficients of thermal expansion, not identical ones.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the low-CTE bar does not contract when heated; it expands less than the high-CTE frame.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because if both metals expanded uniformly in all directions, there would be no differential expansion to cause shape change.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the fundamental principle behind the bi-metallic structure's shape-morphing behavior, requiring students to synthesize information about material properties, structural design, and thermal expansion effects."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Theoretical and numerical considerations of the assumptions behind\n  triple closures in epidemic models on networks", "source": "Nicos Georgiou, Istv\\'An Z.

The documentation states that \"for some ratios between a and b, quite unusual and at first ostensibly counterintuitive policies may appear.\" This is in contrast to unconstrained models or those with no shortselling. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the surplus level itself doesn't determine the counterintuitive nature of the optimal policy. \n\nOption B is not mentioned in the text and would generally lead to straightforward investment decisions rather than counterintuitive ones. \n\nOption D is also not discussed in the given information and the trend of the Cramer-Lundberg process is not indicated as a factor in determining the nature of the optimal policy.\n\nThe key point is that the interrelation between the model parameters, specifically the ratio between the purchasing constraint (a) and the shortselling constraint (b), can lead to unexpected optimal strategies.

By endogeneous, we envision either fluctuations resulting from an underlying chaotic dynamics or from a stochastic forcing origin which may be external or be an effective coarse-grained description of the microscopic fluctuations. In this scenario, endogeneous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves.

A seemingly paradoxical signature of human impact appears as an increase in the widths of the vegetation bands, which effectively increases the extent of vegetation cover in many areas.
