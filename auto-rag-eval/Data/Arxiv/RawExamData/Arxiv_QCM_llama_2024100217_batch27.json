Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is an important phenomenon observed in various fields including physics and biology. In this connection, we here show that the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings can induce spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators. With a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we demonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase synchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in inducing out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) oscillations compete with each other and give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states and interesting multistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and anti-synchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death (OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter (${\\lambda}$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system, the attractive coupling favours the emergence of an anti-symmetric OD state via a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favours the emergence of a similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation. We show that an increase in the repulsive coupling not only destabilizes the IPS state but also facilitates the re-entrance of the IPS state."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings, what type of bifurcation is favored by an increase in the repulsive coupling when the Hopf bifurcation parameter ($\\lambda$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system?\n\n**A)** Hopf bifurcation\n**B)** Saddle-node bifurcation\n**C)** Pitchfork bifurcation\n**D)** Neimark-Sacker bifurcation\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) Saddle-node bifurcation\n\n**Explanation:** According to the provided documentation, when the Hopf bifurcation parameter ($\\lambda$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system, the attractive coupling favors the emergence of an anti-symmetric oscillation death (OD) state via a Hopf bifurcation.

In this work, we start by formally characterizing under which circumstances a predictive model may benefit from algorithmic triage.

Particularly, dam management requires a 6-h lead time of the dam inflow forecast based on a future hydrograph. The authors propose novel target inflow weights to create an ocean feature vector extracted from the analyzed images of the sea surface. We extracted 4,096 elements of the dimension vector in the fc6 layer of the pre-trained VGG16 network. Subsequently, we reduced it to three dimensions of t-SNE. Furthermore, we created the principal component of the sea temperature weights using PCA. We found that these weights contribute to the stability of predictor importance by numerical experiments. As base regression models, we calibrate the least squares with kernel expansion, the quantile random forest minimized out-of bag error, and the support vector regression with a polynomial kernel. When we compute the predictor importance, we visualize the stability of each variable importance introduced by our proposed weights, compared with other results without weights. We apply our method to a dam at Kanto region in Japan and focus on the trained term from 2007 to 2018, with a limited flood term from June to October. We test the accuracy over the 2019 flood term.

Most state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) approaches for speaker recognition work on a short utterance level.

In this work we propose the use of an attention mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non fixed length speech utterances. Our system is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encodes short-term speaker features from the spectrogram and a self multi-head attention model that maps these representations into a long-term speaker embedding. The attention model that we propose produces multiple alignments from different subsegments of the CNN encoded states over the sequence. Hence this mechanism works as a pooling layer which decides the most discriminative features over the sequence to obtain an utterance level representation.

A possible connection between the accelerating periods remains unknown, and, even more intriguing, the best dark energy candidate powering the present accelerating stage (Lambda-vacuum) is plagued with the cosmological constant and coincidence puzzles.
