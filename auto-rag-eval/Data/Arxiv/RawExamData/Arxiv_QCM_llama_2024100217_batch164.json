We use wavelet transform modulus maxima method for the singularity spectrum computations. It is shown that the degree of multifractality defined as a width of singularity spectrum can be successfully used as a measure of complexity both in the case of periodic and aperiodic (stochastic or chaotic) input signals. We show that in the case of periodic driving force singularity spectrum can change its structure qualitatively becoming monofractal in the regime of stochastic synchronization. This fact allows us to consider the degree of multifractality as a new measure of stochastic synchronization also.

Neither alone is sufficient since they are each biased towards a subset of entities. Absolute gain favors large entities, while relative gain favors small ones.

Is there any general functional relation that provides long-term stability despite the wide diversity of the fluctuations commence: emotions, economics, physical interactions etc?

The present contribution is a systematic study written as a book on the relation between long-term stability and exerting macroscopic fluctuations.
