Associated with this learning format is the question: what do people think about the educational value of an online course compared to a course taken in-person in a classroom? This paper addresses the question and presents a Bayesian quantile analysis of public opinion using a nationally representative survey data from the United States. Our findings show that previous participation in online courses and full-time employment status favor the educational value of online courses.

On a central focus, there have been longstanding interests on the mechanism governing data missingness, and correctly deciding the appropriate mechanism is crucially relevant for conducting proper practical investigations. The conventional notions include the three common potential classes -- missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. In this paper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between missing at random and missing not at random. Since the potential alternatives of missing at random are broad, we focus our investigation on a general class of models with instrumental variables for data missing not at random. Our setting is broadly applicable, thanks to that the model concerning the missing data is nonparametric, requiring no explicit model specification for the data missingness. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy measures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when missing at random does not hold. We show that our new hypothesis testing approach achieves an objective data oriented choice between missing at random or not. We demonstrate the feasibility, validity, and efficacy of the new test by theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and a real data analysis."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of missing data mechanisms, which of the following statements best describes the approach presented in the paper for distinguishing between Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Not at Random (MNAR)?\n\nA) It uses a fully parametric model to specify the missing data mechanism and compares likelihood ratios.\n\nB) It employs a semiparametric testing approach using instrumental variables and nonparametric modeling of data missingness.\n\nC) It relies solely on multiple imputation techniques to determine if data is MAR or MNAR.\n\nD) It uses machine learning algorithms to classify missing data patterns into MAR or MNAR categories.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The paper presents a semiparametric testing approach that uses instrumental variables for data Missing Not at Random (MNAR).

Both effects are challenging as competitive markets are complex and computations of optimized pricing adjustments can be time-consuming. We analyze stochastic dynamic pricing models under oligopoly competition for the sale of perishable goods. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a heuristic approach to efficiently compute price adjustments. To demonstrate our strategy's applicability even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies are unknown, we consider different competitive settings in which competitors frequently and strategically adjust their prices. For all settings, we verify that our heuristic strategy yields promising results. We compare the performance of our heuristic against upper bounds, which are obtained by optimal strategies that take advantage of perfect price anticipations. We find that price adjustment frequencies can have a larger impact on expected profits than price anticipations. Finally, our approach has been applied on Amazon for the sale of used books.

Much work in AI deals with the selection of proper actions in a given (known or unknown) environment. However, the way to select a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear. Most work in AI adopts classical game-theoretic equilibrium analysis to predict agent behavior in such settings. This approach however does not provide us with any guarantee for the agent. In this paper we introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap between the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium analysis.

This is the first systematic investigation of a large sample of type I X-ray bursts from Aql X-1 with improved sensitivity at low energies. We detect 22 X-ray bursts including two short recurrence burst events in which the separation was only 451 s and 496 s. We perform time resolved spectroscopy of the bursts using the fixed and scaled background (f_a method) approaches. We show that the use of a scaling factor to the pre-burst emission is the statistically preferred model in about 68% of all the spectra compared to the fixed background approach. Typically the f_a values are clustered around 1-3, but can reach up to 11 in a burst where photospheric radius expansion is observed. Such f_a values indicate a very significant increase in the pre-burst emission especially at around the peak flux moments of the bursts. We show that the use of the f_a factor alters the best fit spectral parameters of the burst emission. Finally, we employed a reflection model instead of scaling the pre-burst emission.

Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) [1] and its variants have been used widely to identify non-random patterns in biomedical signals obtained across distinct physiological states. Non-random signatures of the complexity measure can occur under nonlinear deterministic as well as non-deterministic settings. Surrogate data testing have also been encouraged in the past in conjunction with complexity estimates to make a finer distinction between various classes of processes. In this brief letter, we make two important observations (1) Non-Gaussian noise at the dynamical level can elude existing surrogate algorithms namely: Phase-randomized surrogates (FT) amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (AAFT) and iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT). Thus any inference nonlinear determinism as an explanation for the non-randomness is incomplete (2) Decrease in complexity can be observed even across two linear processes with identical auto-correlation functions. The results are illustrated with a second-order auto-regressive process with Gaussian and non-Gaussian innovations.

Researchers often face data fusion problems, where multiple data sources are available, each capturing a distinct subset of variables. While problem formulations typically take the data as given, in practice, data acquisition can be an ongoing process. In this paper, we aim to estimate any functional of a probabilistic model (e.g., a causal effect) as efficiently as possible, by deciding, at each time, which data source to query. We propose online moment selection (OMS), a framework in which structural assumptions are encoded as moment conditions. The optimal action at each step depends, in part, on the very moments that identify the functional of interest. Our algorithms balance exploration with choosing the best action as suggested by current estimates of the moments. We propose two selection strategies: (1) explore-then-commit (OMS-ETC) and (2) explore-then-greedy (OMS-ETG), proving that both achieve zero asymptotic regret as assessed by MSE.

The findings indicates that the age is not the only factor influencing the pedestrian dynamics but the heterogeneity of the crowd composition and the familiarity among neighboring pedestrians also have significant effects. The existence of three regimes in the relationship between headway and speed is confirmed. In the strong constrained regime, the slope of the relationship between headway and speed of the elderly is bigger than that of the young, which means that the elders are more sensitive to the spatial headway than the young when adapting the speeds. However, the difference of the slopes in the weakly constrained regime is small, which indicates a weak dependency between age and the adaption time. The elderly need longer headway during the transformation of the motion state.

The current research pursues to understand the underlying mechanisms of such coexistence. Applying network dynamics and information theory, we discover that a certain amount of information, determined by the selectivity of networks to the input information, frequently survives from random distortion. Other information will inevitably experience distortion or dissipation, whose speeds are shaped by the diversity of information selectivity in networks. The discovered laws exist irrespective of noise, but the noise accounts for their intensification.
