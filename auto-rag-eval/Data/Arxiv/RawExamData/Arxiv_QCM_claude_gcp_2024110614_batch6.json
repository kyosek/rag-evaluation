Since the introduction of zero-determinant strategies, extortionate strategies have received considerable interest. While an interesting class of strategies, the definitions of extortionate strategies are algebraically rigid, apply only to memory-one strategies, and require complete knowledge of a strategy (memory-one cooperation probabilities). We describe a method to detect extortionate behaviour from the history of play of a strategy. When applied to a corpus of 204 strategies this method detects extortionate behaviour in well-known extortionate strategies as well others that do not fit the algebraic definition. The highest performing strategies in this corpus are able to exhibit selectively extortionate behavior, cooperating with strong strategies while exploiting weaker strategies, which no memory-one strategy can do. These strategies emerged from an evolutionary selection process and their existence contradicts widely-repeated folklore in the evolutionary game theory literature: complex strategies can be extraordinarily effective, zero-determinant strategies can be outperformed by non-zero determinant strategies, and longer memory strategies are able to outperform short memory strategies. Moreover, while resistance to extortion is critical for the evolution of cooperation, the extortion of weak opponents need not prevent cooperation between stronger opponents, and this adaptability may be crucial to maintaining cooperation in the long run."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about extortionate strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a complex evolutionary game theory simulation involving the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, a strategy emerges that cooperates with strong opponents but exploits weaker ones.

The rotational dynamics and shape evolution of fibers in shear depends upon the slenderness of the fiber and the non-dimensional \"elasto-viscous\" number that measures the ratio of the fluid's viscous forces to the fiber's elastic forces. For a small elasto-viscous number, the nearly-rigid fiber rotates in the shear, but when the elasto-viscous number reaches a threshhold, buckling occurs.

Negative Biased Temperature Instability (NBTI)-induced aging is one of the critical reliability threats in nano-scale devices. This paper makes the first attempt to study the NBTI aging in the on-chip weight memories of deep neural network (DNN) hardware accelerators, subjected to complex DNN workloads. We propose DNN-Life, a specialized aging analysis and mitigation framework for DNNs, which jointly exploits hardware- and software-level knowledge to improve the lifetime of a DNN weight memory with reduced energy overhead. At the software-level, we analyze the effects of different DNN quantization methods on the distribution of the bits of weight values. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, we propose a micro-architecture that employs low-cost memory-write (and read) transducers to achieve an optimal duty-cycle at run time in the weight memory cells, thereby balancing their aging.

Here's why:\n\n1. It starts by checking reachability under SC semantics, which is faster and simpler than full TSO exploration. This quickly rules out bugs that are SC-reachable.\n\n2. If the bug isn't found under SC, the algorithm then iteratively introduces TSO behaviors where needed.

It is well known that highly volatile control laws, while theoretically optimal for certain systems, are undesirable from an engineering perspective, being generally deleterious to the controlled system. In this article we are concerned with the temporal volatility of the control process of the regulator in discrete time Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQRs). Our investigation in this paper unearths a surprising connection between the cost functional which an LQR is tasked with minimizing and the temporal variations of its control laws. We first show that optimally controlling the system always implies high levels of control volatility, i.e., it is impossible to reduce volatility in the optimal control process without sacrificing cost. We also show that, akin to communication systems, every LQR has a $Capacity~Region$ associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of control volatility.

Recent advances in wireless communication and solid-state circuits together with the enormous demands of sensing ability have given rise to a new enabling technology, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

The method is most effective when there's a clear distinction between normal feature activations and those caused by Trojan triggers.\n\nOption A (subtle changes across multiple features) would likely still produce detectable misattributions, as MISA analyzes the statistical patterns of attributions across features.\n\nOption B (strong activation of a small subset of neurons) would create a clear anomaly in the attribution patterns, making it easily detectable by MISA.\n\nOption D (uniform effect across the entire image) would also likely produce detectable misattributions, as it would affect the overall attribution pattern in a way that differs from normal inputs.\n\nOption C (mimicking natural variations) is the most challenging for MISA to detect. If a trigger pattern is designed to closely resemble natural variations in the input data, it might not produce the kind of anomalous attributions that MISA is looking for.

Exerting fluctuations is a part of our daily life: traffic noise, heartbeat, opinion poll, currency exchange rate, electrical current, chemical reactions - they all permanently fluctuate. One of the most important questions is why the systems that exert fluctuations stay long-term stable. Is there any general functional relation that provides long-term stability despite the wide diversity of the fluctuations commence: emotions, economics, physical interactions etc? I assert that such functional relation does exist and reveal its specification: the route to the long-term stability is through coherence and boundedness as necessary conditions. It is demonstrated that the chaoticity is the hallmark of that relationship. The present contribution is a systematic study written as a book on the relation between long-term stability and exerting macroscopic fluctuations. Further attention is focused on the mechanism that guarantees the boundedness and the coherence of the local fluctuations in the physical systems. Crucial arguments that neither of the existing so far approaches to the behavior of the extended many-body systems provides boundedness and coherence of the fluctuations are put forward.

The use of a GNN and locally-run CNNs results naturally in a decentralized controller.
