Explorable Decoding of Compressed Images. The ever-growing amounts of visual contents captured on a daily basis necessitate the use of lossy compression methods in order to save storage space and transmission bandwidth. While extensive research efforts are devoted to improving compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. Especially at low bit rates, this information often corresponds to semantically meaningful visual cues, so that decompression involves significant ambiguity. In spite of this fact, existing decompression algorithms typically produce only a single output, and do not allow the viewer to explore the set of images that map to the given compressed code. In this work we propose the first image decompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of natural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus granting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been there in the original scene. Specifically, we develop a novel deep-network based decoder architecture for the ubiquitous JPEG standard, which allows traversing the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the compressed JPEG file.

Current-fed half bridge converter with bidirectional switches on ac side and a full bridge converter on dc side of a high frequency transformer is an optimal topology for single stage galvanically isolated ac-dc converter for onboard vehicle charging application. AC side switches are actively commutated to achieve zero current switching (ZCS) using single phase shift modulation (SPSM) and discontinuous current phase shift modulation (DCPSM). Furthermore, zero voltage turn-on (ZVS) is achieved for dc side switches. Compared to SPSM, DCPSM maintains a constant peak current in the converter throughout the grid cycle of ac mains voltage. However, constant peak current contributes to a high circulating current near the zero crossings of ac mains voltage and also at light load conditions.

The linear stability analysis takes into account all possible infinitesimal three-dimensional disturbances and is carried out by solution of the associated eigenproblem. The neutral stability boundary and the corresponding critical wave number are obtained for liquid - liquid and air - water systems. Depending on the problem parameters, the instability sets in owing to short, intermediate, of long wave most unstable perturbations. Patterns of the most unstable disturbances are reported and discussed. It is shown that the instability arises due to shear, or interfacial mechanisms. Effects of the surface tension and of width/height aspect ratio are also studied.

Recent observation of linear optical polarization from brown dwarfs confirms the dust hypothesis in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs with effective temperature higher than 1400 K. The observed polarization could arise due to dust scattering in the rotation induced oblate photosphere or due to the scattering by non-spherical grains in the spherical atmosphere or by the anisotropic distribution of dust clouds. Assuming single scattering by spherical grains in a slightly oblate photosphere consistent with the projected rotational velocity, the observed optical linear polarization is modeled by taking grains of different sizes located at different pressure height and of different number density. Minimum possible oblateness of the object due to rotation is considered in order to constrain the grain size. It is shown that the observed polarization from the L-dwarfs 2MASSW J0036+1821 and DENIS-P J0255-4700 can well be explained by several sets of dust parameters and with the minimum possible oblateness.

We are basically combining the relativistic rocket equation with Haug's new insight on the maximum velocity for anything with rest mass. An interesting new finding is that in order to accelerate any subatomic \"fundamental\" particle to its maximum velocity, the particle rocket basically needs two Planck masses of initial load. This might sound illogical until one understands that subatomic particles with different masses have different maximum velocities. This can be generalized to large rockets and gives us the maximum theoretical velocity of a fully-efficient and ideal rocket.

Bootstrapping has become the mainstream method for entity set expansion. Conventional bootstrapping methods mostly define the expansion boundary using seed-based distance metrics, which heavily depend on the quality of selected seeds and are hard to be adjusted due to the extremely sparse supervision. In this paper, we propose BootstrapGAN, a new learning method for bootstrapping which jointly models the bootstrapping process and the boundary learning process in a GAN framework. Specifically, the expansion boundaries of different bootstrapping iterations are learned via different discriminator networks; the bootstrapping network is the generator to generate new positive entities, and the discriminator networks identify the expansion boundaries by trying to distinguish the generated entities from known positive entities. By iteratively performing the above adversarial learning, the generator and the discriminators can reinforce each other and be progressively refined along the whole bootstrapping process.
