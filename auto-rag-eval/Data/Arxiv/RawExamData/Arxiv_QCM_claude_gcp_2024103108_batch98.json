Recent studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to Trojan attacks, where a network is trained to respond to specially crafted trigger patterns in the inputs in specific and potentially malicious ways. This paper proposes MISA, a new online approach to detect Trojan triggers for neural networks at inference time. Our approach is based on a novel notion called misattributions, which captures the anomalous manifestation of a Trojan activation in the feature space. Given an input image and the corresponding output prediction, our algorithm first computes the model's attribution on different features. It then statistically analyzes these attributions to ascertain the presence of a Trojan trigger. Across a set of benchmarks, we show that our method can effectively detect Trojan triggers for a wide variety of trigger patterns, including several recent ones for which there are no known defenses.

Spin qubits in quantum dots are a compelling platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the potential to fabricate dense two-dimensional arrays with nearest neighbour couplings, a requirement to implement the surface code. However, due to the proximity of the surface gate electrodes, cross-coupling capacitances can be substantial, making it difficult to control each quantum dot independently.

There are many uses for linear fitting; the context here is interpolation and denoising of data, as when you have calibration data and you want to fit a smooth, flexible function to those data.

In these contexts, investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets, or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions thereof. We emphasize that it is often valuable to choose far more parameters than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process.

Beamforming is evidently a core technology in recent generations of mobile communication networks. Nevertheless, an iterative process is typically required to optimize the parameters, making it ill-placed for real-time implementation due to high complexity and computational delay.
