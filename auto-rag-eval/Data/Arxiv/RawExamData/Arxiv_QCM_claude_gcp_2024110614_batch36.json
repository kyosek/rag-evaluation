We report here on the pitfalls of the simulation model introduced in the \"Capturing Phase Behavior of Ternary Lipid Mixtures with a Refined Martini Coarse-Grained Force Field\" [Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2018, 14, 11, 6050-6062]. This refined Martini model was reported to reproduce experimental phase diagrams for a ternary DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol mixture, including the coexistence of two liquid phases. However, we demonstrate that this coexistence only emerged due to an unfortunate choice of simulation parameters, which leads to poor energy conservation. Specifically, the constraints on the cholesterol model drained energy out from the membrane, resulting in two coexisting phases at drastically different temperatures. Using the simulation parameters recommended for the used cholesterol model, this artefact is eliminated, yet so is phase coexistence, i.e. experimental phase diagrams are no longer reproduced. It is important to highlight that the present comment was submitted to Chemical Theory and Computation.

They observe coexistence of two liquid phases in their DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol mixture simulations. However, upon careful analysis, they notice poor energy conservation in their system. What is the most likely explanation for their observations, and what should be their next step?\n\nA) The coexistence is real, but the energy conservation issue suggests the need for longer equilibration times.\nB) The observed coexistence is an artifact caused by improper constraint handling in the cholesterol model, and they should use recommended simulation parameters.\nC) The energy conservation problem is unrelated to phase behavior, and they should focus on optimizing their simulation algorithm.\nD) The coexistence is valid, but they should adjust their thermostat to address the energy conservation issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests critical thinking rather than mere recall. The correct answer, B, directly addresses the core issue presented in the documentation. The study revealed that the coexistence of two liquid phases in the original paper was due to an \"unfortunate choice of simulation parameters,\" specifically related to constraints on the cholesterol model. This led to poor energy conservation and artificial phase separation at different temperatures.\n\nOption A is a plausible distractor, as equilibration times are often a concern in molecular dynamics simulations, but it doesn't address the fundamental issue with the cholesterol model constraints.\n\nOption C represents a common misconception that algorithm optimization can solve all simulation problems, but it ignores the specific issue with the cholesterol model parameters.\n\nOption D is another believable distractor, as thermostat adjustments can sometimes help with energy conservation, but it doesn't address the root cause of the problem in this case.\n\nThe correct approach, as suggested in the documentation, is to use the recommended simulation parameters for the cholesterol model. This eliminates the artifact but also removes the phase coexistence, indicating that the original results did not accurately reproduce experimental phase diagrams.

The matching game is a cooperative game where the value of every coalition is the maximum revenue of players in the coalition can make by forming pairwise disjoint partners. The multiple partners matching game generalizes the matching game by allowing each player to have more than one possibly repeated partner. In this paper, we study profit-sharing in multiple partners matching games. A central concept for profit-sharing is the core which consists of all possible ways of distributing the profit among individual players such that the grand coalition remains intact. The core of multiple partners matching games may be empty [Deng et al., Algorithmic aspects of the core of combinatorial optimization games, Math. Oper.

A new unusual contributing to these studies represents the recent detection of localized sources of water vapour releasing from its surface at a rate about 6 kg s-1 (K\\\"uppers et al 2014). A drastic distinction between asteroid (1) Ceres and nearest the large asteroid (4) Vesta in terms of their composition and appearance emphasizes an urgent state of a problem of the possible origin of Ceres in the main asteroid belt.

This complex sequence arises from the interplay between disorder and electron-electron interactions:\n\n1. Initially, at low U, the system is in an Anderson Insulator (AI) phase due to the randomness in atom positions.\n2. As U increases, the AI phase becomes metallic. This is attributed to the screening of disorder by the Hubbard interaction, which reduces the localizing effect of the random potential.\n3. With further increase in U, the system re-enters an AI phase. This counter-intuitive transition occurs because the strong Hubbard interaction suppresses charge fluctuations, which then allows the residual randomness to localize the quasi-particles of the metallic phase.\n4. Finally, at very large U, the system becomes a Mott Insulator (MI) due to the dominant effect of strong electron-electron interactions.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (disorder, screening, localization, and strong correlation effects), applies them to a real-world experimental scenario, and tests critical thinking about the competing effects in the system rather than mere memorization.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"the total angular momentum (TAM) of the photon is equally distributed among the positron and electron.\" This means that higher TAM values in incident photons will lead to higher overall angular momentum in the generated leptons.\n\n2. It's also mentioned that \"For each photon TAM value, the generated leptons gain higher average OAM number when the photon spin is anti-parallel to its TAM.\" This directly supports the spin orientation in the correct answer.\n\n3. The question asks for the scenario resulting in the \"highest average OAM number,\" which combines both the high TAM value and the anti-parallel spin orientation.\n\n4. Options A and C differ only in spin orientation, with C being correct due to the anti-parallel spin.\n\n5. Options B and D involve low TAM values, which would result in lower overall angular momentum transfer to the leptons, making them less likely to produce the highest average OAM number.\n\n6. The documentation also notes that \"The impact of photon polarization on the OAM spectrum profile and the scattering probability is more significant at small photon TAM numbers.\" This suggests that while spin orientation is important for all TAM values, its effect is most pronounced at lower TAM numbers, further supporting the choice of high TAM values for maximizing average OAM number.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (TAM distribution, spin-TAM relationship, and their combined effect on OAM) and apply them to a hypothetical experimental scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "38": {"documentation": {"title": "Offset-free setpoint tracking using neural network controllers", "source": "Patricia Pauli, Johannes K\\\"ohler, Julian Berberich, Anne Koch and\n  Frank Allg\\\"ower", "docs_id": "2011.14006", "section": ["eess.SY", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Offset-free setpoint tracking using neural network controllers.

By using the model, we can solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics.

The research found that \"adversarially robust CNNs have comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust counterparts,\" which goes against the intuition that smaller norms lead to better robustness.\n\n3. The documentation proves that \"adversarially robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant.\" This suggests that enforcing small norms on CNN layers may not be necessary or effective for achieving adversarial robustness.\n\n4.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. EG-LF-MCMC avoids the need for designing expressive summary statistics (unlike some ABC methods), so increasing their number (option A) is not likely to improve performance.\n\n2. The method uses a classifier trained on (\u03b5, \u03b8)-tuples to distinguish between corresponding and non-corresponding pairs.

This would enhance the method's robustness and potentially its performance.\n\n3. The documentation states that the classifier is conditioned on the smallest recorded \u03b5 value from the training set, not the largest (option C). Using the largest \u03b5 would likely lead to poorer performance as it would accept parameter sets with larger errors.\n\n4. The method's strength partly comes from its ability to condition the MCMC on specific \u03b5 values, allowing for amortized inference.

Mortality forecasting plays a pivotal role in insurance and financial risk management of life insurers, pension funds, and social securities.

This paper introduces a new forecast-driven hierarchical factor model (FHFM) customized for mortality forecasting. Compared to existing models, which only capture the cross-sectional variation or time-serial dependence in the dimension reduction step, the new model captures both features efficiently under a hierarchical structure, and provides insights into the understanding of dynamic variation of mortality patterns over time. By comparing with static PCA utilized in Lee and Carter 1992, dynamic PCA introduced in Lam et al. 2011, as well as other existing mortality modelling methods, we find that this approach provides both better estimation results and superior out-of-sample forecasting performance.

This is in contrast to existing models that typically focus on only one of these aspects in the dimension reduction step.\n\nThe Lee-Carter model, mentioned in the documentation, uses static Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which primarily captures cross-sectional variation. Option A is incorrect because FHFM doesn't exclusively focus on cross-sectional variation.

In practice, however, optimal execution problems often involve large portfolios comprising numerous assets, and models should consequently account for risks at the portfolio level. In this paper, we address multi-asset optimal execution in a model where prices have multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics and where the agent maximizes the expected (exponential) utility of her PnL.

By using \\textit{a priori} estimates obtained thanks to optimal control tools, we nevertheless prove an existence and uniqueness result for the latter ODE, and then deduce a verification theorem that provides a rigorous solution to the execution problem.
