Modern wake word detection systems usually rely on neural networks for acoustic modeling. Transformers has recently shown superior performance over LSTM and convolutional networks in various sequence modeling tasks with their better temporal modeling power. However it is not clear whether this advantage still holds for short-range temporal modeling like wake word detection. Besides, the vanilla Transformer is not directly applicable to the task due to its non-streaming nature and the quadratic time and space complexity. In this paper we explore the performance of several variants of chunk-wise streaming Transformers tailored for wake word detection in a recently proposed LF-MMI system, including looking-ahead to the next chunk, gradient stopping, different positional embedding methods and adding same-layer dependency between chunks.

A priori these theories are, somewhat unusually, given in terms of their effective rather than bare action. In this paper we construct a functional integral representation of these theories. We fix a regularized measure and show that every trajectory of effective average actions, depending on an IR cutoff only, induces an associated trajectory of bare actions which depend on a UV cutoff.

The previous method that I developed, the Nearest-Neighbor Angular Profile (N-NAP) method [2], is good for detecting subtle patterns of order based on the assumption that breast tumor cells are attempting to arrange themselves side-by-side (like bricks), as in the luminal compartment of a normal mammary gland [3].

The phenomenon even transcends to self-propelled fluids such as dense bacterial suspensions that can display turbulence at mesoscale even though the constituent particles move at Reynolds number below unity. It is intensely debated whether such fluids possess an effective temperature and obey fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) as they are generally marred by a lack of detailed balance. In this letter, we answer this question and report an exact expression of the effective temperature for a distribution of interacting particles that are advected by a mesoscale turbulent flow. This effective temperature is linear in particle diffusivity with the slope defining the particle mobility that is higher when the background fluid exhibits global polar ordering, and lower when the fluid is in isotropic equilibrium.

Here, we develop a robust and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density.

A generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no additional training.
