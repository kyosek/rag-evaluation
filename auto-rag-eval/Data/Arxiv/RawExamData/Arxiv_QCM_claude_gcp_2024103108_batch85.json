In this paper we prove that the classical phase space of spin networks coupled to cosmic strings may obtained as a straightforward discretization of general relativity in 3+1 spacetime dimensions. We decompose the continuous spatial geometry into 3-dimensional cells, which are dual to a spin network graph in a unique and well-defined way. Assuming that the geometry may only be probed by holonomies (or Wilson loops) located on the spin network, we truncate the geometry such that the cells become flat and the curvature is concentrated at the edges of the cells, which we then interpret as a network of cosmic strings. The discrete phase space thus describes a spin network coupled to cosmic strings. This work proves that the relation between gravity and spin networks exists not only at the quantum level, but already at the classical level.

It has been shown that well-known spectral graph kernel methods assume that the underlying random process over a graph is stationary.

The properties of competition models where all individuals are identical are relatively well-understood; however, juveniles and adults can experience or generate competition differently. We study here structured competition models in discrete time that allow multiple life history parameters to depend on adult or juvenile population densities. While the properties of such models are less well-known, a numerical study with Ricker density-dependence suggested that when competition coefficients acting on juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies, stage structure could foster coexistence. We revisit and expand those results using models more amenable to mathematical analysis. First, through a Beverton-Holt two-species juvenile-adult model, we obtain analytical expressions explaining how this coexistence emerging from life-history complexity can occur. Second, we show using a community-level sensitivity analysis that such emergent coexistence is robust to perturbations of parameter values. Finally, we ask whether these results extend from two to many species, using simulations. We show that they do not, as coexistence emerging from life-history complexity is only seen for very similar life-history parameters. Such emergent coexistence is therefore not likely to be a key mechanism of coexistence in very diverse ecosystems."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In a structured competition model with stage-specific density dependence, which of the following scenarios is most likely to foster coexistence between two competing species?\n\nA) When competition coefficients for juvenile survival and fertility reflect the same competitive hierarchy for both species\nB) When competition coefficients for juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies for the two species\nC) When competition coefficients are identical for juveniles and adults of both species\nD) When competition coefficients are stronger for adults than for juveniles in both species\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

An initial decay of the pseudospin occurs at the level of dark excitons on a time scale of 100 ps, which is tunable with a magnetic field. This decay is followed by even longer decay ($>1$ ns), once the dark excitons form more complex objects allowing for their radiative recombination.
