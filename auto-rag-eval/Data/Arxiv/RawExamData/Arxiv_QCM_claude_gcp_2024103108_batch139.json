Dust grains emit intrinsic polarized emission if they are elongated and aligned in the same direction. The direction of the grain alignment is determined by external forces, such as magnetic fields, radiation, and gas flow against the dust grains. In this letter, we apply the concept of the grain alignment by gas flow, which is called mechanical alignment, to the situation of a protoplanetary disk. We assume that grains have a certain helicity, which results in the alignment with the minor axis parallel to the grain velocity against the ambient disk gas and discuss the morphology of polarization vectors in a protoplanetary disk. We find that the direction of the polarization vectors depends on the Stokes number, which denotes how well grains are coupled to the gas. If the Stokes number is less than unity, orientation of polarization is in the azimuthal direction since the dust velocity against the gas is in the radial direction. If the Stokes number is as large as unity, the polarization vectors show a leading spiral pattern since the radial and azimuthal components of the gas velocity against the dust grains are comparable. This suggests that if the observed polarization vectors show a leading spiral pattern, it would indicate that Stokes number of dust grains is around unity, which is presumably radially drifting."}, "answer": "Question: In a protoplanetary disk, how does the Stokes number of dust grains influence the orientation of polarization vectors due to mechanical alignment?\n\nA) Stokes number < 1: radial orientation; Stokes number \u2248 1: azimuthal orientation\nB) Stokes number < 1: azimuthal orientation; Stokes number \u2248 1: leading spiral pattern\nC) Stokes number < 1: trailing spiral pattern; Stokes number \u2248 1: radial orientation\nD) Stokes number < 1: random orientation; Stokes number \u2248 1: perpendicular to the disk plane\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, when the Stokes number is less than unity, the dust grains are well-coupled to the gas, and their velocity against the gas is primarily in the radial direction. This results in polarization vectors oriented in the azimuthal direction. When the Stokes number is around unity, the dust grains experience comparable radial and azimuthal components of gas velocity, leading to a leading spiral pattern in the polarization vectors.

The documentation describes a mechanism where the Higgs boson, as a light spectator field during inflation, acquires large field values from quantum fluctuations that vary across different Hubble patches. This spatial variation in the Higgs field leads to space-dependent Standard Model particle masses after inflation. When the inflaton decays to Higgsed SM particles during reheating, the efficiency of this process varies spatially due to the varying particle masses. This inhomogeneous reheating results in temperature anisotropies with a significant non-Gaussian component in the CMB.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the model doesn't involve direct Higgs-CMB photon interactions.

We summarize the value of livestreaming content by estimating how demand responds to price before, on the day of, and after the livestream. We do this by proposing a generalized Orthogonal Random Forest framework.

Incomplete multi-view clustering is an important technique to deal with real-world incomplete multi-view data. Previous works assume that all views have the same incompleteness, i.e., balanced incompleteness. However, different views often have distinct incompleteness, i.e., unbalanced incompleteness, which results in strong views (low-incompleteness views) and weak views (high-incompleteness views). The unbalanced incompleteness prevents us from directly using the previous methods for clustering. In this paper, inspired by the effective biological evolution theory, we design the novel scheme of view evolution to cluster strong and weak views. Moreover, we propose an Unbalanced Incomplete Multi-view Clustering method (UIMC), which is the first effective method based on view evolution for unbalanced incomplete multi-view clustering.

We reinvestigate effects of neutrino oscillations on the production of 7Li and 11B in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). During the propagation of neutrinos from the proto-neutron star, their flavors change and the neutrino reaction rates for spallation of 12C and 4He are affected. In this work corrected neutrino spallation cross sections for 4He and 12C are adopted. Initial abundances involving heavy s-nuclei and other physical conditions are derived in a new calculation of the SN 1987A progenitor in which effects of the progenitor metallicity are included. A dependence of the SN nucleosynthesis and final yields of 7Li and 11B on the neutrino mass hierarchy are shown in several stellar locations. In the normal hierarchy case, the charged current reaction rates of electron neutrinos are enhanced, and yields of proton-rich nuclei, along with 7Be and 11C, are increased. In the inverted hierarchy case, the charged current reaction rates of electron antineutrinos are enhanced, and yields of neutron-rich nuclei, along with 7Li and 11B, are increased. We find that variation of the metallicity modifies the yields of 7Li, 7Be, 11B, and 11C. This effect is caused by changes in the neutron abundance during SN nucleosynthesis.

However at present explicit forms of Markov bases are known only for some relatively simple models, such as the decomposable models of contingency tables. Furthermore general algorithms for Markov bases computation often fail to produce Markov bases even for moderate-sized models in a practical amount of time.
