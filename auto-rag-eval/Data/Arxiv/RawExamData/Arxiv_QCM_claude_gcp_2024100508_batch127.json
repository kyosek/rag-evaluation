Energy released from the accretion of disk material by the black hole or from the rotation of the hole itself extracted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism powers a relativistic wind along the system axis. Lorentz factors of several hundreds are needed to solve the compactness problem in the wind which implies the injection of a tremendous power into a very small amount of matter.

However, longer-term predictions tend to suffer from lower quality. Thus, a critical question is: how to reduce the impact of long-term prediction errors on the online performance? To address this question, we introduce a gradient-based online algorithm, Receding Horizon Inexact Gradient (RHIG), and analyze its performance by dynamic regrets in terms of the temporal variation of the environment and the prediction errors.

It then uses decomposition techniques to break this MPC problem into smaller subproblems. Crucially, the algorithm estimates the horizon length online, adding or removing subproblems based on whether the state of the last subproblem belongs to a given control invariant set. This allows the horizon length to be dynamically adjusted during the optimization process, which is a unique feature of this approach.

In several applications, ultimately at the largest data, truncation effects can be observed when analysing tail characteristics of statistical distributions.

Clustering of Fe abundances during the \"reservoir\" period, late in SEP events, is also newly reported. Transport-induced enhancements in one region are balanced by depletions in another, thus, averaging over these variations produces SEP abundances that are energy independent, confirms previous SEP abundances in this energy region, and provides a credible measure of element abundances in the solar corona.
