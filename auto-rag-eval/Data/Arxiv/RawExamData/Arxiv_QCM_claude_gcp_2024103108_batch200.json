This poses a fundamental challenge for hardware implementations of DNNs, and for their deployment in critical applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper we construct robust DNNs via error correcting codes. By our approach, either the data or internal layers of the DNN are coded with error correcting codes, and successful computation under noise is guaranteed. Since DNNs can be seen as a layered concatenation of classification tasks, our research begins with the core task of classifying noisy coded inputs, and progresses towards robust DNNs. We focus on binary data and linear codes. Our main result is that the prevalent parity code can guarantee robustness for a large family of DNNs, which includes the recently popularized binarized neural networks.

System identification is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning, control theory and signal processing, and the non-asymptotic analysis of the corresponding sample complexity is challenging and elusive, even for linear time-varying (LTV) systems. To tackle this challenge, we develop an episodic block model for the LTV system where the model parameters remain constant within each block but change from block to block. Based on the observation that the model parameters across different blocks are related, we treat each episodic block as a learning task and then run meta-learning over many blocks for system identification, using two steps, namely offline meta-learning and online adaptation. We carry out a comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of the performance of meta-learning based system identification. To deal with the technical challenges rooted in the sample correlation and small sample sizes in each block, we devise a new two-scale martingale small-ball approach for offline meta-learning, for arbitrary model correlation structure across blocks.
