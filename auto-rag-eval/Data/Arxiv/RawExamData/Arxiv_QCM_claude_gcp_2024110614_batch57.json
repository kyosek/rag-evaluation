Using the Fisher information (FI), the design of neutron reflectometry experiments can be optimised, leading to greater confidence in parameters of interest and better use of experimental time [Durant, Wilkins, Butler, & Cooper (2021). J. Appl. Cryst. 54, 1100-1110]. In this work, the FI is utilised in optimising the design of a wide range of reflectometry experiments. Two lipid bilayer systems are investigated to determine the optimal choice of measurement angles and liquid contrasts, in addition to the ratio of the total counting time that should be spent measuring each condition. The reduction in parameter uncertainties with the addition of underlayers to these systems is then quantified, using the FI, and validated through the use of experiment simulation and Bayesian sampling methods. For a \"one-shot\" measurement of a degrading lipid monolayer, it is shown that the common practice of measuring null-reflecting water is indeed optimal, but that the optimal measurement angle is dependent on the deuteration state of the monolayer.

While the loss function is indeed non-convex, the paper shows that OGD can still be effective due to local strong convexity.\n\nOption B represents another plausible misconception. While Kalman filters are commonly used for tracking, the paper demonstrates that OGD alone can effectively handle time-varying targets, given the properties of the loss function.\n\nOption D is a distractor that might appeal to those familiar with particle filters for non-linear estimation problems. However, the paper shows that OGD can handle noisy measurements without resorting to more complex filtering techniques.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (online optimization, convexity properties, and tracking performance) and applies them to a real-world scenario of drone tracking.

We exploit the noisy feature maps by using an additional subnetwork to extract image feature maps and train an auto-encoder on perceptual losses of these feature maps.

Despite its importance, substantial challenges persist in training these models, such as severe class imbalance, high decision thresholds, and lack of ground truth labels in some datasets. In this work we argue in favor of directly optimizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in such cases, due to its robustness to class imbalance, its ability to compromise over different decision thresholds, certain freedom to influence the relative weights in this compromise, fidelity to typical benchmarking measures, and equivalence to positive/unlabeled learning.

It shows a pattern similar to Mumbai's findings, where confirmed cases (0.1%) are a tiny fraction of the actual infections indicated by serological testing (2%).

A rapid change in void structures over a relatively short cosmic time would suggest a different mechanism of structure formation, potentially challenging the CDM model.\n\nA) A consistent increase in galaxy merger rates is expected in the CDM model as structure grows hierarchically. While interesting, this observation would actually support rather than challenge the CDM paradigm.\n\nB) A uniform distribution of galaxy groups across all redshifts would be unusual, but not necessarily in direct conflict with CDM.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. HCG 88 shows no detectable intra-group diffuse light component down to a limiting surface brightness of 29.1 B mag arcsec^-2.

HCG 79 has the highest fraction of intra-group diffuse light at 46\u00b111% (B band), suggesting it is the most evolved of the three groups. The high percentage of diffuse light indicates that significant interactions and stripping events have occurred over time.\n\nThe question challenges the examinee to interpret the percentages of intra-group diffuse light as indicators of evolutionary stage, rather than simply memorizing facts.

Tungsten (W) is widely considered as the most promising plasma facing material (PFM), which will be used in nuclear fusion devices.

In this paper, transmutation elements effects on mechanical properties of the W and the behavior of hydrogen/helium (H/He) atom in the W were investigated by using the first-principles calculation method. The results show that the ductility of the W is enhanced by transmutation elements if dislocation and other defects were ignored, while mechanical properties of the W incompletely depend on transmutation elements content. Compared with the pure W, the formation energy of the H/He in the W is reduced by transmutation elements, but the most favorable sites of the H/He in the W is not changed.

Based on the coherence study findings, which of the following strategies would be most promising for targeting the neurophysiological basis of the condition?\n\nA) Designing a biofeedback system that suppresses alpha band (8-12 Hz) EEG activity\nB) Creating a neurostimulation protocol that enhances low beta (13-20 Hz) coherence between EEG and EMG\nC) Implementing a brain-computer interface that modulates high beta (around 30 Hz) EEG activity\nD) Developing a pharmacological intervention that specifically reduces gamma band (40-100 Hz) synchronization\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a real-world scenario of developing a treatment for focal hand dystonia. The correct answer (C) is based on the key finding from the study that \"activity in the high beta band (around 30 Hz) could represent an electroencephalographic correlate for the pathological electromyographic bursts affecting the focal hand dystonia condition.\"\n\nOption A is a distractor based on the common misconception that alpha activity is always relevant in motor control disorders. Option B presents a plausible but incorrect frequency band, as the study specifically highlights the high beta band. Option D introduces a higher frequency band (gamma) that wasn't mentioned in the study, but might seem plausible to those familiar with other neuroscience research.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the study's findings and apply them to a potential treatment strategy, requiring critical thinking beyond mere memorization of facts. It also challenges the examinee to consider the practical implications of the research in a clinical context, aligning with the L3 (Analysis/Application) or higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}}
