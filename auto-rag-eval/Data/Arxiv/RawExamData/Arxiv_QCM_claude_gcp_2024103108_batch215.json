For centuries, national economies created wealth by engaging in international trade and production. The resulting international supply networks not only increase wealth for countries, but also create systemic risk: economic shocks, triggered by company failures in one country, may propagate to other countries. Using global supply network data on the firm-level, we present a method to estimate a country's exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by the failure of a company in another country. We show the network of systemic risk-flows across the world. We find that rich countries expose poor countries much more to systemic risk than the other way round. We demonstrate that higher systemic risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP, nor do they correlate with economic growth. Systemic risk around the globe appears to be distributed more unequally than wealth. These findings put the often praised benefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light, since they relate them to the involved risks in the production processes. Exposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality, that most affects the poor in supply shock crises. It becomes fully quantifiable with the proposed method."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between systemic risk and economic benefits in global supply networks, according to the study?\n\nA) Countries exposed to higher systemic risk receive proportionally higher economic benefits, creating a balanced risk-reward scenario.\n\nB) Systemic risk is evenly distributed among countries, regardless of their economic status or position in the global supply network.\n\nC) Rich countries expose poor countries to more systemic risk, while the economic benefits for developing countries may not adequately compensate for this increased risk exposure.\n\nD) The study found that higher systemic risk levels positively correlate with economic growth, justifying the risk exposure for developing countries.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the study indicates that rich countries expose poor countries to more systemic risk than vice versa. The findings suggest that the often-praised benefits of globalized production for developing countries need to be reconsidered in light of the risks involved. The study also demonstrates that higher systemic risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP, nor do they correlate with economic growth. This implies that the economic benefits for developing countries may not adequately compensate for their increased exposure to systemic risk in global supply networks.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study does not suggest a balanced risk-reward scenario.

In computer science, models are made explicit to provide formality and a precise understanding of small, contingent universes (e.g., an organization), as constructed from stakeholder requirements.

In the information systems field, one of the reasons why projects fail is an inability to capture requirements in a way that can be technically used to configure a system.

The documentation states that at B* \u2248 30 T, a field-induced Fermi surface reconstruction occurs within the antiferromagnetic state. This reconstruction is associated with the delocalization of the 4f electrons, as evidenced by the significant enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient above B_onset \u2248 17 T. The text also mentions that the Kondo coupling remains remarkably robust as the magnetic field increases, which is attributed to the delocalization of the 4f electrons at the Fermi surface reconstruction.
