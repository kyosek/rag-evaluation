This paper presents an adaptive haptic shared control framework wherein a driver and an automation system are physically connected through a motorized steering wheel.

To enable the automation system to smoothly exchange the control authority with the human partner, this paper introduces a novel self-regulating impedance controller for the automation system. To determine an optimal modulation policy, a cost function is defined. The terms of the cost function are assigned to minimize the performance error and reduce the disagreement between the human and automation system. To solve the optimal control problem, we employed a nonlinear model predictive approach and used the continuation generalized minimum residual method to solve the nonlinear cost function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation studies consider a scenario where the human and the automation system both detect an obstacle and negotiate on controlling the steering wheel so that the obstacle can be avoided safely.
