In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic but novel samples, and thus effectively cover the real image distribution. In terms of interpolation, the GAN-based medical image augmentation is reliable because medical modalities can display the human body's strong anatomical consistency at fixed position while clearly reflecting inter-subject variability; thus, we propose to use noise-to-image GANs (e.g., random noise samples to diverse pathological images) for (i) medical Data Augmentation (DA) and (ii) physician training. Regarding the DA, the GAN-generated images can improve Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on supervised learning. For the physician training, the GANs can display novel desired pathological images and help train medical trainees despite infrastructural/legal constraints.

The fractional dashpot is characterised by a parameter beta, continuously moving from the pure viscous behaviour when beta=1 to the purely elastic response when beta=0.

In this limit, the system loses its ability to dissipate energy through viscous mechanisms.

Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) networks have the utmost significance for real-world applications. There are several deep learning based SR methods with remarkable performance, but their memory and computational cost are hindrances in practical usage. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Attentive Feature Fusion Super-Resolution Network (MAFFSRN). MAFFSRN consists of proposed feature fusion groups (FFGs) that serve as a feature extraction block. Each FFG contains a stack of proposed multi-attention blocks (MAB) that are combined in a novel feature fusion structure. Further, the MAB with a cost-efficient attention mechanism (CEA) helps us to refine and extract the features using multiple attention mechanisms. The comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our model over the existing state-of-the-art.

Stochastic simulation has been widely used to analyze the performance of complex stochastic systems and facilitate decision making in those systems.

The input model is usually estimated using a finite amount of data, which introduces the so-called input model uncertainty to the simulation output. How to quantify input uncertainty has been studied extensively, and many methods have been proposed for the batch data setting, i.e., when all the data are available at once.
