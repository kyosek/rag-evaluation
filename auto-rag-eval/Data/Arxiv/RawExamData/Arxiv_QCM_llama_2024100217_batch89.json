We propose a simple model of inter-bank borrowing and lending where the evolution of the log-monetary reserves of $N$ banks is described by a system of diffusion processes coupled through their drifts in such a way that stability of the system depends on the rate of inter-bank borrowing and lending. Systemic risk is characterized by a large number of banks reaching a default threshold by a given time horizon. Our model incorporates a game feature where each bank controls its rate of borrowing/lending to a central bank. The optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from the central bank when its monetary reserve falls below a critical level or lend if it rises above this critical level which is chosen here as the average monetary reserve. Borrowing from or lending to the central bank is also subject to a quadratic cost at a rate which can be fixed by the regulator. We solve explicitly for Nash equilibria with finitely many players, and we show that in this model the central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. We also study the corresponding Mean Field Game in the limit of large number of banks in the presence of a common noise."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the Mean Field Games and Systemic Risk model, what is the role of the central bank in the system, and how does it affect the systemic risk of the inter-bank network?\n\n**A)** The central bank acts as a lender of last resort, providing liquidity to banks in times of need, thereby increasing systemic risk.\n\n**B)** The central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk, and its optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from or lend to the central bank when its monetary reserve falls or rises above a critical level.\n\n**C)** The central bank is a passive entity that only responds to changes in the monetary reserves of the banks, without any proactive role in managing the system's stability.\n\n**D)** The central bank's optimization is solely focused on minimizing its own costs, without considering the impact on the systemic risk of the inter-bank network.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk, and its optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from or lend to the central bank when its monetary reserve falls or rises above a critical level.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the model describes the central bank as a clearing house that adds liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. This is achieved through the optimization of each bank's rate of borrowing or lending to the central bank, which reflects the desire of each bank to borrow when its monetary reserve falls below a critical level or lend when it rises above this level. This mechanism allows the central bank to manage the system's stability without increasing systemic risk."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "The advantage of being slow: the quasi-neutral contact process", "source": "Marcelo Martins de Oliveira and Ronald Dickman", "docs_id": "1705.03819", "section": ["q-bio.PE", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "The advantage of being slow: the quasi-neutral contact process. According to the competitive exclusion principle, in a finite ecosystem, extinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same resources. An important question that arises is: when coexistence is not possible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the other(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher reproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such as asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been found to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine competitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models, including stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic (mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the \"biological clock\" of one species is a factor of $\\alpha$ slower than that of the other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and competition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems. We find that a species with a slower biological clock has an advantage if resources are limited, winning the competition against a species with a faster clock, in relatively small systems. Periodic or stochastic environmental variations also favor the slower species, even in much larger systems."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the quasi-neutral contact process, what is the advantage of being slow for a species in a finite ecosystem, and under what conditions does this advantage emerge?\n\nA) A slower biological clock allows for more efficient resource utilization, leading to increased reproductive rates.\nB) A slower biological clock confers an advantage in interspecific competition, particularly when resources are limited, and this advantage persists even in larger systems.\nC) A slower biological clock leads to increased diffusion rates, allowing the species to outcompete others for resources.\nD) A slower biological clock results in reduced mortality rates, leading to increased population growth and extinction avoidance.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) A slower biological clock confers an advantage in interspecific competition, particularly when resources are limited, and this advantage persists even in larger systems.\n\n**Explanation:** According to the text, the advantage of being slow for a species in a finite ecosystem is that it confers an advantage in interspecific competition, particularly when resources are limited.

We introduce a model of three parallel-coupled nonlinear waveguiding cores equipped with Bragg gratings (BGs), which form an equilateral triangle. The objective of the work is to investigate solitons and their stability in this system. New results are also obtained for the earlier investigated dual-core system. Families of symmetric and antisymmetric solutions are found analytically, extending beyond the spectral gap in both the dual- and tri-core systems. Moreover, these families persist in the case (strong coupling between the cores) when there is no gap in the system's linear spectrum. Three different types of asymmetric solitons are found in the tri-core system. They exist only inside the spectral gap, but asymmetric solitons with nonvanishing tails are found outside the gap as well. The symmetric solitons are stable up to points at which two types of asymmetric solitons bifurcate from them. Beyond the bifurcation, one type of the asymmetric solitons is stable, and the other is not. Then, they swap their stability. In both the dual- and tri-core systems, the stability region of the symmetric solitons extends far beyond the gap, persisting in the case when the system has no gap at all.

The consistency of the species abundance distribution across diverse communities has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, I argue that the consistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a common symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that different ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and lose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed patterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the magnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear. This measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic diversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in biology."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The author of the paper argues that the consistency of the species abundance distribution across diverse communities arises from a common symmetry with regard to measurement scale.

The reconstructed phase space is represented as a simplicial complex, and its persistent homology is computed to examine the topological features of the invariant set. Suppose the system exhibits chaotic behavior and has an embedding dimension of 3. What can be inferred about the relationship between the lifetime of topological features and the topological noise in the reconstructed phase space?\n\nA) The lifetime of topological features is directly proportional to the topological noise, and the embedding dimension has no effect on this relationship.\n\nB) The lifetime of topological features is inversely proportional to the topological noise, and the embedding dimension affects the rate at which topological features emerge and disappear.\n\nC) The lifetime of topological features is independent of the topological noise, and the embedding dimension determines the complexity of the topological features.\n\nD) The lifetime of topological features is affected by the topological noise, but the embedding dimension has no effect on this relationship, and the lifetime of topological features is determined by the intrinsic properties of the dynamical system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The lifetime of topological features is inversely proportional to the topological noise, and the embedding dimension affects the rate at which topological features emerge and disappear.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is based on the understanding that persistent homology is a measure of the topological features of a simplicial complex, and the lifetime of these features is related to the topological noise in the reconstructed phase space. The embedding dimension affects the rate at which topological features emerge and disappear, as it determines the complexity of the topological features. The inverse proportionality between the lifetime of topological features and the topological noise is a consequence of the fact that topological noise is a measure of the uncertainty in the reconstructed phase space, and the lifetime of topological features is a measure of the stability of these features in the presence of this uncertainty."}, "16": {"documentation": {"title": "The impact of state capacity on the cross-country variations in COVID-19\n  vaccination rates", "source": "Dragan Tevdovski, Petar Jolakoski and Viktor Stojkoski", "docs_id": "2103.04981", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "The impact of state capacity on the cross-country variations in COVID-19\n  vaccination rates.

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based topology optimization algorithm, a unified search framework, for self-organized energy-efficient WSNs. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses a deep neural network to guide a Monte Carlo tree search to roll out simulations, and the results from the tree search reinforce the learning of the neural network. In addition, the proposed algorithm is an anytime algorithm that keeps improving the solution with an increasing amount of computing resources. Various simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance as compared to heuristic solutions, and is capable of adapting to environment and network changes without restarting the algorithm from scratch."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary challenge in topology optimization for self-organized wireless sensor networks, and how does the proposed deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm address this challenge?\n\nA) The primary challenge is the high computational complexity of the optimization problem, and the proposed algorithm uses a heuristic approach to reduce the number of search candidates.

Recent advances in experimental neuroscience allow, for the first time, non-invasive studies of the white matter tracts in the human central nervous system, thus making available cutting-edge brain anatomical data describing these global connectivity patterns. This new, non-invasive, technique uses magnetic resonance imaging to construct a snap-shot of the cortical network within the living human brain. Here, we report on the initial success of a new weighted network communicability measure in distinguishing local and global differences between diseased patients and controls. This approach builds on recent advances in network science, where an underlying connectivity structure is used as a means to measure the ease with which information can flow between nodes. One advantage of our method is that it deals directly with the real-valued connectivity data, thereby avoiding the need to discretise the corresponding adjacency matrix, that is, to round weights up to 1 or down to 0, depending upon some threshold value.

The future 5G wireless infrastructure will support any-to-any connectivity between densely deployed smart objects that form the emerging paradigm known as the Internet of Everything (IoE). Compared to traditional wireless networks that enable communication between devices using a single technology, 5G networks will need to support seamless connectivity between heterogeneous wireless objects and IoE networks. To tackle the complexity and versatility of future IoE networks, 5G will need to guarantee optimal usage of both spectrum and energy resources and further support technology-agnostic connectivity between objects. One way to realize this is to combine intelligent network control with adaptive software defined air interfaces.

We consider our universe as a 3d domain wall embedded in a 5d dimensional Minkowski space-time. We address the problem of inflation and late time acceleration driven by bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall. The expansion of our universe is mainly related to these bulk particles. Since our universe tends to be permeated by a large number of isolated structures, as temperature diminishes with the expansion, we model our universe with a 3d domain wall with increasing internal structures. These structures could be unstable 2d domain walls evolving to fermi-balls which are candidates to cold dark matter. The momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall is related to the reflection coefficient. We show a nontrivial dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark matter structures inside the 3d domain wall. As the population of such structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases. The expansion is exponential at early times and polynomial at late times.

This means that the reflection coefficient is not simply proportional to the number of structures, but rather has a more complex dependence on it. This is consistent with the idea that the number of internal dark matter structures affects the momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the domain wall, leading to a non-trivial dependence on the reflection coefficient."}}
