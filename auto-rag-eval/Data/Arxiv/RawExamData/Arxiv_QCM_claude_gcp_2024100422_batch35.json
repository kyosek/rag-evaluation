I investigate the prospects for using the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) to measure the masses of nearby stars from their astrometric deflection of more distant sources, as originally suggested by Paczynski and by Miralda-Escude. I derive an analytic expression for the total observing time T_tot required to measure the masses of a fixed number of stars to a given precision. I find that T_tot ~ r_max^{-2}, where r_max is the maximum radius to which candidates are searched, or T_tot ~ \\mu_min^2, where \\mu_min is the minimum proper motion to which candidates are searched. I show that T_tot can be reduced by a factor 4 if source availability is extended from V_s=17 to V_s=19. Increasing r_max and V_s and decreasing \\mu_min all require a significantly more agressive approach to finding candidates. A search for candidates can begin by making use of the Luyton proper motion catalog together with the USNO-A2.0 all-sky astrometric catalog.

When r_max is doubled, it's equivalent to multiplying it by 2. In an inverse square relationship, this results in dividing T_tot by 2^2 = 4. Therefore, doubling r_max would cause T_tot to decrease by a factor of 4.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of inverse square relationships and their ability to interpret the given formula in the context of astronomical observations.

Lyric-to-melody generation is an important task in automatic songwriting. Previous lyric-to-melody generation systems usually adopt end-to-end models that directly generate melodies from lyrics, which suffer from several issues: 1) lack of paired lyric-melody training data; 2) lack of control on generated melodies. In this paper, we develop TeleMelody, a two-stage lyric-to-melody generation system with music template (e.g., tonality, chord progression, rhythm pattern, and cadence) to bridge the gap between lyrics and melodies (i.e., the system consists of a lyric-to-template module and a template-to-melody module).

The template-to-melody module is trained in a self-supervised way (i.e., the source template is extracted from the target melody) that does not need any lyric-melody paired data. The lyric-to-template module is made up of some rules and a lyric-to-rhythm model, which is trained with paired lyric-rhythm data that is easier to obtain than paired lyric-melody data. Second, it is controllable. The design of template ensures that the generated melodies can be controlled by adjusting the musical elements in template.

This article reviews the basic computational techniques for carrying out multi-scale simulations using statistical methods, with the focus on simulations of epitaxial growth.

The kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is introduced as an extension of the more wide-spread thermodynamic Monte Carlo methods, and algorithms for kMC simulations, including parallel ones, are discussed in some detail. The step from the atomistic picture to the more coarse-grained description of Monte Carlo simulations is exemplified for the case of surface diffusion.

This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their expression for the Coulomb logarithm, \\ln (m_pri/m_sat). The two alternative forms \\ln (1+m_pri/m_sat) and 1/2\\ln [1+(m_pri/m_sat)^2] for the Coulomb logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully, but both of them underestimate the merger time scale by a factor 2.

This means that to achieve a long range, a backscatter tag needs to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak. Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit through several walls covering a distance of 18 meter while consuming a peak biasing power of 57 microwatts.
