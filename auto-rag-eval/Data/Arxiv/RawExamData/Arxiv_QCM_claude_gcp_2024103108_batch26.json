Photonic metamaterials with properties unattainable in base materials are already beginning to revolutionize optical component design. However, their exceptional characteristics are often static, as artificially engineered into the material during the fabrication process. This limits their application for in-operando adjustable optical devices and active optics in general. Here, for a hybrid material consisting of a liquid crystal-infused nanoporous solid, we demonstrate active and dynamic control of its meta-optics by applying alternating electric fields parallel to the long axes of its cylindrical pores. First-harmonic Pockels and second-harmonic Kerr birefringence responses, strongly depending on the excitation frequency- and temperature, are observed in a frequency range from 50 Hz to 50 kHz. This peculiar behavior is quantitatively traced by a Landau-De Gennes free energy analysis to an order-disorder orientational transition of the rod-like mesogens and intimately related changes in the molecular mobilities and polar anchoring at the solid walls on the single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Thus, our study evidences that liquid crystal-infused nanopores exhibit integrated multi-physical couplings and reversible phase changes that make them particularly promising for the design of photonic metamaterials with thermo-electrically tunable birefringence in the emerging field of spacetime metamaterials aiming at a full spatio-temporal control of light."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and potential application of the liquid crystal-infused nanoporous material discussed in the text?\n\nA) It exhibits static meta-optical properties that are fixed during fabrication, making it ideal for stable, unchanging optical components.\n\nB) It demonstrates dynamic control of meta-optics through mechanical deformation, allowing for pressure-sensitive optical devices.\n\nC) It shows active and dynamic control of meta-optics via alternating electric fields, enabling thermo-electrically tunable birefringence for spacetime metamaterials.\n\nD) It displays magnetic field-responsive properties, making it suitable for magneto-optical devices in data storage applications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The text describes a hybrid material consisting of liquid crystals infused into a nanoporous solid. This material demonstrates active and dynamic control of its meta-optical properties through the application of alternating electric fields parallel to the pores' long axes. The material exhibits both Pockels and Kerr birefringence responses that are dependent on excitation frequency and temperature. This behavior is attributed to an order-disorder orientational transition of the liquid crystal molecules within the nanopores. The key innovation is the ability to dynamically tune the optical properties of the material using electric fields and temperature, making it particularly promising for developing photonic metamaterials with thermo-electrically tunable birefringence. This capability is especially relevant for the emerging field of spacetime metamaterials, which aims to achieve full spatio-temporal control of light.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the material's properties are not static but dynamically controllable.

We introduce a hypothesis testing procedure to identify statistically significant differences between the antineutrino count rate evolution of a standard 'baseline' fuel cycle and that of an anomalous cycle, in which plutonium is removed and replaced with an equivalent fissile worth of uranium. The test would allow an inspector to detect anomalous reactor activity, or to positively confirm that the reactor is operating in a manner consistent with its declared fuel inventory and power level. We show that with a reasonable choice of detector parameters, the test can detect replacement of 73 kg of plutonium in 90 days with 95% probability, while controlling the false positive rate at 5%.
