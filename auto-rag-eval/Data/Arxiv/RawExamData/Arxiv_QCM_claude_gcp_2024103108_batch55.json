Context. There exist few variability studies of stars in the region in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the A and B-star pulsational instability strips. With the aid of the high precision continuous measurements of the CoRoT space satellite, low amplitudes are more easily detected, making a study of this neglected region worthwhile. Aims. We collected a small sample of B stars observed by CoRoT to determine the origin of the different types of variability observed. Methods. We combine literature photometry and spectroscopy to measure the fundamental parameters of the stars in the sample, and compare asteroseismic modelling of the light curves with (differentially rotating) spotted star models. Results. We found strong evidence for the existence of spots and differential rotation in HD 174648, and formulated hypotheses for their origin.

The study found strong evidence for spots and differential rotation in HD 174648, which is explicitly stated in the text. Additionally, the documentation highlights the difficulty in distinguishing between pulsations and rotational modulation based solely on light curves, especially in slowly rotating stars.

In order to probe the inside-out formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe, we have explored the radial (0.1 < R < 8 kpc) variation of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of M87 from UV to IR. For this purpose, we have combined high resolution data in 16 different bands. Our analysis indicate that the age of the stellar population of M87 remains almost unchanged with radius. However, the metallicity ([Z/H]) profile presents three different zones: the innermost kpc shows a plateau with supersolar metallicity, followed by a decline in metallicity down to 5 kpc and another plateau afterwards.

Understanding the relationship between symmetry breaking, system properties, and instabilities has been a problem of longstanding scientific interest. Symmetry-breaking instabilities underlie the formation of important patterns in driven systems, but there are many instances in which such instabilities are undesirable. Using parametric resonance as a model process, here we show that a range of states that would be destabilized by symmetry-breaking instabilities can be preserved and stabilized by the introduction of suitable system asymmetry. Because symmetric states are spatially homogeneous and asymmetric systems are spatially heterogeneous, we refer to this effect as heterogeneity-stabilized homogeneity.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that: 1) TWR-NOMA is superior to TWR-OMA in terms of outage probability in low SNR regimes; and 2) Due to the impact of interference signal (IS) at the relay, error floors and throughput ceilings exist in outage probabilities and ergodic rates for TWR-NOMA, respectively."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a two-way relay non-orthogonal multiple access (TWR-NOMA) system with imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC), what phenomenon is observed in the outage probability at high SNR regions?\n\nA) The outage probability decreases exponentially with increasing SNR\nB) The outage probability remains constant, forming an error floor\nC) The outage probability increases linearly with SNR\nD) The outage probability oscillates unpredictably\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the system's behavior under imperfect SIC conditions. The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"Due to the impact of interference signal (IS) at the relay, error floors and throughput ceilings exist in outage probabilities and ergodic rates for TWR-NOMA, respectively.\" This means that at high SNR regions, the outage probability doesn't continue to decrease but instead reaches a constant value, forming an error floor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because exponential decrease would indicate ideal performance, which is not the case with ipSIC.

This means that for each true jump in the mean vector, there is an estimated jump nearby.

This property ensures that not only does each true jump have an estimated jump nearby, but also each estimated jump has a true jump nearby.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation doesn't claim perfect detection, only approximate screening and recovery.\nOption B is wrong as the documentation explicitly links the \u21132 error rate to changepoint detection capabilities.\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation specifically discusses these properties in the context of the 1-dimensional problem."}, "31": {"documentation": {"title": "CH in absorption in IRAS16293-2422", "source": "S.

In dynamic ride-sharing systems, intelligent repositioning of idle vehicles enables service providers to maximize vehicle utilization and minimize request rejection rates as well as customer waiting times.

The core part of our approach is a novel mixed-integer programming model that aims to maximize coverage of forecasted demand while minimizing travel times for repositioning movements. This model is embedded into a planning service also encompassing other relevant tasks such as vehicle dispatching. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulation studies on real-world datasets from Hamburg, New York City, and Manhattan.
