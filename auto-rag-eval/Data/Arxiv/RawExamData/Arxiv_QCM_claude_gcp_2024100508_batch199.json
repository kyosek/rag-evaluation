Annotating microscopy images for nuclei segmentation is laborious and time-consuming. To leverage the few existing annotations, also across multiple modalities, we propose a novel microscopy-style augmentation technique based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Unlike other style transfer methods, it can not only deal with different cell assay types and lighting conditions, but also with different imaging modalities, such as bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. Using disentangled representations for content and style, we can preserve the structure of the original image while altering its style during augmentation. We evaluate our data augmentation on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset consisting of various cell assays, lighting conditions, and imaging modalities. With our style augmentation, the segmentation accuracy of the two top-ranked Mask R-CNN-based nuclei segmentation algorithms in the competition increases significantly.

Effective medium theory aims to describe a complex inhomogeneous material in terms of a few important macroscopic parameters. To characterise wave propagation through an inhomogeneous material, the most crucial parameter is the effective wavenumber. For this reason, there are many published studies on how to calculate a single effective wavenumber. Here we present a proof that there does not exist a unique effective wavenumber; instead, there are an infinite number of such (complex) wavenumbers. We show that in most parameter regimes only a small number of these effective wavenumbers make a significant contribution to the wave field. However, to accurately calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients, a large number of the (highly attenuating) effective waves is required. For clarity, we present results for scalar (acoustic) waves for a two-dimensional material filled (over a half space) with randomly distributed circular cylindrical inclusions. We calculate the effective medium by ensemble averaging over all possible inhomogeneities. The proof is based on the application of the Wiener-Hopf technique and makes no assumption on the wavelength, particle boundary conditions/size, or volume fraction. This technique provides a simple formula for the reflection coefficient, which can be explicitly evaluated for monopole scatterers.
