This work proposes improvements in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording protocols for motor imagery through the introduction of actual motor movement and/or somatosensory cues. The results obtained demonstrate the advantage of requiring the subjects to perform motor actions following the trials of imagery. By introducing motor actions in the protocol, the subjects are able to perform actual motor planning, rather than just visualizing the motor movement, thus greatly improving the ease with which the motor movements can be imagined. This study also probes the added advantage of administering somatosensory cues in the subject, as opposed to the conventional auditory/visual cues. These changes in the protocol show promise in terms of the aptness of the spatial filters obtained on the data, on application of the well-known common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithms. The regions highlighted by the spatial filters are more localized and consistent across the subjects when the protocol is augmented with somatosensory stimuli. Hence, we suggest that this may prove to be a better EEG acquisition protocol for detecting brain activation in response to intended motor commands in (clinically) paralyzed/locked-in patients."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of protocol modifications in EEG recording for motor imagery tasks showed the most promising results in terms of producing more localized and consistent spatial filters across subjects?\n\nA) Introducing actual motor movements after imagery trials and using conventional auditory/visual cues\nB) Using only somatosensory cues without any actual motor movements\nC) Combining actual motor movements after imagery trials with somatosensory cues\nD) Relying solely on motor planning visualization without any physical movement or sensory cues\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The study described in the text suggests that the most effective improvements to the EEG acquisition protocol for motor imagery tasks involve a combination of two key modifications:\n\n1. Introducing actual motor movements following the trials of imagery. This allows subjects to perform real motor planning, which enhances their ability to imagine motor movements.\n\n2.

One of the main necessities for population geneticists is the availability of statistical tools that enable to accept or reject the neutral Wright-Fisher model with high power. A number of statistical tests have been developed to detect specific deviations from the null frequency spectrum in different directions (i.e., Tajima's D, Fu and Li's F and D test, Fay and Wu's H). Recently, a general framework was proposed to generate all neutrality tests that are linear functions of the frequency spectrum. In this framework, a family of optimal tests was developed to have almost maximum power against a specific alternative evolutionary scenario. Following these developments, in this paper we provide a thorough discussion of linear and nonlinear neutrality tests. First, we present the general framework for linear tests and emphasize the importance of the property of scalability with the sample size (that is, the results of the tests should not depend on the sample size), which, if missing, can guide to errors in data interpretation.

Recently, it has been realized that liquids are able to support solid-like transverse modes with an interesting gap in momentum space developing in the dispersion relation.

Firstly, the appropriately defined relaxation time in the holographic models decreases with temperature in the same way. More importantly, the holographic $k$-gap increases with temperature and with the inverse of the relaxation time. Our results suggest that the Maxwell-Frenkel approach to liquids, involving the additivity of liquid hydrodynamic and solid-like elastic responses, can be applicable to a much wider class of physical systems and effects than thought previously, including relativistic models and strongly-coupled quantum field theories.

We study a simple graphical model for the generation of two-modality data. We analytically show that, with known model parameters, posterior mean estimators that jointly use both modalities outperform arbitrary linear mixing of single modality posterior estimators in latent variable prediction. Penalized extensions of CCA (pCCA) that incorporate domain knowledge can discover correlations with high-dimensional, low-sample data, whereas traditional CCA is inapplicable. To facilitate the generation of multi-dimensional embeddings with pCCA, we propose two matrix deflation schemes that enforce desirable properties exhibited by CCA.

String Theory is a top-to-bottom approach to Quantum Supergravity in that it postulates a new object, the string, from which classical Supergravity emerges as a low energy limit.

Many systems across the sciences evolve through a combination of multiplicative growth and diffusive transport. In the presence of disorder, these systems tend to form localized structures which alternate between long periods of relative stasis and short bursts of activity. This behaviour, known as intermittency in physics and punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory, is difficult to forecast; in particular there is no general principle to locate the regions where the system will settle, how long it will stay there, or where it will jump next. Here I introduce a predictive theory of linear intermittency that closes these gaps. I show that any positive linear system can be mapped onto a generalization of the \"maximal entropy random walk\", a Markov process on graphs with non-local transition rates. This construction reveals the localization islands as local minima of an effective potential, and intermittent jumps as barrier crossings in that potential.

We explore several major neural architectures and a range of standard benchmark datasets for NLP, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and computer vision tasks to show that these architectures, with the same hyper-parameter settings as reported in the literature, perform comparably or better when trained with the square loss, even after equalizing computational resources.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based internet of things (IoT) are among the fast booming technologies that drastically contribute to different systems management and resilience data accessibility. Designing a robust IoT network imposes some challenges such as data trustworthiness (DT) and power management. This paper presents a repeated game model to enhance clustered WSNs-based IoT security and DT against the selective forwarding (SF) attack. Besides, the model is capable of detecting the hardware (HW) failure of the cluster members (CMs) and conserve the power consumption due to packet retransmission. The model relies on TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid collision between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed model aims to keep packets transmitting, isotropic or non-isotropic transmission, from the CMs to the CH for maximizing the DT and aims to distinguish between the malicious CM and the one suffering from HW failure. Accordingly, it can manage the consequently lost power due to the malicious attack effect or HW malfunction.
