Effective methods of fluid transport vary across scale. A commonly used dimensionless number for quantifying the effective scale of fluid transport is the Reynolds number, Re, which gives the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.

These differences in scale have implications for many organisms, ranging from the mechanics of how organisms move through their fluid environment to how hearts pump at various stages in development. Some organisms, such as soft pulsing corals, actively contract their tentacles to generate mixing currents that enhance photosynthesis. Their unique morphology and intermediate scale where both viscous and inertial forces are significant make them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing.

A simple symmetry analysis of in-plane and out-of-plane transport in a family of high temperature superconductors is presented. It is shown that generalized scaling relations exist between the low frequency electronic Raman response and the low frequency in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities in both the normal and superconducting states of the cuprates. Specifically, for both the normal and superconducting state, the temperature dependence of the low frequency $B_{1g}$ Raman slope scales with the $c-$axis conductivity, while the $B_{2g}$ Raman slope scales with the in-plane conductivity. Comparison with experiments in the normal state of Bi-2212 and Y-123 imply that the nodal transport is largely doping independent and metallic, while transport near the BZ axes is governed by a quantum critical point near doping $p\\sim 0.22$ holes per CuO$_{2}$ plaquette. Important differences for La-214 are discussed. It is also shown that the $c-$ axis conductivity rise for $T\\ll T_{c}$ is a consequence of partial conservation of in-plane momentum for out-of-plane transport."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In high-Tc superconductors, which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between Raman response and conductivity in both normal and superconducting states?\n\nA) The B1g Raman slope scales with the in-plane conductivity, while the B2g Raman slope scales with the c-axis conductivity.\n\nB) The B1g Raman slope scales with the c-axis conductivity, while the B2g Raman slope scales with the in-plane conductivity.\n\nC) Both B1g and B2g Raman slopes scale with the in-plane conductivity, but not with the c-axis conductivity.\n\nD) The scaling relationships between Raman slopes and conductivities are different in the normal and superconducting states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The recent progress on capsule networks by Hinton et al. has generated considerable excitement in the machine learning community. The idea behind a capsule is inspired by a cortical minicolumn in the brain, whereby a vertically organised group of around 100 neurons receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected, and may well constitute a fundamental computation unit of the cerebral cortex.

In this paper we share some of these learnings, specifically focusing on three implementation pitfalls and how to avoid them: (1) parent capsules with only one child; (2) normalising the amount of data assigned to parent capsules; (3) parent capsules at different positions compete for child capsules.

The vivid success of the emerging wireless sensor technology (WSN) gave rise to the notion of localization in the communications field.

By utilizing a subset of sensor terminals, gathered data in a WSN can be both identified and correlated which helps in managing the nodes distributed throughout the network.

In a rechargeable wireless sensor network, the data packets are generated by sensor nodes at a specific data rate, and transmitted to a base station. Moreover, the base station transfers power to the nodes by using Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) to extend their battery life. However, inadequately scheduling WPT and data collection causes some of the nodes to drain their battery and have their data buffer overflow, while the other nodes waste their harvested energy, which is more than they need to transmit their packets. In this paper, we investigate a novel optimal scheduling strategy, called EHMDP, aiming to minimize data packet loss from a network of sensor nodes in terms of the nodes' energy consumption and data queue state information. The scheduling problem is first formulated by a centralized MDP model, assuming that the complete states of each node are well known by the base station. This presents the upper bound of the data that can be collected in a rechargeable wireless sensor network.
