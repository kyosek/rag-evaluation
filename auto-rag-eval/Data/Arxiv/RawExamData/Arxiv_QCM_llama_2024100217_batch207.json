State-space mixed-frequency vector autoregressions are now widely used for nowcasting. Despite their popularity, estimating such models can be computationally intensive, especially for large systems with stochastic volatility. To tackle the computational challenges, we propose two novel precision-based samplers to draw the missing observations of the low-frequency variables in these models, building on recent advances in the band and sparse matrix algorithms for state-space models. We show via a simulation study that the proposed methods are more numerically accurate and computationally efficient compared to standard Kalman-filter based methods.

What is the likely explanation for the observed formation of these polymer chains, and what implications does this have for the transport properties of matter in the plasma?\n\n**A)** The polymer chains form due to the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, which allows for the creation of multiple binary bound states. This leads to a network of polymer chains that can affect the transport properties of matter.\n\n**B)** The polymer chains form due to the cooling of the plasma to a temperature range where the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes strong enough to support multiple binary bound states. This leads to a network of polymer chains that can affect the transport properties of matter.\n\n**C)** The polymer chains form due to the presence of diquarks, which are bound states of quarks that can form a chain-like structure. This leads to a network of polymer chains that can affect the transport properties of matter.\n\n**D)** The polymer chains form due to the presence of baryons, which are bound states of three quarks that can form a chain-like structure. This leads to a network of polymer chains that can affect the transport properties of matter.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The polymer chains form due to the cooling of the plasma to a temperature range where the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes strong enough to support multiple binary bound states. This leads to a network of polymer chains that can affect the transport properties of matter.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the study proposes that the polymer chains form in the same temperature range as binary bound states, and that the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes strong enough to support multiple binary bound states at this temperature range. This suggests that the formation of polymer chains is a result of the cooling of the plasma to a temperature where the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes strong enough to support multiple binary bound states."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Generalized Energy Based Models", "source": "Michael Arbel and Liang Zhou and Arthur Gretton", "docs_id": "2003.05033", "section": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Generalized Energy Based Models. We introduce the Generalized Energy Based Model (GEBM) for generative modelling. These models combine two trained components: a base distribution (generally an implicit model), which can learn the support of data with low intrinsic dimension in a high dimensional space; and an energy function, to refine the probability mass on the learned support. Both the energy function and base jointly constitute the final model, unlike GANs, which retain only the base distribution (the \"generator\"). GEBMs are trained by alternating between learning the energy and the base. We show that both training stages are well-defined: the energy is learned by maximising a generalized likelihood, and the resulting energy-based loss provides informative gradients for learning the base. Samples from the posterior on the latent space of the trained model can be obtained via MCMC, thus finding regions in this space that produce better quality samples. Empirically, the GEBM samples on image-generation tasks are of much better quality than those from the learned generator alone, indicating that all else being equal, the GEBM will outperform a GAN of the same complexity.
