Objective: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a time-consuming process involving iterative adjustments of hyperparameters. To automate the treatment planning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner (MP). Methods: Our MP algorithm automates planning by performing optimization of treatment planning hyperparameters. The algorithm uses a derivative-free method (i.e. parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search) to search for weight configurations that minimize a meta-scoring function. Meta-scoring is performed by constructing a tier list of the relevant considerations (e.g. dose homogeneity, conformity, spillage, and OAR sparing) to mimic the clinical decision-making process. Additionally, we have made our source code publicly available via github. Results: The proposed MP method is evaluated on two datasets (21 prostate cases and 6 head and neck cases) collected as part of clinical workflow. MP is applied to both IMRT and VMAT planning and compared to a baseline of manual VMAT plans. MP in both IMRT and VMAT scenarios has comparable or better performance than manual VMAT planning for all evaluated metrics. Conclusion: Our proposed MP provides a general framework for fully automated treatment planning that produces high quality treatment plans. Significance: Our MP method promises to substantially reduce the workload of treatment planners while maintaining or improving plan quality."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the MetaPlanner (MP) algorithm for automated radiation therapy treatment planning, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A hospital is implementing the MetaPlanner (MP) algorithm for automated radiation therapy treatment planning. During a mixed cohort study involving both prostate and head and neck cancer cases, the team notices that while most plans are excellent, a small subset shows suboptimal organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Which of the following modifications to the MP algorithm would most likely address this issue while maintaining its overall effectiveness?\n\nA) Replace the parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search with a gradient-based optimization method\nB) Increase the weight of OAR sparing in the meta-scoring function's tier list\nC) Switch from VMAT to IMRT planning for all cases\nD) Reduce the number of iterations in the hyperparameter optimization process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires analysis of the MetaPlanner (MP) algorithm and application of its principles to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The MP algorithm uses a meta-scoring function with a tier list of considerations, including OAR sparing. Increasing the weight of OAR sparing in this tier list would directly address the observed issue of suboptimal OAR sparing in some cases.\n\n2. Option A suggests changing the optimization method from derivative-free (Nelder-Mead) to gradient-based. While this might improve optimization in some scenarios, it doesn't specifically target OAR sparing and could potentially reduce the algorithm's robustness to non-smooth optimization landscapes.\n\n3. Option C proposes switching from VMAT to IMRT for all cases. However, the documentation states that MP performs well for both IMRT and VMAT, so this change wouldn't necessarily improve OAR sparing and might reduce flexibility.\n\n4. Option D suggests reducing optimization iterations, which would likely decrease overall plan quality and wouldn't address the specific OAR sparing issue.\n\nBy choosing to increase the weight of OAR sparing in the meta-scoring function (Option B), the algorithm would place more emphasis on this aspect during optimization, likely improving OAR sparing in the problematic subset of cases while maintaining the overall effectiveness of the MP method for the majority of plans.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the concepts of the MP algorithm to a practical scenario, requiring integration of multiple aspects of the documentation and critical thinking about the algorithm's structure and potential modifications."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series, Econometric, Machine Learning,\n  and Deep Learning Models", "source": "Ananda Chatterjee, Hrisav Bhowmick, and Jaydip Sen", "docs_id": "2111.01137", "section": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG", "econ.EM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series, Econometric, Machine Learning,\n  and Deep Learning Models.

We present a general method for calculating the leading contributions to h -> gg and h -> gamma gamma in models where the Higgs weakly mixes with a nearly supersymmetric extra sector.

Our method applies even when the extra sector is strongly coupled, and moreover does not require a microscopic Lagrangian description. Using constraints from holomorphy we fix the leading parametric form of the contributions to these Higgs processes, including the Higgs mixing angle dependence, up to an overall coefficient. Moreover, when the Higgs is the sole source of mass for a superconformal sector, we show that even this coefficient is often calculable.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory was designed primarily to search for high-energy (TeV--PeV) neutrinos produced in distant astrophysical objects. A search for $\\gtrsim 100$~TeV neutrinos interacting inside the instrumented volume has recently provided evidence for an isotropic flux of such neutrinos. At lower energies, IceCube collects large numbers of neutrinos from the weak decays of mesons in cosmic-ray air showers. Here we present the results of a search for neutrino interactions inside IceCube's instrumented volume between 1~TeV and 1~PeV in 641 days of data taken from 2010--2012, lowering the energy threshold for neutrinos from the southern sky below 10 TeV for the first time, far below the threshold of the previous high-energy analysis. Astrophysical neutrinos remain the dominant component in the southern sky down to 10 TeV.

Our empirical framework allows researchers to (i) recover the time series of the estimated permanent and transitory components and (ii) estimate the yield and the change of measure which characterize pricing over long investment horizons. We also introduce nonparametric estimators of the continuation value function in a class of models with recursive preferences by reinterpreting the value function recursion as a nonlinear Perron-Frobenius problem. We establish consistency and convergence rates of the eigenfunction estimators and asymptotic normality of the eigenvalue estimator and estimators of related functionals. As an application, we study an economy where the representative agent is endowed with recursive preferences, allowing for general (nonlinear) consumption and earnings growth dynamics."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An economist is studying the long-term pricing implications of a new financial instrument using the nonparametric stochastic discount factor (SDF) decomposition.

The correct answer, A, is based on several key factors:\n\n1. Photons, being lighter particles, typically penetrate deeper into the atmosphere before initiating an extensive air shower. This results in a deeper shower maximum compared to hadronic cosmic rays.\n\n2. Photon-initiated showers tend to have fewer particles reaching the ground, leading to a lower particle density detected by the water Cherenkov detectors.\n\n3. The fluorescence light yield is generally lower for photon-initiated showers due to their electromagnetic nature, producing fewer charged particles that can excite nitrogen molecules in the air.\n\nOption B is incorrect because higher fluorescence yield and earlier shower maximum are more characteristic of hadronic showers.

A\n  synthetic control approach. In this paper, we assess the demand effects of lower public transport fares in Geneva, an urban area in Switzerland. Considering a unique sample based on transport companies' annual reports, we find that, when reducing the costs of annual season tickets, day tickets and short-distance tickets (by up to 29%, 6% and 20%, respectively), demand increases by, on average, about 13%. However, we also show that the effect of the policy intervention did not occur immediately after the price reduction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show how the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010) can be used to assess such (for policy-makers) important price reduction effects in urban public transport. To assess the demand effects, we propose an aggregate metric that inherits extensions of networks, namely passenger trips per vehicle kilometre. Therefore, we can isolate the impact of price reductions, ensuring that companies' network extensions do not affect estimators of interest. In addition, we show how to investigate the robustness of results in similar settings using recent statistical methods and different study designs. Finally, as far as we know, it is the first causal estimate of price reduction on urban public transport initiated by direct democracy."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A mid-sized city is considering implementing a public transport fare reduction strategy similar to Geneva's. The city council is debating the best approach to measure the impact of this policy. Which of the following metrics would be most appropriate for isolating the effect of price reductions on demand, while accounting for potential network expansions?\n\nA) Total number of passenger trips per year\nB) Revenue generated per kilometer of transport network\nC) Passenger trips per vehicle kilometer\nD) Percentage increase in annual season ticket sales\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate metric for isolating the effect of price reductions on demand while accounting for network expansions is passenger trips per vehicle kilometer. This answer demonstrates a higher level of analysis (L3 in Bloom's taxonomy) by requiring the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by asking the respondent to apply the methodology used in the Geneva study to a hypothetical scenario in another city. It also requires understanding the importance of choosing the right metric to measure policy impact accurately.\n\nOption A (Total number of passenger trips per year) is a common misconception as it's a straightforward measure of demand but doesn't account for network expansions, which could inflate the numbers independently of price reductions.\n\nOption B (Revenue generated per kilometer of transport network) is a plausible distractor as it considers network size, but it doesn't directly measure demand and would be affected by the price reductions themselves.\n\nOption D (Percentage increase in annual season ticket sales) is another misconception as it focuses on only one aspect of the fare reduction strategy and doesn't account for other ticket types or network expansions.\n\nThe correct answer, C (Passenger trips per vehicle kilometer), is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as an \"aggregate metric that inherits extensions of networks\" and allows for isolation of the impact of price reductions while ensuring that network extensions don't affect the estimators of interest. This metric provides the most accurate representation of demand changes relative to the service provided, accounting for both fare reductions and potential network expansions."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "On the efficient parallel computing of long term reliable trajectories\n  for the Lorenz system", "source": "I.

Which of the following strategies would likely yield the best combination of accuracy and computational efficiency?\n\nA) Use a fixed stepsize with a lower-order method to reduce computational work per step\nB) Implement a variable stepsize approach with a lower-order method to balance accuracy and efficiency\nC) Employ a fixed stepsize with a higher-order method to maximize parallel efficiency\nD) Apply a variable stepsize approach with a higher-order method, leveraging reduced step count and increased parallel efficiency\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question requires analyzing and applying multiple concepts from the documentation to a real-world research scenario. The correct answer, D, integrates several key points:\n\n1. Variable stepsize: The documentation states that \"For given level of accuracy the optimal variable stepsize determines higher order of the method than in the case of optimal fixed stepsize.\" This suggests that variable stepsize is preferable for accuracy.\n\n2. Higher-order method: The text mentions that \"Although the used order of the method is greater then that in the case of fixed stepsize, and hence the computational work per step is greater, the reduced number of steps gives less overall work.\" This indicates that a higher-order method, despite increased per-step work, results in less overall computational work due to fewer steps.\n\n3. Parallel efficiency: The documentation notes that \"the greater order of the method is beneficial in the sense that it increases the parallel efficiency.\" This supports the use of a higher-order method in a parallel computing context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses fixed stepsize and a lower-order method, which would not optimize either accuracy or parallel efficiency. Option B improves on A by using variable stepsize, but still uses a lower-order method, missing the benefits of higher-order methods for parallel computing. Option C correctly uses a higher-order method but fails to leverage the advantages of variable stepsize.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize multiple concepts from the documentation and apply them to a practical scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere memorization. The distractors represent plausible alternatives that test understanding of the trade-offs between stepsize, method order, accuracy, and computational efficiency in parallel computing for complex systems like the Lorenz system."}}
