Many complex adaptive systems contain a large diversity of specialized components. The specialization at the level of the microscopic degrees of freedom, and diversity at the level of the system as a whole are phenomena that appear during the course of evolution of the system. We present a mathematical model to describe these evolutionary phenomena in economic communities. The model is a generalization of the replicator equation. The economic motivation for the model and its relationship with some other game theoretic models applied to ecology and sociobiology is discussed. Some results about the attractors of this dynamical system are described. We argue that while the microscopic variables -- the agents comprising the community -- act locally and independently, time evolution produces a collective behaviour in the system characterized by individual specialization of the agents as well as global diversity in the community. This occurs for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions provided the community is sufficiently large, and can be viewed as a kind of self-organization in the system. The context dependence of acceptable innovations in the community appears naturally in this framework."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the evolutionary game model presented in the Arxiv documentation, what is the underlying assumption that allows for the emergence of collective behavior in economic communities, despite the local and independent actions of individual agents?\n\n**A)** The model assumes that agents are highly interconnected and share a common goal.\n**B)** The model assumes that agents are specialized in their microscopic degrees of freedom, but lack a global understanding of the system.\n**C)** The model assumes that the community is sufficiently large, allowing for the emergence of self-organization and collective behavior.\n**D)** The model assumes that agents are highly motivated by economic incentives, leading to a homogenization of behavior.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) The model assumes that the community is sufficiently large, allowing for the emergence of self-organization and collective behavior.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the statement in the documentation that \"this occurs for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions provided the community is sufficiently large\".

Automated airway segmentation is a prerequisite for pre-operative diagnosis and intra-operative navigation for pulmonary intervention. Due to the small size and scattered spatial distribution of peripheral bronchi, this is hampered by severe class imbalance between foreground and background regions, which makes it challenging for CNN-based methods to parse distal small airways. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is arisen by gradient erosion and dilation of the neighborhood voxels. During back-propagation, if the ratio of the foreground gradient to background gradient is small while the class imbalance is local, the foreground gradients can be eroded by their neighborhoods. This process cumulatively increases the noise information included in the gradient flow from top layers to the bottom ones, limiting the learning of small structures in CNNs. To alleviate this problem, we use group supervision and the corresponding WingsNet to provide complementary gradient flows to enhance the training of shallow layers.

Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles. Key performance factors are weather resistance and the possibility to directly measure velocity. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data in early processing stages are required to run directly on specialized hardware, i.e. the radar sensor. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. However, these models typically contain millions of parameters, stored in hundreds of megabytes of memory, and require additional memory during execution. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals.
