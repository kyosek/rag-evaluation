In this paper, a semiparametric partially linear model in the spirit of Robinson (1988) with Box- Cox transformed dependent variable is studied. Transformation regression models are widely used in applied econometrics to avoid misspecification. In addition, a partially linear semiparametric model is an intermediate strategy that tries to balance advantages and disadvantages of a fully parametric model and nonparametric models. A combination of transformation and partially linear semiparametric model is, thus, a natural strategy. The model parameters are estimated by a semiparametric extension of the so called smooth minimum distance (SmoothMD) approach proposed by Lavergne and Patilea (2013). SmoothMD is suitable for models defined by conditional moment conditions and allows the variance of the error terms to depend on the covariates. In addition, here we allow for infinite-dimension nuisance parameters. The asymptotic behavior of the new SmoothMD estimator is studied under general conditions and new inference methods are proposed.

Prior distributions for Bayesian inference that rely on the $l_1$-norm of the parameters are of considerable interest, in part because they promote parameter fields with less regularity than Gaussian priors (e.g., discontinuities and blockiness). These $l_1$-type priors include the total variation (TV) prior and the Besov $B^s_{1,1}$ space prior, and in general yield non-Gaussian posterior distributions. Sampling from these posteriors is challenging, particularly in the inverse problem setting where the parameter space is high-dimensional and the forward problem may be nonlinear. This paper extends the randomize-then-optimize (RTO) method, an optimization-based sampling algorithm developed for Bayesian inverse problems with Gaussian priors, to inverse problems with $l_1$-type priors. We use a variable transformation to convert an $l_1$-type prior to a standard Gaussian prior, such that the posterior distribution of the transformed parameters is amenable to Metropolized sampling via RTO. We demonstrate this approach on several deconvolution problems and an elliptic PDE inverse problem, using TV or Besov $B^s_{1,1}$ space priors.

How to practically maintain the frequency stability of large-scale power systems by a decentralized way is a simple but non-trivial question. In other words, is it possible to design any local controller without understanding the other controlled areas and with less understanding of network structure? With respect to the special properties of physical interaction between the local areas, this paper suggests two existing theories for tackling this issue. Firstly, passivity theory is shown to be a candidate for frequency control problem using swing equation. Based on the passivity of swing dynamics, it is possible to guarantee the system stability by designing for each local area a passive controller. We further extend the passivity approach to the hierarchically decentralized control system with unknown communication delay. Secondly, we discuss the application of generalized frequency variable (GFV) to the frequency control problem using area-control-error. Each local controller is designed such that each local subsystem follows a nominal model set. Utilizing GFV theory, we present a triad of conditions that sufficiently guarantee the system stability. The conditions can be tested conveniently by a limited set of inequalities established from the GFV and the eigenvalues of the physical interaction matrix.

Often in macroeconomics, however, many candidate explanatory variables are available and the number of possible models becomes too large for DMA to be applied in its original form. We propose a new method for this situation which allows us to perform DMA without considering the whole model space, but using a subset of models and dynamically optimizing the choice of models at each point in time.
