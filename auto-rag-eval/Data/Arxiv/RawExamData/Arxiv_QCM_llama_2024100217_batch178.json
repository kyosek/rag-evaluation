Non-trivial critical models in 2D with central charge c=0 are described by Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories (LCFTs), and exhibit in particular mixing of the stress-energy tensor with a \"logarithmic\" partner under a conformal transformation. This mixing is quantified by a parameter (usually denoted b), introduced in [V. Gurarie, Nucl. Phys. B 546, 765 (1999)], and which was first thought to play the role of an \"effective\" central charge. The value of b has been determined over the last few years for the boundary versions of these models: $b_{\\rm perco}=-5/8$ for percolation and $b_{\\rm poly} = 5/6$ for dilute polymers. Meanwhile, the existence and value of $b$ for the bulk theory has remained an open problem. Using lattice regularization techniques we provide here an \"experimental study\" of this question. We show that, while the chiral stress tensor has indeed a single logarithmic partner in the chiral sector of the theory, the value of b is not the expected one: instead, b=-5 for both theories.

Tensors are multidimensional arrays of numerical values and therefore generalize matrices to multiple dimensions.

Tensors and their decompositions are especially beneficial in unsupervised learning settings, but are gaining popularity in other sub-disciplines like temporal and multi-relational data analysis, too. The scope of this paper is to give a broad overview of tensors, their decompositions, and how they are used in machine learning. As part of this, we are going to introduce basic tensor concepts, discuss why tensors can be considered more rigid than matrices with respect to the uniqueness of their decomposition, explain the most important factorization algorithms and their properties, provide concrete examples of tensor decomposition applications in machine learning, conduct a case study on tensor-based estimation of mixture models, talk about the current state of research, and provide references to available software libraries."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary advantage of using tensors over matrices in unsupervised learning settings, and how do tensor decompositions address this advantage?\n\nA) Tensors provide more flexibility in data representation, allowing for the capture of complex relationships between variables.

Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region.
