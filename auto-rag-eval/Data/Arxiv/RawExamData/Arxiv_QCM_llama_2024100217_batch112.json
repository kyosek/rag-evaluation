In this paper a diffuse-interface model featuring phase change, transition to supercritical conditions, thermal conduction, compressibility effects and shock wave propagation is exploited to deal with the dynamics of a cavitation bubble. At variance with previous descriptions, the model is uniformly valid for all phases (liquid, vapor and supercritical) and phase transitions involved, allowing to describe the non-equilibrium processes ongoing during the collapse. As consequence of this unitary description, rather unexpectedly for pure vapor bubbles, the numerical experiments show that the collapse is accompanied by the emission of a strong shock wave in the liquid and by the oscillation of the bubble that periodically disappears and reappears, due to transition to super/sub critical conditions. The mechanism of shock wave formation is strongly related to the transition of the vapor to supercritical state, with a progressive steepening of the compression wave to form the shock which is eventually reflected as an outward propagating wave in the liquid."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** Describe the mechanism of shock wave formation in the collapse of a vapor nano-bubble, as described in the paper \"Shock formation in the collapse of a vapor nano-bubble\".

Many problems in machine learning and game theory can be formulated as saddle-point problems, for which various first-order methods have been developed and proven efficient in practice.

However, numerically, the iterates themselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This observation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on later iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such increasing averaging schemes, applied to various first-order methods, are able to preserve the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate with no additional assumptions or computational overhead.

This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify.

We study decision making in environments where the reward is only partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of an action and an observed context. This setting, known as contextual bandits, encompasses a wide variety of applications including health-care policy and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous approaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. In this work, we leverage the strength and overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches by applying the doubly robust technique to the problems of policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields accurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better policies.

This paper proposes a three-step method for a humanoid robot to reason about the feasibility of lifting a heavy box with physical properties that are unknown to the robot. Since feasibility of lifting is directly related to the physical properties of the box, we first discretize a range for the unknown values of parameters describing these properties and tabulate all valid optimal quasi-static lifting trajectories generated by simulations over all combinations of indices.

We relate this critical value of the promiscuity to what epidemiologist call the basic reproductive number, connecting it with the other parameters of the model, namely the infectivity and the infective period in a quantitative way. We consider the possibility of subjects be grouped in couples. In this contribution only the homosexual case is analyzed."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the model for the evolution of sexually transmitted diseases, what is the relationship between the promiscuity parameter and the basic reproductive number (R0), and how does it relate to the infectivity and infective period of the disease?\n\n**A)** The promiscuity parameter is directly proportional to the basic reproductive number, and the infectivity and infective period are independent of it.\n\n**B)** The promiscuity parameter is inversely proportional to the basic reproductive number, and the infectivity and infective period are directly proportional to it.\n\n**C)** The promiscuity parameter is a threshold value below which the epidemic does not occur, and the basic reproductive number is a function of the infectivity and infective period, but not directly related to the promiscuity parameter.\n\n**D)** The promiscuity parameter is a measure of the distribution of sexual attitudes in the population, and the basic reproductive number is a quantitative value that connects the promiscuity parameter to the infectivity and infective period.\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) The promiscuity parameter is a measure of the distribution of sexual attitudes in the population, and the basic reproductive number is a quantitative value that connects the promiscuity parameter to the infectivity and infective period.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is D) because the promiscuity parameter is a measure of the distribution of sexual attitudes in the population, and the basic reproductive number (R0) is a quantitative value that connects the promiscuity parameter to the infectivity and infective period. The promiscuity parameter is used to describe the social behavior of the population, and the basic reproductive number is a key concept in epidemiology that describes the potential for an infectious disease to spread in a population. The relationship between the promiscuity parameter and the basic reproductive number is established in the model, and it is used to quantify the impact of social behavior on the evolution of sexually transmitted diseases."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Spectral curves in gauge/string dualities: integrability, singular\n  sectors and regularization", "source": "Boris Konopelchenko, Luis Mart\\'inez Alonso, Elena Medina", "docs_id": "1301.7082", "section": ["math-ph", "math.MP", "nlin.SI"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Spectral curves in gauge/string dualities: integrability, singular\n  sectors and regularization.
