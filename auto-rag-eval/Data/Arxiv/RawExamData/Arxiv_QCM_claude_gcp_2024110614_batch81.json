We consider the problem of computationally-efficient prediction from high dimensional and highly correlated predictors in challenging settings where accurate variable selection is effectively impossible. Direct application of penalization or Bayesian methods implemented with Markov chain Monte Carlo can be computationally daunting and unstable. Hence, some type of dimensionality reduction prior to statistical analysis is in order. Common solutions include application of screening algorithms to reduce the regressors, or dimension reduction using projections of the design matrix. The former approach can be highly sensitive to threshold choice in finite samples, while the later can have poor performance in very high-dimensional settings. We propose a TArgeted Random Projection (TARP) approach that combines positive aspects of both strategies to boost performance. In particular, we propose to use information from independent screening to order the inclusion probabilities of the features in the projection matrix used for dimension reduction, leading to data-informed sparsity.

High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance images (MRI) provide detailed anatomical information important for clinical application and quantitative image analysis.

Recent studies have shown that single image super-resolution (SISR), a technique to recover HR details from one single low-resolution (LR) input image, could provide high-quality image details with the help of advanced deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"The slow drift of the exciters along the flare loop suggests a high pitch-anisotropy of the emitting electrons.\" This directly supports the idea of high pitch-angle anisotropy and slow movement along the loop.\n\n2.

Option B is incorrect because the electrons are not primarily at the footpoints, but near the top of the loop.\n\n5.

In this study, we employ a microfluidics-based pore scale model to observe the effect of bacterial density on the growth rate and characteristics of CaCO3 precipitates during MICP processes occurring at the sand particle scale. Results show that the precipitation rate of CaCO3 increases with bacterial density in the range between 0.6e8 and 5.2e8 cells/ml. Bacterial density also affects both the size and number of CaCO3 crystals. A low bacterial density of 0.6e8 cells/ml produced 1.1e6 crystals/ml with an average crystal volume of 8,000 um3, whereas a high bacterial density of 5.2e8 cells/ml resulted in more crystals (2.0e7 crystals/ml) but with a smaller average crystal volume of 450 um3. The produced CaCO3 crystals were stable when the bacterial density was 0.6e8 cells/ml. When the bacterial density was 4-10 times higher, the crystals were first unstable and then transformed into more stable CaCO3 crystals. This suggests that bacterial density should be an important consideration in the design of MICP protocols."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An environmental engineer is developing a new MICP protocol for soil stabilization in a large-scale project.

Starting with a low bacterial density (0.6e8 cells/ml) would produce fewer but larger CaCO3 crystals (1.1e6 crystals/ml with an average volume of 8,000 um3). These larger crystals are described as stable in the documentation.\n\n2. Gradually increasing the bacterial density over time would allow for the formation of more numerous, smaller crystals. This approach combines the benefits of both low and high bacterial densities.\n\n3. The documentation suggests that higher bacterial densities (4-10 times higher than 0.6e8 cells/ml) initially produce unstable crystals that later transform into more stable forms. By starting low and increasing gradually, this process of crystal formation and stabilization can be better controlled.\n\n4. This strategy would likely lead to a more uniform distribution of crystal sizes and improved overall stability, addressing the inconsistency issues mentioned in the question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because consistently high bacterial density would only produce numerous small crystals (2.0e7 crystals/ml with an average volume of 450 um3), which may not provide optimal soil stabilization.\n\nOption C is incorrect because alternating between high and low densities would likely lead to unpredictable results and wouldn't take advantage of the gradual crystal formation and stabilization process.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while a moderate density might seem like a compromise, it doesn't leverage the benefits of starting with larger, stable crystals and then promoting the formation of smaller crystals to fill in gaps.\n\nThis question challenges the examinee to apply the research findings to a practical engineering problem, requiring critical thinking about how bacterial density affects crystal formation and stability over time in a soil stabilization context."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "Viscous Effects on the Mapping of the Initial to Final State in Heavy\n  Ion Collisions", "source": "Fernando G.

Modelling the near-wall region of wall-bounded turbulent flows is a widespread practice to reduce the computational cost of large-eddy simulations (LESs) at high Reynolds number.

The fully-convolutional network (FCN) proposed by Guastoni et al.

The correct answer, C, is based on the phenomenon of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\n\nWhen charm quarks are produced in the initial hard scatterings of a heavy-ion collision, they must traverse the hot and dense medium (QGP) before hadronizing into D mesons.

Precision cosmology has recently triggered new attention on the topic of approximate methods for the clustering of matter on large scales, whose foundations date back to the period from late '60s to early '90s. Indeed, although the prospect of reaching sub-percent accuracy in the measurement of clustering poses a challenge even to full N-body simulations, an accurate estimation of the covariance matrix of clustering statistics, not to mention the sampling of parameter space, requires usage of a large number (hundreds in the most favourable cases) of simulated (mock) galaxy catalogs. Combination of few N-body simulations with a large number of realizations performed with approximate methods gives the most promising approach to solve these problems with a reasonable amount of resources.

Swarming is a conspicuous behavioural trait observed in bird flocks, fish shoals, insect swarms and mammal herds. It is thought to improve collective awareness and offer protection from predators. Many current models involve the hypothesis that information coordinating motion is exchanged between neighbors. We argue that such local interactions alone are insufficient to explain the organization of large flocks of birds and that the mechanism for the exchange of long-ranged information necessary to control their density remains unknown. We show that large flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many directions. Such flocks are marginally opaque - an external observer can also just still see a substantial fraction of sky through the flock. Although seemingly intuitive we show that this need not be the case; flocks could easily be highly diffuse or entirely opaque. The emergence of marginal opacity strongly constrains how individuals interact with each other within large swarms. It also provides a mechanism for global interactions: An individual can respond to the projection of the flock that it sees.

For one of these case studies on 14th century Byzantium, the explanatory value of this approach is presented in greater detail. The presented results are integrated in a wider comparison of five late medieval polities across Afro-Eurasia (Byzantium, China, England, Hungary and Mamluk Egypt) against the background of the {\\guillemotright}Late Medieval Crisis{\\guillemotleft} and its political and environmental turmoil.

In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are active as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA.

Distributed training of massive machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is becoming commonplace. Several families of communication-reduction methods, such as quantization, large-batch methods, and gradient sparsification, have been proposed. To date, gradient sparsification methods - where each node sorts gradients by magnitude, and only communicates a subset of the components, accumulating the rest locally - are known to yield some of the largest practical gains. Such methods can reduce the amount of communication per step by up to three orders of magnitude, while preserving model accuracy. Yet, this family of methods currently has no theoretical justification. This is the question we address in this paper. We prove that, under analytic assumptions, sparsifying gradients by magnitude with local error correction provides convergence guarantees, for both convex and non-convex smooth objectives, for data-parallel SGD.

Our target is to minimize the total energy consumption of the mobile device and multiple relay nodes through optimizing the allocation of computation and communication resources. Optimization problems under the three considered modes are formulated and shown to be non-convex. For DF-TDMA mode, we transform the original non-convex problem to be a convex one and further develop a low computation complexity yet optimal solution. In DF-FDMA mode, with some transformation on the original problem, we prove the mathematical equivalence between the transformed problem in DF-FDMA mode and the problem under DF-TDMA mode. In AF mode, the associated optimization problem is decomposed into two levels, in which monotonic optimization is utilized in upper level and successive convex approximation (SCA) is adopted to find the convergent solution in the lower level. Numerical results prove the effectiveness of our proposed methods under various working modes."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An IoT company is developing a new energy-efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) system for smart city applications.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The documentation discusses three modes: DF-TDMA, DF-FDMA, and AF. It shows that DF-TDMA and DF-FDMA can be optimized effectively.\n\n2. The question asks for the most energy-efficient solution that can adapt to varying network conditions, which implies the need for flexibility.\n\n3. The paper states that for DF-TDMA, they developed \"a low computation complexity yet optimal solution.\" It also proves \"the mathematical equivalence between the transformed problem in DF-FDMA mode and the problem under DF-TDMA mode.\"\n\n4.

This approach leverages the strengths of both modes and the optimization techniques developed for them.\n\nOption A is incomplete as it only uses DF-TDMA, limiting adaptability.

This sequence of two transitions is brought about by an interplay of short-range and long-range interactions between substrate and adsorbate.
