The electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian fluids in deformable microchannels is fundamentally important in the understanding of the hydrodynamics in physiological flows. The performance of these microchannels is governed by the load bearing capacity indicating the maximum amount of load that the device can withstand. While significant research efforts are aimed towards the coupling of electrokinetics with substrate deformability, the corresponding enhancement in the performances still remains elusive. Towards this, employing an intricate coupling between substrate compliance, hydrodynamic, and electrokinetic modulations, we have analyzed the possible sources of alterations in the flow physics in a deformable microchannel under the rheological premises of viscoelastic fluids which have a close resemblance with biological fluids typically used in several bio and micro-fluidic applications. The present study reveals that by operating under favorable regimes of parameters like the concentration and molecular weight of the polymer, the quality of the Newtonian solvent, and the concentration of electrolyte, one can achieve substantial augmentation in the load carrying capacity of a deformable microchannel for viscoelastic fluids as compared to its Newtonian counterpart.

Coating only one hemisphere of the asteroid can produce a Solar radiation torque, which is described as being able to displace an asteroid by an Earth radius in ~200 years.

Temporal information preservation: Unlike simpler averaging methods or standard GLM approaches, S-GPFA incorporates temporal information in the common latent structures. It models temporal correlation in fMRI data, which is essential for accurately capturing the dynamics of brain activity during a social cognition task.\n\n3. Shared latent trajectories: The model discovers shared latent trajectories across subjects, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of common patterns in brain activity related to social cognition, while still accounting for individual differences.\n\n4. Subject-specific functional topographies: S-GPFA can model subject-specific functional topographies, which is important when dealing with a diverse group of participants, including those with schizophrenia who may have altered brain function.\n\n5. Proven efficacy: The documentation mentions that S-GPFA has demonstrated effectiveness in revealing ground truth latent structures in simulated data and has replicated experimental performance on real datasets (Raider and Sherlock).\n\nOption A (standard GLM with rigid co-registration) doesn't adequately address inter-subject variability and may lose important individual-specific information. Option B (ICA on each subject separately) doesn't leverage the power of multi-subject analysis and may miss common patterns across individuals. Option D (simple averaging) would lose both temporal information and individual-specific patterns, potentially obscuring important differences between the schizophrenia and control groups.\n\nThe S-GPFA model (Option C) provides a sophisticated approach that balances the need for shared representation with the preservation of individual and temporal characteristics, making it the most effective choice for this complex multi-subject fMRI study on social cognition in schizophrenia."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "Statistical dependence: Beyond Pearson's $\\rho$", "source": "Dag Tj{\\o}stheim, H{\\aa}kon Otneim and B{\\aa}rd St{\\o}ve", "docs_id": "1809.10455", "section": ["math.ST", "stat.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Statistical dependence: Beyond Pearson's $\\rho$.

We derive the implications of these principles for an autarkic agent that maximizes utility subject to an energy budget constraint and maximizes energy surplus to relax such constraint.

Contextual dynamic pricing aims to set personalized prices based on sequential interactions with customers.

The seller does not observe the customer's true valuation, but instead needs to learn the valuation by leveraging contextual information and historical binary purchase feedbacks.

Among these challenges is the inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of species based on sequence information from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. It is widely accepted that each individual gene has its own phylogeny, which may not agree with the species tree. Many possible causes of this gene tree incongruence are known.

Many models of market dynamics make use of the idea of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for economic markets the system converges to a very unequal \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the wide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here we present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation but also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of interacting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated by the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is changed at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of this poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory tool for wealth redistribution.

The cooling rates account for medium-modified one-pion exchange in dense matter, polarization effects in the pair-breaking-formation processes operating on superfluid neutrons and protons paired in the 1S_0 state, and other relevant processes. The emissivity of the pair-breaking-formation process in the 3P_2 state is a tiny quantity within our scenario. Crucial for a successful description of the Cassiopeia A cooling proves to be the thermal conductivity from both, the electrons and nucleons, being reduced by medium effects. Moreover, we exploit an EoS which stiffens at high densities due to an excluded volume effect and is capable of describing a maximum mass of 2.1 M_sun, thus including the recent measurements of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about neutron star cooling and the Cassiopeia A neutron star, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A newly discovered neutron star shows cooling behavior similar to Cassiopeia A, but with a slightly slower rate.

The documentation emphasizes that reduced thermal conductivity from both electrons and nucleons is crucial for explaining Cassiopeia A's cooling. A slightly slower cooling rate could be achieved by a modest increase in thermal conductivity.\n\n2. Weaker proton superfluidity would reduce the efficiency of the pair-breaking-formation processes in the 1S_0 state, which are described as relevant in the cooling scenario. This would lead to a slightly slower cooling rate.\n\n3. The combination of these factors aligns with the \"nuclear medium cooling\" scenario described in the document, while also accounting for a cooling rate that's similar but slightly slower than Cassiopeia A.\n\nOption A is incorrect because enhanced 3P_2 neutron pairing would increase cooling rates, and the document states that the emissivity of pair-breaking-formation in the 3P_2 state is tiny in this scenario.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increased opacity would likely lead to faster cooling, not slower. The document doesn't mention opacity as a key factor in the cooling scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect because enhanced pair-breaking-formation processes in the 3P_2 state contradicts the document's statement about its tiny contribution. Additionally, while a stiffer equation of state is mentioned, it's primarily in the context of explaining high neutron star masses, not directly linked to cooling rates.\n\nThis question tests the ability to synthesize information from the document and apply it to a new scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Estimation of Building Rooftop Temperature from High Spatial Resolution\n  Aerial Thermal Images", "source": "Atma Bharathi Mani, Ramanathan Sugumaran", "docs_id": "2001.09191", "section": ["eess.IV", "stat.AP"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Estimation of Building Rooftop Temperature from High Spatial Resolution\n  Aerial Thermal Images.

Hebbian plasticity is a powerful principle that allows biological brains to learn from their lifetime experience.

We introduce a formalism of ``particle automata'', and discuss several properties that they may exhibit, some of which, like anticipation and momentum preservation, happen to be intrinsic to the conservative CA they represent.

This approach \"turns the typical fMRI approach on its head\" by using real-time fMRI in combination with optimization techniques to automatically design the optimal experiment to evoke a desired target brain state. \n\nOption A, while traditional, would be time-consuming and may not explore the full parameter space of possible auditory stimuli. It represents the standard \"one task-to-many regions mapping\" approach, which the Automatic Neuroscientist aims to improve upon.\n\nOption C, a meta-analysis, would be limited to existing studies and wouldn't allow for the exploration of novel combinations of stimuli or real-time optimization based on individual responses.\n\nOption D, using a machine learning model, might be helpful but would be limited by the training data and wouldn't adapt in real-time to the specific participant's brain responses.\n\nThe Automatic Neuroscientist approach (B) offers several advantages:\n1. It uses real-time fMRI, allowing for immediate feedback and adjustment of stimuli.\n2. It employs state-of-the-art optimization techniques to efficiently explore the experimental parameter space.\n3. It can provide an accurate estimation of the underlying relationship between stimuli and neural responses across an extensive parameter space.\n4. It's described as \"very powerful, hugely speeding up fMRI\" in the documentation.\n5. It allows for a \"many tasks-to-region mapping,\" which is particularly relevant when trying to identify optimal stimuli for activating a specific brain region.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies the approach to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about experimental design in neuroscience rather than simple memorization."}}
