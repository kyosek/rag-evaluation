The interaction between equilibrium tides and convection in stellar envelopes is often considered important for tidal evolution in close binary and extrasolar planetary systems. Its efficiency for fast tides has however long been controversial, when the tidal frequency exceeds the turnover frequency of convective eddies. Recent numerical simulations indicate that convection can act like an effective viscosity which decays quadratically with tidal frequency for fast tides, resulting in inefficient dissipation in many applications involving pre- and main-sequence stars and giant planets. A new idea was however recently proposed by Terquem (2021), who suggested Reynolds stresses involving correlations between tidal flow components dominate the interaction instead of correlations between convective flow components as usually assumed.
