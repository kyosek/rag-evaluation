A full accounting of biological robustness remains elusive; both in terms of the mechanisms by which robustness is achieved and the forces that have caused robustness to grow over evolutionary time. Although its importance to topics such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery of future adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate relationship between robustness and complexity in biology. This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for system evolvability."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary mechanism by which degeneracy contributes to the robustness of complex biological systems, according to the hypothesis presented in the paper?\n\nA) Degeneracy leads to increased functional redundancy, allowing systems to maintain their properties even when individual components are mutated or damaged.\nB) Degeneracy enables the evolution of complex systems through the creation of multiple, non-overlapping functional modules that can be modified independently.\nC) Degeneracy facilitates the emergence of complex behaviors by allowing for the co-option of existing genetic elements, reducing the need for new mutations.\nD) Degeneracy provides a mechanism for the selection of robustness-enhancing mutations, as systems with degenerate components are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nCorrect Answer: A) Degeneracy leads to increased functional redundancy, allowing systems to maintain their properties even when individual components are mutated or damaged.\n\nExplanation: The paper suggests that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness in complex biological systems. This is because degeneracy allows for the creation of functional redundancy, where multiple components can perform the same function, making the system more resilient to mutations or damage. This redundancy enables the system to maintain its properties even when individual components are mutated or damaged, thereby contributing to its robustness."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Role Detection in Bicycle-Sharing Networks Using Multilayer Stochastic\n  Block Models", "source": "Jane Carlen, Jaume de Dios Pont, Cassidy Mentus, Shyr-Shea Chang,\n  Stephanie Wang, Mason A.

We study the problem of recovering sparse signals from compressed linear measurements. This problem, often referred to as sparse recovery or sparse reconstruction, has generated a great deal of interest in recent years. To recover the sparse signals, we propose a new method called multiple orthogonal least squares (MOLS), which extends the well-known orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm by allowing multiple $L$ indices to be chosen per iteration. Owing to inclusion of multiple support indices in each selection, the MOLS algorithm converges in much fewer iterations and improves the computational efficiency over the conventional OLS algorithm.

Incomplete multi-view clustering is an important technique to deal with real-world incomplete multi-view data.

However, different views often have distinct incompleteness, i.e., unbalanced incompleteness, which results in strong views (low-incompleteness views) and weak views (high-incompleteness views).

Bacterial communities have rich social lives. A well-established interaction involves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the iron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with the rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and non-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used to test game theoretical predictions on the \"social dilemma\" of producers. Such an approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the public good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment. Here, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in a specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that explicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as chemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an ensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial producer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer fraction initially increases.

On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger than 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the AdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always negative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other wall gravitates upon us.

The application of Mission Critical Machine Type Communication (MC-MTC) in wireless systems is currently a hot research topic.

However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, such systems are prone to a wide range of cyber attacks.
