First, we explain the emergence of Kadomsev-Petviashvily (KP) $\\tau$-functions. This result is an extension of what we did in arXiv:1805.02761, where a symbolic correspondence between KP equations and group factors was established. In this paper we prove that integrability of the colored Alexander polynomial is due to it's relation to soliton $\\tau$-functions. Mainly, the colored Alexander polynomial is embedded in the action of the KP generating function on the soliton $\\tau$-function. Secondly, we use this correspondence to provide a rather simple combinatoric description of the group factors in term of Young diagrams, which is otherwise described in terms of chord diagrams, where no simple description is known.

By discretising space into compartments and letting system dynamics be governed by the reaction-diffusion master equation, it is possible to derive and simulate a stochastic model of reaction and diffusion on an arbitrary domain. However, there are many implementation choices involved in this process, such as the choice of discretisation and method of derivation of the diffusive jump rates, and it is not clear a priori how these affect model predictions. To shed light on this issue, in this work we explore how a variety of discretisations and method for derivation of the diffusive jump rates affect the outputs of stochastic simulations of reaction-diffusion models, in particular using Turing's model of pattern formation as a key example. We consider both static and uniformly growing domains and demonstrate that, while only minor differences are observed for simple reaction-diffusion systems, there can be vast differences in model predictions for systems that include complicated reaction kinetics, such as Turing's model of pattern formation.

This way, we are able to investigate dynamics of correlations in time and across scales (frequencies) with a model-free approach. We show that correlations indeed vary in time and across frequencies.

This approach addresses two main issues with traditional backpropagation: the weight transport problem and the update locking problem. Additionally, it relaxes computational and memory requirements, making it suitable for adaptive edge computing devices.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while DRTP addresses some biological plausibility issues, it doesn't entirely eliminate the need for backpropagation or make neural networks fully biologically plausible.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as DRTP actually aims to avoid the need for bidirectional synaptic weight transport, which is a constraint in traditional backpropagation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while DRTP does use random projections of the targets, its primary goal is not to increase classification accuracy but to provide a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost that's suitable for edge devices.

A key limitation of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), an established and powerful tool for studying atomic-scale biomolecular structure and dynamics is its poor sensitivity, samples containing in excess of 10^12 labeled biomolecules are required in typical experiments. In contrast, single molecule measurements provide improved insights into heterogeneous behaviors that can be masked by ensemble measurements and are often essential for illuminating the molecular mechanisms behind the function of a biomolecule. We report EPR measurements of a single labeled biomolecule that merge these two powerful techniques. We selectively label an individual double-stranded DNA molecule with a single nanodiamond containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and optically detect the paramagnetic resonance of NV spins in the nanodiamond probe. Analysis of the spectrum reveals that the nanodiamond probe has complete rotational freedom and that the characteristic time scale for reorientation of the nanodiamond probe is slow compared to the transverse spin relaxation time.
