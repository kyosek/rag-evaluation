In this paper, we investigate the physical-layer security for a spatial modulation (SM) based indoor visible light communication (VLC) system, which includes multiple transmitters, a legitimate receiver, and a passive eavesdropper (Eve). At the transmitters, the SM scheme is employed, i.e., only one transmitter is active at each time instant. To choose the active transmitter, a uniform selection (US) scheme is utilized. Two scenarios are considered: one is with non-negativity and average optical intensity constraints, the other is with non-negativity, average optical intensity and peak optical intensity constraints. Then, lower and upper bounds on the secrecy rate are derived for these two scenarios. Besides, the asymptotic behaviors for the derived secrecy rate bounds at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are analyzed. To further improve the secrecy performance, a channel adaptive selection (CAS) scheme and a greedy selection (GS) scheme are proposed to select the active transmitter. Numerical results show that the lower and upper bounds of the secrecy rate are tight. At high SNR, small asymptotic performance gaps exist between the derived lower and upper bounds.

Surface roughness is primary measure of pavement performance that has been associated with ride quality and vehicle operating costs.

However, it is costly to measure IRI, and for this reason, certain road classes are excluded from IRI measurements at a network level. Higher levels of distresses are generally associated with higher roughness.
