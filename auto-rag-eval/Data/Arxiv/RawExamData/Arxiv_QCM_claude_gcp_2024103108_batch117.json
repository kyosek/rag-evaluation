We report the discovery of an extreme X-ray flux rise (by a factor of > 20) of the weak-line quasar SDSS J153913.47+395423.4 (hereafter SDSS J1539+3954) at z = 1.935. SDSS J1539+3954 is the most-luminous object among radio-quiet type 1 AGNs where such dramatic X-ray variability has been observed. Before the X-ray flux rise, SDSS J1539+3954 appeared X-ray weak compared with the expectation from its UV flux; after the rise, the ratio of its X-ray flux and UV flux is consistent with the majority of the AGN population. We also present a contemporaneous HET spectrum of SDSS J1539+3954, which demonstrates that its UV continuum level remains generally unchanged despite the dramatic increase in the X-ray flux, and its C iv emission line remains weak. The dramatic change only observed in the X-ray flux is consistent with a shielding model, where a thick inner accretion disk can block our line of sight to the central X-ray source. This thick inner accretion disk can also block the nuclear ionizing photons from reaching the high-ionization broad emission-line region, so that weak high-ionization emission lines are observed. Under this scenario, the extreme X-ray variability event may be caused by slight variations in the thickness of the disk. This event might also be explained by gravitational light-bending effects in a reflection model."}, "answer": "Question: What phenomenon best explains the extreme X-ray flux rise observed in SDSS J1539+3954 while its UV continuum and C IV emission line remained largely unchanged?\n\nA) Relativistic jet formation\nB) Shielding by a thick inner accretion disk\nC) Tidal disruption event\nD) Supernova explosion in the host galaxy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Shielding by a thick inner accretion disk. This explanation is consistent with the observations reported in the text. The dramatic increase in X-ray flux (by a factor of >20) without significant changes in the UV continuum or C IV emission line strength suggests a mechanism that primarily affects the X-ray emission. The shielding model proposes that a thick inner accretion disk can block the line of sight to the central X-ray source, explaining why the quasar initially appeared X-ray weak. Slight variations in the thickness of this disk could cause extreme X-ray variability while leaving the UV continuum and broad emission lines relatively unaffected.\n\nOption A is incorrect because relativistic jet formation is typically associated with radio-loud AGNs, while SDSS J1539+3954 is described as radio-quiet.\n\nOption C is unlikely because tidal disruption events usually affect both X-ray and UV emissions and are typically transient phenomena.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a supernova in the host galaxy would not explain the extreme X-ray variability observed in the quasar's core, nor would it be consistent with the unchanged UV continuum.\n\nThe text also mentions gravitational light-bending effects in a reflection model as an alternative explanation, but the shielding model is presented as the primary hypothesis consistent with all observed features."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Heavy vector and axial-vector $D$ mesons in hot magnetized asymmetric\n  nuclear matter", "source": "Rajesh Kumar, Rahul Chhabra and Arvind Kumar", "docs_id": "2004.01379", "section": ["hep-ph", "nucl-th"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Heavy vector and axial-vector $D$ mesons in hot magnetized asymmetric\n  nuclear matter.

Adaptively weighted Fisher's method (AW-Fisher) is an effective approach to combine p-values from $K$ independent studies and to provide better biological interpretation by characterizing which studies contribute to meta-analysis. Currently, AW-Fisher suffers from lack of fast, accurate p-value computation and variability estimate of AW weights. When the number of studies $K$ is large, the $3^K - 1$ possible differential expression pattern categories can become intractable.

Points of interest (POI) recommendation has been drawn much attention recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, e.g., Foursquare and Yelp. Among the existing approaches to POI recommendation, Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective. However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems: (1) Expensive computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and potentially huge low rank matrices. (2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g., cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the computation and storage issue.

The construction of physically relevant low dimensional state models, and the design of appropriate measurements are key issues in tackling quantum state tomography for large dimensional systems.

We present extensive simulation results showing that the error is robust with respect to the choice of states of a given rank, the random selection of settings, and that the number of settings can be significantly reduced with only a negligible increase in error. We present an argument to explain these findings based on a concentration inequality for the Fisher information matrix. In the more general setup of random basis measurements we use this argument to show that for certain rank $r$ states it suffices to measure in $O(r\\log d)$ bases to achieve the average Fisher information over all bases.

The rise and spread of antibiotic resistance causes worsening medical cost and mortality especially for life-threatening bacteria infections, thereby posing a major threat to global health.

It remains unclear when individual prescribing decisions can lead to the overuse of antibiotics on the population level, and whether population optimum of antibiotic use can be reached through an adaptive social learning process that governs the evolution of prescribing norm. Here we study a behavior-disease interaction model, specifically incorporating a feedback loop between prescription behavior and resistance evolution. We identify the conditions under which antibiotic resistance can evolve as a result of the tragedy of the commons in antibiotic overuse. Furthermore, we show that fast social learning that adjusts prescribing behavior in prompt response to resistance evolution can steer out cyclic oscillations of antibiotic usage quickly towards the stable population optimum of prescribing.

Organisations are currently lacking in developing and implementing business systems in meaningful ways to motivate and engage their staff. This is particularly salient as the average employee spends eleven cumulative years of their life at work, however less than one third of the workforce are actually engaged in their duties throughout their career. Such low levels of engagement are particularly prominent with younger employees, referred to as Generation Y (GenY), who are the least engaged of all groups at work.
