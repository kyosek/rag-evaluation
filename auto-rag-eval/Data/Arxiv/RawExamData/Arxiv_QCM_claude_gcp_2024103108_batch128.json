The role of the dilaton field and its coupling to matter may result to a dilution of Dark Matter (DM) relic densities.

Dilaton field, besides this, affects relic densities through its coupling to dust which tends to decrease relic abundances. Thus two separate mechanisms compete each other resulting, in general, to a decrease of the relic density. This feature may be welcome and can rescue the situation if Direct Dark Matter experiments point towards small neutralino-nucleon cross sections, implying small neutralino annihilation rates and hence large relic densities, at least in the popular supersymmetric scenarios. In the presence of a diluting mechanism both experimental constraints can be met.

Comparison of our measurements with stochastic trajectory simulations based on sequential Langevin collisions indicate diffusive transport properties of the impurity and allows us to measure its mobility.

The autoregressive (AR) model is a widely used model to understand time series data. Traditionally, the innovation noise of the AR is modeled as Gaussian.

Another issue that frequently occurs in time series is missing values, due to system data record failure or unexpected data loss. Although there are numerous works about Gaussian AR time series with missing values, as far as we know, there does not exist any work addressing the issue of missing data for the heavy-tailed AR model.

Which of your team's possible lineups has the best chances against each of your opponents possible lineups? In order to answer this question we develop LinNet.

The nodes of this network represent the different lineups, while an edge from node j to node i exists if lineup i has outperformed lineup j. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute).

The present work proposes a multi-scale patch-based GAN approach for establishing unpaired domain translation by generating 3D medical image volumes of high resolution in a memory-efficient way. The key idea to enable memory-efficient image generation is to first generate a low-resolution version of the image followed by the generation of patches of constant sizes but successively growing resolutions. To avoid patch artifacts and incorporate global information, the patch generation is conditioned on patches from previous resolution scales. Those multi-scale GANs are trained to generate realistically looking images from image sketches in order to perform an unpaired domain translation. This allows to preserve the topology of the test data and generate the appearance of the training domain data. The evaluation of the domain translation scenarios is performed on brain MRIs of size 155x240x240 and thorax CTs of size up to 512x512x512.

The study found that productivity gains in Chinese firms were not due to super-star firms, but rather resulted from a systematic shift of the entire labor productivity distribution. The characteristics of the distribution remained mostly unchanged, except for an emerging right-skew in the distribution of labor productivity change.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study explicitly states that gains were not due to super-star firms. Answer B is wrong because significant productivity gains were observed, not just marginal improvements.
