An atomic monoid $M$ is called a length-factorial monoid (or an other-half-factorial monoid) if for each non-invertible element $x \\in M$ no two distinct factorizations of $x$ have the same length. The notion of length-factoriality was introduced by Coykendall and Smith in 2011 as a dual of the well-studied notion of half-factoriality. They proved that in the setting of integral domains, length-factoriality can be taken as an alternative definition of a unique factorization domain. However, being a length-factorial monoid is in general weaker than being a factorial monoid (i.e., a unique factorization monoid). Here we further investigate length-factoriality. First, we offer two characterizations of a length-factorial monoid $M$, and we use such characterizations to describe the set of Betti elements and obtain a formula for the catenary degree of $M$.

To overcome these difficulties, this study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled with time series elements according to our algorithm. The accuracy of the classification of images from the MNIST-10 database is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The novelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing the input information in the res-ervoir.

First, we apply our methods in the context of robust linear programming, providing a method for reducing conservatism in intuitive ways that encode economically realistic modeling assumptions.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a contact angle of a soft silicone substrate on rigid silica spheres that depends on the surface functionalization but not the sphere size.

Most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight COVID-19 including wearing masks, social distancing, virus testing, contact tracing, and vaccination. However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic pandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in sub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome.

In this paper we propose a new four-parameters distribution with increasing, decreasing, bathtub-shaped and unimodal failure rate, called as the exponentiated Weibull-Poisson (EWP) distribution. The new distribution arises on a latent complementary risk problem base and is obtained by compounding exponentiated Weibull (EW) and Poisson distributions. This distribution contains several lifetime sub-models such as: generalized exponential-Poisson (GEP), complementary Weibull-Poisson (CWP), complementary exponential-Poisson (CEP), exponentiated Rayleigh-Poisson (ERP) and Rayleigh-Poisson (RP) distributions. We obtain several properties of the new distribution such as its probability density function, its reliability and failure rate functions, quantiles and moments. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure via a EM-algorithm is presented in this paper. Sub-models of the EWP distribution are studied in details. In the end, Applications to two real data sets are given to show the flexibility and potentiality of the new distribution."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary motivation behind the development of the Exponentiated Weibull-Poisson (EWP) distribution, and what are some of its key features?\n\n**A)** The EWP distribution is proposed to model the failure rate of complex systems, which exhibit increasing, decreasing, bathtub-shaped, and unimodal failure rates.
