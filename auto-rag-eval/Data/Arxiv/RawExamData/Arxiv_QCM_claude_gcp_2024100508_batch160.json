It is an open question how well tensor network states in the form of an infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) tensor network can approximate gapless quantum states of matter. Here we address this issue for two different physical scenarios: i) a conformally invariant $(2+1)d$ quantum critical point in the incarnation of the transverse field Ising model on the square lattice and ii) spontaneously broken continuous symmetries with gapless Goldstone modes exemplified by the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models on the square lattice. We find that the energetically best wave functions display {\\em finite} correlation lengths and we introduce a powerful finite correlation length scaling framework for the analysis of such finite-$D$ iPEPS states. The framework is important i) to understand the mild limitations of the finite-$D$ iPEPS manifold in representing Lorentz-invariant, gapless many body quantum states and ii) to put forward a practical scheme in which the finite correlation length $\\xi(D)$ combined with field theory inspired formulae can be used to extrapolate the data to infinite correlation length, i.e. to the thermodynamic limit.

To explore the correlation between the structure and the superconductivity, the high-pressure structure evolution of CrAs was investigated using angle dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD) method with small steps of ~0.1 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) up to 1.8 GPa. In the pressure range covered by our current experiment, the structure of CrAs keeps stable. However, the lattice parameters exhibit anomalous compression behaviors.

In this paper, we introduce and examine a fractional linear birth--death process $N_{\\nu}(t)$, $t>0$, whose fractionality is obtained by replacing the time derivative with a fractional derivative in the system of difference-differential equations governing the state probabilities $p_k^{\\nu}(t)$, $t>0$, $k\\geq0$. We present a subordination relationship connecting $N_{\\nu}(t)$, $t>0$, with the classical birth--death process $N(t)$, $t>0$, by means of the time process $T_{2\\nu}(t)$, $t>0$, whose distribution is related to a time-fractional diffusion equation. We obtain explicit formulas for the extinction probability $p_0^{\\nu}(t)$ and the state probabilities $p_k^{\\nu}(t)$, $t>0$, $k\\geq1$, in the three relevant cases $\\lambda>\\mu$, $\\lambda<\\mu$, $\\lambda=\\mu$ (where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are, respectively, the birth and death rates) and discuss their behaviour in specific situations. We highlight the connection of the fractional linear birth--death process with the fractional pure birth process.

This paper proposes a generative model, the latent Dirichlet hidden Markov models (LDHMM), for characterizing a database of sequential behaviors (sequences).

These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E and M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and partially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions.
