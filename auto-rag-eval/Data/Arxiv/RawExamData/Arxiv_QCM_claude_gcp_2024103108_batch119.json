To reconcile the differing objectives, we introduce posted machine prices. The selfish job seeks to minimize the sum of its completion time on the machine and the posted price for the machine.

The hierarchical structure of production planning has the advantage of assigning different decision variables to their respective time horizons and therefore ensures their manageability.

One problem that occurs is that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences.

The study found that on average, the 43 GHz v=1 line is brighter than the 86 GHz v=1 line by a factor of 1.36+/-0.15.

Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA structural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting only of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity.
