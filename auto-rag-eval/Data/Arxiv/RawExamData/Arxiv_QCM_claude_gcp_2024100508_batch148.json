We present the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey (ATATS), a multi-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz. The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408 sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam. We compare the catalog generated from this 12-epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure source positions to better than ~20 arcsec. For sources above the ATATS completeness limit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSS sources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine the effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between ATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect no transients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS, and place a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 per square degree.

It has been shown that well-known spectral graph kernel methods assume that the underlying random process over a graph is stationary.

Bartik regressions use locations' differential exposure to nationwide sector-level shocks as an instrument to estimate the effect of a location-level treatment on an outcome. In the canonical Bartik design, locations' differential exposure to industry-level employment shocks are used as an instrument to measure the effect of their employment evolution on their wage evolution. Some recent papers studying Bartik designs have assumed that the sector-level shocks are exogenous and all have the same expectation. This second assumption may sometimes be implausible. For instance, there could be industries whose employment is more likely to grow than that of other industries. We replace that second assumption by parallel trends assumptions. Under our assumptions, Bartik regressions identify weighted sums of location-specific effects, with weights that may be negative. Accordingly, such regressions may be misleading in the presence of heterogeneous effects, an issue that was not present under the assumptions maintained in previous papers. Estimating the weights attached to Bartik regressions is a way to assess their robustness to heterogeneous effects.

The research suggests that under the new assumptions (which replace the assumption that all sector-level shocks have the same expectation with parallel trends assumptions), Bartik regressions identify weighted sums of location-specific effects.

This means that in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects across locations, the Bartik regression results could be misleading, as they might not accurately represent the true effect for any particular location or the average effect across all locations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the research doesn't claim that Bartik regressions always produce biased estimates or that sector-level shocks are necessarily endogenous.\n\nAnswer C is too strong and specific.

It also doesn't specifically test for weak monotonicity at all treatment levels.\n\nOption D is incorrect because categorizing the continuous variables loses information and a chi-square test doesn't directly test for monotonicity.\n\nThe Cram\u00e9r-von Mises-type test (Option C) is the most appropriate as it's designed specifically for this type of analysis with continuous treatments and can test for weak monotonicity across all treatment levels."}, "42": {"documentation": {"title": "Neural correlates of flow using auditory evoked potential suppression", "source": "Kyongsik Yun, Saeran Doh, Elisa Carrus, Daw-An Wu, Shinsuke Shimojo", "docs_id": "1711.06967", "section": ["q-bio.NC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Neural correlates of flow using auditory evoked potential suppression. \"Flow\" is a hyper-engaged state of consciousness most commonly described in athletics, popularly termed \"being in the zone.\" Quantitative research into flow has been hampered by the disruptive nature of gathering subjective reports.

In this work, we aim to identify the optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple network model of the human brain.

Based on the BioBricks standard, restriction synthesis is a novel catabolic iterative DNA synthesis method that utilizes endonucleases to synthesize a query sequence from a reference sequence. In this work, the reference sequence is built from shorter subsequences by classifying them as applicable or inapplicable for the synthesis method using three different machine learning methods: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), random forest, and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Before applying these methods to the data, a series of feature selection, curation, and reduction steps are applied to create an accurate and representative feature space. Following these preprocessing steps, three different pipelines are proposed to classify subsequences based on their nucleotide sequence and other relevant features corresponding to the restriction sites of over 200 endonucleases. The sensitivity using SVMs, random forest, and CNNs are 94.9%, 92.7%, 91.4%, respectively.
