We consider the problem of statistical inference in a parametric finite Markov chain model and develop a robust estimator of the parameters defining the transition probabilities via minimization of a suitable (empirical) version of the popular density power divergence. Based on a long sequence of observations from a first-order stationary Markov chain, we have defined the minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) of the underlying parameter and rigorously derived its asymptotic and robustness properties under appropriate conditions. Performance of the MDPDEs is illustrated theoretically as well as empirically for some common examples of finite Markov chain models. Its applications in robust testing of statistical hypotheses are also discussed along with (parametric) comparison of two Markov chain sequences. Several directions for extending the MDPDE and related inference are also briefly discussed for multiple sequences of Markov chains, higher order Markov chains and non-stationary Markov chains with time-dependent transition probabilities.

We have success proving algebraic results in the general setting of symmetric monoidal and semiring $\\infty$-categories, which categorify abelian groups and rings, respectively.

Evaluation results obtained through said methodology are then used as a proxy to predict which system will perform better in an online setting.

The influence of nuclear isospin mixing on parity-violating elastic electron scattering is studied for the even-even, N=Z nuclei 12C, 24Mg, 28Si, and 32S. Their ground-state wave functions have been obtained using a self-consistent axially-symmetric mean-field approximation with density-dependent effective two-body Skyrme interactions. Some differences from previous shell-model calculations appear for the isovector Coulomb form factors which play a role in determining the parity-violating asymmetry. To gain an understanding of how these differences arise, the results have been expanded in a spherical harmonic oscillator basis. Results are obtained not only within the plane-wave Born approximation, but also using the distorted-wave Born approximation for comparison with potential future experimental studies of parity-violating electron scattering. To this end, for each nucleus the focus is placed on kinematic ranges where the signal (isospin-mixing effects on the parity-violating asymmetry) and the experimental figure-of-merit are maximized. Strangeness contributions to the asymmetry are also briefly discussed, since they and the isospin mixing contributions may play comparable roles for the nuclei being studied at the low momentum transfers of interest in the present work."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary goal of the study on nuclear isospin mixing and elastic parity-violating electron scattering, and what is the significance of the results obtained in the distorted-wave Born approximation?\n\nA) To investigate the effects of nuclear isospin mixing on parity-violating electron scattering in even-even nuclei, with the primary goal of improving experimental studies of parity-violating electron scattering.\nB) To calculate the isovector Coulomb form factors for even-even nuclei using a self-consistent axially-symmetric mean-field approximation, with the primary goal of understanding the differences from previous shell-model calculations.\nC) To expand the results in a spherical harmonic oscillator basis to gain a deeper understanding of the isospin-mixing effects on the parity-violating asymmetry, with the primary goal of maximizing the signal and experimental figure-of-merit for future experimental studies.\nD) To discuss the role of strangeness contributions to the asymmetry in comparison to isospin mixing contributions, with the primary goal of understanding the potential impact on experimental studies of parity-violating electron scattering.\n\nCorrect Answer: A) To investigate the effects of nuclear isospin mixing on parity-violating electron scattering in even-even nuclei, with the primary goal of improving experimental studies of parity-violating electron scattering.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A) because the study aims to investigate the effects of nuclear isospin mixing on parity-violating electron scattering in even-even nuclei, which is a crucial aspect of improving experimental studies of parity-violating electron scattering.

The celebrated van der Waals model describes simple fluids in the thermodynamic limit and predicts the existence of a critical point associated to the gas-liquid phase transition. However the behaviour of critical isotherms according to the equation of state, where a gas-liquid phase transition occurs, significantly departs from experimental observations. The correct critical isotherms are heuristically re-established via the Maxwell equal areas rule. A long standing open problem in mean field theory is concerned with the analytic description of van der Waals isotherms for a finite size system that is consistent, in the thermodynamic limit, with the Maxwell prescription. Inspired by the theory of nonlinear conservation laws, we propose a novel mean field approach, based on statistical mechanics, that allows to calculate the van der Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles $N$. Our partition function naturally extends to the whole space of thermodynamic variables, reproduces, in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to \\infty$, the classical results outside the critical region and automatically encodes Maxwell's prescription. We show that isothermal curves evolve in the space of thermodynamic variables like nonlinear breaking waves and the criticality is explained as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock."}, "answer": "Here is the difficult multi-form question:\n\nWhat is the underlying mechanism that explains the formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock in the van der Waals model, and how does it relate to the Maxwell equal areas rule?\n\nA) The van der Waals model predicts a phase transition at a critical point, where the isotherms deviate significantly from experimental observations.\nB) The Maxwell equal areas rule is a heuristic approach that re-establishes the correct critical isotherms, but does not provide an analytic description of van der Waals isotherms for finite-size systems.\nC) The proposed novel mean field approach, based on statistical mechanics, allows for the calculation of the van der Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles, and explains the criticality as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock.\nD) The van der Waals model is a simple fluid model that describes the behavior of fluids in the thermodynamic limit, but does not account for the complexities of finite-size systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The proposed novel mean field approach, based on statistical mechanics, allows for the calculation of the van der Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles, and explains the criticality as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) because the novel mean field approach, as described in the paper, provides a statistical mechanics framework for calculating the van der Waals partition function for finite-size systems. This approach explains the criticality as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock, which is a key concept in the paper.
