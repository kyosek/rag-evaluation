We also point out the subtle differences between global and local metrics, and show that in many cases the global descriptions are far more complicated than discussed earlier. We determine the full global description in type I/heterotic theory. In type IIA, our analysis gives rise to a local non-Kahler metric whose global description involves a particular orientifold action with gauge fluxes localised on branes. We are also able to identify the three form fields that allow for a smooth flop in the M-theory lift.

Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel, which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian assumption are not robust.
