We present a new method for inferring species trees from multi-copy gene trees. Our method is based on a generalization of the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees), i.e., gene trees in which multiple leaves can have the same label. Unlike most previous phylogenetic methods using gene trees, this method does not assume that gene tree incongruence is caused by a single, specific biological process, such as gene duplication and loss, deep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute the RF distance between two mul-trees, but it is easy to calculate the generalized RF distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled tree. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the RF supertree problem for mul-trees (MulRF), which takes a collection of mul-trees and constructs a species tree that minimizes the total RF distance from the input mul-trees. We present a fast heuristic algorithm for the MulRF supertree problem. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the MulRF method produces more accurate species trees than gene tree parsimony methods when incongruence is caused by gene tree error, duplications and losses, and/or lateral gene transfer. Furthermore, the MulRF heuristic runs quickly on data sets containing hundreds of trees with up to a hundred taxa."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The MulRF method for inferring species trees from multi-copy gene trees is advantageous because:\n\nA) It assumes gene tree incongruence is caused by a single, specific biological process.\nB) It requires less computational power than other phylogenetic methods.\nC) It can handle gene tree incongruence caused by multiple biological processes.\nD) It always produces perfectly accurate species trees.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The MulRF method is advantageous because it can handle gene tree incongruence caused by multiple biological processes.

The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking.

Computing expected predictions of discriminative models is a fundamental task in machine learning that appears in many interesting applications such as fairness, handling missing values, and data analysis. Unfortunately, computing expectations of a discriminative model with respect to a probability distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such as logistic regression and a naive Bayes distribution. In this paper, we identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations, as well as moments of any order, of the latter with respect to the former in case of regression. Specifically, we consider expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that support tractable probabilistic inference. Moreover, we exploit the tractable computation of high-order moments to derive an algorithm to approximate the expectations for classification scenarios in which exact computations are intractable. Our framework to compute expected predictions allows for handling of missing data during prediction time in a principled and accurate way and enables reasoning about the behavior of discriminative models. We empirically show our algorithm to consistently outperform standard imputation techniques on a variety of datasets.

In diverse biological applications, particle tracking of passive microscopic species has become the experimental measurement of choice -- when either the materials are of limited volume, or so soft as to deform uncontrollably when manipulated by traditional instruments.

However, MSD measurements are typically contaminated by complex and interacting sources of instrumental noise.

First, if we look for a fixed decay parameter for the full sample, the results are in agreement with the RiskMetrics suggestion for 1-month forecasting. In addition, we provide the full-sample optimal decay parameter for the weekly and bi-weekly forecasting horizon cases, confirming two facts: i) the optimal value is as a function of the forecasting horizon, and ii) for lower forecasting horizons the short-term memory gains importance. In a second way, we also evaluate the forecasting performance of EWMA, but this time using the optimal time-varying decay parameter which minimizes the in-sample variance-covariance estimator, arriving at better accuracy than the use of a fixed-full-sample optimal parameter."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the EWMA volatility model, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the optimal decay parameter (\u03bb)?\n\nA) The optimal \u03bb is constant across all forecasting horizons and should always be set to the RiskMetrics suggestion.\n\nB) For shorter forecasting horizons, long-term memory becomes more important in determining the optimal \u03bb.\n\nC) The optimal \u03bb is solely a function of the asset class and does not depend on the forecasting horizon.\n\nD) A time-varying \u03bb that minimizes the in-sample variance-covariance estimator generally provides better forecasting accuracy than a fixed full-sample optimal \u03bb.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the study shows that the optimal \u03bb varies with the forecasting horizon.\nOption B is the opposite of what the document states; for shorter horizons, short-term memory gains importance.\nOption C is not supported by the document, which emphasizes the importance of the forecasting horizon in determining optimal \u03bb.\nOption D is correct according to the last sentence of the passage, which states that using a time-varying optimal \u03bb results in better accuracy than a fixed full-sample optimal parameter."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Dynamics of spherical space debris of different sizes falling to Earth", "source": "Judit Sl\\'iz-Balogh, D\\'aniel Horv\\'ath, R\\'obert Szab\\'o, G\\'abor\n  Horv\\'ath", "docs_id": "2006.00853", "section": ["astro-ph.EP", "physics.ao-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Dynamics of spherical space debris of different sizes falling to Earth. Space debris larger than 1 cm can damage space instruments and impact Earth.
