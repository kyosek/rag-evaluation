Heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC give access to the medium-induced suppression patterns of heavy-flavored single inclusive hadron spectra at high transverse momentum. This opens novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of the medium produced in the collision. In this note, we point out that the capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic projectile is an independent signature, which may differ for different media at the same density. In particular, while the mass hierarchy (i.e., the projectile mass dependence) of radiative energy loss depends solely on a property of the projectile, the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss depends significantly on properties of the medium. By varying these properties in a class of models, we find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be modified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative parton energy loss. This may help to disentangle the relative strengths of radiative and collisional contributions to jet quenching, and it may be employed to constrain properties of the produced QCD medium beyond its density."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between radiative and collisional energy loss in heavy ion collisions, according to the given text?\n\nA) Both radiative and collisional energy loss exhibit the same mass hierarchy, which is solely dependent on the properties of the projectile.\n\nB) The mass hierarchy of radiative energy loss depends on medium properties, while collisional energy loss depends on projectile properties.\n\nC) The mass hierarchy of radiative energy loss depends on projectile properties, while collisional energy loss can vary significantly based on medium properties.\n\nD) Both radiative and collisional energy loss have mass hierarchies that can be inverted by manipulating projectile properties.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Heavy fermion pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation is a fundamental process in hadron physics and is of considerable interest for various phenomena.

The PMC provides a systematic, unambiguous method for determining the renormalization scales of the QCD coupling constant for single-scale and multiple-scale applications. The resulting predictions eliminate any renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities, eliminate the factorial renormalon divergences, and are consistent with the requirements of the renormalization group.

For this purpose, we study a large number of realisations of the potential; we find the nature of the inflationary trajectory to be very consistent despite the complex construction. Inflation is always canonical and occurs in the vicinity of an inflection point. Extending the transport method to non-slow-roll and to calculate the running, we obtain distributions for observables. The spectral index is typically blue and the running positive, putting the model under moderate pressure from WMAP7 constraints. The local f_NL and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically unobservably small, though we find approximately 0.5% of realisations to give observably large local f_NL. Approximating the potential as sum-separable, we are able to give fully analytic explanations for the trends in observed behaviour. Finally we find the model suffers from the persistence of isocurvature perturbations, which can be expected to cause further evolution of adiabatic perturbations after inflation.

Such a trap has not been previously considered for Fundamental Interaction studies and exhibits potentially very significant advantages over other schemes.

The passage explicitly mentions several advantages of using an Electrostatic Ion Beam Trap (EIBT) for fundamental interaction studies, including \"improved injection efficiency of the radionuclide under study, an extended field-free region, ion-beam kinematics for better efficiency and ease-of-operation and the potential for a much larger solid angle for the electron and recoiling atom counters.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention higher energy collisions.

We have grown and studied high quality SrRuO3 films grown by MBE as well as PLD. By changing the oxygen activity during deposition we were able to make SrRuO3 samples that were stoichiometric (low oxygen activity) or with ruthenium vacancies (high oxygen activity). Samples with strontium vacancies were found impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO2. The volume of the unit cell of SrRuO3 becomes larger as more ruthenium vacancies are introduced. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and room temperature resistivity were found to systematically depend on the volume of the unit cell and therefore on the amount of ruthenium vacancies. The RRR varied from ~30 for stoichiometric samples to less than two for samples that were very ruthenium poor. The room temperature resistivity varied from 190 microOhm cm for stoichoimetric samples to over 300 microOhm cm for very ruthenium poor samples. UPS spectra show a shift of weight from the coherent peak to the incoherent peak around the Fermi level when samples have more ruthenium vacancies. Core level XPS spectra of the ruthenium 3d lines show a strong screened part in the case of stoichiometric samples. This screened part disappears when ruthenium vacancies are introduced.

Positive feedback trading, which buys when prices rise and sells when prices fall, has long been criticized for being destabilizing as it moves prices away from the fundamentals. Motivated by the relationship between positive feedback trading and investors cognitive bias, this paper provides a quantitative measurement of the bias based on the conditional estimates of diffusion processes. We prove the asymptotic properties of the estimates, which helps to interpret the investment behaviors that if a feedback trader finds a security perform better than his expectation, he will expect the future return to be higher, while in the long term, this bias will converge to zero. Furthermore, the observed deviations between the return forecast and its realized value lead to adaptive expectations in reality, for which we raise an exponential smoothing model as an adjustment method. In the empirical study on the stock market in China, we show the effectiveness of the ES method in bringing the biased expectation closer to the fundamental level, and suggest that the feedback traders, who are often over-optimistic about the return, are likely to suffer from downside risk and aggravate the speculative bubbles in the market."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the research on positive feedback trading, which of the following statements best describes the long-term behavior of feedback traders' bias and its implications for market dynamics?\n\nA) The bias of feedback traders increases over time, leading to more stable market conditions.\n\nB) The bias converges to zero in the long term, but can still contribute to speculative bubbles in the short term.\n\nC) Feedback traders' bias remains constant, having no significant impact on market stability.\n\nD) The bias decreases linearly over time, resulting in more accurate price discovery.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

In a landmark contribution to the structural vector autoregression (SVARs) literature, Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner, and Zha (2010, `Structural Vector Autoregressions: Theory of Identification and Algorithms for Inference,' Review of Economic Studies) shows a necessary and sufficient condition for equality restrictions to globally identify the structural parameters of a SVAR.

However, this note shows by counterexample that this condition is not sufficient for global identification. Analytical investigation of the counterexample clarifies why their sufficiency claim breaks down. The problem with the rank condition is that it allows for the possibility that restrictions are redundant, in the sense that one or more restrictions may be implied by other restrictions, in which case the implied restriction contains no identifying information.

The key issue identified in the note is that the rank condition proposed by Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2010) allows for the possibility of redundant restrictions.
