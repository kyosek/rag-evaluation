Detection of rare variants by resequencing is important for the identification of individuals carrying disease variants. Rapid sequencing by new technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it is still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve cost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which enable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals. However, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals in a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases. We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach, which is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental procedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of rare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially in situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual. Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance performance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing costs. For example, when targeting a small enough genomic region (~100 base-pairs) and using only ~10 sequencing lanes and ~10 distinct barcodes, one can recover the identity of 4 rare allele carriers out of a population of over 4000 individuals."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A research team wants to identify rare allele carriers in a population of 3000 individuals for a disease-associated variant.

While this is smaller than 4000, the reduction in resources makes it unlikely that the project would be feasible as described. Option A is incorrect because it overestimates the capability given the resources. Option B is incorrect because reducing the genomic region alone wouldn't compensate for the reduced resources and large population. Option D is closer but still likely overestimates the capability.

This paper proposes a deep learning approach to a class of active sensing problems in wireless communications in which an agent sequentially interacts with an environment over a predetermined number of time frames to gather information in order to perform a sensing or actuation task for maximizing some utility function. In such an active learning setting, the agent needs to design an adaptive sensing strategy sequentially based on the observations made so far. To tackle such a challenging problem in which the dimension of historical observations increases over time, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to exploit the temporal correlations in the sequence of observations and to map each observation to a fixed-size state information vector. We then use a deep neural network (DNN) to map the LSTM state at each time frame to the design of the next measurement step. Finally, we employ another DNN to map the final LSTM state to the desired solution.
