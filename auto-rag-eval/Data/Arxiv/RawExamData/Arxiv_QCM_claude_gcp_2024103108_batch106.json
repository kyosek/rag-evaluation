The transport of cargo particles which are pulled by several molecular motors in a cooperative manner is studied theoretically. The transport properties depend primarily on the maximal number, $N$, of motor molecules that may pull simultaneously on the cargo particle. Since each motor must unbind from the filament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the actual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between zero and $N$. An increase in the maximal number $N$ leads to a strong increase of the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the cargo is pulled by up to $N$ kinesin motors, e.g., the walking distance is estimated to be $5^{N-1}/N$ micrometers which implies that seven or eight kinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the centimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load force, this force is shared between the motors which provides a nontrivial motor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity relationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the instantenous velocity is shifted towards smaller values, becomes broader, and develops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental data and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in vitro experiments."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A cargo particle is being transported by multiple kinesin motors.

We demonstrate that expected scores are not suitable to distinguish genuine tail properties in a very strong sense.

While a scale mixture of normal distributions with known mixing distribution for the random effects has been found to be effective in presence of outliers, the solution depends on the mixing distribution. As a possible alternative solution to the problem, a two-component normal mixture model has been proposed based on noninformative priors on the model variance parameters, regression coefficients and the mixing probability.

The two-component normal mixture alternative is proposed to deal with the problem of outliers in the random effects of small area means. The standard Fay-Herriot model, which assumes normality of random effects, tends to overestimate the random effects variance in the presence of outliers. This overestimation leads to less than ideal shrinkage towards synthetic regression predictions and inhibits borrowing of information across areas.\n\nThe two-component mixture model provides a robust approach that can handle extreme values in random effects without severely inflating the variance estimate. This allows for better shrinkage to the synthetic part of the model and improved borrowing of information across areas, which is crucial in small area estimation.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the primary focus is not on heteroscedasticity or general non-normality, but specifically on dealing with outliers in random effects. Option D is also incorrect because while the method may indirectly help with small sample sizes by improving information borrowing, this is not the primary purpose of the approach as described in the documentation."}, "33": {"documentation": {"title": "Obvious Manipulability of Voting Rules", "source": "Haris Aziz and Alexander Lam", "docs_id": "2111.01983", "section": ["cs.GT", "cs.AI", "cs.MA", "econ.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Obvious Manipulability of Voting Rules.

Finally, it explicitly states that a limit of such F-theory compactifications can return us to the Type IIB orientifold models.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the M-theory models are said to yield similar spectra to some orientifold models, not completely different ones. Option B is wrong because the text specifically mentions that D5-branes behaving like small instantons and extra tensor multiplets are non-perturbative phenomena from the heterotic string theory perspective.

The application of Mission Critical Machine Type Communication (MC-MTC) in wireless systems is currently a hot research topic. Wireless systems are considered to provide numerous advantages over wired systems in e.g. industrial applications such as closed loop control. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, such systems are prone to a wide range of cyber attacks. These range from passive eavesdropping attacks to active attacks like data manipulation or masquerade attacks. Therefore it is necessary to provide reliable and efficient security mechanisms. Some of the most important security issues in such a system are to ensure integrity as well as authenticity of exchanged messages over the air between communicating devices. In the present work, an approach on how to achieve this goal in MC-MTC systems based on Physical Layer Security (PHYSEC) is presented. A new method that clusters channel estimates of different transmitters based on a Gaussian Mixture Model is applied for that purpose.

These methods manipulate the training data in order to improve the out of sample patterns fitting. When applied with the static subset selection method using a single training data sample, GP could generate forecasting models which are not adapted to some out of sample fitness cases. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of generated GP patterns, dynamic subset selection methods are introduced to the GP algorithm allowing a regular change of the training sample during evolution. Four dynamic training-subset selection methods are proposed based on random, sequential or adaptive subset selection. The latest approach uses an adaptive subset weight measuring the sample difficulty according to the fitness cases errors. Using real data from SP500 index options, these techniques are compared to the static subset selection method.

This procedure has the advantage of preserving the asymptotic character of the continuum wave function and hence the elastic observables are unaffected.

We consider a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with deterministic subthreshold dynamics and a firing threshold that evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The formulation of this minimal model is motivated by the experimentally observed widespread variation of neural firing thresholds. We show numerically that the mean first passage time can depend non-monotonically on the noise amplitude. For sufficiently large values of the correlation time of the stochastic threshold the mean first passage time is maximal for non-vanishing noise. We provide an explanation for this effect by analytically transforming the original model into a first passage time problem for Brownian motion. This transformation also allows for a perturbative calculation of the first passage time histograms. In turn this provides quantitative insights into the mechanisms that lead to the non-monotonic behaviour of the mean first passage time. The perturbation expansion is in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations. The approach developed here can be applied to any deterministic subthreshold dynamics and any Gauss-Markov processes for the firing threshold.
