Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an important data assimilation method for high dimensional geophysical systems. Efficient implementation of EnKF in practice often involves the localization technique, which updates each component using only information within a local radius. This paper rigorously analyzes the local EnKF (LEnKF) for linear systems, and shows that the filter error can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, as long as 1) the sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the local radius; 2) the forecast covariance matrix admits a stable localized structure. In particular, this indicates that with small system and observation noises, the filter error will be accurate in long time even if the initialization is not. The analysis also reveals an intrinsic inconsistency caused by the localization technique, and a stable localized structure is necessary to control this inconsistency. While this structure is usually taken for granted for the operation of LEnKF, it can also be rigorously proved for linear systems with sparse local observations and weak local interactions. These theoretical results are also validated by numerical implementation of LEnKF on a simple stochastic turbulence in two dynamical regimes."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary condition under which the filter error of the Local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, according to the analysis presented in the paper?\n\nA) The sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the local radius.\nB) The sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the observation noise.\nC) The sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the forecast covariance matrix.\nD) The sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the system noise.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the local radius.\n\n**Explanation:** According to the analysis presented in the paper, the filter error of LEnKF can be dominated by the ensemble covariance if two conditions are met: (1) the sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the local radius, and (2) the forecast covariance matrix admits a stable localized structure.
