Recent research has shown that piecewise smooth (PS) functions can be approximated by piecewise linear functions with second order error in the distance to a given reference point.

For local bijectivity of the linearization at a root, a radius of quadratic convergence was explicitly calculated in terms of local Lipschitz constants of the underlying PS function. In the present work we relax the criterium of local bijectivity of the linearization to local openness. For this purpose a weak implicit function theorem is proved via local mapping degree theory.

The recent success of brain-inspired deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex, high-level visual tasks has led to rising expectations for their potential to match the human visual system. However, DNNs exhibit idiosyncrasies that suggest their visual representation and processing might be substantially different from human vision. One limitation of DNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, input images on which subtle, carefully designed noises are added to fool a machine classifier. The robustness of the human visual system against adversarial examples is potentially of great importance as it could uncover a key mechanistic feature that machine vision is yet to incorporate. In this study, we compare the visual representations of white- and black-box adversarial examples in DNNs and humans by leveraging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find a small but significant difference in representation patterns for different (i.e. white- versus black- box) types of adversarial examples for both humans and DNNs.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"GO-pretreated astrocytes promote the functional maturation of co-cultured primary neurons by inducing an increase in intrinsic excitability and in the density of GABAergic synapses.\" This outcome suggests that GO treatment of astrocytes could have beneficial effects on neuronal function, which would be desirable in treating a neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation indicates that GO upregulates inward-rectifying K+ channels, not decreases their expression. This upregulation is associated with improved astrocyte function in controlling extracellular homeostasis.\n\nOption B is also incorrect, as the documentation states that GO increases Na+-dependent glutamate uptake, which is linked to improved astrocyte capacity to control extracellular homeostasis.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that graphene-exposed astrocytes acquire a more differentiated morphological phenotype with extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements, not minimal changes.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a hypothetical research scenario, and evaluate which outcome would best support the potential therapeutic use of GO in treating astrocyte dysfunction.

Training is performed in an interleaved fashion; some batches undergo the regular forward and backpropagation passes with original network parameters, whereas others undergo a forward pass with pooled filters and downsampled inputs. Since pooling is differentiable, the gradients of the pooled filters propagate to the original network parameters for a standard parameter update.

To achieve the transformation we built a full pipeline named `\\textit{Audeo}' containing three components. We first translate the video frames of the keyboard and the musician hand movements into raw mechanical musical symbolic representation Piano-Roll (Roll) for each video frame which represents the keys pressed at each time step. We then adapt the Roll to be amenable for audio synthesis by including temporal correlations. This step turns out to be critical for meaningful audio generation. As a last step, we implement Midi synthesizers to generate realistic music. \\textit{Audeo} converts video to audio smoothly and clearly with only a few setup constraints.

We investigate the hadron-quark phase transition at finite density and in the presence of a magnetic field taking into account the anisotropy created by a uniform magnetic field in the system's equations of state. We find a new anisotropic equilibrium condition that will drive along the boundary between the two phases the first-order phase transition that takes place by increasing the baryonic chemical potential at zero temperature. It is shown that the magnetic field is mildly boosted after the system transition from the hadronic to the quark phase. Each phase is found to be paramagnetic with higher magnetic susceptibility in the quark phase. It is proved from first principles that the speed of sound becomes anisotropic in the presence of a magnetic field, with different values in the directions along and transverse to the field direction.

This becomes even more challenging in dynamic scenarios where the generation of pathways can quickly become a combinatorial problem.

The main goal of this work is a short description and a qualitative analysis of experimental data on low-frequency nonlinear resonances revealed in a nonautonomous ruby phaser. Under phaser pumping modulation near these resonances, an unusual kind of self-organized motions in the ruby spin-phonon system was observed by me in 1984 for the first time. The original technique of optical-wavelength microwave-frequency acoustic stimulated emission (SE) detection and microwave-frequency power spectra (MFPS) analysis was used in these experiments (description of the technique see: D.N.Makovetskii, Cand. Sci. Diss., Kharkov, 1983). The real time evolution of MFPS was studied using this technique at scales up to several hours. The phenomenon of the self-organized periodic alternation of SE phonon modes was experimentally revealed at hyperlow frequencies from about 0.1 Hz to 0.001 Hz and less (for the phaser pumping modulation at approximately 10 Hz). The nature of this phenomenon was investigated by me later in details (see: arXiv:cond-mat/0303188v1 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0410460v1 ; Tech. Phys. Letters, 2001, Vol.27, No.6, P.511-514 ; Tech.

This behavior cannot be explained by simple linear relationships or classical resonance effects, which rules out options A and B.\n\nThe phenomenon was consistently observed and studied over extended periods (up to several hours), using specialized techniques for optical-wavelength microwave-frequency acoustic stimulated emission detection and microwave-frequency power spectra analysis. This level of reproducibility and the use of advanced measurement techniques strongly suggest that the effect is not a measurement artifact, eliminating option D.\n\nThe complexity arises from the significant mismatch between the input modulation frequency and the observed response frequency, implying the presence of intricate feedback mechanisms and possibly multiple interacting timescales within the spin-phonon system. This behavior is characteristic of nonlinear systems exhibiting self-organization, which can lead to emergent phenomena not predictable from simple component interactions.\n\nUnderstanding this phenomenon requires integrating concepts from nonlinear dynamics, solid-state physics, and laser physics, making it a prime example of the complex behaviors that can arise in optical-wavelength phonon lasers.

Despite attempts to relax these assumptions in the context of MHD turbulence, the central idea of turbulence generation persists.

Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration.
