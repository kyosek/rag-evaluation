The polarization of light is utilized in many technologies throughout science and engineering. The ability to transform one state of polarization to another is a key enabling technology.

Simple polarizers change the intensity depending on the input state and can only output a fixed polarized state, while polarization rotators rotates the input Stokes vector in the 3D Stokes space. We experimentally demonstrate an all-optical input-agnostic polarization transformer (AI-APT), which transforms all input states of polarization to a particular state that can be polarized or partially polarized.

In the first region, mediocre firms sort with mediocre workers and coworkers such that output losses are equal across all these pairings (complete mixing). In the second region, high skill workers sort with a low skill coworker and a high productivity firm, while high productivity firms employ a low skill worker and a high skill coworker (pairwise countermonotonicity). The equilibrium assignment is also necessarily characterized by product countermonotonicity, meaning that sorting is negative for each dimension of heterogeneity with the product of heterogeneity in the other dimensions. The equilibrium assignment as well as wages and firm values are completely characterized in closed form. We illustrate our theory with an application to show that our model is consistent with the observed dispersion of earnings within and across U.S. firms.

To ensure the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform next-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the decoder) which are discarded during control.

The deepening penetration of renewables in power systems has contributed to the increasing needs for generation scheduling flexibility.

To address the growing requirements for flexible ramp capacity, markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in California ISO and Midcontinent ISO. Some-times, to guarantee sufficient ramp capacity, expensive fast start units have to be committed in real-time. Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable generation, the flexibility provided by the conventional units might not be enough.

The paper describes a mathematical framework based on the principle of invariance that classifies institutions into two paradigms (accounting and management perspectives) according to how they calculate credit, debit, and funding adjustments. This framework helps to determine which paradigm an institution belongs to, where market consensus and regulations are heading, and the implications of switching perspectives.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the principle of invariance is not about determining absolute values, but rather about classification based on calculation methods.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the paper suggests that there are implications, pros, and cons to switching perspectives, not that it can be done freely without consequences.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the paper mentions an improved solution for calculating metrics irrespective of the discounting curve used in Front Office systems, this is not the primary purpose of the principle of invariance as described."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Nanoscale domains in ionic liquids: A statistical mechanics definition\n  for molecular dynamics studies", "source": "B.

One of the many open questions concerning Ionic Liquids (ILs) is the existence of nanoscale supramolecular domains which characterize the bulk.

In this work, we propose a suitable definition of supramolecular domains based on first principles of statistical mechanics. Such principles can be realized through the application of a recently developed computational tool which employs adaptive molecular resolution. The method can identify the smallest region of a liquid for which the atomistic details are strictly required, while the exterior plays the role of a generic structureless thermodynamic reservoir.

Depth functions have become increasingly powerful tools in nonparametric inference for multivariate data, as they measure a degree of centrality of a point with respect to a distribution. A multivariate risks scenario is then represented by a depth-based lower level set of the risk factors, meaning that we consider a non-compact setting. More precisely, given a multivariate depth function D associated to a fixed probability measure, we are interested in the lower level set based on D. First, we present a plug-in approach in order to estimate the depth-based level set.

In practical terms, controlling a network requires manipulating a large number of nodes with a comparatively small number of external inputs, a process that is facilitated by paths that broadcast the influence of the (directly-controlled) driver nodes to the rest of the network. Recent work has shown that surprisingly, temporal networks can enjoy tremendous control advantages over their static counterparts despite the fact that in temporal networks such paths are seldom instantaneously available. To understand the underlying reasons, here we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of a key control cost for temporal networks--the control energy. We show that the energy costs of controlling temporal networks are determined solely by the spectral properties of an \"effective\" Gramian matrix, analogous to the static network case. Surprisingly, we find that this scaling is largely dictated by the first and the last network snapshot in the temporal sequence, independent of the number of intervening snapshots, the initial and final states, and the number of driver nodes.
