The Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model was devised to test the validity of different approximate formalisms to treat many-particle systems.

In the present contribution, we explicitly review the fact that different many-body approximations commonly used in different fields in physics clearly fail to describe the exact LMG solution. With similar assumptions as those adopted for the LMG model, we propose a new Hamiltonian based on a general two-body interaction.

Instead, we reduce the problem of the bid leakage detection to a positive-unlabeled classification. The key idea is to regard the losing participants as fair and the winners as possibly corrupted. This allows us to estimate the prior probability of bid leakage in the sample, as well as the posterior probability of bid leakage for each specific auction. We extract and analyze the data on 600,000 Russian procurement auctions between 2014 and 2018. We find that around 9% of the auctions are exposed to bid leakage, which results in an overall 1.5% price increase.

The researchers use a positive-unlabeled classification approach because of the absence of bid leakage labels in the available data.

The classification of glomerular lesions is a routine and essential task in renal pathology.

However, one major challenge of developing such methods is the naturally imbalanced distribution of different lesions.

The loss of synchronizability at large coupling strength is of major concern especially in the fields of secure communication and complex systems.

All liquids in nature can be supercooled to form a glass. Surprisingly, although this phenomenon has been employed for millennia, it still remains ill-understood. Perhaps the most puzzling feature of supercooled liquids is the dramatic increase in their viscosity as the temperature ($T$) is lowered. This precipitous rise has long posed a fundamental theoretical challenge. Numerous approaches currently attempt to explain this phenomenon. When present, data collapse points to an underlying simplicity in various branches of science. In this Letter, we report on a 16 decade data collapse of the viscosity of 45 different liquids of all known types. Specifically, the viscosity of supercooled liquids scaled by their value at their respective equilibrium melting temperature ($\\eta(T)/\\eta(T_{melt}))$ is, for all temperatures $T<T_{melt}$, a universal function of $(T_{melt} - T)/(B T)$ where $B$ is a constant that does not change significantly from one liquid to another.

Background: Mean-field methods based on an energy density functional (EDF) are powerful tools used to describe many properties of nuclei in the entirety of the nuclear chart. The accuracy required on energies for nuclear physics and astrophysics applications is of the order of 500 keV and much effort is undertaken to build EDFs that meet this requirement.

We study this numerical accuracy in detail for a specific numerical choice of representation for the mean-field equations that can accommodate any kind of symmetry breaking.

Its numerical accuracy is governed by three main factors: the size of the box in which the nucleus is confined, the way numerical derivatives are calculated and the distance between the points on the mesh. Results: We have examined the dependence of the results on these three factors for spherical doubly-magic nuclei, neutron-rich $^{34}$Ne, the fission barrier of $^{240}$Pu and isotopic chains around Z = 50.
