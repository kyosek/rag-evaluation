In the last two decades, luggage scanning has globally become one of the prime aviation security concerns. Manual screening of the baggage items is a cumbersome, subjective and inefficient process.

We present 26 point-sources discovered with Chandra within 200\" (~20kpc) of the center of the barred supergiant galaxy NGC 1365. The majority of these sources are high-mass X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star or a black hole accreting from a luminous companion at a sub-Eddington rate. Using repeat Chandra and XMM-Newton as well as optical observations, we discuss in detail the natures of two highly-variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): NGC 1365 X1, one of the most luminous ULXs known since the ROSAT era, which is X-ray variable by a factor of 30, and NGC 1365 X2, a newly discovered transient ULX, variable by a factor of >90. Their maximum X-ray luminosities (3-5 x 10^40 erg/s, measured with Chandra) and multiwavelength properties suggest the presence of more exotic objects and accretion modes: accretion onto intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) and beamed/super-Eddington accretion onto solar-mass compact remnants. We argue that these two sources have black-hole masses higher than those of the typical primaries found in X-ray binaries in our Galaxy (which have masses of <20 Msolar), with a likely black-hole mass of 40-60 Msolar in the case of NGC 1365 X1 with a beamed/super-Eddington accretion mode, and a possible IMBH in the case of NGC 1365 X2 with M=80-500Msolar."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the Chandra observations of NGC 1365, which of the following statements about the ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) NGC 1365 X1 and NGC 1365 X2 is most accurate?\n\nA) Both NGC 1365 X1 and NGC 1365 X2 are likely to contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses exceeding 500 solar masses.\n\nB) NGC 1365 X1 shows less variability than NGC 1365 X2, with X-ray luminosity changes by a factor of about 30, while NGC 1365 X2 varies by a factor greater than 90.\n\nC) The maximum X-ray luminosities of both ULXs are consistent with standard sub-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes typically found in Galactic X-ray binaries.\n\nD) NGC 1365 X1 likely contains a black hole of 40-60 solar masses with beamed/super-Eddington accretion, while NGC 1365 X2 potentially harbors an IMBH with a mass between 80-500 solar masses.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

The incorporation of the chiral partner N* in the mirror assignment introduces a chirally invariant mass term m0.
