Important trait features, such as the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple Fourier interpretation. Roughness at a gene location corresponds to high sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces such sensitivity. Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated in identifiable, low-level coefficients.

Here, individual-based simulations are used to evaluate whether the mechanisms implied by this view may result in rapid speciation if the only source of genetic divergence are mutation and random genetic drift. Distinctive features of the simulations are the consideration of the complete process of speciation (from initiation until completion), and of a large number of loci, which was only one order of magnitude smaller than that of bacteria. It is demonstrated that rapid speciation on the time scale of hundreds of generations is plausible without the need for extreme founder events, complete geographic isolation, the existence of distinct adaptive peaks or selection for local adaptation. The plausibility of speciation is enhanced by population subdivision. Simultaneous emergence of more than two new species from a subdivided population is highly probable.

Instead, the key factors identified in the simulation are mutation and random genetic drift as sources of genetic divergence, with population subdivision enhancing the plausibility of speciation. The study specifically states that these mechanisms can lead to rapid speciation without requiring distinct adaptive peaks or other traditional factors often associated with speciation processes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study explicitly states that extreme founder events and complete geographic isolation are not necessary for rapid speciation in this model.\n\nOption C is incorrect because distinct adaptive peaks are not required in this model, and large population sizes would likely slow down the process of genetic drift.\n\nOption D includes concepts mentioned in the study (ring species and centrifugal speciation) but these are presented as examples or applications of the model, not as causes of rapid speciation."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Generalizing the first-difference correlated random walk for marine\n  animal movement data", "source": "Christoffer Moesgaard Albertsen", "docs_id": "1806.08582", "section": ["q-bio.QM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Generalizing the first-difference correlated random walk for marine\n  animal movement data. Animal telemetry data are often analysed with discrete time movement models assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant distant time steps.

The model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than the regular time counterpart.

In this paper, we propose embedding capacity (the amount of information the embedding contains about the data) as a unified method of analyzing the behavior of latent variable models of speech, comparing existing heuristic (non-variational) methods to variational methods that are able to explicitly constrain capacity using an upper bound on representational mutual information. In our proposed model (Capacitron), we show that by adding conditional dependencies to the variational posterior such that it matches the form of the true posterior, the same model can be used for high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generation of natural-sounding prior samples. For multi-speaker models, Capacitron is able to preserve target speaker identity during inter-speaker prosody transfer and when drawing samples from the latent prior.
