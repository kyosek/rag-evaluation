A market consisting of a generator with thermal and renewable generation capability, a set of non-preemptive loads (i.e., loads which cannot be interrupted once started), and an independent system operator (ISO) is considered. Loads are characterized by durations, power demand rates and utility for receiving service, as well as disutility functions giving preferences for time slots in which service is preferred. Given this information, along with the generator's thermal generation cost function and forecast renewable generation, the social planner solves a mixed integer program to determine a load activation schedule which maximizes social welfare. Assuming price taking behavior, we develop a competitive equilibrium concept based on a relaxed version of the social planner's problem which includes prices for consumption and incentives for flexibility, and allows for probabilistic allocation of power to loads. Considering each load as representative of a population of identical loads with scaled characteristics, we demonstrate that the relaxed social planner's problem gives an exact solution to the original mixed integer problem in the large population limit, and give a market mechanism for implementing the competitive equilibrium. Finally, we evaluate via case study the benefit of incorporating load flexibility information into power consumption and generation scheduling in terms of proportion of loads served and overall social welfare."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the smart-grid network model described, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the competitive equilibrium concept developed?\n\nA) It is based on a relaxed version of the social planner's problem.\nB) It includes prices for consumption and incentives for flexibility.\nC) It assumes loads can be interrupted at any time during their operation.\nD) It allows for probabilistic allocation of power to loads.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C because the question asks for the statement that is NOT true.

Among the model-based approaches, fractal geometry has been one of the most popular, especially in biological applications. Nevertheless, fractals are part of a much broader family of models, which are the non-linear operators, studied in chaos theory.

Systems with long-range persistence and memory are shown to exhibit different precursory as well as recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogeneous versus endogeneous origins. By endogeneous, we envision either fluctuations resulting from an underlying chaotic dynamics or from a stochastic forcing origin which may be external or be an effective coarse-grained description of the microscopic fluctuations. In this scenario, endogeneous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves. As a consequence, the recovery after an endogeneous shock is in general slower at early times and can be at long times either slower or faster than after an exogeneous perturbation.

On the other hand, in the case of mutual coupling a very large value of coupling strength is required for local synchronization and, consequently, all the local subsystems synchronize immediately for the same value of the coupling strength and hence globally synchronization also occurs in a narrow range of the coupling strength. In the transition regime, we observe a new type of synchronization transition where long intervals of high quality synchronization which are interrupted at irregular times by intermittent chaotic bursts simultaneously in all the systems, which we designate as global intermittent synchronization (GIS).

The significant difference in gas mass fractions between the eastern (0.087_{-0.001}^{+0.005} from X-ray data) and western (0.030 _{-0.014}^{+0.010}) components suggests an ongoing merger process. The authors interpret the low gas mass fraction in the western component as likely due to gas stripping during the merger.

This explanation aligns with the integrated system's lower gas mass fraction and the suggestion that missing baryons might be in a form not easily detected by current X-ray observations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it misinterprets the data, suggesting the merger is complete when the evidence points to an ongoing process.

Light field saliency detection -- important due to utility in many vision tasks -- still lacks speed and can improve in accuracy. Due to the formulation of the saliency detection problem in light fields as a segmentation task or a memorizing task, existing approaches consume unnecessarily large amounts of computational resources for training, and have longer execution times for testing. We solve this by aggressively reducing the large light field images to a much smaller three-channel feature map appropriate for saliency detection using an RGB image saliency detector with attention mechanisms.

Recent advances have extended the linear approach by using it in conjunction with link functions, and by considering multiple indices, but the flexibility of this technique is still limited.
