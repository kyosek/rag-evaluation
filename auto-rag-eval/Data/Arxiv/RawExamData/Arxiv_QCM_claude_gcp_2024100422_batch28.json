            "text": "Analysis of a Japan government intervention on the domestic agriculture\n  market. We investigate an economic system in which one large agent - the Japan government changes the environment of numerous smaller agents - the Japan agriculture producers by indirect regulation of prices of agriculture goods. The reason for this intervention was that before the oil crisis in 1974 Japan agriculture production prices exhibited irregular and large amplitude changes. By means of analysis of correlations and a combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA), principal component analysis (PCA), and time delay phase space construction (TDPSC) we study the influence of the government measures on the domestic piglet prices and production in Japan. We show that the government regulation politics was successful and leaded (i) to a decrease of the nonstationarities and to increase of predictability of the piglet price; (ii) to a coupling of the price and production cycles; (iii) to increase of determinism of the dynamics of the fluctuations of piglet price around the year average price. The investigated case is an example confirming the thesis that a large agent can change in a significant way the environment of the small agents in complex (economic or financial) systems which can be crucial for their survival or extinction."

[1] that correlations in the noise surrounding the observed gravitational wave signals, GW150194, GW151226, and GW170194 were found by the two LIGO detectors in Hanford and Livingston with the same time delay as the signals themselves. This raised some issues about the statistical reliability of the signals themselves, which led to much discussion, the current view appearing to support the contention that there is something unexplained that may be of genuine astrophysical interest [2]. In this note, it is pointed out that a resolution of this puzzle may be found in a proposal very recently put forward by the author [3], see also [4], that what seems to be spuriously generated noise may in fact be gravitational events caused by the decay of dark-matter particles (erebons) of mass around 10^-5g, the existence of such events being a clear implication of the cosmological scheme of conformal cyclic cosmology, or CCC [5], [6]. A brief outline of the salient points of CCC is provided here, especially with regard to its prediction of erebons and their impulsive gravitational signals."

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for unsupervised deep homography estimation. Our contributions are 3 folds. First, unlike previous methods that regress 4 offsets for a homography, we propose a homography flow representation, which can be estimated by a weighted sum of 8 pre-defined homography flow bases. Second, considering a homography contains 8 Degree-of-Freedoms (DOFs) that is much less than the rank of the network features, we propose a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block that reduces the feature rank, so that features corresponding to the dominant motions are retained while others are rejected. Last, we propose a Feature Identity Loss (FIL) to enforce the learned image feature warp-equivariant, meaning that the result should be identical if the order of warp operation and feature extraction is swapped. With this constraint, the unsupervised optimization is achieved more effectively and more stable features are learned. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed components, and results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the homography benchmark datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms in production for extended periods of time has uncovered new challenges such as monitoring and management of real-time prediction quality of a model in the absence of labels. However, such tracking is imperative to prevent catastrophic business outcomes resulting from incorrect predictions. The scale of these deployments makes manual monitoring prohibitive, making automated techniques to track and raise alerts imperative. We present a framework, ML Health, for tracking potential drops in the predictive performance of ML models in the absence of labels. The framework employs diagnostic methods to generate alerts for further investigation. We develop one such method to monitor potential problems when production data patterns do not match training data distributions. We demonstrate that our method performs better than standard \"distance metrics\", such as RMSE, KL-Divergence, and Wasserstein at detecting issues with mismatched data sets. Finally, we present a working system that incorporates the ML Health approach to monitor and manage ML deployments within a realistic full production ML lifecycle."

We examine the wavelength dependence of flux ratios for six gravitationally lensed quasars using K and L' images obtained at the Gemini North 8m telescope. We select lenses with source redshifts z_s < 2.8 so that K-band images probe rest-frame optical emission from accretion disks, while L'-band images probe rest-frame near-infrared flux emitted (in part) from the more extended surrounding torus. Since the observations correspond to different source sizes, the K and L' flux ratios are sensitive to structure on different scales and may be useful for studying small-structure in the lens galaxies. Four of the six lenses show differences between K and L' flux ratios. In HE 0435$-1223, SDSS 0246-0825, and HE 2149-2745 the differences may be attributable to known microlensing and/or intrinsic variability. In SDSS 0806+2006 the wavelength dependence is not easily attributed to known variations, and may indicate the presence of substructure. By contrast, in Q0142-100 and SBS 0909+523 the K and L' flux ratios are consistent within the uncertainties.

The study examines K and L' flux ratios in lensed quasars to probe different source sizes and scales. K-band images correspond to rest-frame optical emission from the accretion disk, while L'-band images probe more extended emission from the surrounding torus. This difference allows researchers to potentially detect small-scale structure in lens galaxies and study various chromatic effects such as microlensing, dust extinction, and dark matter substructure.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study found that four out of six lenses showed differences between K and L' flux ratios, contradicting the claim of consistent ratios across wavelengths.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the primary focus is on using the flux ratio differences to study lensing effects and lens galaxy properties, not just the quasar's intrinsic properties.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the study does not claim that L' flux ratios are more reliable.

This phenomenon, known as the \\emph{disposition effect} in the field of behavioural finance, is well-known and its prevalence has been shown in a number of existing markets. But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis. Our results show that investors are indeed subject to the disposition effect, tending to sell their winning positions too soon and holding on to their losing position for too long. This effect is very prominently evident from the boom and bust year 2017 onwards, confirmed via most of the applied technical indicators.

A denser network is found to be always better, not only for information diffusion but also for seller's profits, as long as Private WOM is concerned. Differently, under Public WOM, the seller may prefer an environment with less competition between informed consumers and the presence of highly connected influencers (hubs) is the main driver to make network density beneficial to profits. When the seller is able to discriminate between Private and Public WOM, the optimal strategy is to cheaply incentivize the more connected people to pass on the information publicly and then offer a high bonus for Private WOM."

According to the documentation, when the seller can discriminate between Private and Public WOM, the optimal strategy is to \"cheaply incentivize the more connected people to pass on the information publicly and then offer a high bonus for Private WOM.\" This approach leverages the network structure by using highly connected individuals (hubs) for efficient public dissemination of information, while still maintaining the option for more targeted private communication through higher incentives. This strategy balances the cost-effectiveness of Public WOM for well-connected individuals with the potentially more influential but costlier Private WOM.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't discriminate based on connectivity and focuses only on Public WOM. Option B is wrong as it doesn't align with the optimal strategy of differentiating between Public and Private WOM incentives. Option C is the opposite of the correct strategy, as it suggests incentivizing less connected individuals for Public WOM, which would be less effective."

It is shown that if the data set satisfies a persistence of excitation condition, then a data-driven LPV predictor of future trajectories of the system can be constructed from the I/O data set and online measured data. The approach represents the first step towards a DPC solution for nonlinear and time-varying systems due to the potential of the LPV framework to represent them.

Interest in the study of in-host microbial communities has increased in recent years due to our improved understanding of the communities' significant role in host health. As a result, the ability to model these communities using differential equations, for example, and analyze the results has become increasingly relevant. The size of the models and limitations in data collection among many other considerations require that we develop new parameter estimation methods to address the challenges that arise when using traditional parameter estimation methods for models of these in-host microbial communities. In this work, we present the challenges that appear when applying traditional parameter estimation techniques to differential equation models of microbial communities, and we provide an original, alternative method to those techniques. We show the derivation of our method and how our method avoids the limitations of traditional techniques while including additional benefits. We also provide simulation studies to demonstrate our method's viability, the application of our method to a model of intestinal microbial communities to demonstrate the insights that can be gained from our method, and sample code to give readers the opportunity to apply our method to their own research."

In simple ferromagnetic quantum Ising models characterized by an effective double-well energy landscape the characteristic tunneling time of path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations has been shown to scale as the incoherent quantum-tunneling time, i.e., as $1/\\Delta^2$, where $\\Delta$ is the tunneling gap. Since incoherent quantum tunneling is employed by quantum annealers (QAs) to solve optimization problems, this result suggests there is no quantum advantage in using QAs w.r.t. quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. A counterexample is the recently introduced shamrock model, where topological obstructions cause an exponential slowdown of the PIMC tunneling dynamics with respect to incoherent quantum tunneling, leaving the door open for potential quantum speedup, even for stoquastic models. In this work, we investigate the tunneling time of projective QMC simulations based on the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm without guiding functions, showing that it scales as $1/\\Delta$, i.e., even more favorably than the incoherent quantum-tunneling time, both in a simple ferromagnetic system and in the more challenging shamrock model. However a careful comparison between the DMC ground-state energies and the exact solution available for the transverse-field Ising chain points at an exponential scaling of the computational cost required to keep a fixed relative error as the system size increases."

Resistant bacteria are selected for by antibiotic treatments, and once resistance becomes widespread in a population of hosts, antibiotics become useless. Here, we develop a multiscale model of the interaction between antibiotic use and resistance spread in a host population, focusing on an important aspect of within-host immunity. Antibodies secreted in the gut enchain bacteria upon division, yielding clonal clusters of bacteria. We demonstrate that immunity-driven bacteria clustering can hinder the spread of a novel resistant bacterial strain in a host population. We quantify this effect both in the case where resistance pre-exists and in the case where acquiring a new resistance mutation is necessary for the bacteria to spread. We further show that the reduction of spread by clustering can be countered when immune hosts are silent carriers, and are less likely to get treated, and/or have more contacts. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings to including stochastic within-host bacterial growth, a fitness cost of resistance, and its compensation. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between immunity and the spread of antibiotic resistance, and argue in the favor of vaccine-based strategies to combat antibiotic resistance."

The study demonstrates that immunity-driven bacteria clustering, caused by antibodies secreted in the gut that enchain bacteria upon division, can hinder the spread of a novel resistant bacterial strain in a host population. This effect is quantified both for pre-existing resistance and for cases where acquiring a new resistance mutation is necessary for bacterial spread. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study does not suggest that antibody-mediated cross-linking accelerates the spread of resistance. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the study explicitly states that this mechanism has a significant impact on hindering resistance spread. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the clustering does concentrate bacteria, the study does not indicate that this increases the likelihood of acquiring new resistance mutations. Instead, it focuses on how clustering hinders the spread of resistance."

While classical novae are now routinely detected in gamma-rays, the origin of the shocks that produce relativistic particles has remained unknown. We carried out electronic European VLBI Network (e-EVN) observations that revealed a pair of compact synchrotron emission features in V959 Mon on 2012 Sep 18. Since synchrotron emission requires strong shocks as well, we identify these features as the location where the gamma rays were produced. We also detected the extended ejecta in the follow-up EVN observations. They expanded much faster in East-West direction than the compact knots detected in the aforementioned e-EVN measurements. By comparing the VLBI results with lower resolution images obtained using e-MERLIN and the VLA - as reported by Chomiuk et al. (2014) - it appears that 1) influenced by the binary orbit, the nova ejecta was highly asymmetric with a dense and slow outflow in the equatorial plane and low-density and faster ejecta along the poles; and 2) the VLBI knots were related to shocks formed in the interaction region of these outflows."

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the key findings from the VLBI observations:\n\n1. The e-EVN observations revealed \"a pair of compact synchrotron emission features,\" which were identified as the location of gamma-ray production due to the requirement of strong shocks for both synchrotron emission and gamma-ray generation.\n\n2.

Pertinent articles were selected through key search points and excerpt-related literature. The key search points covered the topic related to different terms of engagement for example \"employee engagement\" OR \"work engagement\" OR \"job engagement\" OR \"organization engagement\" OR \"staff engagement\" OR \"personnel engagement\" which were steered in diverse context particularly financial sector. Through critically reviewing the literature for the last 11 years i.e., 2009-2019, we discovered 91 empirical studies in financial sector. From these studies, we found the overall concept of engagement and its different determinants (e.g., organizational factors, individual factors, job factors) as well as its various outcomes (e.g., employee outcomes, organizational outcomes).

In this work, we study architectural-level contributions to energy dissipation in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based processor that is trained to perform edge-detection task. We compare the training and information processing cost of ANN to that of conventional architectures and algorithms using 64-pixel binary image.

In particular, new NLO and parton shower simulations with POWHEG are performed in the ALICE kinematic regime at three different centre-of-mass energies, including scale and parton density variations, in order to establish a reliable baseline for future detailed studies of heavy-quark suppression in heavy-ion collisions. Very good agreement of POWHEG is found with FONLL, in particular for centrally produced D^0, D^+ and D^*+ mesons and electrons from charm and bottom quark decays, but also with the generally somewhat higher GM-VFNS predictions within the theoretical uncertainties. The latter are dominated by scale rather than quark mass variations. Parton density uncertainties for charm and bottom quark production are computed here with POWHEG for the first time and shown to be dominant in the forward regime, e.g. for muons coming from heavy-flavour decays.

Liquidity and trading activity on constant function market makers (CFMMs) such as Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer has grown significantly in the second half of 2020. Much of the growth of these protocols has been driven by incentivized pools or 'yield farming', which reward participants in crypto assets for providing liquidity to CFMMs. As a result, CFMMs and associated protocols, which were historically very small markets, now constitute the most liquid trading venues for a large number of crypto assets. But what does it mean for a CFMM to be the most liquid market? In this paper, we propose a basic definition of price sensitivity and liquidity. We show that this definition is tightly related to the curvature of a CFMM's trading function and can be used to explain a number of heuristic results. For example, we show that low-curvature markets are good for coins whose market value is approximately fixed and that high-curvature markets are better for liquidity providers when traders have an informational edge. Additionally, the results can also be used to model interacting markets and explain the rise of incentivized liquidity provision, also known as 'yield farming.'"

While passive diffusion is often sufficiently fast for the transport of smaller cargo, active transport is necessary to organize large structures on short timescales. The main mechanism of this transport is by cargo attachment to motors which walk in a directed fashion along intracellular filaments. There are a number of models which seek to describe the motion of motors with attached cargo, from detailed microscopic to coarse phenomenological descriptions. We focus on the intermediate-detailed discrete stochastic hopping models, and explore how cargo transport changes depending on the number of motors, motor interaction, system constraints and rate formulations which are derived from common thermodynamic assumptions. We find that, despite obeying the same detailed balance constraint, the choice of rate formulation considerably affects the characteristics of the overall motion of the system, with one rate formulation exhibiting novel behavior of loaded motor groups moving faster than a single unloaded motor."

General expressions are derived for the electrical resisitivity and thermal conductivity of a twinned single crystal. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the structure of the twin domains on these transport coefficients. Edge effects are also considered. The expression for the thermal conductivity is used to fit data for a twinned single crystal of 0.8% Zn-doped YBa2Cu3O6.98. The expression for the electrical resistivity is used to fit previously published electrical resistivity data for a twinned single crystal of YBa2Cu3O6.9.

The following topics are briefly considered and discussed: harmonic quark series and its boundaries, the d-quark peculiarity, parallel quark series and quark mixing. The boundaries of quark chain can are closely related to a weak interaction. The cause of the quark mixing is probably an existence of the parallel quark chain and the special properties of the d-quark in the main quark chain. The new mass equation is found.

In the Seel-Strack contest, each agent or contestant privately observes a Brownian motion, absorbed at zero, and chooses when to stop it. The winner of the contest is the agent who stops at the highest value. The model assumes that all the processes start from a common value $x_0>0$ and the symmetric Nash equilibrium is for each agent to utilise a stopping rule which yields a randomised value for the stopped process. In the two-player contest, this randomised value has a uniform distribution on $[0,2x_0]$. In this paper, we consider a variant of the problem whereby the starting values of the Brownian motions are independent, nonnegative random variables that have a common law $\\mu$. We consider a two-player contest and prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Nash equilibrium for the problem. The solution is that each agent should aim for the target law $\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is greater than or equal to $\\mu$ in convex order; $\\nu$ has an atom at zero of the same size as any atom of $\\mu$ at zero, and otherwise is atom free; on $(0,\\infty)$ $\\nu$ has a decreasing density; and the density of $\\nu$ only decreases at points where the convex order constraint is binding."

In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction.

Here, an agent on the proposed-to side (say, a woman) partners with an agent on the proposing side -- an accomplice -- to manipulate on her behalf (possibly at the expense of worsening his match). We show that the optimal manipulation strategy for an accomplice comprises of promoting exactly one woman in his true list (i.e., an inconspicuous manipulation). This structural result immediately gives a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal accomplice manipulation. We also study the conditions under which the manipulated matching is stable with respect to the true preferences. Our experimental results show that accomplice manipulation outperforms self manipulation both in terms of the frequency of occurrence as well as the quality of matched partners."

Background noise is a major source of quality impairments in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) calls.

In order to better facilitate deep learning research in Speech Enhancement, we present a noisy speech dataset (MS-SNSD) that can scale to arbitrary sizes depending on the number of speakers, noise types, and Speech to Noise Ratio (SNR) levels desired. We show that increasing dataset sizes increases noise suppression performance as expected. In addition, we provide an open-source evaluation methodology to evaluate the results subjectively at scale using crowdsourcing, with a reference algorithm to normalize the results. To demonstrate the dataset and evaluation framework we apply it to several noise suppressors and compare the subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) with objective quality measures such as SNR, PESQ, POLQA, and VISQOL and show why MOS is still required.

One way to analyse the behaviour of machine learning models is through local explanations that highlight input features that maximally influence model predictions. Sensitivity analysis, which involves analysing the effect of input perturbations on model predictions, is one of the methods to generate local explanations. Meaningful input perturbations are essential for generating reliable explanations, but there exists limited work on what such perturbations are and how to perform them. This work investigates these questions in the context of machine listening models that analyse audio. Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art deep singing voice detection (SVD) model to analyse whether explanations from SoundLIME (a local explanation method) are sensitive to how the method perturbs model inputs. The results demonstrate that SoundLIME explanations are sensitive to the content in the occluded input regions. We further propose and demonstrate a novel method for quantitatively identifying suitable content type(s) for reliably occluding inputs of machine listening models. The results for the SVD model suggest that the average magnitude of input mel-spectrogram bins is the most suitable content type for temporal explanations."

Traditionally the Costa Rican historians and genealogists have interpreted that the Spanish ruling elite emerged after the conquest was exclusively of European origin. On the other side, recent technological advances in Genetics give us the opportunity to approach the study of pedigrees from a new perspective, examining alive people and simultaneously collating the historical information of their ancestors. In this paper, a complete matrilineal genealogy was reconstructed from nowadays \"white\" Costa Ricans to their ancestors in the early Colonial society (XVI century). It was compared the correlation between ethnic affiliations deduced from historical records with the genetic inheritance from maternal lineages. The MtDNA lineage observed corresponds to a Native American ancestry. These results show that some Amerindian gene flow into the Spanish group must have occurred since the first generation of Colonial society, a finding that contrasts with the prevailing ideas that the Spanish elite avoided the intermarriage with other ethnic groups. Examples like this one confirm that miscegenation began early in Costa Rica. So, those who considered themselves \"Spaniards\" in the late colonial era, were actually biologically mestizos.

It demonstrates that miscegenation (mixing of ethnic groups) began early in Costa Rica's colonial history, even among those who considered themselves \"Spanish.\" This challenges the prevailing idea that the Spanish elite avoided intermarriage with other ethnic groups and shows that those who identified as \"Spaniards\" in the late colonial era were actually biologically mestizo (of mixed ancestry)."

We report on the highest precision yet achieved in the measurement of the polarization of a low energy, $\\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV), electron beam, accomplished using a new polarimeter based on electron-photon scattering, in Hall~C at Jefferson Lab. A number of technical innovations were necessary, including a novel method for precise control of the laser polarization in a cavity and a novel diamond micro-strip detector which was able to capture most of the spectrum of scattered electrons. The data analysis technique exploited track finding, the high granularity of the detector and its large acceptance. The polarization of the $180~\\mu$A, $1.16$~GeV electron beam was measured with a statistical precision of $<$~1\\% per hour and a systematic uncertainty of 0.59\\%. This exceeds the level of precision required by the \\qweak experiment, a measurement of the vector weak charge of the proton. Proposed future low-energy experiments require polarization uncertainty $<$~0.4\\%, and this result represents an important demonstration of that possibility. This measurement is also the first use of diamond detectors for particle tracking in an experiment."

Harnessing their activity is key towards developing new nano-technologies, or functional biomaterials. Cytoskeleton-like networks, recently tailored in vitro, result from the self-assembly of subcellular autonomous units. Taming this biological activity bottom-up may thus require molecular level alterations compromising protein integrity. Taking a top-down perspective, here we prove that the seemingly chaotic flows of a tubulin-kinesin active gel can be forced to adopt well-defined spatial directions by tuning the anisotropic viscosity of a contacting lamellar oil. Different configurations of the active material are realized, when the passive oil is either unforced or commanded by a magnetic field. The inherent instability of the extensile active fluid is thus spatially regularized, leading to organized flow patterns, endowed with characteristic length and time scales. Our finding paves the way for designing hybrid active/passive systems where ATP-driven dynamics can be externally conditioned."

We develop a theoretical framework that places energy transfers at centerstage of growth theory based on two principles: (1) goods are material rearrangements and (2) such rearrangements are done by energy transferred by prime movers (e.g. workers, engines). We derive the implications of these principles for an autarkic agent that maximizes utility subject to an energy budget constraint and maximizes energy surplus to relax such constraint. The solution to these problems shows that growth is driven by positive marginal energy surplus of energy goods (e.g. rice, oil), yet materializes through prime mover accumulation. This perspective brings under one framework several results from previous attempts to insert energy within growth theory, reconciles economics with natural sciences, and provides a basis for a general reinterpretation of economics and growth as the interplay between human desires and thermodynamic processes."

Our measurement has been obtained through an accurate reanalysis of archival polarisation observations obtained with the FORS instrument at the VLT. We have measured a phase-averaged linear polarisation degree P=9.4% +/- 4% and a position angle 146 +/- 11 deg, very close to the ones of the axis of symmetry of the X-ray arcs and jets detected by Chandra and of the pulsar proper motion.We have compared the measured phase-averaged optical polarisation with the expectations of different pulsars' magnetosphere models. We have found that all models consistently predict too large values of the phase-averaged linear polarization with respect to the observed one. This is probably a consequence of present models' limitations which neglect the contributions of various depolarisation effects.

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field that has attracted considerable research interest over the past few years. Previous review articles in CS limit their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including continuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and measurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging theory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new directions as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of serving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field, and as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing ideas in perspective of practical applications."

In the first part the original Skyrme model with finite pion mass has been extended by inclusion of the light scalar - isoscalar sigma - meson. The Lagrangian has been further extended by explicit inclusion of sigma, rho and omega - mesons as well. In order to get a more complete picture of NN potential the appropriate meson - nucleon vertex form - factors are obtained. The second part of the thesis considers a nucleon immersed into a nuclear medium. For this purpose a medium modified Skyrme Lagrangian has been proposed. The Lagrangian describes well such well known medium effects as decreasing of nucleon mass and increasing of its size (swelling). We studied also a system with finite temperature also. The temperature effects are taken into account by using the method of termofield dynamics (TFD). The corresponding critical temperatures for each meson - nucleon system are calculated ."

Adding constraint support in Machine Learning has the potential to address outstanding issues in data-driven AI systems, such as safety and fairness. Existing approaches typically apply constrained optimization techniques to ML training, enforce constraint satisfaction by adjusting the model design, or use constraints to correct the output. Here, we investigate a different, complementary, strategy based on \"teaching\" constraint satisfaction to a supervised ML method via the direct use of a state-of-the-art constraint solver: this enables taking advantage of decades of research on constrained optimization with limited effort. In practice, we use a decomposition scheme alternating master steps (in charge of enforcing the constraints) and learner steps (where any supervised ML model and training algorithm can be employed). The process leads to approximate constraint satisfaction in general, and convergence properties are difficult to establish; despite this fact, we found empirically that even a na\\\"ive setup of our approach performs well on ML tasks with fairness constraints, and on classical datasets with synthetic constraints."

These are selected as starburst (EW(H$\\alpha) > 50$\\AA) and for their high excitation locus in the upper-left region of the BPT diagram. Their photometry was derived from the cross-matched GALEX, SDSS, UKDISS and WISE catalogues. We have used CIGALE modelling and SED fitting routine with the parametrization of a three burst star formation history, and a comprehensive analysis of all other model parameters. We have been able to estimate the contribution of the underlying old stellar population to the observed equivalent width of H$\\beta$ and allow for more accurate burst age determination. We found that the star formation histories of HII Galaxies can be reproduced remarkably well by three major eras of star formation. In addition, the SED fitting results indicate that: i) in all cases the current burst produces less than a few percent of the total stellar mass: the bulk of stellar mass in HII galaxies have been produced by the past episodes of star formation; ii) at a given age the H$\\beta$ luminosity depends only on the mass of young stars favouring a universal IMF for massive stars; iii) the current star formation episodes are {\\it maximal} starbursts, producing stars at the highest possible rate."

Detailed understanding of the couplings between fluid flow and solid deformation in porous media is crucial for the development of novel technologies relating to a wide range of geological and biological processes. A particularly challenging phenomenon that emerges from these couplings is the transition from fluid invasion to fracturing during multiphase flow. Previous studies have shown that this transition is highly sensitive to fluid flow rate, capillarity, and the structural properties of the porous medium. However, a comprehensive characterization of the relevant fluid flow and material failure regimes does not exist. Here, we used our newly developed Multiphase Darcy-Brinkman-Biot framework to examine the transition from drainage to material failure during viscously-stable multiphase flow in soft porous media in a broad range of flow, wettability, and solid rheology conditions. We demonstrate the existence of three distinct material failure regimes controlled by non-dimensional numbers that quantify the balance of viscous, capillary, and structural forces in the porous medium."

            "text": "ModelHub.AI: Dissemination Platform for Deep Learning Models. Recent advances in artificial intelligence research have led to a profusion of studies that apply deep learning to problems in image analysis and natural language processing among others. Additionally, the availability of open-source computational frameworks has lowered the barriers to implementing state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains. Albeit leading to major performance breakthroughs in some tasks, effective dissemination of deep learning algorithms remains challenging, inhibiting reproducibility and benchmarking studies, impeding further validation, and ultimately hindering their effectiveness in the cumulative scientific progress. In developing a platform for sharing research outputs, we present ModelHub.AI (www.modelhub.ai), a community-driven container-based software engine and platform for the structured dissemination of deep learning models. For contributors, the engine controls data flow throughout the inference cycle, while the contributor-facing standard template exposes model-specific functions including inference, as well as pre- and post-processing. Python and RESTful Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable users to interact with models hosted on ModelHub.AI and allows both researchers and developers to utilize models out-of-the-box. ModelHub.AI is domain-, data-, and framework-agnostic, catering to different workflows and contributors' preferences."
