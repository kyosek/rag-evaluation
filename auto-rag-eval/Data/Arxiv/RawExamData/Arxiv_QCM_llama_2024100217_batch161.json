In diverse biological applications, particle tracking of passive microscopic species has become the experimental measurement of choice -- when either the materials are of limited volume, or so soft as to deform uncontrollably when manipulated by traditional instruments. In a wide range of particle tracking experiments, a ubiquitous finding is that the mean squared displacement (MSD) of particle positions exhibits a power-law signature, the parameters of which reveal valuable information about the viscous and elastic properties of various biomaterials. However, MSD measurements are typically contaminated by complex and interacting sources of instrumental noise. As these often affect the high-frequency bandwidth to which MSD estimates are particularly sensitive, inadequate error correction can lead to severe bias in power law estimation and thereby, the inferred viscoelastic properties. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to filter high-frequency noise from particle tracking measurements.

We report the experimental investigation and theoretical modeling of a rotating polariton superfluid relying on an innovative method for the injection of angular momentum. This novel, multi-pump injection method uses four coherent lasers arranged in a square, resonantly creating four polariton populations propagating inwards. The control available over the direction of propagation of the superflows allows injecting a controllable non-quantized amount of optical angular momentum. When the density at the center is low enough to neglect polariton-polariton interactions, optical singularities, associated to an interference pattern, are visible in the phase. In the superfluid regime resulting from the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton interaction, the interference pattern disappears and only vortices with the same sign are persisting in the system. Remarkably the number of vortices inside the superfluid region can be controlled by controlling the angular momentum injected by the pumps."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary effect of injecting a controllable non-quantized amount of optical angular momentum into a polariton superfluid using the novel, multi-pump injection method described in the paper?\n\n**A)** The interference pattern associated with optical singularities disappears, and only vortices with the same sign persist in the system.\n**B)** The number of vortices inside the superfluid region increases, allowing for the creation of a stable, quantized vortex state.\n**C)** The polariton-polariton interaction is strengthened, leading to a more efficient storage of quantized vortices.\n**D)** The phase of the polariton superfluid is altered, resulting in a change in the direction of propagation of the superflows.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The interference pattern associated with optical singularities disappears, and only vortices with the same sign persist in the system.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is A) because the paper states that when the density at the center is low enough to neglect polariton-polariton interactions, optical singularities associated with an interference pattern are visible in the phase.
