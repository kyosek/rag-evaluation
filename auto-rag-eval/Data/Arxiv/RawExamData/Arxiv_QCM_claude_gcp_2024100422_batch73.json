When directly using existing text generation datasets for controllable generation, we are facing the problem of not having the domain knowledge and thus the aspects that could be controlled are limited.A typical example is when using CNN/Daily Mail dataset for controllable text summarization, there is no guided information on the emphasis of summary sentences. A more useful text generator should leverage both the input text and control variables to guide the generation, which can only be built with deep understanding of the domain knowledge. Motivated by this vi-sion, our paper introduces a new text generation dataset, named MReD. Our new dataset consists of 7,089 meta-reviews and all its 45k meta-review sentences are manually annotated as one of the carefully defined 9 categories, including abstract, strength, decision, etc. We present experimental results on start-of-the-art summarization models, and propose methods for controlled generation on both extractive and abstractive models using our annotated data.

Microwave and submillimeter molecular transition frequencies between nearly degenerated rotational levels, tunneling transitions, and mixed tunneling-rotational transitions show an extremely high sensitivity to the values of the fine-structure constant, alpha, and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu. This review summarizes the theoretical background on quantum-mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such transitions to tiny changes in alpha and mu for a number of molecules which are usually observed in Galactic and extragalactic sources, and discusses the possibility of testing the space- and time-invariance of fundamental constants through comparison between precise laboratory measurements of the molecular rest frequencies and their astronomical counterparts.

Utilizing perception for feedback control in combination with Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP)-based motion generation for a robot's end-effector control is a useful solution for many robotic manufacturing tasks. For instance, while performing an insertion task when the hole or the recipient part is not visible in the eye-in-hand camera, a learning-based movement primitive method can be used to generate the end-effector path. Once the recipient part is in the field of view (FOV), Image-based Visual Servo (IBVS) can be used to control the motion of the robot. Inspired by such applications, this paper presents a generalized control scheme that switches between motion generation using DMPs and IBVS control. To facilitate the design, a common state space representation for the DMP and the IBVS systems is first established. Stability analysis of the switched system using multiple Lyapunov functions shows that the state trajectories converge to a bound asymptotically.
