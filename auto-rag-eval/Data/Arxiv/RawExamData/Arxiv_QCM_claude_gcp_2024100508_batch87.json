The relevance of chaos to evolution is discussed in the context of the origin and maintenance of diversity and complexity. Evolution to the edge of chaos is demonstrated in an imitation game. As an origin of diversity, dynamic clustering of identical chaotic elements, globally coupled each to other, is briefly reviewed. The clustering is extended to nonlinear dynamics on hypercubic lattices, which enables us to construct a self-organizing genetic algorithm. A mechanism of maintenance of diversity, ``homeochaos\", is given in an ecological system with interaction among many species. Homeochaos provides a dynamic stability sustained by high-dimensional weak chaos. A novel mechanism of cell differentiation is presented, based on dynamic clustering.

However, the need for a significant number of patient-specific seizures and periodic retraining of the model because of non-stationary EEG creates difficulties for designing practical device for a patient. To mitigate this process, we propose a Siamese neural network based seizure prediction method that takes a wavelet transformed EEG tensor as an input with convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base network for detecting change-points in EEG. Compared to the solutions in the literature, which utilize days of EEG recordings, our method only needs one seizure for training which translates to less than ten minutes of preictal and interictal data while still getting comparable results to models which utilize multiple seizures for seizure prediction."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantage of the proposed Siamese neural network-based seizure prediction method compared to traditional deep learning approaches?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for EEG recordings entirely, relying solely on patient history for prediction.\n\nB) It requires multiple seizures to be recorded but reduces the overall training time of the model.\n\nC) It uses only one seizure recording, requiring less than ten minutes of preictal and interictal data for training.\n\nD) It improves prediction accuracy by utilizing months of continuous EEG data from each patient.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key innovation of the proposed method is that it only needs one seizure for training, which translates to less than ten minutes of preictal and interictal data.

Differences in interaural phase configuration between a target and a masker can lead to substantial binaural unmasking. This effect is decreased for masking noises with an interaural time difference (ITD). Adding a second noise with the opposite ITD (double-delayed noise) in most cases further reduces binaural unmasking. Thus far, modeling of these detection thresholds required both a mechanism for internal ITD compensation and an increased binaural bandwidth. An alternative explanation for the reduction is that unmasking is impaired by the lower interaural coherence in off-frequency regions caused by the second masker (Marquardt and McAlpine, 2009, JASA pp. EL177 - EL182). Based on this hypothesis, the current work proposes a quantitative multi-channel model using monaurally derived peripheral filter bandwidths and an across-channel incoherence interference mechanism. This mechanism differs from wider filters since it has no effect when the masker coherence is constant across frequency bands. Combined with a monaural energy discrimination pathway, the model predicts the differences between single- and double-delayed noise, as well as four other data sets.

This approach uses monaurally derived peripheral filter bandwidths and considers how interaural coherence in off-frequency regions affects binaural unmasking. Unlike previous models that required both internal ITD compensation and increased binaural bandwidth, this new model focuses on how the lower interaural coherence caused by a second masker impairs unmasking.
