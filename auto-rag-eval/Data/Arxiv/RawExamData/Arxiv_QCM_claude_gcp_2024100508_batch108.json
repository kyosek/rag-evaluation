We treat the problem of the approach to thermal equilibrium by only resorting to quantum dynamics of an isolated macroscopic system. Inspired by the two important works in 2009 and in 1929, we have noted that a condition we call \"thermodynamic normality\" for a macroscopic observable guarantees the approach to equilibrium (in the sense that a measurement of the observable at time $t$ almost certainly yields a result close to the corresponding microcanonical average for a sufficiently long and typical $t$). A crucial point is that we make no assumptions on the initial state of the system, except that its energy is distributed close to a certain macroscopic value. We also present three (rather artificial) models in which the thermodynamic normality can be established, thus providing concrete examples in which the approach to equilibrium is rigorously justified.

Efficient global optimization is the problem of minimizing an unknown function f, using as few evaluations f(x) as possible.
