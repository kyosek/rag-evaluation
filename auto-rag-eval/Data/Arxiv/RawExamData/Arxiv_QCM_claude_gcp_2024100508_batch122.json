Previous studies on automatic assessment of SSD revealed that detection of speech errors concerning short and transitory consonants is less satisfactory. This paper investigates a neural network based approach to detecting consonant errors in disordered speech using consonant-vowel (CV) diphone segment in comparison to using consonant monophone segment. The underlying assumption is that the vowel part of a CV segment carries important information of co-articulation from the consonant. Speech embeddings are extracted from CV segments by a recurrent neural network model.
