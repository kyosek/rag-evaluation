The prototype consists of detection modules arranged axially forming a cylindrical diagnostic chamber with the inner diameter of 360 mm and the axial field-of-view of 300 mm. Promising perspectives for a low-cost construction of a total-body PET scanner are opened due to an axial arrangement of strips of plastic scintillators, wchich have a small light attenuation, superior timing properties, and the possibility of cost-effective increase of the axial field-of-view. The presented prototype comprises dedicated solely digital front-end electronic circuits and a triggerless data acquisition system which required development of new calibration methods including time, thresholds and gain synchronization.

It is widely accepted in the MHD turbulence community that the nonlinear cascade of wave energy requires counter-propagating Alfv\\'enic wave-packets, along some mean magnetic field. This fact is an obvious outcome of the MHD equations under the assumptions of incompressibility and homogeneity. Despite attempts to relax these assumptions in the context of MHD turbulence, the central idea of turbulence generation persists. However, once the assumptions of incompressiblity and homogeneity break down, the generally accepted picture of turbulent cascade generation is not universal. In this paper, we show that perpendicular inhomogeneities (across the mean magnetic field) lead to propagating wave solutions which are necessarily described by co-propagating Els\\\"asser fields, already in the incompressible case. One simple example of these wave solutions is the surface Alfv\\'en wave on a planar discontinuity across the magnetic field.

Casimir entropies due to quantum fluctuations in the interaction between electrical bodies can often be negative, either caused by dissipation or by geometry. Although generally such entropies vanish at zero temperature, consistent with the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem), there is a region in the space of temperature and separation between the bodies where negative entropy occurs, while positive interaction entropies arise for large distances or temperatures. Systematic studies on this phenomenon in the Casimir-Polder interaction between a polarizable nanoparticle or atom and a conducting plate in the dipole approximation have been given recently. Since the total entropy should be positive according to the second law of thermodynamics, we expect that the self-entropy of the bodies would be sufficiently positive as to overwhelm the negative interaction entropy.

Cued and un-cued cell polarization is a fundamental mechanism in cell biology. As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been proposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known phenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and elegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and coworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with other networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has to be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a spatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to preserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we numerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded perturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss depends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the kind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an increase of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of polarization.

Understanding the emergence and sustainability of cooperation is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology and is frequently studied by the framework of evolutionary game theory. A very powerful mechanism to promote cooperation is network reciprocity, where the interaction patterns and opportunities for strategy spread of agents are constrained to limited sets of permanent interactions partners. Cooperation survives because it is possible for close-knit communities of cooperation to be shielded from invasion by defectors. Here we show that parameter ranges in which cooperation can survive are strongly expanded if game play on networks is skewed towards more frequent interactions with more successful neighbours. In particular, if agents exclusively select neighbors for game play that are more successful than themselves, cooperation can even dominate in situations in which it would die out if interaction neighbours were chosen without a bias or with a preference for less successful opponents.

The documentation describes a specific sequence of phase transitions as the Weissenberg number (Wi) increases. It states that the system first transitions from a square lattice of vortices to \"spatially distorted, but temporally steady, crystals.\" Then, as Wi increases further, the system shows \"a sequence of crystals that oscillate in time, periodically, at low Wi, and quasiperiodically, for slightly larger Wi.\" Finally, the system becomes disordered and displays \"spatiotemporal chaos and elastic turbulence.\" This progression matches the description in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it omits the intermediate phases of spatial distortion and oscillatory behavior.

A significant number of current industrial applications rely on web services. A cornerstone task in these applications is discovering a suitable service that meets the threshold of some user needs.

We argue that the prevailing approach to compose services based on the \"all or nothing\" paradigm is limiting and leads to exceedingly high rejection of potentially suitable services. Furthermore, contemporary models do not allow \"mix and match\" composition from atomic services of different composite services when binary matching is not possible or desired. In this paper, we propose a new model for service composition based on \"stratified graph summarization\" and \"service stitching\". We discuss the limitations of existing approaches with a motivating example, present our approach to overcome these limitations, and outline a possible architecture for service composition from atomic services.
