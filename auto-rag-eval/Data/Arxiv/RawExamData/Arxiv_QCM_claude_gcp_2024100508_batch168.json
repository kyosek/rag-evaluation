Observation of phenotypic diversity in a population of genetically identical cells is often linked to the stochastic nature of chemical reactions involved in gene regulatory networks.

We consider three basic gene regulation networks corresponding to transcription with and without gene state switching and translation. Using analytical expressions for the probability generating function of observables and Large Deviation Theory, we calculate the distribution and first two moments of the population averaged mRNA and protein levels as a function of model parameters, population size and number of measurements contained in a data set.

In stochastic gene expression models, individual cells show variability due to the random nature of chemical reactions. However, when we consider population averages, the Law of Large Numbers comes into play.\n\nAs the population size increases, the variance of the population-averaged mRNA levels is expected to decrease inversely proportional to the population size. This is because larger populations provide more samples, which tends to average out the individual variations and converge towards the true mean.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the variance does change with population size. Option B is incorrect because increasing population size reduces, not increases, variance. Option D is also incorrect; an exponential increase in variance with population size would lead to more, not less, variability in larger populations.\n\nThis question requires students to apply concepts from stochastic processes, statistics, and gene expression models, making it a challenging and integrative exam question."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "End-to-end training of time domain audio separation and recognition", "source": "Thilo von Neumann, Keisuke Kinoshita, Lukas Drude, Christoph\n  Boeddeker, Marc Delcroix, Tomohiro Nakatani, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach", "docs_id": "1912.08462", "section": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "End-to-end training of time domain audio separation and recognition.

The key innovation of M3Lcmf lies in its use of collaborative matrix factorization to address the complexities of M3L.

In this Letter we estimate and discuss the effects of episodicity on the mass-velocity and position-velocity relations observed in molecular outflows. We explain how many recent observational results disagree with the predictions of non-episodic outflow models, and we offer simple explanations for the discrepancies. In particular, we discuss how an episodic stellar outflow can steepen the power-law slope of the mass-velocity relation in a molecular outflow.

Here we identify key mechanisms through which noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for excitation transfer.

Main sequence low-mass stars are known to spin-down as a consequence of their magnetised stellar winds. However, estimating the precise rate of this spin-down is an open problem. The mass-loss rate, angular momentum-loss rate and the magnetic field properties of low-mass stars are fundamentally linked making this a challenging task. Of particular interest is the stellar magnetic field geometry. In this work, we consider whether non-dipolar field modes contribute significantly to the spin-down of low-mass stars. We do this using a sample of stars that have all been previously mapped with Zeeman-Doppler imaging. For a given star, as long as its mass-loss rate is below some critical mass-loss rate, only the dipolar fields contribute to its spin-down torque. However, if it has a larger mass-loss rate, higher order modes need to be considered. For each star, we calculate this critical mass-loss rate, which is a simple function of the field geometry. Additionally, we use two methods of estimating mass-loss rates for our sample of stars. In the majority of cases, we find that the estimated mass-loss rates do not exceed the critical mass-loss rate and hence, the dipolar magnetic field alone is sufficient to determine the spin-down torque.
