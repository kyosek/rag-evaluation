In order to better understand factor-based conditioning information with respect to expected stock returns within a regression tree setting, the analysis of stock returns is demonstrated using daily stock return data for 5 major US corporations. The first finding is that in all cases (solo and joint) the most informative factor is always the market excess return factor.

Here, we systematically study a hybrid-model which combines the network adaptation schemes intended to generate space-filling perfusion as well as optimal filtration of metabolites.

Implicit generative models are difficult to train as no explicit density functions are defined. Generative adversarial nets (GANs) present a minimax framework to train such models, which however can suffer from mode collapse due to the nature of the JS-divergence. This paper presents a learning by teaching (LBT) approach to learning implicit models, which intrinsically avoids the mode collapse problem by optimizing a KL-divergence rather than the JS-divergence in GANs. In LBT, an auxiliary density estimator is introduced to fit the implicit model's distribution while the implicit model teaches the density estimator to match the data distribution. LBT is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, whose optimal generator matches the true data distribution. LBT can be naturally integrated with GANs to derive a hybrid LBT-GAN that enjoys complimentary benefits.

Within the upper area the three typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S waves are not numerous, and there is no double body wave, whereas within the lower area there are sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. From those observations, we conclude that the stress domain is isotropic above the Aigion fault, and anisotropic below, which is consistent with conclusions drawn by authors from other kinds of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves suggests that this horizontal stress anisotropy is very high, up to 190 % with the maximum horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal stress close to zero at 939 meters in depth.

Such commitments are possible only with practically CO2-free power generation based on variable renewable technologies. Historically, the main point of criticism regarding renewable power is the variability driven by weather dependence. Power-to-X systems, which convert excess power to other stores of energy for later use, can play an important role in offsetting the variability of renewable power production.

To do this, the theory breaks Lorentz invariance at high energies by introducing a Lifshitz-type anisotropic scaling between space and time.
