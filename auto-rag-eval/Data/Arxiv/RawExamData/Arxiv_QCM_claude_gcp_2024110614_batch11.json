We reveal how monolayer $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematene) can be distinguished from the few-layer structures, and how they all differ from bulk through observable Raman spectra. The optical spectra exhibit gradual shift of the prominent peak to higher energy, as well as additional features at lower energy when $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is thinned down to a monolayer.

The advent of the era of Big Data has allowed many researchers to dig into various socio-technical systems, including social media platforms. In particular, these systems have provided them with certain verifiable means to look into certain aspects of human behavior. In this work, we are specifically interested in the behavior of individuals on social media platforms---how they handle the information they get, and how they share it. We look into Twitter to understand the dynamics behind the users' posting activities---tweets and retweets---zooming in on topics that peaked in popularity. Three mechanisms are considered: endogenous stimuli, exogenous stimuli, and a mechanism that dictates the decay of interest of the population in a topic.

The correct answer is A because the study found a strong correlation between the peculiarity of Am stars and their rotational velocity (Vsini). Specifically, the abundance of elements that are typically underabundant in Am stars increases with Vsini, while the abundance of elements that are typically overabundant decreases with Vsini.\n\nThis relationship suggests that rapid rotation tends to normalize the chemical composition of Am stars, making them more similar to normal A-type stars.

Option D is incorrect as it contradicts the observed trend where overabundant elements decrease in abundance with increasing rotation.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to analyze the relationship between stellar rotation and chemical composition, applying it to a hypothetical scenario, which aligns with higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

Recent years have witnessed the rapid proliferation of backscatter technologies that realize the ubiquitous and long-term connectivity to empower smart cities and smart homes. Localizing such backscatter tags is crucial for IoT-based smart applications. However, current backscatter localization systems require prior knowledge of the site, either a map or landmarks with known positions, which is laborious for deployment. To empower universal localization service, this paper presents Rover, an indoor localization system that localizes multiple backscatter tags without any start-up cost using a robot equipped with inertial sensors. Rover runs in a joint optimization framework, fusing measurements from backscattered WiFi signals and inertial sensors to simultaneously estimate the locations of both the robot and the connected tags.

We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation.

The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate no mRNAs are free and available for translation.

Data-dependent kernel: IDK uses a data-dependent point kernel, which is crucial for adapting to the dynamic nature of IoT sensor data. This addresses one of the key issues with traditional kernel mean embedding methods, which typically use data-independent kernels like the Gaussian kernel.\n\n2. Handling high-dimensional data: IoT sensor networks often produce high-dimensional data. IDK's approach can handle this more effectively than traditional methods, which often struggle with the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n\n3.

Efficiency: IDK^2 is described as running \"orders of magnitude faster\" than other group anomaly detectors like OCSMM. This is crucial for real-time anomaly detection in large-scale IoT networks.\n\n5. No explicit learning required: IDK and IDK^2 can perform anomaly detection without the need for explicit learning, which is advantageous in a dynamic IoT environment where patterns may change rapidly.\n\n6.

The motivic Galois group is the more comprehensive structure, with the renormalization group being identifiable as a specific subgroup within it.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the complex relationships between physical theories and mathematical structures, requiring a deep understanding of the concepts presented in the documentation."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "Influence of surface centers on the effective surface recombination rate\n  and the parameters of silicon solar cells", "source": "V.P.

The results of our researches of the influence of exponentially distributed surface centers on the effective surface recombination rate and the parameters of silicon solar cells (SCs) are reported. In our calculations, we assumed the acceptor and donor surface states to lie in the upper and lower, respectively, parts of the bandgap. The model also supposed a discrete surface level to exist in the middle of the energy gap. In the case where the integrated concentration of continuously distributed centers is comparable with that of deep surface levels, those centers can affect the SC parameters only due to the recombination. If the concentration of continuously distributed centers is comparable or higher than the concentration characterizing a charge built-in into the insulator, those centers directly affect the surface band bending and the photo-induced electromotive force. With the help of a computer simulation, the conditions for the rate of surface recombination through continuously distributed surface centers to exceed that through the deep discrete level are determined. A decrease of the open-circuit voltage in inverted silicon SCs associated with the recombination through continuously distributed centers is calculated. The obtained theoretical results are compared with the experimental data."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about silicon solar cells and surface recombination, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is investigating the impact of surface centers on silicon solar cell performance. They observe a significant decrease in open-circuit voltage in inverted silicon solar cells. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to explain this observation?\n\nA) The integrated concentration of continuously distributed centers is much lower than the concentration of deep discrete levels\nB) The recombination rate through deep discrete levels exceeds that of continuously distributed surface centers\nC) The concentration of continuously distributed centers is comparable to or higher than the charge built into the insulator\nD) The acceptor and donor surface states are evenly distributed across the entire bandgap\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests the understanding of how different types of surface centers affect solar cell parameters, particularly the open-circuit voltage in inverted silicon solar cells. The correct answer is C because the documentation states that when \"the concentration of continuously distributed centers is comparable or higher than the concentration characterizing a charge built-in into the insulator, those centers directly affect the surface band bending and the photo-induced electromotive force.\" This scenario would lead to a decrease in open-circuit voltage due to increased recombination through these centers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a low concentration of continuously distributed centers compared to deep discrete levels would not significantly impact the cell's performance. Option B is also incorrect, as the question asks about a decrease in open-circuit voltage, which is more likely when recombination through continuously distributed centers is higher. Option D is a distractor based on a misinterpretation of the surface state distribution described in the documentation, which actually states that acceptor and donor surface states lie in the upper and lower parts of the bandgap, respectively.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the relationship between surface center concentrations, recombination rates, and their effects on solar cell parameters. It also tests the ability to apply this knowledge to a real-world scenario of investigating solar cell performance."}}
