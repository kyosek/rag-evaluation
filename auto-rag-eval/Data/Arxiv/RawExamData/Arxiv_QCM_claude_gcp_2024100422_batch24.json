It was recently suggested that such planets may form by the partial destruction of GI protoplanets: energy output due to the growth of a massive core may unbind all or most of the surrounding pre-collapse protoplanet. Here we present the first 3D global disc simulations that simultaneously resolve grain dynamics in the disc and within the protoplanet.

Cued and un-cued cell polarization is a fundamental mechanism in cell biology. As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been proposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known phenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and elegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and coworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with other networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has to be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a spatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to preserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we numerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded perturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss depends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the kind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an increase of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of polarization.
