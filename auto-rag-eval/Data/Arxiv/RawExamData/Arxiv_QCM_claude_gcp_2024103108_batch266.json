The past few decades have seen exponential growth in capabilities of digital electronics primarily due to the ability to scale Integrated Circuits (ICs) to smaller dimensions while attaining power and performance benefits. That scalability is now being challenged due to the lack of scaled transistor performance and also manufacturing complexities [1]-[5]. In addition, the growing cyber threat in fabless manufacturing era poses a new front that modern ICs need to withstand. We present a new noise based computing where the interconnect interference between nanoscale metal lines is intentionally engineered to exhibit programmable Boolean logic behavior. The reliance on just coupling between metal lines and not on transistors for computing, and the programmability are the foundations for better scalability, and security by obscurity. Here, we show experimental evidence of a functioning Crosstalk computing chip at 65nm technology. Our demonstration of computing constructs, gate level configurability and utilization of foundry processes show feasibility. These results in conjunction with our simulation results at 7nm for various benchmarks, which show over 48%, 57%, and 10% density, power and performance respectively, gains over equivalent CMOS in the best case, show potentials.

A popular formalism for multiagent control applies tools from game theory, casting a multiagent decision problem as a cooperation-style game in which individual agents make local choices to optimize their own local utility functions in response to the observable choices made by other agents. When the system-level objective is submodular maximization, it is known that if every agent can observe the action choice of all other agents, then all Nash equilibria of a large class of resulting games are within a factor of $2$ of optimal; that is, the price of anarchy is $1/2$.

The design of cooperative adaptive cruise control is critical in mixed traffic flow, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to handle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state deviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model predictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs' trajectories to mitigate the deviation at each time step. However, as the replan process is usually conducted by solving an optimization problem with information through inter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and communicational burdens. To address this limitation, a robust platoon control framework is proposed based on tube MPC in this paper. The prediction uncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted inside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or additional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered to plan a ``tube'' (a sequence of the set), which can bound CAVs' actual trajectories.

TDA is a growing field in the mathematical and computational sciences, that consists of algorithmic methods for identifying global and multi-scale structures in high-dimensional data sets that may be noisy and incomplete. TDA has identified the effect of ageing on vessel networks in the brain and more recently proposed to study blood flow and stenosis. Here we present preliminary work which shows how TDA of spatial network structure can be used to characterise tumour vasculature."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the potential of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in studying tumour vasculature, as suggested by the research?\n\nA) TDA can only be used to study healthy blood vessel networks and is not applicable to abnormal vasculature.\n\nB) TDA is primarily useful for identifying the effects of ageing on brain vessel networks but has limited application in tumor studies.\n\nC) TDA can characterize spatial network structures of tumour vasculature, potentially revealing new links between vessel structure and disease progression.\n\nD) TDA is exclusively used for analyzing blood flow and stenosis in tumour vessels, without considering overall network structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage states that TDA can be used to study vessel network structures and has been applied to identify aging effects in brain vessels. More importantly, it explicitly mentions \"preliminary work which shows how TDA of spatial network structure can be used to characterise tumour vasculature.\" This indicates that TDA has the potential to reveal new insights into the relationship between vessel structure and disease in tumours.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage suggests TDA can be applied to both healthy and abnormal tissues. Option B is too limited, as the text indicates TDA's applicability beyond just aging effects in brain vessels. Option D is overly specific and doesn't capture the broader potential of TDA in analyzing overall network structure, as described in the passage."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Okapi: Causally Consistent Geo-Replication Made Faster, Cheaper and More\n  Available", "source": "Diego Didona, Kristina Spirovska, Willy Zwaenepoel", "docs_id": "1702.04263", "section": ["cs.DC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Okapi: Causally Consistent Geo-Replication Made Faster, Cheaper and More\n  Available.

Second, Okapi achieves higher resource efficiency and better availability, at the expense of a slight increase in update visibility latency. To this end, Okapi implements a new stabilization protocol that uses a combination of vector and scalar clocks and makes a remote update visible when its delivery has been acknowledged by every data center. We evaluate Okapi with different workloads on Amazon AWS, using three geographically distributed regions and 96 nodes. We compare Okapi with two recent approaches to causal consistency, Cure and GentleRain.

Healing of soft biological tissue is the process of self-recovering or self-repairing the injured or damaged extracellular matrix (ECM). Healing is assumed to be stress-driven, with the objective of returning to a homeostatic stress metrics in the tissue after replacing the damaged ECM with new undamaged one. However, based on the existence of intrinsic length-scales in soft tissues, it is thought that computational models of healing should be non-local. In the present study, we introduce for the first time two gradient-enhanced con-stitutive healing models for soft tissues including non-local variables. The first model combines a continuum damage model with a temporally homogenized growth model, where the growth direction is determined according to local principal stress directions. The second one is based on a gradient-enhanced healing model with continuously recoverable damage variable. Both models are implemented in the finite-element package Abaqus by means of a user sub-routine UEL.
