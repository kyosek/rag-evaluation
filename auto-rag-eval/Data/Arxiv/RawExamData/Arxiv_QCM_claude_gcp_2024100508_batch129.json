Diffusion models have recently attained significant interest within the community owing to their strong performance as generative models.

Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion.

The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance.

Recent studies with simplified models have identified two advantages of coupling fast and slow feedback loops. Namely, this dual-time structure enables a fast response while enhancing resistances of responses and bistability to stimulus noise. We now find that in addition: 1) the dual-time structure confers resistance to internal noise due to molecule number fluctuations, and 2) model variants with altered coupling, which better represent some specific systems, share all the above advantages. We develop a similar bistable model with a fast autoactivation loop coupled to a slow loop, which minimally represents positive feedback that may be essential for long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). The advantages of fast response and noise resistance carry over to this model. Empirically, LTP develops resistance to reversal over ~1 h. The model suggests this resistance may result from increased amounts of synaptic kinases involved in positive feedback."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of interlinked dual-time feedback loops in biochemical systems, as discussed in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) They only enhance resistance to external stimulus noise and have no effect on internal noise.\n\nB) They provide a fast response and enhance resistance to both external stimulus noise and internal noise due to molecule number fluctuations, but do not affect bistability.\n\nC) They solely improve the speed of response in biochemical systems without affecting noise resistance or memory persistence.\n\nD) They enable a fast response, enhance resistance to both external stimulus noise and internal noise due to molecule number fluctuations, improve bistability, and may contribute to the persistence of long-term synaptic potentiation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it comprehensively captures the advantages of interlinked dual-time feedback loops described in the documentation.

I gathered a large sample that comprised observations of the treatment group (4,682) and the control group (2,268).

The past decade has seen a dramatic increase of practical applications of the microwave gyrosynchrotron emission for plasma diagnostics and three-dimensional modeling of solar flares and other astrophysical objects. This break-through turned out to become possible due to apparently minor, technical development of Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes, which enormously reduced the computation time needed to calculate a single spectrum, while preserving accuracy of the computation. However, the available fast codes are limited in that they could only be used for a factorized distribution over the energy and pitch-angle, while the distributions of electrons over energy or pitch-angle are limited to a number of predefined analytical functions. In realistic simulations, these assumptions do not hold; thus, the codes free from the mentioned limitations are called for. To remedy this situation, we extended our fast codes to work with an arbitrary input distribution function of radiating electrons. We accomplished this by implementing fast codes for a distribution function described by an arbitrary numerically-defined array. In addition, we removed several other limitations of the available fast codes and improved treatment of the free-free component.
