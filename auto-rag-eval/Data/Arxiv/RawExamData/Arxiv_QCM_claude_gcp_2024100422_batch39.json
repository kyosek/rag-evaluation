In this paper, we study the design and analysis of optimal detection scheme for sensors that are deployed to monitor the change in the environment and are powered by the energy harvested from the environment. In this type of applications, detection delay is of paramount importance. We model this problem as quickest change detection problem with a stochastic energy constraint. In particular, a wireless sensor powered by renewable energy takes observations from a random sequence, whose distribution will change at a certain unknown time. Such a change implies events of interest. The energy in the sensor is consumed by taking observations and is replenished randomly. The sensor cannot take observations if there is no energy left in the battery. Our goal is to design a power allocation scheme and a detection strategy to minimize the worst case detection delay, which is the difference between the time when an alarm is raised and the time when the change occurs. Two types of average run length (ARL) constraint, namely an algorithm level ARL constraint and an system level ARL constraint, are considered. We propose a low complexity scheme in which the energy allocation rule is to spend energy to take observations as long as the battery is not empty and the detection scheme is the Cumulative Sum test. We show that this scheme is optimal for the formulation with the algorithm level ARL constraint and is asymptotically optimal for the formulations with the system level ARL constraint."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of quickest change detection with stochastic energy constraints, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the proposed low complexity scheme?\n\nA) It uses the Cumulative Sum test as the detection strategy\nB) It is optimal for formulations with algorithm level ARL constraints\nC) It is asymptotically optimal for formulations with system level ARL constraints\nD) It allocates energy for observations only when the battery is fully charged\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the proposed low complexity scheme allocates energy to take observations as long as the battery is not empty, not only when it's fully charged.

Building a network with directional beams changes the interference behavior, since, narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages. Such sensitivity to blockages causes uncertainty in the active interfering node locations. Configuration uncertainty may also manifest in the spectral domain while applying dynamic channel and frequency assignment to support 5G applications.

However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders are unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the presence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing models.

One group heard the words pronounced by a single talker, while another group heard them pronounced by multiple talkers. On the third day, they completed a variety of tasks to evaluate their learning. Our results show a robust influence of orthography, with faster response times in both production (picture naming) and recognition (picture mapping) tasks for words learned in the Audio-Ortho condition. Moreover, formant analyses of the picture naming responses show that orthographic input pulls pronunciations of English novel words towards a non-native (French) phonological target. Words learned with their orthographic forms were pronounced more precisely (with smaller Dispersion Scores), but were misplaced in the vowel space (as reflected by smaller Euclidian distances with respect to French vowels). Finally, we found only limited evidence of an effect of talker-based acoustic variability: novel words learned with multiple talkers showed faster responses times in the picture naming task, but only in the Audio-only condition, which suggests that orthographic information may have overwhelmed any advantage of talker-based acoustic variability."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the study, which of the following statements best describes the impact of orthographic input on L2 English word learning by L1 French participants?\n\nA) Orthographic input led to slower response times in production and recognition tasks.\nB) Orthographic input resulted in more native-like English pronunciations.\nC) Orthographic input improved response times but pulled pronunciations towards French phonology.\nD) Orthographic input had no significant effect on pronunciation or response times.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the study found that orthographic input (Audio-Ortho condition) led to faster response times in both production (picture naming) and recognition (picture mapping) tasks. However, it also caused pronunciations to be pulled towards a non-native (French) phonological target. The text states that words learned with orthographic forms were pronounced more precisely but were \"misplaced in the vowel space\" and showed \"smaller Euclidian distances with respect to French vowels.\" This indicates that while orthography improved speed, it also resulted in pronunciations that were closer to French phonology rather than native English pronunciations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study found faster, not slower, response times with orthographic input. Option B is incorrect because the orthographic input actually led to more French-like, not English-like, pronunciations.

In this paper, we relax this assumption by proposing a flexible law of motion for the TVPs in large-scale vector autoregressions (VARs). Instead of imposing a restrictive random walk evolution of the latent states, we carefully design hierarchical mixture priors on the coefficients in the state equation. These priors effectively allow for discriminating between periods where coefficients evolve according to a random walk and times where the TVPs are better characterized by a stationary stochastic process. Moreover, this approach is capable of introducing dynamic sparsity by pushing small parameter changes towards zero if necessary. The merits of the model are illustrated by means of two applications.
