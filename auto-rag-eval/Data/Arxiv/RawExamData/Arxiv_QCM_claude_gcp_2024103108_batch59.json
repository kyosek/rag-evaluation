Inspired by the lotus effect, many studies in the last decade have focused on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces.

However, the mechanisms and parameters that control drag reduction, e.g. Reynolds number and pattern geometry, are still unclear. We propose an effective medium representation of the micro-features, that treats the latter as a porous medium, and provides a framework to model flow over patterned surfaces in both Cassie and Wenzel states.

The functionality of soft interfaces is crucial to many applications in biology and surface science. Recent studies have used liquid drops to probe the surface mechanics of elastomeric networks. Experiments suggest an intricate surface elasticity, also known as the Shuttleworth effect, where surface tension is not constant but depends on substrate deformation. However, interpretations have remained controversial due to singular elastic deformations, induced exactly at the point where the droplet pulls the network. Here we reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic substrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy. First, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive finite element simulations. This confirms the universal validity, also at large elastic deformations, of the previously disputed Neumann's law for the contact angles. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that describe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement with numerics, and show that the stretch at the contact line, as previously measured experimentally, consistently points to a strong Shuttleworth effect.

Establishing these theoretical properties explains the mechanism of the design and provides assurance to practitioners regarding the behavior of the keyboard design. We further extend the keyboard design to dual-agent dose-finding trials, which inherit the same statistical properties and simplicity as the single-agent keyboard design. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed keyboard drug-combination design using a novel, random two-dimensional dose--toxicity scenario generating algorithm. The simulation results confirm the desirable and competitive operating characteristics of the keyboard design as established by the theoretical study.
