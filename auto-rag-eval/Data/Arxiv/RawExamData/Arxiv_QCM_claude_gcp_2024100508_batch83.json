For an $n$-element universe $U$ and a family $\\scr F$ of its subsets, trimmed Moebius inversion allows us to compute the number of packings, coverings, and partitions of $U$ with $k$ sets from $\\scr F$ in time within a polynomial factor (in $n$) of the number of supersets of the members of $\\scr F$.

The time complexity is just O(n^1.5). resulting computing times range from seconds for 10^4 objects to minutes for 10^5 objects and to less than an hour for 10^6 objects.

The model consists of a large population of phase oscillators with all-to-all sinusoidal coupling. The oscillators' intrinsic frequencies are randomly distributed across the population according to a prescribed probability density, here taken to be unimodal and symmetric about its mean. As the coupling between the oscillators is increased, the system spontaneously synchronizes: the oscillators near the center of the frequency distribution lock their phases together and run at the same frequency, while those in the tails remain unlocked and drift at different frequencies. Although this ``partially locked'' state has been observed in simulations for decades, its stability has never been analyzed mathematically.

Understanding how the structure of community interactions is modified by coevolution is vital for understanding system responses to change at all scales. However, in absence of a group selection process, collective community behaviours cannot be organised or adapted in a Darwinian sense. An open question thus persists: are there alternative organising principles that enable us to understand how coevolution of component species creates complex collective behaviours exhibited at the community level? We address this issue using principles from connectionist learning, a discipline with well-developed theories of emergent behaviours in simple networks. We identify conditions where selection on ecological interactions is equivalent to 'unsupervised learning' (a simple type of connectionist learning) and observe that this enables communities to self organize without community-level selection.

Since their development in 2001, regularised stokeslets have become a popular numerical tool for low-Reynolds number flows since the replacement of a point force by a smoothed blob overcomes many computational difficulties associated with flow singularities (Cortez, 2001, \\textit{SIAM J.

An explicit formula for the flow from any regularised stokeslet is first derived, which is shown to simplify for spherically symmetric blobs. Far from the centre of any regularised stokeslet we show that the flow can be written in terms of an infinite number of singularity solutions provided the blob decays sufficiently rapidly.

Slowly-decaying blobs induce additional flow resulting from the non-zero body forces acting on the fluid.

This star is particularly important as this is one of the brightest Cepheids in the Galaxy and an analog of the Cepheids used to determine extragalactic distances. An accurate distance of 1910 +/- 80 pc (+/- 4.2%) has recently been determined for RS Pup using the light echoes propagating in its circumstellar nebula. We combine this distance with new VLTI/PIONIER interferometric angular diameters, photometry and radial velocities to derive the p-factor of RS Pup using the code Spectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars (SPIPS). We obtain p = 1.250 +/- 0.064 (+/-5.1%), defined for cross-correlation radial velocities. Together with measurements from the literature, the p-factor of RS Pup confirms the good agreement of a constant p = 1.293 +/- 0.039 (+/-3.0%) model with the observations. We conclude that the p-factor of Cepheids is constant or mildly variable over a broad range of periods (3.7 to 41.5 days)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is using the Baade-Wesselink (BW) technique to determine the distance to a Cepheid variable star. They accurately measure the star's radial velocities and angular diameters, but are unsure about the appropriate p-factor to use. Based on the study of RS Puppis, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the p-factor for Cepheids?\n\nA) The p-factor varies significantly with the pulsation period of the Cepheid, ranging from 1.1 for short-period Cepheids to 1.5 for long-period Cepheids.\n\nB) The p-factor for RS Puppis was determined to be exactly 1.293, and this value should be used for all Cepheids regardless of their pulsation period.\n\nC) The p-factor appears to be constant or only mildly variable, with a value of 1.293 \u00b1 0.039 being consistent with observations for Cepheids with periods ranging from 3.7 to 41.5 days.\n\nD) The p-factor for long-period Cepheids like RS Puppis (P = 41.5 days) is significantly lower than for short-period Cepheids, with a value of 1.250 \u00b1 0.064 for RS Puppis specifically.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The study of RS Puppis, a long-period Cepheid, provided valuable insights into the p-factor used in the Baade-Wesselink technique. The research found that a constant p-factor model of 1.293 \u00b1 0.039 is in good agreement with observations across a broad range of Cepheid periods, from 3.7 to 41.5 days. While the specific p-factor for RS Puppis was determined to be 1.250 \u00b1 0.064, this value is consistent with the broader constant model within the margins of error. The study concludes that the p-factor is either constant or only mildly variable across this period range, which is important for the reliability of Cepheid distance measurements."}, "52": {"documentation": {"title": "Trade Selection with Supervised Learning and OCA", "source": "David Saltiel and Eric Benhamou", "docs_id": "1812.04486", "section": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Trade Selection with Supervised Learning and OCA. In recent years, state-of-the-art methods for supervised learning have exploited increasingly gradient boosting techniques, with mainstream efficient implementations such as xgboost or lightgbm. One of the key points in generating proficient methods is Feature Selection (FS). It consists in selecting the right valuable effective features. When facing hundreds of these features, it becomes critical to select best features. While filter and wrappers methods have come to some maturity, embedded methods are truly necessary to find the best features set as they are hybrid methods combining features filtering and wrapping.

We derive this new method using coordinate ascent optimization and using block variables. We compare our method to Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Binary Coordinate Ascent (BCA). We show on a real life example the capacity of this method to select good trades a priori. Not only this method outperforms the initial trading strategy as it avoids taking loosing trades, it also surpasses other method, having the smallest feature set and the highest score at the same time.
