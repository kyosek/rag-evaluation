In this context, an enlargement of the strategy basis by including additional biological effects of UV radiation studied during the past years has been discussed. For instance, the weight of the spectral UV-A (315 - 400 nm) band that in practice had been neglected by UVI definition can be enhanced since it was found to play an important role in DNA damaging.

The discovery of topological states of matter has profoundly augmented our understanding of phase transitions in physical systems.

It is characterized by the first Chern number which manifests in the quantized Hall response induced by an external electric field. Generalizing the quantum Hall effect to four-dimensional systems leads to the appearance of a novel non-linear Hall response that is quantized as well, but described by a 4D topological invariant - the second Chern number.

It is acknowledged as a significant challenge to Australian hospitals for MRSA infection control. Nursing professionals are in urgent need of the study of MRSA nosocomial infection controls. This review provides insight into the hand washing and isolation infection-control strategies for MRSA.

A characteristic feature of collective and particle-hole excitations in neutron-rich nuclei is that many of them couple to unbound neutron in continuum single-particle orbits.

In an attempt to apply cRPA to the radiative neutron capture reaction, we formulate in the present study an extended scheme of cRPA that describes gamma-transitions from the excited states under consideration, which decay to low-lying excited states as well as the ground state. This is achieved by introducing a non-local one-body operator which causes transitions to a low-lying excited state, and describing a density-matrix response against this operator.
