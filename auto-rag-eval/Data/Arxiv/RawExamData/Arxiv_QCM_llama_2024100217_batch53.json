Gaseous detectors are widely used in high energy physics, and are attractive choices in tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography. Such detectors offer high resolution and high efficiency at reasonable cost for large sizes, however, one of the drawbacks is that the gaseous detection medium must be prevented from contamination by outside air or internal outgassing. Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such \"breathing\" effect can be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contamination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system with 0.9 square meter area, total volume of 160 l, has been operated for 36 days with a flow of 3 l/day, confirming that the buffer volume, in this case a 50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufficient gas quality.

This poses a fundamental challenge for hardware implementations of DNNs, and for their deployment in critical applications such as autonomous driving.

We focus on binary data and linear codes. Our main result is that the prevalent parity code can guarantee robustness for a large family of DNNs, which includes the recently popularized binarized neural networks.
