This paper formulates and studies a general continuous-time behavioral portfolio selection model under Kahneman and Tversky's (cumulative) prospect theory, featuring S-shaped utility (value) functions and probability distortions. Unlike the conventional expected utility maximization model, such a behavioral model could be easily mis-formulated (a.k.a. ill-posed) if its different components do not coordinate well with each other. Certain classes of an ill-posed model are identified. A systematic approach, which is fundamentally different from the ones employed for the utility model, is developed to solve a well-posed model, assuming a complete market and general It\\^o processes for asset prices. The optimal terminal wealth positions, derived in fairly explicit forms, possess surprisingly simple structure reminiscent of a gambling policy betting on a good state of the world while accepting a fixed, known loss in case of a bad one. An example with a two-piece CRRA utility is presented to illustrate the general results obtained, and is solved completely for all admissible parameters. The effect of the behavioral criterion on the risky allocations is finally discussed."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the Behavioral Portfolio Selection in Continuous Time paper, what is the primary challenge in formulating a well-posed model, and how does the developed systematic approach address this issue?\n\n**A)** The primary challenge is the non-coordination of the different components of the model, which can lead to ill-posedness. The systematic approach addresses this issue by assuming a complete market and general It\u00f4 processes for asset prices, which ensures that the model's components are well-coordinated.\n\n**B)** The primary challenge is the difficulty in specifying the probability distortions in the utility function. The systematic approach addresses this issue by developing a general framework that can accommodate different types of probability distortions.\n\n**C)** The primary challenge is the non-convexity of the utility function, which can lead to non-convex optimization problems. The systematic approach addresses this issue by assuming a complete market and general It\u00f4 processes for asset prices, which allows for the use of convex optimization techniques.\n\n**D)** The primary challenge is the lack of information about the risk preferences of the investor. The systematic approach addresses this issue by assuming a complete market and general It\u00f4 processes for asset prices, which allows for the estimation of the investor's risk preferences.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The primary challenge is the non-coordination of the different components of the model, which can lead to ill-posedness. The systematic approach addresses this issue by assuming a complete market and general It\u00f4 processes for asset prices, which ensures that the model's components are well-coordinated.\n\n**Explanation:** The paper highlights the importance of coordination between the different components of the behavioral portfolio selection model. If these components do not coordinate well with each other, the model can be ill-posed, leading to non-existent or non-uniqueness solutions. The systematic approach developed in the paper addresses this issue by assuming a complete market and general It\u00f4 processes for asset prices, which ensures that the model's components are well-coordinated and the model is well-posed.

We demonstrate a nondestructive measurement of light propagation in ONFs by sampling the local evanescent field with a microfiber. This approach reveals the behavior of all propagating modes, and because the modal beat lengths in cylindrical waveguides depend strongly on radius, simultaneously provides exquisite sensitivity to the ONF radius.

We demonstrate the utility of our method applied to nano-scale electron microscopy data, where even relatively small portions of animal brains can require terabytes of image data. Although supervised methods can be used to predict and identify known patterns of interest, the scale of the data makes it difficult to mine and analyze patterns that are not known a priori. We show the ability of our learned representation to enable query by example, so that if a scientist notices an interesting pattern in the data, they can be presented with other locations with matching patterns. We also demonstrate that clustering of data in the learned space correlates with biologically-meaningful distinctions. Finally, we introduce a visualization tool and software ecosystem to facilitate user-friendly interactive analysis and uncover interesting biological patterns.

In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence infilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete sentence. We emphasize \"storiability\" as a desirable feature of the resulting sentences, where \"storiable\" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader would be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a neural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting, people wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed the sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers then assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a subsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as more storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that storiability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the examples. This result gives evidence of an \"inspiration through observation\" paradigm for human-computer collaborative writing, through which human writing can be enhanced by text generation models without directly copying their output."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the study on \"Inspiration through Observation: Demonstrating the Influence of Automatically Generated Text on Creative Writing\", what is the primary finding regarding the effect of observing automatically generated text on human writing, specifically in the context of sentence infilling?\n\n**A)** Human authors who observed generated examples produced sentences that were less storiable than those who did not observe them.\n**B)** Human authors who observed generated examples produced sentences that were more storiable than those who did not observe them, and this effect increased as authors derived more semantic content from the examples.\n**C)** Human authors who observed generated examples produced sentences that were equally storiable as those who did not observe them.\n**D)** Human authors who observed generated examples produced sentences that were less storiable than those who wrote without observing generated examples.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) Human authors who observed generated examples produced sentences that were more storiable than those who did not observe them, and this effect increased as authors derived more semantic content from the examples.\n\n**Explanation:** The study found that human-authored sentences were judged as more storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that storiability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the examples.

The theory is applied to lower Balmer lines and the theoretical and observational impact of the new broadening theory is examined. It is shown that this theory leads to considerable differences in the predicted line profiles in cool stars when compared with previous theories which include only resonance interactions.

Knowledge graphs contain knowledge about the world and provide a structured representation of this knowledge. Current knowledge graphs contain only a small subset of what is true in the world.

Tensor factorization approaches have proved promising for such link prediction problems. Proposed in 1927, Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is among the first tensor factorization approaches.

The technical difficulties and suggested methods are briefly discussed."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of spatial public goods games, what is the paradoxical outcome when both individual (peer) and institutional (pool) punishments are present, and how does it relate to the evolution of strategy distribution?\n\n**A)** Peer punishers always dominate pool punishers, leading to a stable cooperator equilibrium.\n**B)** The synergy factor, punishment cost, and fine all have a synergistic effect on the prevalence of peer punishers, resulting in a robust cooperator outcome.\n**C)** Pool punishers can only survive in the limit of weak peer punishment, while peer punishers can control the system behavior in a large segment of parameters, but both types of punishment can extinguish each other's impact, leading to the triumph of defectors.\n**D)** The presence of peer punishment leads to a decrease in the frequency of pool punishers, resulting in a shift towards a defector-dominated equilibrium.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) Pool punishers can only survive in the limit of weak peer punishment, while peer punishers can control the system behavior in a large segment of parameters, but both types of punishment can extinguish each other's impact, leading to the triumph of defectors.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the paradoxical outcome mentioned in the documentation, where both peer and pool punishers can lead to the triumph of defectors when their impact is extinguished. This requires an understanding of the complex interactions between individual and institutional punishments in spatial public goods games. The correct answer highlights the nuanced relationship between peer and pool punishers, and how their coexistence can lead to an unstable equilibrium."}}
