Ho\\v{r}ava gravity at a Lifshitz point is a theory intended to quantize gravity by using techniques of traditional quantum field theories. To avoid Ostrogradsky's ghosts, a problem that has been plaguing quantization of general relativity since the middle of 1970's, Ho\\v{r}ava chose to break the Lorentz invariance by a Lifshitz-type of anisotropic scaling between space and time at the ultra-high energy, while recovering (approximately) the invariance at low energies.

The key challenge it addresses is avoiding Ostrogradsky's ghosts, which have been a persistent problem in quantizing general relativity. To tackle this, Ho\\v{r}ava's approach breaks Lorentz invariance at ultra-high energies by employing a Lifshitz-type anisotropic scaling between space and time. The theory then aims to recover (approximately) Lorentz invariance at low energies. This approach is reflected in option B, which correctly captures the essence of Ho\\v{r}ava gravity's strategy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Ho\\v{r}ava gravity does not preserve Lorentz invariance at all energy scales; breaking this invariance at high energies is a key feature of the theory. Option C is wrong because the theory does not maintain strict Lorentz invariance, and solving the ghost problem is achieved by breaking this invariance, not by maintaining it.

Based on a recent model of evolving viruses competing with an adapting immune system [1], we study the conditions under which a viral quasispecies can maximize its growth rate. The range of mutation rates that allows viruses to thrive is limited from above due to genomic information deterioration, and from below by insufficient sequence diversity, which leads to a quick eradication of the virus by the immune system. The mutation rate that optimally balances these two requirements depends to first order on the ratio of the inverse of the virus' growth rate and the time the immune system needs to develop a specific answer to an antigen. We find that a virus is most viable if it generates exactly one mutation within the time it takes for the immune system to adapt to a new viral epitope. Experimental viral mutation rates, in particular for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), seem to suggest that many viruses have achieved their optimal mutation rate. [1] C.Kamp and S.

For the purpose of phase space reconstruction from nonlinear time series, delay selection is one of the most vital criteria.

However, in that case, the delay selection is limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI between two variables only. The corresponding reconstructed phase space is also not satisfactory. To overcome the situation, a high-dimensional estimator of the MI is used; it selects more than one delay between more than two variables. The quality of the reconstructed phase space is tested by shape distortion parameter (SD), it is found that even this multidimensional MI sometimes fails to produce a less distorted phase space.
