In this work we include black hole (BH) seeding, growth and feedback into our semi-analytic galaxy formation model, Delphi. Our model now fully tracks the, accretion- and merger-driven, hierarchical assembly of the dark matter halo, baryonic and BH masses of high-redshift ($z>5$) galaxies. We use a minimal set of mass- and $z$-independent free parameters associated with star formation and BH growth (and feedback) and include suppressed BH growth in low-mass galaxies to explore a number of physical scenarios including: (i) two types of BH seeds (stellar and those from Direct Collapse BH; DCBH); (ii) the impact of reionization feedback; and (iii) the impact of instantaneous versus delayed galaxy mergers on the baryonic growth. While both reionization feedback and delayed galaxy mergers have no sensible impact on the evolving ultra-violet luminosity function, the latter limits the maximum BH masses achieved at these high-$z$. We then use this model, baselined against all available high-$z$ galaxy and BH data-sets, to predict the LISA detectability of merger events at $z > 5$. As expected, the merger rate is dominated by stellar BH mergers for all scenarios and our model predicts an expected upper limit of about 20 mergers in the case of instantaneous merging and no reionization feedback over the 4-year mission duration.

In our work, a real options valuation (ROV) framework is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for executing multiple interacting options within a distribution network investment, to mitigate the risk of financial losses in the presence of future uncertainties. To demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the optimal strategy to economically justify the investment in residential PV-battery systems for additional grid supply during peak demand periods.

The resolution methodology relies on the connection between Nash equilibrium and the corresponding system of quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs in short). We prove, by means of the weak dynamic programming principle for the stochastic differential game, that the value function of each player is a constrained viscosity solution to the associated QVIs system in the class of linear growth functions. We also introduce a family of value functions converging to our value function of each player, and which is characterized as the unique constrained viscosity solutions of an approximation of our QVIs system. This convergence result is useful for numerical purpose.
