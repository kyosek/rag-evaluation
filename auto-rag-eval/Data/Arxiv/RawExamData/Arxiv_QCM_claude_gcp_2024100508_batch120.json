Employing nonparametric methods for density estimation has become routine in Bayesian statistical practice.

In this work we propose a method that produces parsimonious mixture models (i.e. mixtures that discourage the creation of redundant clusters), without sacrificing flexibility or model fit.

Assortment optimization is an important problem that arises in many industries such as retailing and online advertising where the goal is to find a subset of products from a universe of substitutable products which maximize seller's expected revenue. One of the key challenges in this problem is to model the customer substitution behavior. Many parametric random utility maximization (RUM) based choice models have been considered in the literature. However, in all these models, probability of purchase increases as we include more products to an assortment. This is not true in general and in many settings more choices hurt sales. This is commonly referred to as the choice overload. In this paper we attempt to address this limitation in RUM through a generalization of the Markov chain based choice model considered in Blanchet et al. (2016). As a special case, we show that our model reduces to a generalization of MNL with no-purchase attractions dependent on the assortment S and strictly increasing with the size of assortment S.

This spectral analysis is developed by implementing the method of separation of variables (SoV). The transfer matrix spectrum (both eigenvalues and eigenstates) is completely characterized in terms of the set of solutions to a discrete system of polynomial equations in a given class of functions. Moreover, we prove an equivalent characterization as the set of solutions to a Baxter's like T-Q functional equation and rewrite the transfer matrix eigenstates in an algebraic Bethe ansatz form.
