The influence of pairing correlations on the neutron root mean square (rms) radius of nuclei is investigated in the framework of self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations.

We find that, as the pairing strength increases, the neutron rms radius first shrinks, reaches a minimum and beyond this point it expands again. The shrinkage is due to the the so-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the asymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing. However, in some cases, increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the nucleus due to a growing occupation of so-called `halo' orbits, i.e. weakly bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-$\\ell $ values. In this case, the neutron radii are extended just by the influence of pairing correlations, since these `halo' orbits cannot be occupied without pairing.

This is solely due to the pairing anti-halo effect and the occupation of core orbitals.\n\nC) The neutron rms radius consistently increases due to the growing occupation of halo orbits, which are weakly bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-\u2113 values.\n\nD) The neutron rms radius first shrinks, reaches a minimum, and then expands again. This complex behavior is due to the interplay between the pairing anti-halo effect and the potential occupation of halo orbits in the continuum.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately describes the complex behavior of the neutron rms radius as the pairing strength increases. Initially, the radius shrinks due to the pairing anti-halo effect, which decreases the asymptotic density distribution. However, as pairing strength continues to increase, the radius can expand again due to the growing occupation of halo orbits (weakly bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-\u2113 values).

Our safety system consists of two modules namely handcrafted safety and dynamically-learned safety. The handcrafted safety module is a heuristic safety rule based on common driving practice that ensure a minimum relative gap to a traffic vehicle. On the other hand, the dynamically-learned safety module is a data-driven safety rule that learns safety patterns from driving data. Specifically, the dynamically-leaned safety module incorporates a model lookahead beyond the immediate reward of reinforcement learning to predict safety longer into the future. If one of the future states leads to a near-miss or collision, then a negative reward will be assigned to the reward function to avoid collision and accelerate the learning process.

The documentation describes a process where external stimulus signals at different driving frequencies (representing different neural stimuli) can drive the coupled Kuramoto oscillators into different synchronized groups. These groups are locked to the same effective frequencies and recover different synchronized patterns. These patterns are closely related to the predetermined frequency distributions of the oscillators, which represent the stored \"memory\" in this model. This mechanism explains how the brain might store and retrieve information through synchronized patterns emerging in response to external inputs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the model specifically requires external stimuli to trigger the synchronization that leads to information retrieval. Option C is wrong because the model relies on synchronization, not desynchronization, for information retrieval. Option D is incorrect as the network is not always fully synchronized; it operates in a critical state just below the synchronization threshold, and synchronization occurs in response to specific stimuli."}, "22": {"documentation": {"title": "On Noether's theorem for the Euler-Poincar\\'e equation on the\n  diffeomorphism group with advected quantities", "source": "Colin J.

Animals within groups need to coordinate their reactions to perceived environmental features and to each other in order to safely move from one point to another. This paper extends our previously published work on the flight patterns of Myotis velifer that have been observed in a habitat near Johnson City, Texas. Each evening, these bats emerge from a cave in sequences of small groups that typically contain no more than three or four individuals, and they thus provide ideal subjects for studying leader-follower behaviors. By analyzing the flight paths of a group of M. velifer, the data show that the flight behavior of a follower bat is influenced by the flight behavior of a leader bat in a way that is not well explained by existing pursuit laws, such as classical pursuit, constant bearing and motion camouflage. Thus we propose an alternative steering law based on virtual loom, a concept we introduce to capture the geometrical configuration of the leader-follower pair. It is shown that this law may be integrated with our previously proposed vision-enabled steering laws to synthesize trajectories, the statistics of which fit with those of the bats in our data set.

Higher rank symmetry and higher moment conservation have been drawn considerable attention from, e.g., subdiffusive transport to fracton topological order.

We consider a $d$-dimensional model of interacting bosons of d components.
