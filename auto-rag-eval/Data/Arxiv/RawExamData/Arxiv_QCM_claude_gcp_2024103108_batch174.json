Understanding mixing and transport of passive scalars in active fluids is important to many natural (e.g. algal blooms) and industrial (e.g. biofuel, vaccine production) processes. Here, we study the mixing of a passive scalar (dye) in dilute suspensions of swimming Escherichia coli in experiments using a two-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results show that the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce overall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured velocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and lowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be attributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high stretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye concentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales is also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average size and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity seems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability distribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a vanishing skewness. Overall, our results show that the coupling between activity and flow can lead to nontrivial effects on mixing and transport."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a study of passive scalar mixing in active fluids containing swimming E. coli bacteria, which of the following combinations of effects was observed?\n\nA) Enhanced large-scale transport and reduced small-scale mixing\nB) Reduced large-scale transport and enhanced small-scale mixing\nC) Enhanced large-scale transport and enhanced small-scale mixing\nD) Reduced large-scale transport and reduced small-scale mixing\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Reduced large-scale transport and enhanced small-scale mixing. \n\nThe documentation states that \"the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce overall mixing rate.\" This directly supports the first part of answer B, indicating reduced large-scale transport.\n\nFor small-scale effects, the text mentions that \"at small scales, activity seems to enhance local mixing.\" This supports the second part of answer B, showing enhanced small-scale mixing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it contradicts both observed effects. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it contradicts the large-scale transport observation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, while it correctly identifies the reduced large-scale transport, it fails to account for the enhanced small-scale mixing.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully read and synthesize information from a complex scientific text, identifying key findings and their scale-dependent nature."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "A Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning Theory of Emotion: unifying\n  emotion, cognition and adaptive behavior", "source": "Joost Broekens", "docs_id": "1807.08941", "section": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "A Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning Theory of Emotion: unifying\n  emotion, cognition and adaptive behavior.

One of the important issues that arise is image denoising, which means recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples. This interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory, which is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then the original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much less, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling theories.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-efficient method for global black-box optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate fitness function.

In practice, this allows us to optimize ten or fewer critical parameters in up to 1,000 experiments. But experiments may be less expensive than BO methods assume: In some simulation models, we may be able to conduct multiple thousands of experiments in a few hours, and the computational burden of BO is no longer negligible compared to experimentation time. To address this challenge we introduce a new Dimension Scheduling Algorithm (DSA), which reduces the computational burden of BO for many experiments. The key idea is that DSA optimizes the fitness function only along a small set of dimensions at each iteration.
