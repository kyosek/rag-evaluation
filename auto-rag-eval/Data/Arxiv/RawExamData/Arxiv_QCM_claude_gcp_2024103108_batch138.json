We demonstrate that partonic correlations that would traditionally be identified as subleading on the basis of a generalized TMD-factorization conjecture can become leading-power because of TMD-factorization breaking that arises in hadron-hadron collisions with large transverse momentum back-to-back hadrons produced in the final state. General forms of TMD-factorization fail for such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the requirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge theories. We first review the basic steps for factorizing the gluon distribution and then show that a conflict between TMD-factorization and the non-Abelian Ward identity arises already at the level of a single extra soft or collinear gluon when the partonic subprocess involves a TMD gluon distribution. Next we show that the resulting TMD-factorization violating effects produce leading-power final state spin asymmetries that would be classified as subleading in a generalized TMD-factorization framework. We argue that similar extra TMD-factorization breaking effects may be necessary to explain a range of open phenomenological QCD puzzles.

The text emphasizes that real-time randomness extraction using information theoretically secure randomness extractors, specifically Toeplitz-hashing extractors, is vital for QRNGs. It mentions that these extractors play a critical role in determining the throughput rate and implementation cost of QRNGs.

This implementation achieves a real-time post-processing rate above 8 Gbps, which is crucial for high-throughput QRNGs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the goal is to speed up, not slow down, the extraction process. Option B is wrong as the extractors are used for randomness extraction, not quantum state preparation.

Enhancement of thermal conductivity via surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) supported in nanostructures has recently drawn attention as a remedy for issues raised due to the reduction of thermal conductivity in nanoscale confinement. Among them, multilayered structures on a substrate are prevalent in nano-sized systems, such as electronic nanodevices, meaning that analysis on those structures is indispensable. In this work, three basic multilayered structures are selected and the analytical expressions for SEWs supported in each structure are derived. This analytical approach enables us to figure out which factors are crucial for enhancing SEW thermal conductivity using multilayers.
