This conclusion is based on several key factors from the documentation:\n\n1. The DDLSD uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are particularly effective at handling time-series data with complex temporal dependencies.

This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the ability to analyze and apply information to a specific scenario.\n\nThe documentation states that \"A fourth experiment describes pure inertial effect, making the sand behaving as a perfect (non viscous) fluid; in particular, it is shown that a static swell (that does not propagate) is enforced at the interface between liquid and sand by strong periodic horizontal forcing.\"\n\nThis observation challenges traditional understanding of granular matter behavior. Typically, granular materials are thought to behave differently from fluids due to their particulate nature and complex interactions. However, under specific conditions of strong periodic horizontal forcing, the sand exhibits behavior akin to a perfect (non-viscous) fluid, as evidenced by the static swell at the interface.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the phenomenon is described as a \"pure inertial effect\" and the sand is behaving as a \"perfect (non viscous) fluid,\" which contradicts the idea of viscous damping.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the documentation does mention acoustic wave propagation in granular matter, this specific phenomenon is attributed to inertial effects under strong horizontal forcing, not acoustic waves.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the static swell is observed under conditions of strong periodic horizontal forcing, not quasi-static conditions. The documentation distinguishes between quasi-static rheology (associated with slow horizontal forcing and bulk convection) and this inertial effect observed under stronger forcing.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze experimental results, apply concepts across different scenarios described in the documentation, and understand the implications of observed phenomena on our broader understanding of granular matter physics."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Fighting for Not-So-Religious Souls: The Role of Religious Competition\n  in Secular Conflicts", "source": "Hector Galindo-Silva, Guy Tchuente", "docs_id": "1910.07707", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Fighting for Not-So-Religious Souls: The Role of Religious Competition\n  in Secular Conflicts.

The study focuses on Colombia, a deeply Catholic country that has suffered one of the world's longest-running internal conflicts and, in the last few decades, has witnessed an intense increase in religious competition between the Catholic Church and new non-Catholic churches.

Contrastive learning is a principled framework to capture such enriched variation between the target and background, but state-of-the-art contrastive methods are limited to linear models. In this paper, we introduce the contrastive variational autoencoder (cVAE), which combines the benefits of contrastive learning with the power of deep generative models.

Efficient global optimization is the problem of minimizing an unknown function f, using as few evaluations f(x) as possible. It can be considered as a continuum-armed bandit problem, with noiseless data and simple regret. Expected improvement is perhaps the most popular method for solving this problem; the algorithm performs well in experiments, but little is known about its theoretical properties. Implementing expected improvement requires a choice of Gaussian process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in the RKHS. We begin by providing convergence rates for this procedure. The rates are optimal for functions of low smoothness, and we modify the algorithm to attain optimal rates for smoother functions. For practitioners, however, these results are somewhat misleading.

Fine-grained indoor localization has attracted attention recently because of the rapidly growing demand for indoor location-based services (ILBS). Specifically, massive (large-scale) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems have received increasing attention due to high angular resolution. This paper presents an indoor localization testbed based on a massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which supports physical-layer channel measurements. Instead of exploiting channel state information (CSI) directly for localization, we focus on positioning from the perspective of multipath components (MPCs), which are extracted from the CSI through the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. On top of the available MPCs, we propose a generalized fingerprinting system based on different single-metric and hybrid-metric schemes. We evaluate the impact of the varying antenna topologies, the size of the training set, the number of antennas, and the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The\n  relation between face-on and edge-on boxiness. We study the dynamical mechanisms that reinforce the formation of boxy structures in the \\textit{inner} regions, roughly in the middle, of bars observed nearly \\textit{face-on}. Outer boxiness, at the ends of the bars, is usually associated with orbits at the inner, radial 4:1 resonance region and can be studied with 2D dynamics. However, in the middle of the bar dominate 3D orbits that give boxy/peanut bulges in the edge-on views of the models. In the present paper we show that 3D quasi-periodic, as well as 3D chaotic orbits sticky to the x1v1 and x1v1$^{\\prime}$ tori, especially from the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) region, have boxy projections on the equatorial plane of the bar. The majority of vertically perturbed 2D orbits, initially on the equatorial plane in the ILR resonance region, enhance boxy features in face-on bars. Orbits that build a bar by supporting sharp \"{\\sf X}\" features in their side-on views at energies \\textit{beyond} the ILR, may also have a double boxy character. If populated, the extent of the inner boxiness along the major axis is about the same with that of the peanut supporting orbits in the side-on views. At any rate these orbits do not obscure the observation of the boxy orbits of the ILR region in the face-on views, as they contribute more to the surface density at the sides of the bar than to their central parts."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about boxy-peanut and X-shaped bulges in galaxies, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An astronomer observes a galaxy with a prominent bar structure and notices a boxy shape in the inner regions when viewed face-on. Which of the following explanations best accounts for this observation, considering the complex 3D dynamics involved?\n\nA) The boxy shape is primarily caused by 2D orbits at the outer ends of the bar\nB) The boxiness is a result of 3D quasi-periodic and chaotic orbits near the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR)\nC) The observed shape is due to vertically stable orbits confined to the equatorial plane\nD) The boxiness is solely attributed to orbits beyond the ILR that form sharp \"X\" features in side-on views\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the understanding of complex orbital dynamics in barred galaxies. The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly states that 3D quasi-periodic orbits and 3D chaotic orbits sticky to the x1v1 and x1v1' tori, especially from the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) region, have boxy projections on the equatorial plane of the bar when viewed face-on. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it refers to outer boxiness at the ends of bars, which is associated with 2D dynamics and the 4:1 resonance region, not the inner boxiness described in the question.\n\nOption C is a distractor based on the misconception that 2D orbits confined to the equatorial plane could explain the 3D boxy structure. While the documentation mentions that vertically perturbed 2D orbits can enhance boxy features, they are not the primary cause of the inner boxiness.\n\nOption D is partially correct but incomplete. While orbits beyond the ILR can contribute to boxiness, they are not solely responsible for the inner boxy shape observed face-on. The question specifically asks about the inner regions, which are better explained by the ILR-related orbits.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the complex interplay between 2D and 3D orbital dynamics in galaxies and apply this knowledge to interpret observational features, demonstrating a high level of cognitive engagement (L4-L5 in Bloom's taxonomy)."}}
