The project OptoTracker aims to investigate a new approach to track charged particles in a scintillating material, by using the optical signal. Our idea is to reconstruct the trajectory of a charged particle by collecting the scintillation light emitted along the path with pixelized photo-detectors. This would permit to obtain an image of the track, similarly to what is done in a photographic camera. Full 3D reconstruction is performed by using both the charge distribution and the hit time information folded in a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm. This solution, compared to \"traditional\" tracking methods, exploits the fastest information carrier within a material: the light. Therefore, an optical tracking detector would be intrinsically capable of sustaining a very high interaction rate. Moreover, the intrinsic resolution would not be limited by carriers diffusion, as happens in charge-transport based detectors. This new technology could have a very large impact both on beam experiments, thanks to the possible increase in the acquisition rate, and in rare-physics experiments (double-$\\beta$ decay, dark-matter searches, neutrino oscillation searches), where the enhanced particle-id and directionality capability can provide significant background reduction.

The OptoTracker project proposes using light (the optical signal) from scintillation to track charged particles. The documentation specifically states that \"This solution, compared to 'traditional' tracking methods, exploits the fastest information carrier within a material: the light.\" This approach allows the detector to potentially handle very high interaction rates, which is a key advantage over traditional methods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the proposal doesn't mention using a more sensitive scintillating material. The focus is on the method of detection, not the material itself.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while charge distribution is used in the 3D reconstruction, it's not the key advantage over traditional methods. The use of light for faster information transfer is the primary innovation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the proposal actually relies on pixelized photo-detectors to collect the scintillation light, so it doesn't eliminate the need for photo-detectors."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "DeepRx: Fully Convolutional Deep Learning Receiver", "source": "Mikko Honkala, Dani Korpi, Janne M.J.

Deep learning has solved many problems that are out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols. Also, DeepRx outputs soft bits that are compatible with the channel coding used in 5G systems. Using 3GPP-defined channel models, we demonstrate that DeepRx outperforms traditional methods.

Transactive microgrids have emerged as a transformative solution for the problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the use of distributed energy resources and rapid growth in renewable energy generation.

The ongoing net neutrality debate has generated a lot of heated discussions on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers.

In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs (zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs.

The system can react to changes of the user locations online; this system design captures the interaction between multiple UAV trajectories by joint processing at the central unit, e.g., a ground base station.

Multivariate dynamic time series models are widely encountered in practical studies, e.g., modelling policy transmission mechanism and measuring connectedness between economic agents. To better capture the dynamics, this paper proposes a wide class of multivariate dynamic models with time-varying coefficients, which have a general time-varying vector moving average (VMA) representation, and nest, for instance, time-varying vector autoregression (VAR), time-varying vector autoregression moving-average (VARMA), and so forth as special cases.
