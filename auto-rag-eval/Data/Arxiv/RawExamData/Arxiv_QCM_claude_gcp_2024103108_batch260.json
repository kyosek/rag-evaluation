Since Marco Polo (1) it has been known that some sand dunes have the peculiar ability of emitting a loud sound with a well defined frequency, sometimes for several minutes. The origin of this sustained sound has remained mysterious, partly because of its rarity in nature (2). It has been recognized that the sound is not due to the air flow around the dunes but to the motion of an avalanche (3), and not to an acoustic excitation of the grains but to their relative motion (4-7). By comparing several singing dunes and two controlled experiments, one in the laboratory and one in the field, we here demonstrate that the frequency of the sound is the frequency of the relative motion of the sand grains. The sound is produced because some moving grains synchronize their motions. The existence of a velocity threshold in both experiments further shows that this synchronization comes from an acoustic resonance within the flowing layer: if the layer is large enough it creates a resonance cavity in which grains self-synchronize."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the mechanism behind the \"song of the dunes\" phenomenon?\n\nA) The sound is produced by air flow around the dunes, with the frequency determined by wind speed.\n\nB) The sound results from acoustic excitation of individual sand grains, with the frequency matching their natural resonance.\n\nC) The sound emerges from the self-synchronization of moving sand grains within a resonance cavity formed by the flowing layer, occurring above a certain velocity threshold.\n\nD) The sound is caused by the vibration of the entire dune structure, with the frequency dependent on the dune's size and shape.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage explicitly states that the sound is not due to air flow around the dunes (ruling out A) or acoustic excitation of individual grains (ruling out B). Instead, it's caused by the relative motion of sand grains during an avalanche. The key mechanism involves the synchronization of moving grains within a resonance cavity formed by the flowing layer, which occurs above a velocity threshold. This explanation combines the concepts of grain synchronization, acoustic resonance within the flowing layer, and the observed velocity threshold, making it the most comprehensive and accurate description based on the given information. Option D is incorrect because the sound is not attributed to the vibration of the entire dune structure, but rather to the motion of grains within the avalanche."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Explaining the mysterious age gap of globular clusters in the Large\n  Magellanic Cloud", "source": "K.

To introduce the core of the method, we consider multilayer heat equations, known in physics for a relatively long time but never used when solving financial problems. Thus, we expand the analytic machinery of quantitative finance by augmenting it with the ML method. We demonstrate how one can solve various problems of mathematical finance by using our approach. Specifically, we develop efficient algorithms for pricing barrier options for time-dependent one-factor short-rate models, such as Black-Karasinski and Verhulst.

Central to the official \"green growth\" discourse is the conjecture that absolute decoupling can be achieved with certain market instruments. This paper evaluates this claim focusing on the role of technology, while changes in GDP composition are treated elsewhere. Some fundamental difficulties for absolute decoupling, referring specifically to thermodynamic costs, are identified through a stylized model based on empirical knowledge on innovation and learning. Normally, monetary costs decrease more slowly than production grows, and this is unlikely to change should monetary costs align with thermodynamic costs, except, potentially, in the transition after the price reform. Furthermore, thermodynamic efficiency must eventually saturate for physical reasons. While this model, as usual, introduces technological innovation just as a source of efficiency, innovation also creates challenges: therefore, attempts to sustain growth by ever-accelerating innovation collide also with the limited reaction capacity of people and institutions. Information technology could disrupt innovation dynamics in the future, permitting quicker gains in eco-efficiency, but only up to saturation and exacerbating the downsides of innovation.

In a previous publication we put the idea forward that the missing stars are deeply connected to the presence of this disc. The progenitor of the stellar disc is very likely to have been a gaseous disc that at some point fragmented and triggered star formation. This caused the appearance of overdensity regions in the disc that had high enough densities to ensure stripping large giants of their atmospheres and thus rendering them very faint. In this paper we use a stellar evolution code to derive the properties that a red giant would display in a colour-magnitude diagram, as well as a non-linearity factor required for a correct estimate of the mass loss. We find that in a very short timescale, the red giants (RGs) leave their standard evolutionary track. The non-linearity factor has values that not only depend on the properties of the clumps, but also on the physical conditions the giant stars, as we predicted analytically.

The text describes a mechanism where a gaseous disc in the Galactic Center fragmented and formed stars, creating high-density regions or clumps.

If the individuals are choosing between a right and a wrong state, and the initial actions are wrong, then the whole cascade will be wrong.

The hard thermal loop approximation has been used for the heat bath to compute various form factors associated with the gauge boson's two point functions both in strong and weak field approximation. We have also analyzed the dispersion of a gauge boson (e.g., gluon) using the effective propagator both in strong and weak magnetic field approximation. The formalism is also applicable to QED. The presence of only thermal background leads to a longitudinal (plasmon) mode and a two-fold degenerate transverse mode. In presence of a hot magnetized background medium the degeneracy of the two transverse modes is lifted and one gets three quasiparticle modes. In weak field approximation one gets two transverse modes and one plasmon mode. On the other hand, in strong field approximation also one gets the three modes in Lowest Landau Level.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that in the presence of a hot magnetized medium, four linearly independent basis tensors are required to construct the general structure of the gauge boson two-point functions. This is a change from the simpler case of only thermal background.\n\n2. In a purely thermal background, there are two quasiparticle modes: one longitudinal (plasmon) mode and a two-fold degenerate transverse mode.\n\n3. When a magnetic field is introduced (hot magnetized background), the degeneracy of the two transverse modes is lifted, resulting in three distinct quasiparticle modes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the propagator structure does change, and the number of modes increases to three, not four. Option B is incorrect on both counts: the number of basis tensors increases to four, not decreases to three, and the number of modes increases, not decreases. Option D is incorrect because while it correctly identifies the lifting of degeneracy in transverse modes, it wrongly states that the longitudinal mode disappears and that the propagator structure remains unchanged."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "The Origin of X-ray Emission in the Gamma-ray emitting Narrow-Line\n  Seyfert 1 1H 0323+342", "source": "Sergio A.
