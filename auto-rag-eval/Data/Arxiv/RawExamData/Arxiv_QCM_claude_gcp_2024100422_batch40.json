Optical nanofibers (ONF) of subwavelength dimensions confine light in modes with a strong evanescent field that can trap, probe, and manipulate nearby quantum systems.

We demonstrate a nondestructive measurement of light propagation in ONFs by sampling the local evanescent field with a microfiber. This approach reveals the behavior of all propagating modes, and because the modal beat lengths in cylindrical waveguides depend strongly on radius, simultaneously provides exquisite sensitivity to the ONF radius.

In particular, we give an unsupervised deep learning approach to learning a latent representation that captures semantic similarity in the data set. The core idea is to use data augmentations that preserve semantic meaning to generate synthetic examples of elements whose feature representations should be close to one another. We demonstrate the utility of our method applied to nano-scale electron microscopy data, where even relatively small portions of animal brains can require terabytes of image data. Although supervised methods can be used to predict and identify known patterns of interest, the scale of the data makes it difficult to mine and analyze patterns that are not known a priori. We show the ability of our learned representation to enable query by example, so that if a scientist notices an interesting pattern in the data, they can be presented with other locations with matching patterns. We also demonstrate that clustering of data in the learned space correlates with biologically-meaningful distinctions. Finally, we introduce a visualization tool and software ecosystem to facilitate user-friendly interactive analysis and uncover interesting biological patterns.

In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence infilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete sentence.

The theory is applied to lower Balmer lines and the theoretical and observational impact of the new broadening theory is examined. It is shown that this theory leads to considerable differences in the predicted line profiles in cool stars when compared with previous theories which include only resonance interactions. In particular, the effect is found to be very important in metal poor stars. The theory provides a natural explanation for the behaviour of effective temperatures derived from Balmer lines by others using a theory which includes only resonance broadening.
