For anisotropic magneto-resistance (AMR) effect, its value synergistically depends on the magnitudes of magneto-resistance (MR) and magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) simultaneously. In a magnetic material, the concurrence of gigantic AMR and MR signals is rather difficult due to weak spin-lattice coupling and small MAE. Here we report the considerable magneto-transport effect in layered A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) NaCrTe2 by realigning the spin configurations. By applying H, the antiparallel spins of adjacent layers are flipped to ferromagnetic (FM) coupling either Ising-type along c-axis or XY-type within ab-plane. Theoretical calculations reveal that the energy bandgap narrows from 0.39 eV to 0.11 eV, accompanying a transition from semiconductor (high-R state) and half-semiconductor (low-R state), respectively. Thus, gigantic negative MR ratio of -90% is obtained at 10 K. More importantly, the decrement of R along H//c is far quicker than that of H//ab because the MAE of Ising-FM state is 1017 {\\mu}eV/Cr3+ lower than that of XY-FM.

When a magnetic field is applied, the antiparallel spins of adjacent layers flip to ferromagnetic coupling, either Ising-type along the c-axis or XY-type within the ab-plane. This realignment causes the energy bandgap to narrow from 0.39 eV to 0.11 eV, accompanying a transition from a semiconductor (high-resistance state) to a half-semiconductor (low-resistance state). This transition results in a gigantic negative magneto-resistance (MR) ratio of -90% at 10 K.\n\nThe record AMR ratio of 732% at 10 K is achieved due to the distinct trends in resistance decrease along different field directions. The resistance decreases more rapidly along H//c compared to H//ab because the MAE of the Ising-FM state is 1017 \u03bceV/Cr3+ lower than that of the XY-FM state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the material actually has weak spin-lattice coupling.

In such scenarios, it is known that to achieve a target error, the computational effort can be reduced when using MLMC relative to exact sampling from the most accurate discretized probability. The ideas rely upon introducing hierarchies of the discretizations where less accurate approximations cost less to compute, and using an appropriate collapsing sum expression for the target expectation.
