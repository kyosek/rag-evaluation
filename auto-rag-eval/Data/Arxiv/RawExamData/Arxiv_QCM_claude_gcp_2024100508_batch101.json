We investigate the exploration of an unknown environment when no reward function is provided. Building on the incremental exploration setting introduced by Lim and Auer [1], we define the objective of learning the set of $\\epsilon$-optimal goal-conditioned policies attaining all states that are incrementally reachable within $L$ steps (in expectation) from a reference state $s_0$. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based approach that interleaves discovering new states from $s_0$ and improving the accuracy of a model estimate that is used to compute goal-conditioned policies to reach newly discovered states. The resulting algorithm, DisCo, achieves a sample complexity scaling as $\\tilde{O}(L^5 S_{L+\\epsilon} \\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon} A \\epsilon^{-2})$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $S_{L+\\epsilon}$ is the number of states that are incrementally reachable from $s_0$ in $L+\\epsilon$ steps, and $\\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon}$ is the branching factor of the dynamics over such states. This improves over the algorithm proposed in [1] in both $\\epsilon$ and $L$ at the cost of an extra $\\Gamma_{L+\\epsilon}$ factor, which is small in most environments of interest. Furthermore, DisCo is the first algorithm that can return an $\\epsilon/c_{\\min}$-optimal policy for any cost-sensitive shortest-path problem defined on the $L$-reachable states with minimum cost $c_{\\min}$.

This model is then used to guide the fuzzing process by focusing on inputs where the model's predictions are most uncertain (measured by entropy). This approach aims to reduce redundant executions and increase efficiency by avoiding inputs whose behavior can be confidently predicted.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the paper doesn't mention modifying AFL's input generation algorithm. Instead, it focuses on selecting which inputs to execute based on a learned model.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the approach doesn't replace existing fuzzers, but rather augments them with a machine learning model to guide input selection.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the paper doesn't discuss optimizing AFL's internal workings or increasing execution speed.

Meeting the defined greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets in Germany is only possible by switching to renewable technologies in the energy sector. A major share of that reduction needs to be covered by the heat sector, which accounts for ~35% of the energy based emissions in Germany. Biomass is the renewable key player in the heterogeneous heat sector today. Its properties such as weather independency, simple storage and flexible utilization open up a wide field of applications for biomass. However, in a future heat sector fulfilling GHG reduction targets and energy sectors being increasingly connected: which bioenergy technology concepts are competitive options against other renewable heating systems? In this paper, the cost optimal allocation of the limited German biomass potential is investigated under longterm scenarios using a mathematical optimization approach. The model results show that bioenergy can be a competitive option in the future. Especially the use of biomass from residues can be highly competitive in hybrid combined heat and power (CHP) pellet combustion plants in the private household sector.
