Solid state single photon sources with Fourier Transform (FT) limited lines are among the most crucial constituents of photonic quantum technologies and have been accordingly the focus of intensive research over the last several decades. However, so far, solid state systems have only exhibited FT limited lines at cryogenic temperatures due to strong interactions with the thermal bath of lattice phonons. In this work, we report a solid state source that exhibits FT limited lines measured in photo luminescence excitation (sub 100 MHz linewidths) from 3K-300K. The studied source is a color center in the two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and we propose that the center's decoupling from phonons is a fundamental consequence of material's low dimensionality. While the center's luminescence lines exhibit spectral diffusion, we identify the likely source of the dffusion and propose to mitigate it via dynamic spectral tuning. The discovery of FT-limited lines at room temperature, which once the spectral diffusion is controlled, will also yield FT-limited emission. Our work motivates a significant advance towards room temperature photonic quantum technologies and a new research direction in the remarkable fundamental properties of two-dimensional materials."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What unique property of the solid state single photon source described in this research makes it particularly groundbreaking, and what is the proposed explanation for this property?\n\nA) It exhibits Fourier Transform limited lines at temperatures ranging from 3K to 300K, likely due to the source's high dimensional structure.\n\nB) It shows spectral diffusion that can be easily controlled, making it ideal for cryogenic quantum computing applications.\n\nC) It demonstrates Fourier Transform limited lines at room temperature, possibly because of the two-dimensional nature of hexagonal boron nitride decoupling the color center from phonons.\n\nD) It produces ultra-narrow linewidths below 10 MHz, attributed to strong interactions with the thermal bath of lattice phonons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The research describes a solid state single photon source that exhibits Fourier Transform (FT) limited lines measured in photo luminescence excitation from 3K to 300K (room temperature). This is groundbreaking because previously, solid state systems only exhibited FT limited lines at cryogenic temperatures.

Our sample of study includes nine M and X-class flares, all from the same active region (AR), six of which are confined and three others are eruptive. The confined flares tend to be more impulsive in the soft X-ray time profiles and show more slender shapes in the EIT 195 A images, while the eruptive ones are of long-duration events and show much more extended brightening regions. The location of the confined flares are closer to the center of the AR, while the eruptive flares are at the outskirts. This difference is quantified by the displacement parameter, the distance between the AR center and the flare location: the average displacement of the six confined flares is 16 Mm, while that of eruptive ones is as large as 39 Mm. Further, through nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we find that the decay index of the transverse magnetic field in the low corona (~10 Mm) have a larger value for eruptive flares than that for confined one. In addition, the strength of the transverse magnetic field over the eruptive flare sites is weaker than that over the confined ones.

Based on these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and major transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of thermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving population.

For the special class of 3-manifolds with tunnel number one, we provide compelling theoretical and experimental evidence that fibering is a very rare property. Indeed, in various precise senses it happens with probability 0. Our main theorem is that this is true for a measured lamination model of random tunnel number one 3-manifolds.

Born in rapidly evolving mini-halos during the first billion years of the Universe, super- massive black holes (SMBH) feed from gas flows spanning many orders of magnitude, from the cosmic web in which they are embedded to their event horizon. As such, accretion onto SMBHs constitutes a formidable challenge to tackle numerically, and currently requires the use of sub-grid models to handle the flow on small, unresolved scales. In this paper, we study the impact of resolution on the accretion pattern of SMBHs initially inserted at the heart of dense galactic gas clouds, using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the black hole (BH) gravitational zone of influence. We find that once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved, accretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently of the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early stages of cloud collapse. For a pristine gas mix of hydrogen and helium, a slim disc develops around the BH on sub-parsec scales, turning the otherwise chaotic BH accretion duty cycle into an episodic one, with potentially important consequences for BH feedback. In the presence of such a nuclear disc, BH mass growth predominantly occurs when infalling dense clumps trigger disc instabilities, fuelling intense albeit short-lived gas accretion episodes."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: What key finding regarding supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion patterns is revealed when using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the black hole's gravitational zone of influence?\n\nA) Accretion onto SMBHs becomes purely chaotic and unpredictable at higher resolutions.\nB) The black hole seed mass becomes the primary factor determining accretion patterns at higher resolutions.\nC) A slim disc forms on sub-parsec scales, transforming the accretion duty cycle from chaotic to episodic.\nD) Higher resolution simulations show that accretion is solely driven by the cosmic web structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

In many applications, it is of interest to assess the relative contribution of features (or subsets of features) toward the goal of predicting a response -- in other words, to gauge the variable importance of features. Most recent work on variable importance assessment has focused on describing the importance of features within the confines of a given prediction algorithm. However, such assessment does not necessarily characterize the prediction potential of features, and may provide a misleading reflection of the intrinsic value of these features. To address this limitation, we propose a general framework for nonparametric inference on interpretable algorithm-agnostic variable importance. We define variable importance as a population-level contrast between the oracle predictiveness of all available features versus all features except those under consideration.

Results: The reproduction number for environmental and direct transmission combined is Rtot = 11.0 [9.4,15.6], and of environmental transmission alone is Renviron = 0.85 [0.18,2.04]. Direct transmission is overwhelmingly due to 0 passenger-to-passenger contacts, but crew can act as a reservoir of infection from cruise-to-cruise. Implications: This is the first quantification of the relative roles of environmental and direct transmission of norovirus. While environmental transmission has the potential to maintain a sustained series of outbreaks aboard a cruise ship in the absence of strict sanitation practices, direct transmission dominates. Quarantine of ill passengers and cleaning are likely to have little impact on final outbreak size, but intensive promotion of good hand washing practices can prevent outbreaks."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the mathematical model of norovirus transmission described in the study, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the transmission dynamics and potential control strategies for norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships?\n\nA) Environmental transmission alone is sufficient to maintain sustained outbreaks, with a reproduction number (Renviron) greater than 1.\n\nB) Direct person-to-person transmission plays a minor role compared to environmental transmission in the overall spread of norovirus on cruise ships.\n\nC) Quarantine of ill passengers and intensive cleaning are the most effective strategies for reducing the final outbreak size.\n\nD) Crew members can serve as a reservoir of infection between cruises, while passenger-to-passenger contacts are the primary driver of direct transmission during a single cruise.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the study reports Renviron = 0.85 [0.18,2.04], which is less than 1 and thus not sufficient alone to maintain sustained outbreaks.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the study emphasizes that direct transmission dominates over environmental transmission.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the study states that quarantine of ill passengers and cleaning are likely to have little impact on final outbreak size.

Estimating the photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) of an imaging sensor from videos is a challenging task due to complications created by several processing steps in the camera imaging pipeline. Among these steps, video coding is one of the most disruptive to PRNU estimation because of its lossy nature. Since videos are always stored in a compressed format, the ability to cope with the disruptive effects of encoding is central to reliable attribution. In this work, by focusing on the block-based operation of widely used video coding standards, we present an improved approach to PRNU estimation that exploits this behavior. To this purpose, several PRNU weighting schemes that utilize block-level parameters, such as encoding block type, quantization strength, and rate-distortion value, are proposed and compared.

The presence of signal outage, due to shadowing and blockage, is expected to be the main bottleneck in millimeter wave (mmWave) networks.

To address the issue of reducing outage, this paper explores the possibility of base station cooperation in the downlink of a mmWave heterogenous network. The main focus of this work is showing that, in a stochastic geometry framework, cooperation from randomly located base stations decreases outage probability. With the presumed vision that less severe fading will be experienced due to highly directional transmissions, one might expect that cooperation would increase the coverage probability; our numerical examples suggest that is in fact the case. Coverage probabilities are derived accounting for: different fading distributions, antenna directionality and blockage.
