Although the adverse effects of using power electronic conversion on the insulation systems used in different apparatuses have been investigated, they are limited to low slew rates and repetitions. These results cannot be used for next-generation wide bandgap (WBG) based conversion systems targeted to be fast (with a slew rate up to 100 kV/us) and operate at a high switching frequency up to 500 kHz. Frequency and slew rate are two of the most important factors of a voltage pulse, influencing the level of degradation of the insulation systems that are exposed to such voltage pulses. The paper reviews challenges concerning insulation degradation when benefitting from WBG-based conversion systems with the mentioned slew rate and switching frequency values and identifies technical gaps and future research needs.

Consumption increases or decreases at the thresholds and after the adjustment new thresholds are set. The share of risky investment in the agent's total investment is inversely U-shaped within the (s, S) band, which generates time-varying risk aversion that can fluctuate widely over time.

Despite the recent success of convolutional neural networks in texture recognition, model-based descriptors are still competitive, especially when we do not have access to large amounts of annotated data for training and the interpretation of the model is an important issue. Among the model-based approaches, fractal geometry has been one of the most popular, especially in biological applications. Nevertheless, fractals are part of a much broader family of models, which are the non-linear operators, studied in chaos theory. In this context, we propose here a chaos-based local descriptor for texture recognition. More specifically, we map the image into the three-dimensional Euclidean space, iterate a chaotic map over this three-dimensional structure and convert it back to the original image. From such chaos-transformed image at each iteration we collect local descriptors (here we use local binary patters) and those descriptors compose the feature representation of the texture.

In this scenario, endogeneous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves.

We extract the average values of the real part of the nuclear optical potential for final state nucleons ($U_{opt}^{QE}$) as a function of the nucleon kinetic energy from inclusive electron scattering data on nuclear targets ($\\bf_{6}^{12}C$+$\\bf_{8}^{16}O$, $\\bf_{20}^{40}Ca$+$\\bf_{18}^{40}Ar$, $\\bf_{3}^{6}Li$, $\\bf_{18}^{27}Al$, $\\bf_{26}^{56}Fe$, $\\bf_{82}^{208}Pb$) in the QE region and compare to calculations. We also extract values of the average of the real part of the nuclear optical potential for a $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance in the final state ($U^\\Delta_{opt}$) within the impulse approximation. We find that $U^\\Delta_{opt}$ is more negative than $U_{opt}^{QE}$ with $U^\\Delta_{opt}\\approx$1.5~$U_{opt}^{QE}$ for $\\bf_{6}^{12}C$."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A neutrino oscillation experiment is being designed to study interactions with a carbon-12 target.

The BON uses a collaborative generative network to produce new synthetic data points as perturbations of original data points. This creates a data support around each original data point, which prevents decision boundaries from passing too close to the original data points, thus reducing overfitting.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while BON may lead to improved accuracy, it doesn't necessarily make decision boundaries more complex or less interpretable.

The aim is to create a support around existing data, not to expand the feature space with entirely new features.\n\nOption D is incorrect because BON doesn't necessarily make the training process faster.

Overrides of credit ratings are important correctives of ratings that are determined by statistical rating models. Financial institutions and banking regulators agree on this because on the one hand errors with ratings of corporates or banks can have fatal consequences for the lending institutions and on the other hand errors by statistical methods can be minimised but not completely avoided. Nonetheless, rating overrides can be misused in order to conceal the real riskiness of borrowers or even entire portfolios. That is why rating overrides usually are strictly governed and carefully recorded. It is not clear, however, which frequency of overrides is appropriate for a given rating model within a predefined time period.

As a result, our algorithm does not have to trade one property for another and jointly learns high-quality representations for multiple network analysis tasks.

In our setup, three primaries lay at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and move in circular orbits around their common center of mass. Here, one of the primaries is a radiating body and the fourth body (whose mass is negligible) does not affect the motion of the primaries. We show that the existence and the number of equilibrium points of the problem depend on the mass parameters and radiation factor. Consequently, the allowed regions of motion, the regions of the basins of convergence for the equilibrium points, and the basin entropy will also depend on these parameters. The present dynamical model is analyzed for three combinations of mass for the primaries: equal masses, two equal masses, different masses. As the main results, we find that in all cases the libration points are unstable if the radiation factor is larger than 0.01 and hence able to destroy the stability of the libration points in the restricted four-body problem composed by Sun, Jupiter, Trojan asteroid and a test (dust) particle. Also, we conclude that the number of fixed points decreases with the increase of the radiation factor."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the triangular restricted four-body problem with a radiating body, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In a space mission designed to study the dynamics of dust particles near a system of three celestial bodies (similar to the Sun-Jupiter-Trojan asteroid system), scientists observe unexpected behavior of the test particles.

The documentation also mentions that \"the number of fixed points decreases with the increase of the radiation factor,\" which rules out option B.\n\n5.

Using computational modelling, we investigate mechanisms of signal transduction focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint where a single unattached kinetochore is able to signal to prevent cell cycle progression. This inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have attached to all kinetochores. This requirement tightly constrains the possible mechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint operation in metazoan cells, both supported by recent experiments. The first involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell-cycle regulators. This mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery data and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells. Using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a two stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial gradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion but then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules.

An unexpected increase in electrical conductivity would likely be due to reduced scattering or enhanced contribution from flux tubes.\n\nIn a neutron star, higher electrical conductivity would lead to:\n\n1. Reduced ohmic dissipation of currents in the star's crust and core.\n2. Better maintenance of small-scale magnetic field structures.\n3. More efficient conversion of rotational energy into electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThese effects would culminate in stronger electromagnetic emissions, particularly in the radio frequency range, which is a key observable property of neutron stars.\n\nOption A is incorrect because higher conductivity would actually slow magnetic field decay, not strengthen it. This would result in a slower, not more rapid, spin-down rate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because electrical conductivity doesn't directly impact neutrino emission processes, which are primarily governed by weak interactions and temperature.\n\nOption C is incorrect because electrical conductivity doesn't significantly affect the star's mass distribution or moment of inertia.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the implications of 2SC matter properties on neutron star behavior, requiring both critical thinking and application of physics principles beyond mere memorization of the documentation."}, "93": {"documentation": {"title": "Pattern formation and chimera states in 2D SQUID metamaterials", "source": "Johanne Hizanidis, Nikos Lazarides, and Giorgos P.
