Longitudinal study designs are indispensable for studying disease progression. Inferring covariate effects from longitudinal data, however, requires interpretable methods that can model complicated covariance structures and detect nonlinear effects of both categorical and continuous covariates, as well as their interactions. Detecting disease effects is hindered by the fact that they often occur rapidly near the disease initiation time, and this time point cannot be exactly observed. An additional challenge is that the effect magnitude can be heterogeneous over the subjects. We present lgpr, a widely applicable and interpretable method for nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data using additive Gaussian processes. We demonstrate that it outperforms previous approaches in identifying the relevant categorical and continuous covariates in various settings. Furthermore, it implements important novel features, including the ability to account for the heterogeneity of covariate effects, their temporal uncertainty, and appropriate observation models for different types of biomedical data.

A geometric analysis of protein folding, which complements many of the models in the literature, is presented. We examine the process from unfolded strand to the point where the strand becomes self-interacting. A central question is how it is possible that so many initial configurations proceed to fold to a unique final configuration. We put energy and dynamical considerations temporarily aside and focus upon the geometry alone. We parameterize the structure of an idealized protein using the concept of a ribbon from differential geometry. The deformation of the ribbon is described by introducing a generic twisting Ansatz. The folding process in this picture entails a change in shape guided by the local amino acid geometry. The theory is reparamaterization invariant from the start, so the final shape is independent of folding time. We develop differential equations for the changing shape. For some parameter ranges, a sine-Gordon torsion soliton is found. This purely geometric waveform has properties similar to dynamical solitons.

Charging demands of electric vehicles (EVs) are sharply increasing due to the rapid development of EVs.

Due to the uncertainty of EV charging loads, load forecasting becomes vital for the operation of quick charge stations to formulate the day-ahead plan.

Here, we report the discovery of a long-period planet candidate, called HD 283869 b, orbiting a member of the Hyades cluster.

To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred.

Based on these findings, we then introduce Libra, a \"fair\" policy that is resilient to gaming and tolerant of technical complications.

We study dynamic matching in a spatial setting. Drivers are distributed at random on some interval. Riders arrive in some (possibly adversarial) order at randomly drawn points. The platform observes the location of the drivers, and can match newly arrived riders immediately, or can wait for more riders to arrive. Unmatched riders incur a waiting cost $c$ per period. The platform can match riders and drivers, irrevocably. The cost of matching a driver to a rider is equal to the distance between them. We quantify the value of slightly increasing supply.
