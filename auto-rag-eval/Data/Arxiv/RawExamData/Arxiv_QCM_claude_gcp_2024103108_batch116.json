Analysis of broad-band X/$\\gamma$-ray spectra of NGC~4151 from contemporaneous observations by {\\it GRO}/OSSE, {\\it ROSAT}, {\\it Ginga} and {\\it ASCA}, shows that the data are well modelled with an intrinsic spectrum due to thermal Comptonization. The X-ray spectral index changes from $\\alpha\\sim$ 0.4 to 0.7, and temperature stays at about 50 keV. The X-ray spectrum varies in such a way that it is consistent with the roughly constant soft $\\gamma$-rays, with pivots at $\\sim$ 100 keV. The UV/X-ray correlation observed by {\\it EXOSAT} and {\\it IUE} can be explained by two specific models with reprocessing of X-rays by cold matter. The first one is based on reemision of the X-ray flux absorbed by clouds in the line of sight. The model predicts no Compton reflection which is consistent with the broad-band spectra. The second model, assumes reprocessing of X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays by a cold accretion disk with dissipative patchy corona. The homogenous corona model is ruled out here, since the hardness of the X-ray spectrum implies that the plasma is photon starved.

In this paper an improved method for searching good interleavers from a certain set is proposed. The first few terms, corresponding to maximum distance of approximately 40 of the distance spectra, for turbo codes using these interleavers are determined by means of Garello's method. The method is applied to find quadratic permutation polynomials (QPP) based interleavers. Compared to previous methods for founding QPP based interleavers, the search complexity is reduced, allowing to find interleavers of higher length. This method has been applied for QPP interleavers with lengths from the LTE (Long Term Evolution) standard up to 1504. The analyzed classes are those with the largest spread QPP (LS-QPP), with the D parameter equal to that of LTE interleaver (D_L_T_E-QPP), and the class consisting of all QPP interleavers for lengths up to 1008. The distance spectrum optimization is made for all classes. For the class of LS-QPP interleavers of small lengths, the search led to superior or at least equal performances with those of the LTE standard.
