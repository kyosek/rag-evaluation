Discrete Fourier transforms~(DFTs) over finite fields have widespread applications in digital communication and storage systems. Hence, reducing the computational complexities of DFTs is of great significance. Recently proposed cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due to their low multiplicative complexities. Unfortunately, there are two issues with CFFTs: (1) they rely on efficient short cyclic convolution algorithms, which has not been investigated thoroughly yet, and (2) they have very high additive complexities when directly implemented. In this paper, we address both issues. One of the main contributions of this paper is efficient bilinear 11-point cyclic convolution algorithms, which allow us to construct CFFTs over GF$(2^{11})$. The other main contribution of this paper is that we propose composite cyclotomic Fourier transforms (CCFTs). In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier transforms, our CCFTs achieve lower overall complexities for moderate to long lengths, and the improvement significantly increases as the length grows. Our 2047-point and 4095-point CCFTs are also first efficient DFTs of such lengths to the best of our knowledge. Finally, our CCFTs are also advantageous for hardware implementations due to their regular and modular structure."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key advantages of Composite Cyclotomic Fourier Transforms (CCFTs) as presented in the paper?\n\nA) They have lower multiplicative complexities than traditional DFTs but higher additive complexities.\n\nB) They are primarily beneficial for short-length transforms and become less efficient as the length grows.\n\nC) They achieve lower overall complexities for moderate to long lengths and offer advantages for hardware implementation.\n\nD) They eliminate the need for efficient short cyclic convolution algorithms in their computation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Index insurance is a promising tool to reduce the risk faced by farmers, but high basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation between the index and individual farm yields, has limited its adoption to date. Basis risk arises from two fundamental sources: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design risk). Whereas previous work has focused almost exclusively on design risk, a theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of zonal risk is still lacking. Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, using the case of maize yields in Kenya. Our first contribution is to derive a formal decomposition of basis risk, providing a simple upper bound on the insurable basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone. Our second contribution is to provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of the extent of zonal versus design risk. To do so, we use satellite estimates of yields at 10m resolution across Kenya, and investigate the effect of using smaller zones versus using different indices.

In October of 2020, China announced that it aims to start reducing its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 20601. The surprise announcement came in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused a transient drop in China's emissions in the first half of 2020. Here, we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020: although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than 2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of 36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of 519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of China's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources. Our results thus reveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target during the pandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in the next few years if the latest trends persist."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the trends observed in China's power system decarbonization during 2020, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential future scenario for China's power sector by 2030, assuming the trends continue?\n\nA) Low-carbon sources could provide approximately 40% of China's power demand, with fossil fuels still dominating the energy mix.\n\nB) Fossil fuel production is likely to increase significantly to meet growing power demands, potentially reversing the decarbonization trend.\n\nC) Low-carbon sources could provide over 50% of China's power demand, marking a significant shift in the country's energy landscape.\n\nD) Nuclear power alone could account for the majority of China's low-carbon energy production, surpassing renewables.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.
