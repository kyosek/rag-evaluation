However, this is a challenging task at socio-economically critical lead times (1-2 years), because meteorological anomalies operate at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.

The study aims to use CNNs to estimate DVKs from CT-derived density kernels, which could potentially improve personalized dosimetry by accounting for tissue heterogeneity without the need for time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. This approach addresses the limitations of the fast but inaccurate DVK convolution method while potentially avoiding the time constraints of full Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the CNN approach is not described as slower than DVK convolution.

Solving the RNA inverse folding problem is a critical prerequisite to RNA design, an emerging field in bioengineering with a broad range of applications from reaction catalysis to cancer therapy. Although significant progress has been made in developing machine-based inverse RNA folding algorithms, current approaches still have difficulty designing sequences for large or complex targets. On the other hand, human players of the online RNA design game EteRNA have consistently shown superior performance in this regard, being able to readily design sequences for targets that are challenging for machine algorithms. Here we present a novel approach to the RNA design problem, SentRNA, a design agent consisting of a fully-connected neural network trained end-to-end using human-designed RNA sequences. We show that through this approach, SentRNA can solve complex targets previously unsolvable by any machine-based approach and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two separate challenging test sets.
