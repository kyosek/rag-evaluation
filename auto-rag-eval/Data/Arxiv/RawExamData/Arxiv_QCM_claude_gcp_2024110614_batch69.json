A 256-channel time-of-flight (TOF) electronics system has been developed for a beam line facility called \"Back-n WNS\" in China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). This paper shows the structure and performance of electronics system and the test results in CSNS. A 256-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT) is chosen as the detector in this system. In order to acquire the time information from the PMT, an electronics system has been designed. The electronics system mainly includes one front-end board (FEB), four time-to-digital converter (TDC) boards and one clock distribution module (CDM). There are 256 channels on FEB and 64 channels on each TDC board. The FEB is connected to the PMT with high-density connectors and the TDC boards are connected to the FEB through 2m cables. The TDC boards are 6U size so that they can be PCI extensions for Instrumentation (PXI) cards. Data from TDC boards can be transferred to the PXI control card through the backboard. In order to make four TDC boards work synchronously, a CDM outputs four clock signals to TDC boards which are distributed from one clock source. The TDC boards achieve a timing resolution of 3.5ns by test with a signal generator.

It is challenging because there are typically millions of cells in a microbial sample, the vast majority of which elude cultivation. The most accurate method to date is exhaustive single cell sequencing using multiple displacement amplification, which is simply intractable for a large number of cells. However, there is hope for breaking this barrier as the number of different cell types with distinct genome sequences is usually much smaller than the number of cells.

Within this setting, the dependent variable may take only two discrete values (such as 0 and 1) giving rise to binary models (e.g., probit and logit models) or more than two values (say $j=1,2, \\ldots, J$, where $J$ is some integer, typically small) giving rise to ordinal models (e.g., ordinal probit and ordinal logit models).

This directly relates to the documentation's point about ants being \"able to grasp regularities and to use them for 'compression' of information.\"\n\nOption A focuses on distance communication but doesn't specifically test for information compression. Option B deals with pheromone response, which is important in ant communication but doesn't directly test for the ability to compress information. Option D relates to recruitment based on food quality and quantity, which, while important, doesn't specifically address the concept of information compression.\n\nThis question integrates multiple concepts (ant communication, Information Theory, and compression of information), applies them to a real-world scenario (food source patterns), and requires critical thinking about how to best demonstrate a specific aspect of ant intelligence.

Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by applying human-imperceptible perturbations on benign inputs. However, under the black-box setting, most existing adversaries often have a poor transferability to attack other defense models. In this work, from the perspective of regarding the adversarial example generation as an optimization process, we propose two new methods to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, namely Nesterov Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (NI-FGSM) and Scale-Invariant attack Method (SIM).

Initially, \u03b3 = 2 (the Fermi-liquid value), then it crosses over to \u03b3 = 3/2, and finally to \u03b3 = 3/4 at the quantum critical point.\n\nRemember that \u03c7(0) - \u03c7(T) \u221d T^\u03b3, so we need to consider the exponents in reverse order as we cool the system towards the critical point:\n\n1. Initially, we have the Fermi-liquid behavior with \u03b3 = 2, so \u03c7(0) - \u03c7(T) \u221d T\u00b2\n2. As we cool, we cross over to \u03b3 = 3/2, so \u03c7(0) - \u03c7(T) \u221d T\u00b3/\u00b2\n3. Finally, as we approach the quantum critical point, \u03b3 = 3/4, giving \u03c7(0) - \u03c7(T) \u221d T\u00b3/\u2074\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence as we cool towards the critical point is T\u00b2 \u2192 T\u00b3/\u00b2 \u2192 T\u00b3/\u2074, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the system's behavior across different regimes, integrate information about crossovers and critical behavior, and apply it to a real-world experimental scenario. The distractors represent plausible misconceptions about the order of transitions or the direction of temperature change, requiring careful consideration of the system's physics."}, "37": {"documentation": {"title": "Should the Ransomware be Paid?", "source": "Rui Fang, Maochao Xu, and Peng Zhao", "docs_id": "2010.06700", "section": ["econ.GN", "math.PR", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Should the Ransomware be Paid?.

Many dynamic processes involve time delays, thus their dynamics are governed by delay differential equations (DDEs). Studying the stability of dynamic systems is critical, but analyzing the stability of time-delay systems is challenging because DDEs are infinite-dimensional. We propose a new approach to quickly generate stability charts for DDEs using continuation of characteristic roots (CCR). In our CCR method, the roots of the characteristic equation of a DDE are written as implicit functions of the parameters of interest, and the continuation equations are derived in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Numerical continuation is then employed to determine the characteristic roots at all points in a parametric space; the stability of the original DDE can then be easily determined. A key advantage of the proposed method is that a system of linearly independent ODEs is solved rather than the typical strategy of solving a large eigenvalue problem at each grid point in the domain. Thus, the CCR method significantly reduces the computational effort required to determine the stability of DDEs. As we demonstrate with several examples, the CCR method generates highly accurate stability charts, and does so up to 10 times faster than the Galerkin approximation method."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the continuation of characteristic roots (CCR) method for analyzing stability in time-delay systems, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a new control system for an industrial robot with inherent time delays.

In this paper, we propose a novel model based on Adversarial Networks and inspirited by the Shared-Private model (ANSP), which aims at reducing common, irrelevant features from the extracted features for information credibility evaluation.

We report an investigation of the structure of $^{12}$C nucleus employing a newly developed configuration-mixing method. In the three-dimensional coordinate-space representation, we generate a number of Slater determinants with various correlated structures using the imaginary-time algorithm. We then diagonalize a many-body Hamiltonian with the Skyrme interaction in the space spanned by the Slater determinants with parity and angular momentum projections. Our calculation reasonably describes the ground and excited states of $^{12}$C nucleus, both for shell-model-like and cluster-like states. The excitation energies and transition strengths of the ground-state rotational band are well reproduced. Negative parity excited states, $1_1^-$, $2_1^-$, and $3_1^-$, are also reasonably described. The second and third $0^+$ states, $0_2^+$ and $0_3^+$, appear at around 8.8 MeV and 15 MeV, respectively. The $0_2^+$ state shows a structure consistent with former results of the \\alpha-cluster models, however, the calculated radius of the $0_2^+$ state is smaller than those calculations.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the structure and properties of this state?\n\nA) It is likely the 0_2^+ state with a dominant \u03b1-cluster structure and a larger radius than predicted by shell model calculations.\nB) It corresponds to the 0_3^+ state and is predominantly characterized by a linear-chain configuration of three \u03b1 particles.\nC) It represents a negative parity excited state, most likely the 3_1^- state, with a mixed shell-model and cluster structure.\nD) This state is part of the ground-state rotational band and exhibits strong electromagnetic transitions to lower-lying states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question targets the higher-level analysis of the ^12C nucleus structure, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly states that \"The three-\u03b1 linear-chain configuration dominates in the 0_3^+ state\" and that this state appears \"at around 15 MeV.\" This matches the description in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it describes some properties of the 0_2^+ state (\u03b1-cluster structure), the documentation places this state at around 8.8 MeV, not 15 MeV. Additionally, the calculated radius is mentioned to be smaller, not larger, than previous \u03b1-cluster model calculations.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the negative parity excited states (1_1^-, 2_1^-, and 3_1^-) are not specifically associated with the 15 MeV energy level in the documentation. Moreover, the 0_3^+ state has positive parity, not negative.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the ground-state rotational band is not described as extending to such high excitation energies (15 MeV) in the given documentation.

Ensemble models are widely used to solve complex tasks by their decomposition into multiple simpler tasks, each one solved locally by a single member of the ensemble. Decoding of error-correction codes is a hard problem due to the curse of dimensionality, leading one to consider ensembles-of-decoders as a possible solution. Nonetheless, one must take complexity into account, especially in decoding. We suggest a low-complexity scheme where a single member participates in the decoding of each word. First, the distribution of feasible words is partitioned into non-overlapping regions. Thereafter, specialized experts are formed by independently training each member on a single region.

Credit (CVA), Debit (DVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustments (FVA) are now familiar valuation adjustments made to the value of a portfolio of derivatives to account for credit risks and funding costs. However, recent changes in the regulatory regime and the increases in regulatory capital requirements has led many banks to include the cost of capital in derivative pricing. This paper formalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer (2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital term, Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA, i.e. Kapital Valuation Adjustment to distinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is also considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the flexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this analysis. The paper further considers the practical calculation of KVA with reference to the Basel II (BCBS-128) and Basel III (BCBS-189) capital regimes and their implementation via CRD IV.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. KVA is designed to account for the cost of regulatory capital in derivative pricing. An increase in market volatility would likely lead to higher capital requirements for the bank's derivatives portfolio.\n\n2. The implementation of more stringent Basel III capital requirements (as mentioned in the documentation) would directly increase the amount of regulatory capital the bank needs to hold against its derivatives portfolio.\n\n3. Long-dated interest rate swaps typically require more capital due to their longer time horizon and potential for market movements, making them more sensitive to changes in capital requirements.\n\n4. Increased volatility and stricter capital requirements would both contribute to higher costs of capital, which is the core concept behind KVA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a decrease in the bank's credit spread would likely reduce credit risk-related capital requirements, potentially decreasing KVA.\n\nOption C, while potentially affecting other valuation adjustments like CVA, would not directly impact KVA, which is primarily concerned with regulatory capital costs.\n\nOption D might actually reduce KVA, as centralized clearing generally reduces counterparty risk and associated capital requirements.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (KVA, Basel III, capital requirements, market conditions) and apply them to a realistic scenario in derivative pricing."}, "49": {"documentation": {"title": "Zero-rating of Content and its Effect on the Quality of Service in the\n  Internet", "source": "Manjesh K.

The ongoing net neutrality debate has generated a lot of heated discussions on whether or not monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing' has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some service providers. In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs (zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs. This allows the possibility for Content Providers (CPs) to make `sponsorship' agreements to zero-rate their content and attract more user traffic. In this paper, we study the effect of differential pricing on various players in the Internet. We first consider a model with a monopolistic ISP and multiple CPs where users select CPs based on the quality of service (QoS) and data access charges. We show that in a differential pricing regime 1) a CP offering low QoS can make have higher surplus than a CP offering better QoS through sponsorships. 2) Overall QoS (mean delay) for end users can degrade under differential pricing schemes. In the oligopolistic market with multiple ISPs, users tend to select the ISP with lowest ISP resulting in same type of conclusions as in the monopolistic market.

The correct answer is B, which integrates two key findings from the research:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"a CP offering low QoS can make have higher surplus than a CP offering better QoS through sponsorships.\" This suggests that the educational CP may indeed gain more users through the zero-rating agreement, even if its quality of service is not superior.\n\n2.

With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is limited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling. We find that when different cells cooperate the resulting bias can be much larger than the effects of ligand-receptor binding. Specifically, when a strongly-responding cell is at one end of a cell cluster, cluster motion is biased toward that cell.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the connection between these two concepts and its implications?\n\nA) The matrix product representation of Bethe eigenstates is equivalent to the six-vertex model with periodic boundary conditions, and changing the basis in the auxiliary space transforms it into a four-vertex model.\n\nB) The matrix product ansatz for the Heisenberg chain is unrelated to the six-vertex model, but both can be derived independently using the algebraic Bethe ansatz.\n\nC) The matrix product representation of Bethe eigenstates is closely related to the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, and changing the basis maps it to a five-vertex model.\n\nD) The six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions can be used to generate the matrix product ansatz, but the resulting matrices are incompatible with those proposed by Alcaraz and Lazo.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and requires analysis of the relationships between different models. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that there is a \"close relation between the matrix product representation of the Bethe eigenstates and the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions.\"\n\n2. It also mentions that \"the change of basis corresponds to a mapping from the six-vertex model to the five-vertex model.\"\n\n3. This connection highlights the deep relationship between different mathematical models in statistical physics and quantum mechanics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions periodic boundary conditions and a four-vertex model, neither of which are discussed in the documentation. Option B is wrong as it states the concepts are unrelated, contradicting the documented close relationship. Option D is incorrect because the matrices derived are actually the same as those proposed by Alcaraz and Lazo, apart from normalization factors.\n\nThis question requires the test-taker to synthesize information about the matrix product ansatz, the Bethe eigenstates, the six-vertex model, and the effects of basis changes, demonstrating a high level of understanding and analysis of the interconnected concepts in the field."}}
