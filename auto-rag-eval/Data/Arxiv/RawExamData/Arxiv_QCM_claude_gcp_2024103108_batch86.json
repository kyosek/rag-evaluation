Here we investigate the cosmological implications of CanDM and how it impacts CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum, by implementing the model within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver.

Resilience against major disasters is the most essential characteristic of future electrical distribution systems (EDS). A multi-agent-based rolling optimization method for EDS restoration scheduling is proposed in this paper. When a blackout occurs, considering the risk of losing the centralized authority due to the failure of the common core communication network, the agents available after disasters or cyber-attacks identify the communication-connected parts (CCPs) in the EDS with distributed communication. A multi-time interval optimization model is formulated and solved by the agents for the restoration scheduling of a CCP. A rolling optimization process for the entire EDS restoration is proposed. During the scheduling/rescheduling in the rolling process, the CCPs in the EDS are reidentified and the restoration schedules for the CCPs are updated. Through decentralized decision-making and rolling optimization, EDS restoration scheduling can automatically start and periodically update itself, providing effective solutions for EDS restoration scheduling in a blackout event.

Regarding underwriting risks, the main uncertainties that insurers must manage are related to the premium sufficiency to cover future claims and the adequacy of the current reserves to pay outstanding claims. Both risks are calibrated using stochastic models due to their nature. This paper introduces a reserving model based on a set of machine learning techniques such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks. These algorithms and other widely used reserving models are stacked to predict the shape of the runoff. To compute the deviation around a former prediction, a log-normal approach is combined with the suggested model. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used to improve the performance of the traditional reserving techniques based on Bayesian statistics and a Chain Ladder, leading to a more accurate assessment of the reserving risk."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and benefit of the stochastic reserving model proposed in the paper?\n\nA) It exclusively uses Artificial Neural Networks to predict claim reserve requirements, eliminating the need for traditional actuarial methods.\n\nB) It combines multiple machine learning techniques with traditional reserving models in a stacked approach to improve the accuracy of runoff predictions and risk assessment.\n\nC) It replaces stochastic modeling with deterministic methods, simplifying the reserve calculation process for insurance companies.\n\nD) It focuses solely on premium sufficiency risk, ignoring the adequacy of current reserves for outstanding claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because the paper introduces a reserving model that stacks multiple machine learning techniques (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks) with traditional reserving models.

Many ion channels spontaneously switch between different levels of activity. Although this behaviour known as modal gating has been observed for a long time it is currently not well understood. Despite the fact that appropriately representing activity changes is essential for accurately capturing time course data from ion channels, systematic approaches for modelling modal gating are currently not available. In this paper, we develop a modular approach for building such a model in an iterative process. First, stochastic switching between modes and stochastic opening and closing within modes are represented in separate aggregated Markov models. Second, the continuous-time hierarchical Markov model, a new modelling framework proposed here, then enables us to combine these components so that in the integrated model both mode switching as well as the kinetics within modes are appropriately represented. A mathematical analysis reveals that the behaviour of the hierarchical Markov model naturally depends on the properties of its components. We also demonstrate how a hierarchical Markov model can be parameterised using experimental data and show that it provides a better representation than a previous model of the same data set.
