May and Leonard (SIAM J. Appl. Math 1975) introduced a three-species Lotka-Volterra type population model that exhibits heteroclinic cycling. Rather than producing a periodic limit cycle, the trajectory takes longer and longer to complete each \"cycle\", passing closer and closer to unstable fixed points in which one population dominates and the others approach zero. Aperiodic heteroclinic dynamics have subsequently been studied in ecological systems (side-blotched lizards; colicinogenic E. coli), in the immune system, in neural information processing models (\"winnerless competition\"), and in models of neural central pattern generators.

In our model, cooperators and defectors interact as in the classical prisoner's dilemma game, where selection favors defection. However, here the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the fitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that of defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's dilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation takes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing states. These quantities are computed exactly and using Fokker-Planck equations. Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate that the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between their density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r. When z>r, the fixation of cooperators is likely in a large population and, under weak selection pressure, invasion and replacement of defection by cooperation is favored by selection if b(z-r)(1-z)>1/N, where 0<b<= 1 is the cooperation payoff benefit.

Heterogeneity of economic agents is emphasized in a new trend of macroeconomics.

In this paper we propose a new idea referred to as production copula; a copula is an analytic means for modeling dependence among variables. Such a production copula predicts value added yielded by firms with given capital and labor in a probabilistic way. It is thereby in sharp contrast to the production function where the output of firms is completely deterministic. We demonstrate empirical construction of a production copula using financial data of listed firms in Japan. Analysis of the data shows that there are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added and confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented by a production function.
