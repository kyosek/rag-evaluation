When directly using existing text generation datasets for controllable generation, we are facing the problem of not having the domain knowledge and thus the aspects that could be controlled are limited.A typical example is when using CNN/Daily Mail dataset for controllable text summarization, there is no guided information on the emphasis of summary sentences. A more useful text generator should leverage both the input text and control variables to guide the generation, which can only be built with deep understanding of the domain knowledge. Motivated by this vi-sion, our paper introduces a new text generation dataset, named MReD. Our new dataset consists of 7,089 meta-reviews and all its 45k meta-review sentences are manually annotated as one of the carefully defined 9 categories, including abstract, strength, decision, etc. We present experimental results on start-of-the-art summarization models, and propose methods for controlled generation on both extractive and abstractive models using our annotated data.

LSQR and its mathematically equivalent CGLS have been popularly used over the decades for large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems, where the iteration number $k$ plays the role of the regularization parameter. It has been long known that if the Ritz values in LSQR converge to the large singular values of $A$ in natural order until its semi-convergence then LSQR must have the same the regularization ability as the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) method and can compute a 2-norm filtering best possible regularized solution. However, hitherto there has been no definitive rigorous result on the approximation behavior of the Ritz values in the context of ill-posed problems. In this paper, for severely, moderately and mildly ill-posed problems, we give accurate solutions of the two closely related fundamental and highly challenging problems on the regularization of LSQR: (i) How accurate are the low rank approximations generated by Lanczos bidiagonalization? (ii) Whether or not the Ritz values involved in LSQR approximate the large singular values of $A$ in natural order?

We consider the Adlam-Allen (AA) system of partial differential equations which, arguably, is the first model that was introduced to describe solitary waves in the context of propagation of hydrodynamic disturbances in collisionless plasmas. Here, we identify the solitary waves of the model by implementing a dynamical systems approach. The latter suggests that the model also possesses periodic wave solutions --which reduce to the solitary wave in the limiting case of infinite period-- as well as rational solutions which are obtained herein. In addition, employing a long-wave approximation via a relevant multiscale expansion method, we establish the asymptotic reduction of the AA system to the Korteweg-de Vries equation.

We find that a number of transition scenarios besides the standard sequence are generically possible, which calls into question the reliability of any particular pattern or sequence as a precursor to vegetation collapse. Additionally, we find that clues to the robustness of the standard sequence lie in the nonlinear details of a particular model."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What can be inferred about the robustness of the \"standard\" sequence of patterned states in vegetation models for semi-arid ecosystems, and what implications does this have for our understanding of vegetation collapse?\n\nA) The \"standard\" sequence is robust and reliable, and its failure is a clear indicator of vegetation collapse.\nB) The \"standard\" sequence is not robust and its failure is a clear indicator of vegetation collapse, and the existence of alternative transition scenarios calls into question the reliability of any particular pattern or sequence.\nC) The \"standard\" sequence is robust and reliable, but its failure is not a clear indicator of vegetation collapse, and the existence of alternative transition scenarios is irrelevant to our understanding of vegetation collapse.\nD) The \"standard\" sequence is not robust and its failure is not a clear indicator of vegetation collapse, and the existence of alternative transition scenarios is a clear indicator of vegetation collapse.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The \"standard\" sequence is not robust and its failure is a clear indicator of vegetation collapse, and the existence of alternative transition scenarios calls into question the reliability of any particular pattern or sequence.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the documentation states that the \"standard\" sequence is not robust and that a number of alternative transition scenarios are generically possible, which calls into question the reliability of any particular pattern or sequence. This implies that the failure of the \"standard\" sequence is a clear indicator of vegetation collapse, and that the existence of alternative transition scenarios is a significant factor in our understanding of vegetation collapse."}}
