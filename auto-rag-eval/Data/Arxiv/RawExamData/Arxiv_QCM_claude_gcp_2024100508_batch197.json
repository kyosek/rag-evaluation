The properties of competition models where all individuals are identical are relatively well-understood; however, juveniles and adults can experience or generate competition differently. We study here structured competition models in discrete time that allow multiple life history parameters to depend on adult or juvenile population densities. While the properties of such models are less well-known, a numerical study with Ricker density-dependence suggested that when competition coefficients acting on juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies, stage structure could foster coexistence. We revisit and expand those results using models more amenable to mathematical analysis. First, through a Beverton-Holt two-species juvenile-adult model, we obtain analytical expressions explaining how this coexistence emerging from life-history complexity can occur. Second, we show using a community-level sensitivity analysis that such emergent coexistence is robust to perturbations of parameter values. Finally, we ask whether these results extend from two to many species, using simulations. We show that they do not, as coexistence emerging from life-history complexity is only seen for very similar life-history parameters. Such emergent coexistence is therefore not likely to be a key mechanism of coexistence in very diverse ecosystems."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a structured competition model with stage-specific density dependence, which of the following scenarios is most likely to foster coexistence between two species according to the study?\n\nA) When competition coefficients for both juvenile survival and fertility reflect the same competitive hierarchy between species\nB) When competition coefficients for juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies between species\nC) When competition coefficients only affect adult survival rates\nD) When competition coefficients are identical for all life stages and species\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The study indicates that coexistence can emerge in structured competition models when the competition coefficients acting on juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies between species.

In recent years, speech emotion recognition (SER) has been used in wide ranging applications, from healthcare to the commercial sector. In addition to signal processing approaches, methods for SER now also use deep learning techniques. However, generalizing over languages, corpora and recording conditions is still an open challenge in the field. Furthermore, due to the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms, a newer challenge is the lack of interpretation and transparency in the models and the decision making process. This is critical when the SER systems are deployed in applications that influence human lives. In this work we address this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the decision making process of the proposed SER system. Towards that end, we present low-complexity SER based on undercomplete- and denoising- autoencoders that achieve an average classification accuracy of over 55\\% for four-class emotion classification.

The ability to locally degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interact with the tumour microenvironment is a key process distinguishing cancer from normal cells, and is a critical step in the metastatic spread of the tumour.

This is a regulatory process through which epithelial cells (ECs) acquire mesenchymal characteristics and transform to mesenchymal-like cells (MCs). In this paper, we present a new mathematical model which describes the transition from a collective invasion strategy for the ECs to an individual invasion strategy for the MCs. We achieve this by formulating a coupled hybrid system consisting of partial and stochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of the ECs and the MCs, respectively.

In this paper, we propose the Data-Driven Distributed Policy Iteration (D3PI) algorithm to design a feedback mechanism for a potentially large system that enjoys an underlying graph structure characterizing communications among the agents. Rather than having access to system parameters, our algorithm requires temporary \"auxiliary\" links to boost information exchange of a small portion of the graph during the learning phase.

After the termination of the learning process, a distributed policy is proposed for the entire networked system by leveraging estimated components obtained in the learning phase.

In this paper, mathematical models are use to investigate the dynamics of interpersonal and romantic relationships, which are examined via ordinary and stochastic differential equations, in order to provide insight into the behaviors of love. The analysis starts with a deterministic model and progresses to nonlinear stochastic models capturing the stochastic rates and factors (e.g.: ecological factors, such as historical, cultural and community conditions) that affect proximal experiences and shape the patterns of relationship.

A growing number of experimental evidence shows that it is general for a ligand binding protein to have a potential for allosteric regulation and for further evolution.

This work aimed to clarify the implication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number of degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With the help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality theorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system that can be described in terms of smooth manifolds.

A simple and elegant arrangement of stock components of a portfolio (market index-DJIA) in a recent paper [1], has led to the construction of crossing of stocks diagram.

The present paper continues to uncover new mathematical structures residing from crossings of stocks diagram by introducing topological properties stock market is endowed with. The crossings of stocks are categorized as overcrossings and undercrossings and interpreted as generators of braid that stocks form in the process of prices quotations in the market. Topological structure of the stock market is even richer if the closure of stocks braid is considered, such that it forms a knot. To distinguish the kind of knot that stock market forms, Alexander-Conway polynomial and the Jones polynomials are calculated for some knotted stocks. These invariants of knots are important for the future practical applications topological stock market might have.

To this end, we use random weights and large width limits, which enables us to utilize mean field theories.

Because the landscape of the parameter space is defined by the FIM, it is locally flat in most dimensions, but strongly distorted in others. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential usage of the derived statistics in learning strategies.

The study reveals that in deep neural networks, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) exhibits a peculiar eigenvalue distribution. Most of the eigenvalues are close to zero, indicating that the parameter space is locally flat in most dimensions. However, there are a few eigenvalues, particularly the maximum eigenvalue, that take on extremely large values. This implies that while the parameter space is mostly flat, there are some dimensions where it is strongly distorted.\n\nThis finding has important implications for understanding the landscape of the parameter space in deep neural networks and can inform learning strategies.
