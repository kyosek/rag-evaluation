A neuro-computational model of cortical map formation was adapted to examine effects of focal and distributed injury at various stages of development.

Born in rapidly evolving mini-halos during the first billion years of the Universe, super- massive black holes (SMBH) feed from gas flows spanning many orders of magnitude, from the cosmic web in which they are embedded to their event horizon. As such, accretion onto SMBHs constitutes a formidable challenge to tackle numerically, and currently requires the use of sub-grid models to handle the flow on small, unresolved scales. In this paper, we study the impact of resolution on the accretion pattern of SMBHs initially inserted at the heart of dense galactic gas clouds, using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the black hole (BH) gravitational zone of influence. We find that once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved, accretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently of the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early stages of cloud collapse. For a pristine gas mix of hydrogen and helium, a slim disc develops around the BH on sub-parsec scales, turning the otherwise chaotic BH accretion duty cycle into an episodic one, with potentially important consequences for BH feedback. In the presence of such a nuclear disc, BH mass growth predominantly occurs when infalling dense clumps trigger disc instabilities, fuelling intense albeit short-lived gas accretion episodes."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary factor that determines the accretion pattern of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the presence of a gas cloud host, according to the study mentioned in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) The mass of the SMBH seed\nB) The internal structure of the gas cloud host\nC) The presence of dynamical friction during cloud collapse\nD) The resolution of the numerical simulation\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The internal structure of the gas cloud host\n\nExplanation: The study suggests that once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well-resolved, accretion onto the SMBH is driven by the cloud's internal structure, independently of the SMBH seed mass.

With the imminent slowing down of DRAM scaling, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth, and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.
