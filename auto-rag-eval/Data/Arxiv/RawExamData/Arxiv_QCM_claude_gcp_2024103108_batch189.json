This paper proposes a novel data augmentation technique based on semantic transposition of the transcriptions via syntax rules for end-to-end Mandarin ASR. Specifically, we first segment the transcriptions based on part-of-speech tags. Then transposition strategies, such as placing the object in front of the subject or swapping the subject and the object, are applied on the segmented sentences. Finally, the acoustic features corresponding to the transposed transcription are reassembled based on the audio-to-text forced-alignment produced by a pre-trained ASR system.

We present a pioneering estimate of the global yearly greenhouse gas emissions of a large-scale Astrophysics experiment over several decades: the Giant Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND).

We developed an analytic framework for the SIR epidemic model to examine the effect of (i) source of infection and (ii) between-host asymmetry in infection probabilities, on disease risk. We measured risk as outbreak probability and outbreak size in a focal host, represented by one network layer. Numeric simulations were used to validate the analytic formulations. We found that outbreak probability is determined by a complex interaction between source of infection and between-host infection probabilities, whereas outbreak size is mainly affected by the non-focal host to focal host infection probability alone. Hence, inter-specific asymmetry in infection probabilities shapes disease dynamics in multihost networks.

The corresponding class of additive regular functions has multiple equivalent characterizations, appealing closure properties, and a decidable equivalence problem. In this paper, we solve two decision problems for this model. First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function to be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We characterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition regarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart from one another. We then use this condition to design a PSPACE algorithm to compute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower bound. Our results also lead to a machine-independent characterization of the register complexity of additive regular functions.

The documentation states that computing the register complexity of a given ACRA is PSPACE-complete. In this case, we're asked to determine if an ACRA with 5 registers can be reduced to one with 3 registers, which is equivalent to determining if the register complexity is at most 3.

If it does, it must satisfy the mixture continuity axiom of Herstein and Milnor (1953). Mixture continuity is sufficient for a mixture-preserving multi-representation when the dimension of the mixture space is countable, but not when it is uncountable. Our strongest positive result is that mixture continuity is sufficient in conjunction with a novel axiom we call countable domination, which constrains the order complexity of the mixture preorder in terms of its Archimedean structure. We also consider what happens when the mixture space is given its natural weak topology. Continuity (having closed upper and lower sets) and closedness (having a closed graph) are stronger than mixture continuity. We show that continuity is necessary but not sufficient for a mixture preorder to have a mixture-preserving multi-representation.

Using a well-studied system of pests and their enemies in an agroecosystem, we apply this model as a stylized vision of the dynamics of that real system, to ask whether its actual natural history is reflected in the dynamics of the qualitatively instantiated Kuramoto model.
