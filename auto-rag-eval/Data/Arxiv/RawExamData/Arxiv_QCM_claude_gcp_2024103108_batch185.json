A new approach to obtaining market--directional information, based on a non-stationary solution to the dynamic equation \"future price tends to the value that maximizes the number of shares traded per unit time\" [1] is presented. In our previous work[2], we established that it is the share execution flow ($I=dV/dt$) and not the share trading volume ($V$) that is the driving force of the market, and that asset prices are much more sensitive to the execution flow $I$ (the dynamic impact) than to the traded volume $V$ (the regular impact). In this paper, an important advancement is achieved: we define the \"scalp-price\" ${\\cal P}$ as the sum of only those price moves that are relevant to market dynamics; the criterion of relevance is a high $I$. Thus, only \"follow the market\" (and not \"little bounce\") events are included in ${\\cal P}$. Changes in the scalp-price defined this way indicate a market trend change - not a bear market rally or a bull market sell-off; the approach can be further extended to non-local price change.

This paper considers the segmentation, identification and localization of vertebrae in CT images.

Consequently, the three tasks tend to be approached independently, e.g. labelling (localization and identification) or segmenting only, or, when treated globally, a sequential strategy is used.

Here we propose a mathematical model to explain how antibiotic-mediated switches in the microbiota composition can result from simple social interactions between antibiotic-tolerant and antibiotic-sensitive bacterial groups. We build a two-species (e.g. two functional-groups) model and identify regions of domination by antibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, as well as a region of multistability where domination by either group is possible.

In this paper, we employ a game-theoretic model to analyze the interaction between an adversary and a classifier.

The adversary is interested in maximizing the probability of miss-detection for the positive class (i.e., false negative probability). The adversary however does not want to significantly modify the data point so that it still maintains favourable traits of the original class. The classifier, on the other hand, is interested in maximizing the probability of correct detection for the positive class (i.e., true positive probability) subject to a lower-bound on the probability of correct detection for the negative class (i.e., true negative probability). For conditionally Gaussian data points (conditioned on the class) and linear support vector machine classifiers, we rewrite the optimization problems of the adversary and the classifier as convex optimization problems and use best response dynamics to learn an equilibrium of the game. This results in computing a linear support vector machine classifier that is robust against adversarial input manipulations.

The mobility of vacancies in alloys may limit dislocation climb. Using a combined density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo approach we investigate vacancy diffusion in Ni-Re, Ni-W, and Ni-Ta binary alloys up to 10 at.% solute concentration. We introduce an interaction model that takes into account the chemical environment close to the diffusing atom to capture the effect of solute-host and solute-solute interactions on the diffusion barriers. In contrast to an ideal solid solution it is not only the diffusion barrier of the solute atom that influences the vacancy mobility, but primarily the change in the host diffusion barriers due to the presence of solute atoms. This is evidenced by the fact that the observed vacancy slowdown as a function of solute concentration is larger in Ni-W than in Ni-Re, even though Re is a slower diffuser than W. To model diffusion in complex, non-dilute alloys an explicit treatment of interaction energies is thus unavoidable. In the context of Ni-based superalloys two conclusions can be drawn from our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations: the observed slowdown in vacancy mobility is not sufficient to be the sole cause for the so-called Re-effect; and assuming a direct correlation between vacancy mobility, dislocation climb, and creep strength the experimentally observed similar effect of W and Re in enhancing creep strength can be confirmed."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the study of vacancy diffusion in non-dilute Ni-X (X=Re, W, Ta) alloys, which of the following conclusions is supported by the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations?\n\nA) The slowdown in vacancy mobility is solely responsible for the Re-effect in Ni-based superalloys.\n\nB) Re causes a larger vacancy slowdown than W in Ni-based alloys due to its slower diffusion rate.\n\nC) An ideal solid solution model is sufficient to accurately predict vacancy mobility in these alloys.\n\nD) The change in host diffusion barriers due to solute atoms primarily influences vacancy mobility, rather than just the solute atom's diffusion barrier.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key findings from the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely the computational and charging delays. This paper proposes a solution for these two challenges by suggesting the use of fog computing for AEMoD systems, and developing an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching scheme for its vehicles. A queuing model representing the proposed multi-class charging and dispatching scheme is first introduced. The stability conditions of this model and the number of classes that fit the charging capabilities of any given city zone are then derived. Decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge, or directly serve customers are then optimized using a stochastic linear program that minimizes the maximum response time of the system.

The proposed multi-class charging and dispatching scheme aims to address the computational and charging delays that are major bottlenecks in AEMoD systems. The scheme optimizes the decision on what proportion of vehicles should partially charge, fully charge, or directly serve customers. This optimization is done using a stochastic linear program that minimizes the maximum response time of the system, effectively balancing the need for charging with the need to maintain service availability.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the scheme doesn't focus on increasing charging stations, but rather on optimizing the use of existing charging capabilities.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the scheme doesn't address the cost of vehicles, but rather their operational efficiency.\n\nAnswer D is unrelated to the charging and dispatching scheme described in the document."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Learning from Demonstration in the Wild", "source": "Feryal Behbahani, Kyriacos Shiarlis, Xi Chen, Vitaly Kurin, Sudhanshu\n  Kasewa, Ciprian Stirbu, Jo\\~ao Gomes, Supratik Paul, Frans A.
