Brain tissue is a heterogeneous material, constituted by a soft matrix filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

Here, we investigate the influence of the cutting rate on the fracture properties of brain, through wire cutting experiments. We also present a model for the rate-dependent behaviour of fracture propagation in soft materials, which comprises the effects of fluid interaction through a poro-hyperelastic formulation. The method is developed in the framework of finite strain continuum mechanics, implemented in a commercial finite element code, and applied to the case of an edge-crack remotely loaded by a controlled displacement.

Downloading the computed result from the EN back to the mobile user may suffer long delay if the downlink channel experiences strong interference or deep fading. This paper exploits the idea of computation replication in MEC networks to speed up the downloading phase. Computation replication allows each user to offload its task to multiple ENs for repetitive execution so as to create multiple copies of the computed result at different ENs which can then enable transmission cooperation and hence reduce the communication latency for result downloading. Yet, computation replication may also increase the communication latency for task uploading, despite the obvious increase in computation load. The main contribution of this work is to characterize asymptotically an order-optimal upload-download communication latency pair for a given computation load in a multi-user multi-server MEC network. Analysis shows when the computation load increases within a certain range, the downloading time decreases in an inversely proportional way if it is binary offloading or decreases linearly if it is partial offloading, both at the expense of linear increase in the uploading time."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of computation replication for mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between computation load and communication latency?\n\nA) As computation load increases, both upload and download times decrease linearly.\n\nB) Increasing computation load always results in shorter overall communication latency.\n\nC) With binary offloading, download time decreases inversely proportionally to computation load increase, while upload time increases linearly.\n\nD) In partial offloading, download time decreases exponentially as computation load increases, with no effect on upload time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, when the computation load increases within a certain range, the downloading time decreases in an inversely proportional way if it is binary offloading. At the same time, this comes at the expense of a linear increase in the uploading time. This relationship accurately captures the fundamental computation-communication tradeoff described in the paper.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that both upload and download times decrease linearly, which contradicts the documented inverse relationship for download time and linear increase for upload time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it oversimplifies the relationship and doesn't account for the increase in upload time as computation load increases.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it misrepresents the relationship for partial offloading.

Recent work in adversarial machine learning started to focus on the visual perception in autonomous driving and studied Adversarial Examples (AEs) for object detection models. However, in such visual perception pipeline the detected objects must also be tracked, in a process called Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), to build the moving trajectories of surrounding obstacles. Since MOT is designed to be robust against errors in object detection, it poses a general challenge to existing attack techniques that blindly target objection detection: we find that a success rate of over 98% is needed for them to actually affect the tracking results, a requirement that no existing attack technique can satisfy.

Energy released from the accretion of disk material by the black hole or from the rotation of the hole itself extracted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism powers a relativistic wind along the system axis. Lorentz factors of several hundreds are needed to solve the compactness problem in the wind which implies the injection of a tremendous power into a very small amount of matter.

In this paper we rather study the wind emitted from the inner part of the disk where the risk of baryonic pollution is much larger since the outflow originates from high density regions. We show that the baryonic load of this wind sensitively depends on the disk temperature and magnetic field geometry and that the outflow can become ultra-relativistic (Lorentz factor Gamma>100) under quite restrictive conditions only.
