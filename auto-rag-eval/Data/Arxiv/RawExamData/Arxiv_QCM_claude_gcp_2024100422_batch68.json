The passage states that Si addition \"promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the intermetallics leading to finer precipitates\" and \"The strengthening effect is mainly owing to the dispersoid strengthening by increasing volume fraction of T phase and less harmful \u03b1-Fe with a compact structure.\" This indicates that Si enhances mechanical properties primarily by increasing the volume fraction of T phase and promoting finer, more dispersed precipitates.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage does not mention Si forming soft, elongated precipitates or increasing ductility.

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that is widespread in many regions of the world.

In addition, the screening of individuals with the largely asymptomatic condition of sickle cell trait (SCT) is necessary to curtail the genetic propagation of the disease. However, the cost and complexity of conventional diagnostic methods limit the feasibility of early diagnosis of SCD and SCT in resource-limited areas worldwide.

To bridge the gap between the sequences and 3-dimensional (3D) structures of RNAs, some computational models have been proposed for predicting RNA 3D structures. However, the existed models seldom consider the conditions departing from the room/body temperature and high salt (1M NaCl), and thus generally hardly predict the thermodynamics and salt effect.

Consider the setting of a utilitarian policy maker who must use sample data to allocate a binary treatment to members of a population, based on their observable characteristics. We model this problem as a statistical decision problem where the policy maker must choose a subset of the covariate space to assign to treatment, out of a class of potential subsets. We focus on settings in which the policy maker may want to select amongst a collection of constrained subset classes: examples include choosing the number of covariates over which to perform best-subset selection, and model selection when approximating a complicated class via a sieve.

We establish an oracle inequality for the regret of the PWM rule which shows that it is able to perform model selection over the collection of available classes.
