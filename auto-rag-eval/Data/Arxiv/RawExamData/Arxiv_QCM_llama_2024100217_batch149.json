The pre-eruption splitting process is associated with gradual magnetic flux cancellations and converging photospheric flows around the polarity inversion line.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the documentation describes the filament's splitting process as a gradual rise of the upper branch, followed by a rapid rise and chaotic motion, and the development of an arc-shaped EUV front. This suggests that the filament is composed of two distinct flux bundles, with the upper branch exhibiting chaotic swirling motions and the lower branch remaining stable. The pre-eruption splitting process is also associated with gradual magnetic flux cancellations and converging photospheric flows around the polarity inversion line, which is consistent with the formation of a double-decker structure."}, "10": {"documentation": {"title": "Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs", "source": "Cheng Wang, Haojin Yang, Christian Bartz, Christoph Meinel", "docs_id": "1604.00790", "section": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.MM"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs. This work presents an end-to-end trainable deep bidirectional LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) model for image captioning.
