We report on the highest precision yet achieved in the measurement of the polarization of a low energy, $\\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV), electron beam, accomplished using a new polarimeter based on electron-photon scattering, in Hall~C at Jefferson Lab. A number of technical innovations were necessary, including a novel method for precise control of the laser polarization in a cavity and a novel diamond micro-strip detector which was able to capture most of the spectrum of scattered electrons.

One way to eliminate this requirement is to utilize strong spin-orbit coupling present in transition metal dichalcogenides that exhibit a valley dependent polarized emission. Such interactions were previously reported using plasmonic waveguides, but these structures exhibit short propagation lengths due to loss.

Traditional methods for solving FBSDEs often require separate steps for forward and backward components, which can be computationally intensive and may introduce errors.\n\n2.

Providing security for messages in group communication is more essential and critical nowadays. In group oriented applications such as Video conferencing and entertainment applications, it is necessary to secure the confidential data in such a way that intruders are not able to modify or transmit the data. Key transfer protocols fully rely on trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) to compute group key and to transport the group keys to all communication parties in a secured and secret manner. In this paper, an efficient key generation and key transfer protocol has been proposed where KGC can broadcast group key information to all group members in a secure way. Hence, only authorized group members will be able to retrieve the secret key and unauthorized members cannot retrieve the secret key. Hence, inorder to maintain the forward and backward secrecy, the group keys are updated whenever a new member joins or leaves the communication group.

In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-relay selection for multi-stream cooperative MIMO systems with $M$ relay nodes. Traditionally, relay selection approaches are primarily focused on selecting one relay node to improve the transmission reliability given a single-antenna destination node. As such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected relay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit cooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time coding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the cooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data streams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore, we propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support multi-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic performance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff.

The scaling exponent of a hierarchy of cities used to be regarded as a fractal parameter. The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of size distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was treated as the reciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In this paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of rank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the principle of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of Pareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio of the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of city population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this dimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the scaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities based on this scale.

In this paper, we propose a human-perception-based pseudo analog video transmission system named ROIC-Cast, which aims to intelligently enhance the transmission quality of the region-of-interest (ROI) parts. Firstly, the classic deep learning based saliency detection algorithm is adopted to decompose the continuous video sequences into ROI and non-ROI blocks. Secondly, an effective compression method is used to reduce the data amount of side information generated by the ROI extraction module. Then, the power allocation scheme is formulated as a convex problem, and the optimal transmission power for both ROI and non-ROI blocks is derived in a closed form. Finally, the simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system by comparing with a few of existing systems, e.g., KMV-Cast, SoftCast, and DAC-RAN. The proposed ROIC-Cast can achieve over 4.1dB peak signal- to-noise ratio gains of ROI compared with other systems, given the channel signal-to-noise ratio as -5dB, 0dB, 5dB, and 10dB, respectively.

With changing policy on climate change and carbon emission regulation, the uncertainties of carbon price and carbon tax are also analysed and considered in the proposed planning model. The stochastic planning, and robust planning methods are introduced to verify mutually through economic and carbon indices.
