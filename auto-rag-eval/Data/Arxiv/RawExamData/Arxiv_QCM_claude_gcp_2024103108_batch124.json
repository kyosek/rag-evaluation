In this work, a MIMO broadcast channel under the energy harvesting (EH) constraint and the peak power constraint is investigated. The transmitter is equipped with a hybrid energy storage system consisting of a perfect super capacitor (SC) and an inefficient battery, where both elements have limited energy storage capacities. In addition, the effect of data processing circuit power consumption is also addressed. To be specific, two extreme cases are studied here, where the first assumes ideal/zero circuit power consumption and the second considers a positive constant circuit power consumption where the circuit is always operating at its highest power level. The performance of these two extreme cases hence serve as the upper bound and the lower bound of the system performance in practice, respectively. In this setting, the offline scheduling with ideal and maximum circuit power consumptions are investigated. The associated optimization problems are formulated and solved in terms of weighted throughput optimization. Further, we extend to a general circuit power consumption model. To complement this work, some intuitive online policies are presented for all cases. Interestingly, for the case with maximum circuit power consumption, a close-to-optimal online policy is presented and its performance is shown to be comparable to its offline counterpart in the numerical results."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the MIMO broadcast channel with energy harvesting constraints, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the circuit power consumption models discussed in the study?\n\nA) The ideal/zero circuit power consumption case provides an upper bound for system performance.\nB) The positive constant circuit power consumption case, where the circuit always operates at its highest power level, represents a lower bound for system performance.\nC) The general circuit power consumption model is an extension that lies between the two extreme cases.\nD) The case with maximum circuit power consumption always outperforms the ideal/zero power consumption case in terms of weighted throughput optimization.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is incorrect and thus the correct answer to this question. The study presents two extreme cases of circuit power consumption: ideal/zero consumption and maximum (positive constant) consumption. These cases serve as upper and lower bounds for system performance, respectively. The ideal case would actually provide better performance in terms of weighted throughput optimization, as it assumes no power is wasted on circuit operations. The maximum power consumption case represents a lower bound on performance due to the constant power drain. The general model extends these concepts, likely falling between these two extremes.

Ideally, the results would indicate the use of micro cavitation as a more efficient alternative to underwater vehicle depth control than the conventional ballast tank method.

We present the $UBVR_cI_c$ broad band optical photometry of the Type Ic supernova SN 2002ap obtained during 2002 February 06 -- March 23 in the early decline phases and also later on 2002 15 August. Combining these data with the published ones, the general light curve development is studied. The time and luminosity of the peak brightness and the peak width are estimated. There is a flattening in the optical light curve about 30 days after the $B$ maximum.

The maximum brightness of SN 2002ap $M_V = - 17.2$ mag, is comparable to that of the type Ic 1997ef, but fainter than that of the type Ic hypernova SN 1998bw. The peak luminosity indicates an ejection of $\\sim$ 0.06 M$_{\\odot}$ ${}^{56}$Ni mass. We also present low-resolution optical spectra obtained during the early phases.

Ultracold neutral plasmas, formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the ionization threshold, have electron temperatures in the 1-1000 kelvin range and ion temperatures from tens of millikelvin to a few kelvin. They represent a new frontier in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with much hotter systems, but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic, condensed matter, and low temperature physics. Modelling these plasmas challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the field has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements for comparison with theoretical predictions. Recent experiments using optical probes demonstrated that ions in the plasma equilibrate in a strongly coupled fluid phase. Strongly coupled plasmas, in which the electrical interaction energy between charged particles exceeds the average kinetic energy, reverse the traditional energy hierarchy underlying basic plasma concepts such as Debye screening and hydrodynamics.

Minimally modified gravity theories are modifications of general relativity with two local gravitational degrees of freedom in four dimensions.

We start with the phase space of general relativity in the ADM formalism.

In the thermodynamics of nanoscopic systems the relation between classical and quantum mechanical description is of particular importance.

The energy change of the oscillator induced by the driving is closely related to the probability distribution of work for the system. With the amplitude $\\lambda(t)$ of the drive increasing from zero to a maximum $\\lambda_{max}$ and then going back to zero again initial and final Hamiltonian coincide.
