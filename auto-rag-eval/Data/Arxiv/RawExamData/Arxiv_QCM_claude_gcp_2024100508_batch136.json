As galaxy simulations increase in resolution more attention is being paid towards the evolution of dwarf galaxies and how the simulations compare to observations. Despite this increasing resolution we are however, far away from resolving the interactions of satellite dwarf galaxies and the hot coronae which surround host galaxies. We describe a new method which focuses only on the local region surrounding an infalling dwarf in an effort to understand how the hot baryonic halo will alter the chemodynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies. Using this method we examine how a dwarf, similar to Sextans dwarf spheroidal, evolves in the corona of a Milky Way like galaxy. We find that even at high perigalacticons the synergistic interaction between ram pressure and tidal forces transform a dwarf into a stream, suggesting that Sextans was much more massive in the past in order survive its perigalacticon passage. In addition the large confining pressure of the hot corona allows gas that was originally at the outskirts to begin forming stars, initially forming stars of low metallicity compared to the dwarf evolved in isolation. This increase in star formation eventually allows a dwarf galaxy to form more metal rich stars compared to one in isolation, but only if the dwarf retains gas for a sufficiently long period of time.

Recent experiments revealed that the dielectric dispersion spectrum of fission yeast cells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-dispersions. The low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, while the high-frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape effect was simulated by an ellipsoidal cell model but the comparison between theory and experiment was far from being satisfactory. Prompted by the discrepancy, we proposed the use of spectral representation to analyze more realistic cell models. We adopted a shell-spheroidal model to analyze the effects of the cell membrane. It is found that the dielectric property of the cell membrane has only a minor effect on the dispersion magnitude ratio and the characteristic frequency ratio.

We simulate how dust settles in passive disks and ask how high mu can become. We settle the dust using a 1D code and test for dynamical stability using a 3D shearing box code. This scheme allows us to explore the behavior of small particles having short but non-zero stopping times in gas: 0 < t_stop << the orbital period. The streaming instability is thereby filtered out. Dust settles until shearing instabilities in the edges of the dust layer threaten to overturn the entire layer. In this state of marginal stability, mu=2.9 for a disk whose bulk (height-integrated) metallicity is solar. For a disk whose bulk metallicity is 4x solar, mu reaches 26.4. These maximum values of mu, which depend on the background radial pressure gradient, are so large that gravitational instability of small particles is viable in disks whose bulk metallicities are just a few (<4) times solar. Earlier studies assumed that dust settles until the Richardson number Ri is spatially constant.

Which of the following statements best describes the overall impact and nature of these corrections?\n\nA) The corrections primarily increase the double scattering term, accounting for about 50% of the empirical pion-deuteron scattering length.\n\nB) The main effect is an off-shell correction equivalent to 3\u03c0-exchange in the deuteron, contributing around 20% to the scattering length.\n\nC) The corrections include one-pion loop effects that close the gap between current-algebra predictions and empirical values for \u03c0N scattering, plus a smaller off-shell correction for \u03c0d scattering.\n\nD) The chiral corrections mostly cancel each other out, leaving the double scattering term largely unchanged from its uncorrected value.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately summarizes the key points from the documentation. The chiral corrections include one-pion loop effects that address the discrepancy between current-algebra predictions and empirical values for \u03c0N scattering. Additionally, there is a smaller off-shell correction for \u03c0d scattering, described as equivalent to 2\u03c0-exchange in the deuteron (not 3\u03c0 as in option B). This off-shell correction contributes at most -8%, which is significant but smaller than the main loop corrections. Option A overestimates the contribution of the corrections, while option D incorrectly suggests the corrections cancel out. Option C correctly captures the dual nature of the corrections and their relative importance."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Tree-Structured Policy based Progressive Reinforcement Learning for\n  Temporally Language Grounding in Video", "source": "Jie Wu, Guanbin Li, Si Liu, Liang Lin", "docs_id": "2001.06680", "section": ["cs.CV"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Tree-Structured Policy based Progressive Reinforcement Learning for\n  Temporally Language Grounding in Video.

The nucleus-nucleus impact parameter and collision geometry of a heavy ion collision are typically characterized by assigning a collision \"centrality\". In all present heavy ion experiments centrality is measured indirectly, by detecting the number of particles or the energy of the particles produced in the interactions, typically at high rapidity. Centrality parameters are associated to the measured detector response using the Glauber model. This approach suffers from systematic uncertainties related to the assumptions about the particle production mechanism and limitations of the Glauber model. In the collider based experiments there is a unique possibility to measure centrality parameters by registering spectator fragments remaining from the collision. This approach does not require model assumptions and relies on the fact that spectators and participants are related via the total number of nucleons in the colliding species.
