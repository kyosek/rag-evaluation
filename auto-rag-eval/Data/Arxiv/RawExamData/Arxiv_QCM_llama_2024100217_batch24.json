The Witten-Veneziano relation, or, alternatively, its generalization proposed by Shore, facilitates understanding and describing the complex of eta and eta' mesons. We present an analytic, closed-form solution to Shore's equations which gives results on the eta-eta' complex in full agreement with results previously obtained numerically. Although the Witten-Veneziano relation and Shore's equations are related, the ways they were previously used in the context of dynamical models to calculate eta and eta' properties, were rather different. However, with the analytic solution, the calculation can be formulated similarly to the approach through the Witten-Veneziano relation, and with some conceptual improvements. In the process, one strengthens the arguments in favor of a possible relation between the U_A(1) and SU_A(3) chiral symmetry breaking and restoration.

The main focus of this work is a detailed characterization and microstructural analysis of the films. Based on micro-Raman spectroscopy in combination with x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, and scanning electron microscopy, some of the observed phonon modes can be attributed to micron-sized inclusions of Cu_{2}O. In the slightly underdoped film (x ~ 0.08), both the Cu_{2}O modes and others that can be assigned to the La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} matrix show pronounced softening and narrowing upon cooling below T ~ T_c. Based on control measurements on commercial Cu_{2}O powders and on a comparison to prior Raman scattering studies of other high-temperature superconductors, we speculate that proximity effects at La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}/Cu_{2}O interfaces may be responsible for these anomalies.

Recent ALMA observations may indicate a surprising abundance of sub-Jovian planets on very wide orbits in protoplanetary discs that are only a few million years old. These planets are too young and distant to have been formed via the Core Accretion (CA) scenario, and are much less massive than the gas clumps born in the classical Gravitational Instability (GI) theory. It was recently suggested that such planets may form by the partial destruction of GI protoplanets: energy output due to the growth of a massive core may unbind all or most of the surrounding pre-collapse protoplanet. Here we present the first 3D global disc simulations that simultaneously resolve grain dynamics in the disc and within the protoplanet. We confirm that massive GI protoplanets may self-destruct at arbitrarily large separations from the host star provided that solid cores of mass around 10-20 Earth masses are able to grow inside them during their pre-collapse phase. In addition, we find that the heating force recently analysed by Masset and Velasco Romero (2017) perturbs these cores away from the centre of their gaseous protoplanets. This leads to very complicated dust dynamics in the protoplanet centre, potentially resulting in the formation of multiple cores, planetary satellites, and other debris such as planetesimals within the same protoplanet.

Prior distributions for Bayesian inference that rely on the $l_1$-norm of the parameters are of considerable interest, in part because they promote parameter fields with less regularity than Gaussian priors (e.g., discontinuities and blockiness). These $l_1$-type priors include the total variation (TV) prior and the Besov $B^s_{1,1}$ space prior, and in general yield non-Gaussian posterior distributions. Sampling from these posteriors is challenging, particularly in the inverse problem setting where the parameter space is high-dimensional and the forward problem may be nonlinear.

As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been proposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known phenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and elegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and coworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with other networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has to be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a spatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to preserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we numerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded perturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss depends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the kind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an increase of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of polarization.
