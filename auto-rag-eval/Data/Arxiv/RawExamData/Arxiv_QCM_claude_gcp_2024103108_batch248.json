Most of the automatic fire alarm systems detect the fire presence through sensors like thermal, smoke, or flame. One of the new approaches to the problem is the use of images to perform the detection. The image approach is promising since it does not need specific sensors and can be easily embedded in different devices. However, besides the high performance, the computational cost of the used deep learning methods is a challenge to their deployment in portable devices. In this work, we propose a new deep learning architecture that requires fewer floating-point operations (flops) for fire recognition. Additionally, we propose a portable approach for fire recognition and the use of modern techniques such as inverted residual block, convolutions like depth-wise, and octave, to reduce the model's computational cost. The experiments show that our model keeps high accuracy while substantially reducing the number of parameters and flops. One of our models presents 71\\% fewer parameters than FireNet, while still presenting competitive accuracy and AUROC performance. The proposed methods are evaluated on FireNet and FiSmo datasets.

We seek to minimize the expected average communication delay to service the data transmission requests, subject to an average power constraint on the mobility of the UAV. The problem is cast as a semi-Markov decision process, and it is shown that the policy exhibits a two-scale structure, which can be efficiently optimized: in the outer decision, upon starting a communication phase, and given its current radius, the UAV selects a target end radius position so as to optimally balance a trade-off between average long-term communication delay and power consumption; in the inner decision, the UAV selects its trajectory between the start radius and the selected end radius, so as to greedily minimize the delay and energy consumption to serve the current request. Numerical evaluations show that, during waiting phases, the UAV circles at some optimal radius at the most energy efficient speed, until a new request is received.

To overcome this problem, at least three remedies have been developed in the literature: stabilizing, thresholding, and trimming.

This slowdown affects the whole mixing region, and not just the vicinity of the wall. The reason is that when the chaotic mixing region extends to the wall, a separatrix connects to it.

We demonstrate that doping of ZnO is a tool to adjust the charge transport in ZnO/P3HT hybrids, using one single injecting metal (Au bottom contact) on a SiO2 dielectric. We observe an influence of the zinc oxide layer on the hole mobility in P3HT which we can modify via Al doping of ZnO. Hence, maximum hole mobility of 5e-4 cm^2/Vs in the hybrid system with 2 at.% Al doping. 5 at.% Al doping leads to a balanced mobility in the organic/inorganic hybrid system but also to a small on/off ratio due to high off-currents."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a study of hybrid field effect transistors based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and zinc oxide (ZnO), what combination of effects was observed with increasing aluminum doping levels in ZnO?\n\nA) Increased electron mobility in ZnO and improved P3HT infiltration into ZnO\nB) Decreased electron mobility in ZnO and improved P3HT infiltration into ZnO\nC) Decreased electron mobility in ZnO and reduced P3HT infiltration into ZnO\nD) Increased electron mobility in ZnO and reduced P3HT infiltration into ZnO\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation states that with increasing Al doping levels in ZnO, two main effects were observed:\n\n1. A decrease in electron mobilities by two orders of magnitude in ZnO.\n2. A morphological change in the ZnO layer that enables the infiltration of P3HT into the inorganic matrix.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states an increase in electron mobility, which contradicts the observed decrease. Option C is incorrect because while it correctly states the decrease in electron mobility, it incorrectly suggests reduced P3HT infiltration. Option D is incorrect on both counts, stating an increase in electron mobility and reduced P3HT infiltration.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to synthesize multiple pieces of information from the text and understand the relationship between doping levels and material properties in this hybrid system."}, "56": {"documentation": {"title": "A better presentation of Planck's radiation law", "source": "Jonathan M.

Introductory physics and astronomy courses commonly use Wien's displacement law to explain the colors of blackbodies, including the Sun and other stars, in terms of their temperatures. We argue here that focusing on the peak of the blackbody spectrum is misleading for three reasons. First, the Planck curve is too broad for an individual spectral color to stand out. Second, the location of the peak of the Planck curve depends on the choice of the independent variable in the plot. And third, Wien's displacement law is seldom used in actual practice to find a temperature and direct fitting to the Planck function is preferable. We discuss these flaws and argue that, at the introductory level, presentation of blackbody radiation in terms of photon statistics would be more effective pedagogically. The average energy of the emitted photons would then be presented in place of Wien's displacement law, and discussion of the Stefan-Boltzmann law would include the total number of photons emitted per second.
