The recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations have opened the field of GW astronomy, intensifying interest in GWs and other possible detectors sensitive in different frequency ranges. Although strong GW producing events are rare and currently unpredictable, GWs can in principle be simulated in analogue systems at will in the lab. Simulation of GWs in a manifestly quantum system would allow for the study of the interaction of quantum phenomena with GWs. Such predicted interaction is exploited in a recently proposed Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) based GW detector. In this paper, we show how to manipulate a BEC to mimic the effect of a passing GW. By simultaneously varying the external potential applied to the BEC, and an external magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance, we show that the resulting change in speed of sound can directly reproduce a GW metric. We also show how to simulate a metric used in the recently proposed BEC based GW detector, to provide an environment for testing the proposed metrology scheme of the detector.

Stochastic simulation has been widely used to analyze the performance of complex stochastic systems and facilitate decision making in those systems.

The input model is usually estimated using a finite amount of data, which introduces the so-called input model uncertainty to the simulation output. How to quantify input uncertainty has been studied extensively, and many methods have been proposed for the batch data setting, i.e., when all the data are available at once. However, methods for \"streaming data\" arriving sequentially in time are still in demand, despite that streaming data have become increasingly prevalent in modern applications. To fill this gap, we propose a two-layer importance sampling framework that incorporates streaming data for online input uncertainty quantification.

This reveals that the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for $\\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result.

Using the extended MCT and a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we calculate the effective temperature $T_{eff}$ of the active fluid.
