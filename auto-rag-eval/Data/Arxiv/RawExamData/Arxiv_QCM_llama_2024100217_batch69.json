In this work, we are interested in the question - what content in a scene causes it to be funny? As a first step towards understanding visual humor, we analyze the humor manifested in abstract scenes and design computational models for them. We collect two datasets of abstract scenes that facilitate the study of humor at both the scene-level and the object-level. We analyze the funny scenes and explore the different types of humor depicted in them via human studies.

We have investigated the impact of niche specificity on tumour evolution using an individual based model of breast tumour growth, in which the carrying capacity of each cell consists of two components: an intrinsic, subclone-specific part and a contribution from all neighbouring cells.

The carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of 519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020, indicating a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. If the observed trends continue, it is expected that over half of China's power demand will be met by low-carbon sources by 2030, which would significantly reduce China's carbon footprint and help achieve its carbon neutrality target."}, "22": {"documentation": {"title": "P-hacking in clinical trials and how incentives shape the distribution\n  of results across phases", "source": "J\\'er\\^ome Adda, Christian Decker, Marco Ottaviani", "docs_id": "1907.00185", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "P-hacking in clinical trials and how incentives shape the distribution\n  of results across phases.

When these components have multiple outputs, we intuitively assume that the outputs are causally dependent on the inputs but are themselves independent of each other given the state of their shared input. However, this intuition can be violated for components with probabilistic logic, as these typically cannot be decomposed into separate logic gates with one output each.

Modern algorithms for de novo prediction of protein structures typically output multiple full-length models (decoys) rather than a single solution. Subsequent clustering of such decoys is used both to gauge the success of the modelling and to decide on the most native-like conformation. At the same time, partial protein models are sufficient for some applications such as crystallographic phasing by molecular replacement (MR) in particular, provided these models represent a certain part of the target structure with reasonable accuracy. Here we propose a novel clustering algorithm that natively operates in the space of partial models through an approach known as granular clustering (GC). The algorithm is based on growing local similarities found in a pool of initial decoys. We demonstrate that the resulting clusters of partial models provide a substantially more accurate structural detail on the target protein than those obtained upon a global alignment of decoys. As the result, the partial models output by our GC algorithm are also much more effective towards the MR procedure, compared to the models produced by existing software.

A major performance and complexity limitation in broadband communications is the long channel delay spread which results in a highly-frequency-selective channel frequency response. Channel shortening equalizers (CSEs) are used to ensure that the cascade of a long channel impulse response (CIR) and the CSE is approximately equivalent to a target impulse response (TIR) with much shorter delay spread.

Assume that the target impulse response (TIR) has a delay spread of 10 samples and the channel impulse response (CIR) has a delay spread of 50 samples. Choose a suitable sparsifying dictionary for the CSE and explain its effectiveness in reducing the coherence of the CIR.\n\n**A)** Use the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as the sparsifying dictionary for the CSE, as it is known for its ability to compress signals with sparse representations. However, this choice may not be effective in reducing the coherence of the CIR, as the DCT is not optimized for this purpose.\n\n**B)** Select the Wavelet Transform (WT) as the sparsifying dictionary for the CSE, as it is capable of capturing both time and frequency localizations in the signal. This choice is effective in reducing the coherence of the CIR, but may not be suitable for all types of channels.\n\n**C)** Choose the Fourier Transform (FT) as the sparsifying dictionary for the CSE, as it is a natural choice for frequency-localized signals.
