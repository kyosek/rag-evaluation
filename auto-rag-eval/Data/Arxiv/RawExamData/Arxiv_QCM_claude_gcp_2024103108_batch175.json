Most programs based on the normal mode model are discretized using the finite difference method (FDM). In this paper, a Legendre collocation method (LCM) based on domain decomposition is proposed to solve this problem. A set of collocation points cannot penetrate multiple layers of media, thus necessitating domain decomposition and the use of multiple sets of collocation points. The solution process of this method proceeds entirely in physical space, requiring that the original differential equation be strictly established at the collocation points; thus, a dense matrix eigenvalue system is formed, from which the solution for the horizontal wavenumbers and modes can be directly obtained. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of this method.

Many models of market dynamics make use of the idea of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for economic markets the system converges to a very unequal \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the wide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here we present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation but also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of interacting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated by the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is changed at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of this poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory tool for wealth redistribution.

This approach allows for a 20.48 Gbps data rate over a single fiber while maintaining compatibility with the lpGBT data interface and transmission protocol. The integration of these components on a single die eliminates the need for CDRs in the PAM4 encoder and enables more efficient use of FPGA input bandwidth at the receiving end.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the PLL is not new; it's taken from the existing lpGBT design.

In many collective decision making situations, agents vote to choose an alternative that best represents the preferences of the group.

The projection factor (p-factor) is an essential component of the classical Baade-Wesselink (BW) technique, that is commonly used to determine the distances to pulsating stars. It is a multiplicative parameter used to convert radial velocities into pulsational velocities. As the BW distances are linearly proportional to the p-factor, its accurate calibration for Cepheids is of critical importance for the reliability of their distance scale. We focus on the observational determination of the p-factor of the long-period Cepheid RS Pup (P = 41.5 days). This star is particularly important as this is one of the brightest Cepheids in the Galaxy and an analog of the Cepheids used to determine extragalactic distances. An accurate distance of 1910 +/- 80 pc (+/- 4.2%) has recently been determined for RS Pup using the light echoes propagating in its circumstellar nebula. We combine this distance with new VLTI/PIONIER interferometric angular diameters, photometry and radial velocities to derive the p-factor of RS Pup using the code Spectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars (SPIPS). We obtain p = 1.250 +/- 0.064 (+/-5.1%), defined for cross-correlation radial velocities. Together with measurements from the literature, the p-factor of RS Pup confirms the good agreement of a constant p = 1.293 +/- 0.039 (+/-3.0%) model with the observations.
