Investigation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is an essential way to diagnose heart disease since the ECG process is noninvasive and easy to use. This work presents a supraventricular arrhythmia prediction model consisting of a few stages, including filtering of noise, a unique collection of ECG characteristics, and automated learning classifying model to classify distinct types, depending on their severity. We de-trend and de-noise a signal to reduce noise to better determine functionality before extractions are performed. After that, we present one R-peak detection method and Q-S detection method as a part of necessary feature extraction. Next parameters are computed that correspond to these features. Using these characteristics, we have developed a classification model based on machine learning that can successfully categorize different types of supraventricular tachycardia. Our findings suggest that decision-tree-based models are the most efficient machine learning models for supraventricular tachycardia arrhythmia. Among all the machine learning models, this model most efficiently lowers the crucial signal misclassification of supraventricular tachycardia.

Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach for scaling up reinforcement learning (RL) techniques.

Searching in a large goal space poses difficulties for both high-level subgoal generation and low-level policy learning.

An electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) is a detector that can determine the arrival direction and energy of incident sub-MeV/MeV gamma-ray events on an event-by-event basis. It is a hybrid detector consisting of a gaseous time projection chamber (TPC), that is the Compton-scattering target and the tracker of recoil electrons, and a position-sensitive scintillation camera that absorbs of the scattered gamma rays, to measure gamma rays in the environment from contaminated soil. To measure of environmental gamma rays from soil contaminated with radioactive cesium (Cs), we developed a portable battery-powered ETCC system with a compact readout circuit and data-acquisition system for the SMILE-II experiment. We checked the gamma-ray imaging ability and ETCC performance in the laboratory by using several gamma-ray point sources.
