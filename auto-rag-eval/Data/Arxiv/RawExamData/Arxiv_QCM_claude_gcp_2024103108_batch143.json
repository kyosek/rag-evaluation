A new method of distortion mitigation for multitarget interferometric angular velocity estimation in millimeter-wave radar is presented. In general, when multiple targets are present, the response of a correlation interferometer is corrupted by intermodulation distortion, making it difficult to estimate individual target angular velocities. We present a distortion mitigation method that works by decomposing the responses at each antenna element into the responses from the individual targets. Data association is performed to match individual target responses at each antenna such that cross-correlation is performed only between associated targets. Thus, the intermodulation distortion (cross-terms) from correlating unlike targets are eliminated, and the result is a frequency response whose individual frequencies are proportional to the angular velocities of the targets.

A way around this problem has been proposed recently, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded Circulant matrices. Although several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods.

Pulsars are the fast rotating neutron stars with strong magnetic field, that emit over a wide frequency range.

We propose a new approach to solving this problem for a subset of pulsars with a high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum from the Pushchino catalogue (the \"Pushchino\" sample). We provide a theoretical explanation of the observed dependence of the high-frequency cutoff from the pulsar period. The dependence of the cutoff position from the magnetic field is predicted. This explanation is based on a new mechanism for electron radio emission in pulsars. Namely, radiation occurs in the inner (polar) gap, when electrons are accelerated in the electric field that is increasing from zero level at the star surface. In this case acceleration of electrons passes through a maximum and goes to zero when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light.
