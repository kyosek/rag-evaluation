We study the synchronization of a coupled map lattice consisting of a one-dimensional chain of logistic maps. We consider global coupling with a time-delay that takes into account the finite velocity of propagation of interactions. We recently showed that clustering occurs for weak coupling, while for strong coupling the array synchronizes into a global state where each element sees all other elements in its current, present state [Physica A {\\bf 325} (2003) 186, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 67} (2003) 056219]. In this paper we study the effects of in-homogeneities, both in the individual maps, which are non-identical maps evolving in period-2 orbits, and in the connection links, which have non-uniform strengths. We find that the global synchronization regime occurring for strong coupling is robust to heterogeneities: for strong enough average coupling the inhomogeneous array still synchronizes in a global state in which each element sees the other elements in positions close to its current state. However, the clustering behaviour occurring for small coupling is sensitive to inhomogeneities and differs from that occurring in the homogeneous array."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a study of globally coupled nonidentical maps with inhomogeneous delayed interactions, what phenomenon is observed for strong coupling in the presence of heterogeneities?\n\nA) The array desynchronizes completely due to the inhomogeneities\nB) The array synchronizes into a global state where each element sees all other elements in random states\nC) The array maintains its clustering behavior as seen in weak coupling scenarios\nD) The array synchronizes into a global state where each element sees other elements in positions close to its current state\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex behavior of coupled nonidentical maps with inhomogeneous delayed interactions.

Many dynamic applications are built upon large network infrastructures, such as social networks, communication networks, biological networks and the Web. Such applications create data that can be naturally modeled as graph streams, in which edges of the underlying graph are received and updated sequentially in a form of a stream. It is often necessary and important to summarize the behavior of graph streams in order to enable effective query processing. However, the sheer size and dynamic nature of graph streams present an enormous challenge to existing graph management techniques. In this paper, we propose a new graph sketch method, gSketch, which combines well studied synopses for traditional data streams with a sketch partitioning technique, to estimate and optimize the responses to basic queries on graph streams. We consider two different scenarios for query estimation: (1) A graph stream sample is available; (2) Both a graph stream sample and a query workload sample are available. Algorithms for different scenarios are designed respectively by partitioning a global sketch to a group of localized sketches in order to optimize the query estimation accuracy.

With the imminent slowing down of DRAM scaling, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth, and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.

Using a stochastic nonlinear phase oscillator model, we study the effect of event-triggered feedback on the statistics of interevent intervals. Events are associated with the entering of a new cycle. The feedback is modeled by an instantaneous increase (positive feedback) or decrease (negative feedback) of the oscillators frequency, whenever an event occurs followed by an exponential decay on a slow timescale. In contrast to previous works, we also consider positive feedback that leads to various novel effects. For instance, besides the known excitable and oscillatory regime, that are separated by a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation, positive feedback can lead to bistable dynamics and a change of the system's excitability. The feedback has also a strong effect on noise-induced phenomena like coherence resonance or anti-coherence resonance. Both positive and negative feedback can lead to more regular output for particular noise strengths. Finally, we investigate serial correlation in the sequence of interevent intervals that occur due to the additional slow dynamics. We derive approximations for the serial correlation coefficient and show that positive feedback results in extended positive interval correlations whereas negative feedback yields short-ranging negative correlations.

One hypothesis is that swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the structure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual constraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions between predators and prey."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the comprehensive evolutionary impact of predator confusion on prey-predator dynamics, as suggested by the study?\n\nA) Predator confusion solely leads to the evolution of swarming behavior in prey species.\n\nB) Predator confusion results in changes to prey behavior and predator visual systems, but does not affect ecological interactions.\n\nC) Predator confusion drives the evolution of swarming in prey, influences predator visual field structure, and alters the functional response curve of predator consumption rates.\n\nD) Predator confusion exclusively affects the sensory mechanisms of predators, leading to frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the study's findings. The research demonstrates that predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behavior in prey, which is the primary effect. Additionally, it shows that this evolutionary change in prey behavior can exert pressure on predators, favoring the development of frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems. Lastly, the study provides evidence that the evolution of swarming in response to predator confusion changes the shape of the functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey density increases. This encompasses the full range of evolutionary effects on prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and ecological interactions between predators and prey.\n\nOption A is incomplete as it only mentions the effect on prey swarming behavior.

This is particularly important for AMPA receptors, which need high accuracy in sensing glutamate to initiate membrane depolarization. The NMDA receptor, while also benefiting from increased accuracy due to receptor diffusion, is described as overall noisier and functions more as a coincidence detector in a second stage of neurotransmission.

Modeling subtractive color mixture (e.g., the way that paints mix) is difficult when working with colors described only by three-dimensional color space values, such as RGB.

Methods do exist for accurately modeling subtractive mixture, such as the Kubelka-Munk equations, but require extensive spectrophotometric measurements of the mixed components, making them unsuitable for many computer graphics applications. This paper presents a strategy for modeling subtractive color mixture given only the RGB information of the colors being mixed, written for a general audience. The RGB colors are first transformed to generic, representative spectral distributions, and then this spectral information is used to perform the subtractive mixture, using the weighted arithmetic-geometric mean.

This hybrid approach is at the core of PolyScientist's innovation. It leverages expert-coded microkernels for the innermost loops while using advanced polyhedral technology to automatically tune the outer loops for performance. This combines the benefits of both library development and automatic compilation approaches.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the polyhedral technology is specifically used for optimizing the outer loops, not both inner and outer loops. The inner loops utilize expert-coded microkernels.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the approach is not exclusively relying on automatic compilation. In fact, it's a hybrid approach that also incorporates expert-coded microkernels.\n\nOption D is incorrect because PolyScientist is not developing a new library from scratch.
