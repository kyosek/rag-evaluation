A volatility surface is an important tool for pricing and hedging derivatives. The surface shows the volatility that is implied by the market price of an option on an asset as a function of the option's strike price and maturity. Often, market data is incomplete and it is necessary to estimate missing points on partially observed surfaces. In this paper, we show how variational autoencoders can be used for this task. The first step is to derive latent variables that can be used to construct synthetic volatility surfaces that are indistinguishable from those observed historically. The second step is to determine the synthetic surface generated by our latent variables that fits available data as closely as possible. As a dividend of our first step, the synthetic surfaces produced can also be used in stress testing, in market simulators for developing quantitative investment strategies, and for the valuation of exotic options. We illustrate our procedure and demonstrate its power using foreign exchange market data."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A quantitative analyst is using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to estimate missing points on a partially observed volatility surface.

One of the key objectives in healthcare is the early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures.

Many neurons display bistability - coexistence of two firing modes such as bursting and tonic spiking or tonic spiking and silence. Bistability has been proposed to endow neurons with richer forms of information processing in general and to be involved in short-term memory in particular by allowing a brief signal to elicit long-lasting changes in firing. In this paper, we focus on bistability that allows for a choice between tonic spiking and depolarization block in a wide range of the depolarization levels. We consider the spike-producing currents in two neurons, models of which differ by the parameter values. Our dopaminergic neuron model displays bistability in a wide range of applied currents at the depolarization block. The Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon shows no bistability. We varied parameter values for the model to analyze transitions between the two parameter sets. We show that bistability primarily characterizes the inactivation of the Na+ current.

As a main result, we demonstrate that both the spin and heat conductivity are enhanced in the gapless phase and most notably at low frequencies. In the case of the thermal conductivity, however, the field-induced increase seen in the bare transport coefficients is suppressed by magnetothermal effects, caused by the coupling of the heat and spin current in finite magnetic fields.

The documentation states that the model undergoes two field-induced quantum phase transitions at zero temperature, moving from a dimerized phase to a Luttinger phase, and finally to a fully polarized phase. Both spin and heat conductivities are enhanced in the gapless phase, especially at low frequencies. However, for thermal conductivity, the field-induced increase observed in the bare transport coefficients is suppressed by magnetothermal effects due to the coupling of heat and spin current in finite magnetic fields.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions a partially polarized phase instead of a fully polarized phase. Option B is wrong as it states that heat conductivity remains constant, which contradicts the information provided. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that magnetothermal effects enhance thermal conductivity, whereas the document states that these effects actually suppress the field-induced increase in thermal conductivity."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "VQCPC-GAN: Variable-Length Adversarial Audio Synthesis Using\n  Vector-Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding", "source": "Javier Nistal, Cyran Aouameur, Stefan Lattner, and Ga\\\"el Richard", "docs_id": "2105.01531", "section": ["cs.SD", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "eess.AS"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "VQCPC-GAN: Variable-Length Adversarial Audio Synthesis Using\n  Vector-Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding.

However, in the (musical) audio domain, it is often desired to generate output of variable duration. This paper presents VQCPC-GAN, an adversarial framework for synthesizing variable-length audio by exploiting Vector-Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding (VQCPC). A sequence of VQCPC tokens extracted from real audio data serves as conditional input to a GAN architecture, providing step-wise time-dependent features of the generated content. The input noise z (characteristic in adversarial architectures) remains fixed over time, ensuring temporal consistency of global features. We evaluate the proposed model by comparing a diverse set of metrics against various strong baselines.

The story of conflict and cooperation has started millions of years ago, and now it is everywhere: In biology, computer science, economics, political science, and psychology. Examples include wars, airline alliances, trade, oligopolistic cartels, the evolution of species and genes, and team sports. However, neither cooperative games nor non-cooperative games -- in which \"each player acts independently without collaboration with any of the others\" (Nash, 1951) -- fully capture the competition between and across individuals and groups, and the strategic partnerships that give rise to such groups. Thus, one needs to extend the non-cooperative framework to study strategic games like scientific publication, which is a rather competitive game, yet (strategic) collaboration is widespread. In this paper, I propose, to the best of my knowledge, the first solution to the long-standing open problem of strategic cooperation first identified by von Neumann (1928).

Precise gap structure in LiFeAs (Tc = 18 K) given by ARPES studies offers us significant information to understand the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors. The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs gap structure would be that \"the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z point\". This result had been naturally explained in terms of the orbital-fluctuation scenario (T. Saito et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 035104 (2014)), whereas an opposite result is obtained by the spin-fluctuation scenario. In this paper, we study the gap structure in LiFeAs by taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, motivated by the recent ARPES studies that revealed the significant SOI-induced modification of the Fermi surface topology. For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models with finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES groups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with finite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin fluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main characteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in the presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy) orbitals.

The authors constructed tight-binding models incorporating SOI and extended the gap equation for multiorbital systems with finite SOI. Their calculations showed that the main characteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only when strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy) orbitals are present, and this is consistent with the orbital-fluctuation pairing mechanism.
