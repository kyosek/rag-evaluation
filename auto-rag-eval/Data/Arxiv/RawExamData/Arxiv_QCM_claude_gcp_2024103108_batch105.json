The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass type is realized in the superconducting system involved.

For time-critical tasks such as autonomous driving and virtual reality, real-time processing is fundamental.

The discovery of disease subtypes is an essential step for developing precision medicine, and disease subtyping via omics data has become a popular approach.

With the rich clinical data along with the omics data in modern epidemiology cohorts, it is urgent to develop an outcome-guided clustering algorithm to fully integrate the phenotypic data with the high-dimensional omics data. Hence, we extended a sparse K-means method to an outcome-guided sparse K-means (GuidedSparseKmeans) method, which incorporated a phenotypic variable from the clinical dataset to guide gene selections from the high-dimensional omics data. We demonstrated the superior performance of the GuidedSparseKmeans by comparing with existing clustering methods in simulations and applications of high-dimensional transcriptomic data of breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

We explicitly single out the contribution of the fifth force to nonrelativistic gravitational potentials. In the case of models with toroidal compactification, we demonstrate how tension (with and without effects of nonlinearity) of the gravitating source can fix the total volume of the internal space, resulting in the vanishing fifth force and consequently in agreement with the observations. It takes place for latent solitons, black strings and black branes. We also demonstrate a particular example where non-vanishing variations of the internal space volume do not contradict the gravitational experiments.

The documentation states that \"variation of the total volume of the internal spaces generates the fifth force\" and this is \"the main reason of the problem.\" It also mentions that this occurs for all considered models, but some models can still meet classical gravitational tests. For instance, in models with toroidal compactification, the tension of the gravitating source can fix the total volume of the internal space, resulting in a vanishing fifth force and agreement with observations. Additionally, for spherical compactification, the fifth force can be replaced by Yukawa interaction when the internal space is stabilized, which can lead to negligible effects and satisfaction of gravitational tests.

The advent of the era of Big Data has allowed many researchers to dig into various socio-technical systems, including social media platforms.

Their symmetries are obtained by the Jordan-Schwinger representations in the family of the Cayley-Klein orthogonal algebras using the creation and annihilation operators of the dynamical $sl_{-1}(2)$ algebra of the one-dimensional Dunkl oscillator. The resulting algebra is a deformation of $so_{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}(4)$ with reflections, which is known as the Jordan-Schwinger-Dunkl algebra $jsd_{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}(4)$. Hence, this model is shown to be maximally superintegrable. On the other hand, the superintegrability of the three-dimensional Dunkl oscillator model is studied from the factorization approach viewpoint. The spectrum of this system is derived through the separation of variables in geodesic polar coordinates, and the resulting eigenfunctions are algebraically given in terms of Jacobi polynomials."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the symmetry algebra of the three-dimensional Dunkl oscillator model in spaces of constant curvature, as discussed in the paper?\n\nA) It is a deformation of so_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4) without reflections, known as the Jordan-Schwinger algebra js_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4).\n\nB) It is an undeformed so_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4) algebra with reflections, called the Dunkl-Schwinger algebra ds_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4).\n\nC) It is a deformation of so_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4) with reflections, known as the Jordan-Schwinger-Dunkl algebra jsd_\u03ba1\u03ba2(4).\n\nD) It is an extension of su(3) algebra with reflections, termed the Dunkl-oscillator algebra do_\u03ba1\u03ba2(3).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The convergence performance of distributed optimization algorithms is of significant importance to solve optimal power flow (OPF) in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we aim to provide some insights on how to partition a power system to achieve a high convergence rate of distributed algorithms for the solution of an OPF problem. We analyzed several features of the power network to find a set of suitable partitions with the aim of convergence performance improvement. We model the grid as a graph and decompose it based on the edge betweenness graph clustering. This technique provides several partitions. To find an effective partitioning, we merge the partitions obtained by clustering technique and analyze them based on characteristics of tie-lines connecting neighboring partitions. The main goal is to find the best set of partitions with respect to the convergence speed. We deploy analytical target cascading (ATC) method to distributedly solve optimization subproblems.

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Experimental evidences of phenotypic differentiation are given by the presence of bimodal distributions of gene expression levels, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate.

The study finds that the presence of extrinsic noise, introduced as fluctuations in miRNA transcription rate, favors the occurrence of bimodal target distributions. This bimodality can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with only intrinsic noise. Additionally, the study notes that bimodality can occur with lower miRNA-target interaction strength when extrinsic noise is present. This suggests that the combination of threshold-inducing interactions (characteristic of miRNA-mediated regulation) and extrinsic noise provides a robust mechanism for achieving bimodal populations without requiring fine-tuning of parameters.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study suggests that extrinsic noise facilitates, rather than inhibits, bimodal gene expression. Answer B is wrong because the study explicitly states that extrinsic noise has a significant effect compared to intrinsic noise alone. Answer D is incorrect because the study does not suggest that extrinsic noise eliminates the threshold effect; rather, it works in conjunction with the threshold-inducing nature of miRNA-target interactions to promote bimodality."}, "42": {"documentation": {"title": "Invitation in Crowdsourcing Contests", "source": "Qi Shi, Dong Hao", "docs_id": "2112.02884", "section": ["cs.AI", "cs.GT", "econ.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Invitation in Crowdsourcing Contests.

The MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located at Fermilab is a neutrino experiment dedicated to the study of short-baseline oscillations, the measurements of neutrino cross sections in liquid argon, and to the research and development of this novel detector technology. Accurate and precise measurements of calorimetry are essential to the event reconstruction and are achieved by leveraging the TPC to measure deposited energy per unit length along the particle trajectory, with mm resolution. We describe the non-uniform calorimetric reconstruction performance in the detector, showing dependence on the angle of the particle trajectory. Such non-uniform reconstruction directly affects the performance of the particle identification algorithms which infer particle type from calorimetric measurements. This work presents a new particle identification method which accounts for and effectively addresses such non-uniformity. The newly developed method shows improved performance compared to previous algorithms, illustrated by a 94% proton selection efficiency and a 10% muon mis-identification rate, with a fairly loose selection of tracks performed on beam data.
