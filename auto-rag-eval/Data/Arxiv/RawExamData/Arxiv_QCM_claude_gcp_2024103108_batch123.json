In the current era of precision quantum many-body physics, one of the most scrutinized systems is the unitary limit of the nonrelativistic spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas, due to its simplicity and relevance for atomic, condensed matter, and nuclear physics. The thermodynamics of this strongly correlated system is determined by universal functions which, at high temperature, are governed by universal virial coefficients $b_n$ that capture the effects of the $n$-body system on the many-body dynamics. Currently, $b_2$ and $b_3$ are well understood, but the situation is less clear for $b_4$, and no predictions have been made for $b_5$.

The Fokker--Planck Equation can be used in a partially-coherent imaging context to model the evolution of the intensity of a paraxial x-ray wave field with propagation.

The x-ray Fokker--Planck equation can simultaneously account for both propagation-based phase contrast, and the diffusive effects of sample-induced small-angle x-ray scattering, when forming an x-ray image of a thin sample. Two derivations are given for the Fokker--Planck equation associated with x-ray imaging, together with a Kramers--Moyal generalisation thereof. Both equations are underpinned by the concept of unresolved speckle due to unresolved sample micro-structure. These equations may be applied to the forward problem of modelling image formation in the presence of both coherent and diffusive energy transport. They may also be used to formulate associated inverse problems of retrieving the phase shifts due to a sample placed in an x-ray beam, together with the diffusive properties of the sample.

Regulatory requirements dictate that financial institutions must calculate risk capital (funds that must be retained to cover future losses) at least annually. Procedures for doing this have been well-established for many years, but recent developments in the treatment of conduct risk (the risk of loss due to the relationship between a financial institution and its customers) have cast doubt on 'standard' procedures. Regulations require that operational risk losses should be aggregated by originating event. The effect is that a large number of small and medium-sized losses are aggregated into a small number of very large losses, such that a risk capital calculation produces a hugely inflated result. To solve this problem, a novel distribution based on a one-parameter probability density with an exponential of a fourth power is proposed, where the parameter is to be estimated. Symbolic computation is used to derive the necessary analytical expressions with which to formulate the problem, and is followed by numeric calculations in R. Goodness-of-fit and parameter estimation are both determined by using a novel method developed specifically for use with probability distribution functions. The results compare favourably with an existing model that used a LogGamma Mixture density, for which it was necessary to limit the frequency and severity of the losses. No such limits were needed using the proposed exponential density."}, "answer": "Question: A financial institution is calculating its risk capital for conduct risk using the novel distribution model described in the Arxiv documentation.
