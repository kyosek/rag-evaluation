Synaptic plasticity is vital for learning and memory in the brain. It consists of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Spike frequency is one of the major components of synaptic plasticity in the brain, a noisy environment. Recently, we mathematically analysed the frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity (FDP) in vivo and found that LTP is more likely to occur with an increase in the frequency of background synaptic activity. Previous studies suggest fluctuation in the amplitude of background synaptic activity. However, little is understood about the relationship between synaptic plasticity and the fluctuation in the background synaptic activity. To address this issue, we performed numerical simulations of a calcium-based synapse model. Then, we found attenuation of the tendency to become LTD due to an increase in the fluctuation of background synaptic activity, leading to an enhancement of synaptic weight. Our result suggests that the fluctuation affect synaptic plasticity in the brain."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between background synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity, as suggested by the research findings?\n\nA) An increase in the frequency of background synaptic activity is more likely to result in long-term depression (LTD).\n\nB) Fluctuations in the amplitude of background synaptic activity have no significant impact on synaptic plasticity.\n\nC) An increase in the fluctuation of background synaptic activity tends to attenuate long-term depression (LTD) and enhance synaptic weight.\n\nD) Spike frequency is the sole determinant of synaptic plasticity in the brain's noisy environment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The economic downturn and the air travel crisis triggered by the recent coronavirus pandemic pose a substantial threat to the new consumer class of many emerging economies.

We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies' income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet.

Existing research argues that countries increase their production basket by adding products which require similar capabilities to those they already produce, a process referred to as path dependency. Green economic growth is a global movement that seeks to achieve economic expansion while at the same time mitigating environmental risks. We postulate that countries engaging in green economic growth are motivated to invest strategically to develop new capabilities that will help them transition to a green economy. As a result, they could potentially increase their production baskets not only by a path dependent process but also by the non path dependent process we term, high investment structural jumps. The main objective of this research is to determine whether countries increase their green production basket mainly by a process of path dependency, or alternatively, by a process of structural jumps. We analyze data from 65 countries and over a period from years 2007 to 2017. We focus on China as our main case study. The results of this research show that countries not only increase their green production baskets based on their available capabilities, following path dependency, but also expand to products that path dependency does not predict by investing in innovating and developing new environmental related technologies."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the findings of the research on green economic growth and product diversification?\n\nA) Countries exclusively expand their green production baskets through path dependency, relying solely on existing capabilities.\n\nB) Structural jumps are the primary mechanism by which countries increase their green production baskets, completely bypassing path dependency.\n\nC) Green economic growth occurs through a balanced combination of path dependency and structural jumps, with path dependency being slightly more prevalent.\n\nD) Countries increase their green production baskets through both path dependency and structural jumps, with structural jumps allowing expansion into products that path dependency alone cannot predict.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The research findings indicate that countries engage in both path-dependent processes and non-path-dependent \"structural jumps\" when expanding their green production baskets. Path dependency involves adding products that require similar capabilities to those already possessed, while structural jumps represent strategic investments in new capabilities to transition to a green economy. The study specifically notes that countries expand to products that path dependency does not predict by investing in innovating and developing new environmental-related technologies.

Excitons in semiconductors are usually non interacting and behave like an ideal gas, but may condense to a strongly correlated liquid like state, i.e. electron hole liquid (EHL), at high density and appropriate temperature. EHL is a macroscopic quantum state with exotic properties and represents the ultimate attainable charge excitation density in steady states. It bears great promise for a variety of fields such as ultrahigh power photonics and quantum science and technology. However, the condensation of gas like excitons to EHL has often been restricted to cryogenic temperatures, which significantly limits the prospect of EHL for use in practical applications. Herein we demonstrate the formation of EHL at room temperature in monolayer MoS2 by taking advantage of the monolayer's extraordinarily strong exciton binding energy.

This article discusses the relationship between emergence and reductionism from the perspective of a condensed matter physicist. Reductionism and emergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet we rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often regarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from current research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show that the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a powerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the cosmos."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the relationship between emergence and reductionism in physics, which of the following statements best reflects the author's perspective?\n\nA) Emergence and reductionism are fundamentally conflicting worldviews that cannot coexist in scientific practice.\n\nB) Reductionism is superior to emergence, as it provides a more fundamental understanding of physical phenomena.\n\nC) Emergence is an encrypted consequence of reductionism, often leading to deeper insights into reductionist physics.\n\nD) Francis Bacon's vision of science primarily focused on emergence rather than reductionism.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Close miking represents a widely employed practice of placing a microphone very near to the sound source in order to capture more direct sound and minimize any pickup of ambient sound, including other, concurrently active sources.

But can this empirical knowledge and close miking practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular, we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component.
