We would like to test if this positional effect is mainly due to the secondary structure of the mRNA at the target site.

The key advantage is that it allows for the automated verification of synthetic gene networks in silico (via computer simulation) based on high-level functional specifications.\n\nThis approach doesn't eliminate the need for experimental testing entirely (ruling out option A), as the document states that the procedure selects designs \"to be implemented and tested further experimentally.\" It also doesn't claim to physically construct gene networks (ruling out B) or generate new genetic sequences (ruling out C).\n\nInstead, the primary advantage is that it provides a way to efficiently filter through many potential device designs and select those that satisfy the specifications for further experimental testing.
