The functionality of soft interfaces is crucial to many applications in biology and surface science. Recent studies have used liquid drops to probe the surface mechanics of elastomeric networks. Experiments suggest an intricate surface elasticity, also known as the Shuttleworth effect, where surface tension is not constant but depends on substrate deformation. However, interpretations have remained controversial due to singular elastic deformations, induced exactly at the point where the droplet pulls the network. Here we reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic substrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy. First, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive finite element simulations. This confirms the universal validity, also at large elastic deformations, of the previously disputed Neumann's law for the contact angles. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that describe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement with numerics, and show that the stretch at the contact line, as previously measured experimentally, consistently points to a strong Shuttleworth effect.

The documentation describes an anomalous behavior in the profile log likelihood for the model with k(k+1)/2 covariance parameters. Specifically, the Fisher information for the autocorrelation parameter \u03b2 increases to a maximum when the number of series k equals half the number of time points n (i.e., k = n/2), and then decreases to zero for k \u2265 n. \n\nThis behavior is considered unusual because in typical parametric statistical models, one expects the Fisher information to increase monotonically with additional data. The fact that it decreases after reaching a maximum at k = n/2 suggests a paradoxical loss of information as more parallel series are added beyond this point.\n\nThis phenomenon implies that the model's ability to estimate the autocorrelation parameter \u03b2 doesn't consistently improve with more data series, contrary to conventional expectations. It highlights the complex interplay between the number of series and the number of time points in this particular model, and suggests that there may be an optimal number of series to consider for parameter estimation."}, "34": {"documentation": {"title": "Approximate Core Allocations for Multiple Partners Matching Games", "source": "Han Xiao, Tianhang Lu, Qizhi Fang", "docs_id": "2107.01442", "section": ["cs.GT", "econ.TH"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Approximate Core Allocations for Multiple Partners Matching Games. The matching game is a cooperative game where the value of every coalition is the maximum revenue of players in the coalition can make by forming pairwise disjoint partners. The multiple partners matching game generalizes the matching game by allowing each player to have more than one possibly repeated partner. In this paper, we study profit-sharing in multiple partners matching games. A central concept for profit-sharing is the core which consists of all possible ways of distributing the profit among individual players such that the grand coalition remains intact. The core of multiple partners matching games may be empty [Deng et al., Algorithmic aspects of the core of combinatorial optimization games, Math. Oper. Res., 1999.]; even when the core is non-empty, the core membership problem is intractable in general [Biro et al., The stable fixtures problem with payments, Games Econ. Behav., 2018]. Thus we study approximate core allocations upon which a coalition may be paid less than the profit it makes by seceding from the grand coalition. We provide an LP-based mechanism guaranteeing that no coalition is paid less than $2/3$ times the profit it makes on its own.

In this work we propose a deep adaptive sampling (DAS) method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), where deep neural networks are utilized to approximate the solutions of PDEs and deep generative models are employed to generate new collocation points that refine the training set. The overall procedure of DAS consists of two components: solving the PDEs by minimizing the residual loss on the collocation points in the training set and generating a new training set to further improve the accuracy of current approximate solution. In particular, we treat the residual as a probability density function and approximate it with a deep generative model, called KRnet. The new samples from KRnet are consistent with the distribution induced by the residual, i.e., more samples are located in the region of large residual and less samples are located in the region of small residual. Analogous to classical adaptive methods such as the adaptive finite element, KRnet acts as an error indicator that guides the refinement of the training set.

According to the documentation, KRnet is described as a deep generative model that is used to approximate the residual as a probability density function. It generates new samples that are consistent with the distribution induced by the residual, with more samples located in regions of large residual and fewer in regions of small residual. KRnet acts as an error indicator that guides the refinement of the training set, analogous to classical adaptive methods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because KRnet is not directly used to solve PDEs by minimizing residual loss. This is done by the deep neural networks that approximate the solutions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while deep neural networks are used to approximate PDE solutions in the DAS method, KRnet specifically is a generative model for sampling, not for approximating solutions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because KRnet does not generate uniformly distributed collocation points.

Underground physics experiments such as dark matter direct detection need to keep control of the background contribution.

One of the largest remaining background sources is the radon emanated from the rocks enclosing the research facility. The radon particles could be deposited inside the detectors when they are opened to perform the maintenance operations. Therefore, forecasting the radon levels is a crucial task in an attempt to schedule the maintenance operations when radon level is minimum. In the past, deep learning models have been implemented to forecast the radon time series at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), in Spain, with satisfactory results. When forecasting time series, the past values of the time series are taken as input variables. The present work focuses on understanding the relative contribution of these input variables to the predictions generated by neural networks.

The passage explicitly states that \"forecasting the radon levels is a crucial task in an attempt to schedule the maintenance operations when radon level is minimum.\" This is important because radon particles can be deposited inside detectors when they are opened for maintenance, potentially affecting experimental results. By scheduling maintenance when radon levels are lowest, researchers can minimize this source of background radiation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while cosmic rays are mentioned as a background source, the underground location already helps minimize this, and radon forecasting is not directly related to cosmic ray prediction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention using radon forecasting to measure rock shielding effectiveness. The rocks are actually the source of radon emanation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss using radon forecasting for calibrating dark matter detectors.

The competition between on-site Coulomb repulsion and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) is studied on two-leg ladders by numerical techniques.
