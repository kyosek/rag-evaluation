From nutrient uptake, to chemoreception, to synaptic transmission, many systems in cell biology depend on molecules diffusing and binding to membrane receptors. Mathematical analysis of such systems often neglects the fact that receptors process molecules at finite kinetic rates. A key example is the celebrated formula of Berg and Purcell for the rate that cell surface receptors capture extracellular molecules. Indeed, this influential result is only valid if receptors transport molecules through the cell wall at a rate much faster than molecules arrive at receptors. From a mathematical perspective, ignoring receptor kinetics is convenient because it makes the diffusing molecules independent. In contrast, including receptor kinetics introduces correlations between the diffusing molecules since, for example, bound receptors may be temporarily blocked from binding additional molecules. In this work, we present a modeling framework for coupling bulk diffusion to surface receptors with finite kinetic rates. The framework uses boundary homogenization to couple the diffusion equation to nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the boundary.

We discuss a possibility that a tidal disruption event near a dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH) can give rise to spectral features of iron in 6-7 keV X-ray signal: a relativistic line profile emerges from debris illuminated and ionised by an intense flash produced from the destroyed star. This could provide a unique way to determine parameters of the system. We consider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape (i.e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive black hole, and also the primary irradiation flare is expected to occur more likely near the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. This suggests that the reprocessing of primary X-rays results in a transient profile that should be relevant for tidal-disruption events (TDE) in otherwise under-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i.e. with no prior accretion disc. Resonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbital eccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them close to the tidal radius, where they can give rise to TDEs.

This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and interpretation of results challenging.

Design is fundamental to software development but can be demanding to perform. Thus to assist the software designer, evolutionary computing is being increasingly applied using machine-based, quantitative fitness functions to evolve software designs. However, in nature, elegance and symmetry play a crucial role in the reproductive fitness of various organisms. In addition, subjective evaluation has also been exploited in Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC). Therefore to investigate the role of elegance and symmetry in software design, four novel elegance measures are proposed based on the evenness of distribution of design elements. In controlled experiments in a dynamic interactive evolutionary computation environment, designers are presented with visualizations of object-oriented software designs, which they rank according to a subjective assessment of elegance. For three out of the four elegance measures proposed, it is found that a significant correlation exists between elegance values and reward elicited. These three elegance measures assess the evenness of distribution of (a) attributes and methods among classes, (b) external couples between classes, and (c) the ratio of attributes to methods.

The study presents a \"detailed analysis of the log-periodic structures as precursors of the financial crashes.\"\n2.

A \"clear log-periodic structure prior to the crash and consistent with its onset extends over the period of a few months.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the research suggests these oscillations have predictive value, not that they are random noise. Option C is a misconception; while the oscillations may indicate an impending crash, their frequency doesn't directly correspond to the timing. Option D is also incorrect, as the documentation mentions similar analysis of American indices, suggesting this phenomenon is not unique to the German market.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (log-periodic structures, discrete scale-invariance, market crashes) and application to a scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and evaluation."}, "64": {"documentation": {"title": "Proton Transport Entropy Increase In Amorphous SiO$_2$", "source": "Randall T.

In this paper, an aggregate game approach is proposed for the modeling and analysis of energy consumption control in smart grid. Since the electricity user's cost function depends on the aggregate load, which is unknown to the end users, an aggregate load estimator is employed to estimate it. Based on the communication among the users about their estimations on the aggregate load, Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are proposed for the electricity users. By using singular perturbation analysis and Lyapunov stability analysis, a local convergence result to the Nash equilibrium is presented for the energy consumption game that may have multiple Nash equilibria. For the energy consumption game with a unique Nash equilibrium, it is shown that the players' strategies converge to the Nash equilibrium non-locally.

In many collective decision making situations, agents vote to choose an alternative that best represents the preferences of the group.

The SIR pandemic model suffers from an unrealistic assumption: The rate of removal from the infectious class of individuals is assumed to be proportional to the number of infectious individuals.

A more realistic assumption is that an individual is removed at a certain time interval after having been infected. A simple modified SIR model is proposed which implements this delay, resulting in a single delay differential equation which comprises the model. A solution to this equation which is applicable to a pandemic is of the form A+B L(t) where L(t) is a logistic function, and A and B are constants.

Diffusion models have recently attained significant interest within the community owing to their strong performance as generative models.

Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency step.

Yet, most analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work) only and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In fact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an influential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection.
