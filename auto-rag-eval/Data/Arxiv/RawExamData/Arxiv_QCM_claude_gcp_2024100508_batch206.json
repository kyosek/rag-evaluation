Measurement and management of credit concentration risk is critical for banks and relevant for micro-prudential requirements. While several methods exist for measuring credit concentration risk within institutions, the systemic effect of different institutions' exposures to the same counterparties has been less explored so far. In this paper, we propose a measure of the systemic credit concentration risk that arises because of common exposures between different institutions within a financial system. This approach is based on a network model that describes the effect of overlapping portfolios. This network metric is applied to synthetic and real world data to illustrate that the effect of common exposures is not fully reflected in single portfolio concentration measures. It also allows to quantify several aspects of the interplay between interconnectedness and credit risk. Using this network measure, we formulate an analytical approximation for the additional capital requirement corresponding to the systemic risk arising from credit concentration interconnectedness. Our methodology also avoids double counting between the granularity adjustment and the common exposure adjustment. Although approximated, this common exposure adjustment is able to capture, with only two parameters, an aspect of systemic risk that can extend single portfolios view to a system-wide one."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and contribution of the paper's proposed measure of systemic credit concentration risk?\n\nA) It focuses solely on measuring credit concentration risk within individual institutions.\n\nB) It introduces a network model that captures the effect of overlapping portfolios between different institutions in a financial system.\n\nC) It provides a comprehensive method for calculating the granularity adjustment in credit risk models.\n\nD) It proposes a new way to measure idiosyncratic risk in single portfolios without considering systemic effects.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Cell-free system where a group of base stations (BSs) cooperatively serves users has received much attention as a promising technology for the future wireless systems. In order to maximize the cooperation gain in the cell-free systems, acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) at the BSs is crucial. While this task is relatively easy for the time division duplexing (TDD) systems due to the channel reciprocity, it is not easy for the frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems due to the CSI feedback overhead.

Using the concept of cheap vertices we strengthen our bound for the independence number. The resulting lower bounds improve greatly the famous Caro-Wei bound and also the best known bounds for $\\alpha_1(G)$ and $\\alpha_2(G)$ for some families of graphs. We show that the equality in our bound for independence number happens for a large class of graphs. Our bounds are achieved by Cheap-Greedy algorithms for $\\alpha_k(G)$ which are designed by the concept of cheap sets.
