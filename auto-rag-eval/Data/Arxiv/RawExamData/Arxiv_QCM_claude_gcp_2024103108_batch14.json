In this paper, we investigate 2727 galaxies observed by MaNGA as of June 2016 to develop spatially resolved techniques for identifying signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We identify 303 AGN candidates. The additional spatial dimension imposes challenges in identifying AGN due to contamination from diffuse ionized gas, extra-planar gas and photoionization by hot stars. We show that the combination of spatially-resolved line diagnostic diagrams and additional cuts on H$\\alpha$ surface brighness and H$\\alpha$ equivalent width can distinguish between AGN-like signatures and high-metallicity galaxies with LINER-like spectra. Low mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates are particularly difficult to diagnose and routinely show diagnostic line ratios outside of the standard star-formation locus. We develop a new diagnostic -- the distance from the standard diagnostic line in the line-ratios space -- to evaluate the significance of the deviation from the star-formation locus. We find 173 galaxies that would not have been selected as AGN candidates based on single-fibre spectral measurements but exhibit photoionization signatures suggestive of AGN activity in the MaNGA resolved observations, underscoring the power of large integral field unit (IFU) surveys.

In this paper we work out the injection into the acceleration phase of the wake field in a plasma behind a high intensity laser pulse, taking advantage of the laser polarization and focusing. With the aid of catastrophe theory we categorize the injection dynamics. The scheme uses the structurally stable regime of transverse wake wave breaking, when electron trajectory self-intersection leads to the formation of a flat electron bunch.

Recently, there was a revived interest in the interaction of rotating matter with the quantum vacuum. Here, we consider a rotating pair of atoms maintained by London van der Waals forces and calculate the frictional torque they experience due to zero-point radiation. Using a semi-classical framework derived from the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem, we take into account the full electrostatic coupling between induced dipoles. Considering the case of zero temperature only, we find a braking torque proportional to the angular velocity and to the third power of the fine structure constant. Although very small compared to London van der Waals attraction, the torque is strong enough to induce the formation of dimers in binary collisions. This new friction phenomenon at the atomic level should induce a paradigm change in the explanation of irreversibility."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the nature and implications of the vacuum friction phenomenon discussed in the document?\n\nA) The friction is caused by classical electromagnetic interactions and is proportional to the square of the fine structure constant.\n\nB) The vacuum friction leads to a propulsive force that could be harnessed for atomic-scale motors.\n\nC) The frictional torque is strong enough to overcome London-van der Waals forces and prevent dimer formation.\n\nD) The phenomenon arises from zero-point quantum fluctuations and could explain irreversibility at the atomic level.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the friction is caused by quantum fluctuations, not classical interactions, and it's proportional to the third power of the fine structure constant, not the square.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the document describes a braking torque, not a propulsive force.

Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) has broad application in open-set verification tasks, such as speaker verification. A key concern for PLDA is that the model is too simple (linear Gaussian) to deal with complicated data; however, the simplicity by itself is a major advantage of PLDA, as it leads to desirable generalization. An interesting research therefore is how to improve modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global and local models. The new model, which we call decoupled PLDA, is tested on a speaker verification task. Experimental results show that it consistently outperforms the vanilla PLDA when the model is based on raw speaker vectors.
