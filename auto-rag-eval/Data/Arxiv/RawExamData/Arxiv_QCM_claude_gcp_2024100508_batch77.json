Ever since WMAP announced its first results, different analyses have shown that there is weak evidence for several large-scale anomalies in the CMB data. While the evidence for each anomaly appears to be weak, the fact that there are multiple seemingly unrelated anomalies makes it difficult to account for them via a single statistical fluke. So, one is led to considering a combination of these anomalies. But, if we \"hand-pick\" the anomalies (test statistics) to consider, we are making an \\textit{a posteriori} choice. In this article, we propose two statistics that do not suffer from this problem. The statistics are linear and quadratic combinations of the $a_{\\ell m}$'s with random co-efficients, and they test the null hypothesis that the $a_{\\ell m}$'s are independent, normally-distributed, zero-mean random variables with an $m$-independent variance. The motivation for such statistics is generality; equivalently, it is a non \\textit{a posteriori} choice. But, a very useful by-product of considering such statistics is this: Because most physical models that lead to large-scale anomalies result in coupling multiple $\\ell$ and $m$ modes, the \"coherence\" of this coupling should get enhanced if a combination of different modes is considered. Using fiducial data, we demonstrate that the method works and discuss how it can be used with actual CMB data to make quite general statements about how incompatible the data are with the null hypothesis."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: A new method for detecting anomalies in CMB maps proposes using statistics that are linear and quadratic combinations of a_\u2113m's with random coefficients.

We prove that, when the underlying set is a polytope, our method never provides an ellipsoid of higher volume than the one obtained by scaling the maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid.

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has recently shown promising advances on speeding up learning, improving the exploration, and discovering intertask transferable skills.

However, HRL with multiple levels is usually needed in many real-world scenarios, whose ultimate goals are highly abstract, while their actions are very primitive.
