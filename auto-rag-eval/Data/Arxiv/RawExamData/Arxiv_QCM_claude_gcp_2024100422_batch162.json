Mining projects often gain support from communities through promises of benefits to the local economy, though the empirical evidence is mixed: mineral assets are advantageous in some circumstances but lead to corruption and violence in others. To shed light on this apparent discrepancy, we significantly extend the coverage of previous work in this area by gathering satellite data that spans several decades and encompasses several institutional environments. Our dataset consists of one million 30m-resolution Landsat images between 1984 and 2019 from a 40km radius around 1,658 mineral deposits across the continent. Using state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision, we translate these images into economically meaningful indicators measuring local wealth and land use. We then use stacked event studies and difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of mine openings and closings. We find strong evidence of a political resource curse at the local level. Although mining boosts the local economy in democratic countries, these gains are meagre in autocracies and come at the expense of an increase in localized conflict. Furthermore, our results show that the growth acceleration in mining areas is only temporary.

Motivated by the increasing number of COVID-19 cases that have been observed in many countries after the vaccination and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we propose a mathematical model on time-varying networks for the spread of recurrent epidemic diseases in a partially vaccinated population. The model encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe symptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals, and human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold, we compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium. These theoretical results show that precautious human behaviour and effective testing practices are key toward avoiding epidemic outbreaks. Interestingly, we found that, in many realistic scenarios, vaccination is successful in mitigating the outbreak by reducing the prevalence of seriously ill patients, but it could be a double-edged sword, whereby in some cases it might favour resurgent outbreaks, calling for higher testing rates, more cautiousness and responsibility among the population, or the reintroduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve complete eradication."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the mathematical model described in the paper, which of the following combinations is most likely to lead to a resurgent outbreak in a partially vaccinated population?\n\nA) High vaccine effectiveness against transmission, increased testing rates, and cautious human behavior\nB) Low vaccine effectiveness against severe symptoms, relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions, and reduced testing practices\nC) High vaccine effectiveness against severe symptoms, relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions, and reduced cautiousness among the population\nD) Low vaccine effectiveness against transmission, strict non-pharmaceutical interventions, and increased testing rates\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

In this paper, we propose to approach economic time series forecasting of multiple financial assets in a novel way via video prediction. Given past prices of multiple potentially interacting financial assets, we aim to predict the prices evolution in the future. Instead of treating the snapshot of prices at each time point as a vector, we spatially layout these prices in 2D as an image, such that we can harness the power of CNNs in learning a latent representation for these financial assets.

Using simultaneous multi-frequency observations performed at 1.4, 4.9 and 8.4 GHz, we obtained polarization information for single pulses and the average pulse profile at several epochs. We find that in several respects this magnetar source shows similarities to the emission properties of normal radio pulsars while simultaneously showing striking differences. The emission is nearly 80-95% polarized, often with a low but significant degree of circular polarization at all frequencies which can be much greater in selected single pulses. The position angle swing has a low average slope of only 1 deg/deg, deviating significantly from an S-like swing as often seen in radio pulsars which is usually interpreted in terms of a rotating vector model and a dipolar magnetic field. The observed position angle is consistent at all frequencies while showing significant secular variations. On average the interpulse is less linearly polarized but shows a higher degree of circular polarization. Some epochs reveal the existence of non-orthogonal emission modes in the main pulse and systematic wiggles in the PA swing, while the interpulse shows a large variety of position angle values.

The documentation states that for realistic parameter values, the Georgi-Manohar picture emerges with the chiral radius R_ch \u2248 \u03c1 \u2248 0.2 fm, which is much less than the confining radius R_c \u2248 hadron radius \u2248 1 fm. This relationship suggests that chiral effects occur at a smaller scale (around 0.2 fm) compared to the confining effects (around 1 fm). This separation of scales is a key feature of the Georgi-Manohar model, which proposes that chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are distinct phenomena occurring at different length scales in QCD."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "An Introduction to Applications of Wavelet Benchmarking with Seasonal\n  Adjustment", "source": "Homesh Sayal, John A.

Prior to adjustment, accounting conditions between national accounts data sets are frequently violated. Benchmarking is the procedure used by economic agencies to make such data sets consistent. It typically involves adjusting a high frequency time series (e.g. quarterly data) so it becomes consistent with a lower frequency version (e.g. annual data). Various methods have been developed to approach this problem of inconsistency between data sets. This paper introduces a new statistical procedure; namely wavelet benchmarking. Wavelet properties allow high and low frequency processes to be jointly analysed and we show that benchmarking can be formulated and approached succinctly in the wavelet domain. Furthermore the time and frequency localisation properties of wavelets are ideal for handling more complicated benchmarking problems. The versatility of the procedure is demonstrated using simulation studies where we provide evidence showing it substantially outperforms currently used methods.
