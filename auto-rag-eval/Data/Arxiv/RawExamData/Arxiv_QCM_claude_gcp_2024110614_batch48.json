Lung cancer is deadly cancer that causes millions of deaths every year around the world. Accurate lung nodule detection and segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images is the most important part of diagnosing lung cancer in the early stage. Most of the existing systems are semi-automated and need to manually select the lung and nodules regions to perform the segmentation task. To address these challenges, we proposed a fully automated end-to-end lung nodule detection and segmentation system based on a deep learning approach. In this paper, we used Optimized Faster R-CNN; a state-of-the-art detection model to detect the lung nodule regions in the CT scans.

Fast and energetic winds are invoked by galaxy formation models as essential processes in the evolution of galaxies. These outflows can be powered either by star-formation and/or AGN activity, but the relative dominance of the two mechanisms is still under debate. We use spectroscopic stacking analysis to study the properties of the low-ionization phase of the outflow in a sample of 1330 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and 79 X-ray detected (42<log(L_X)<45 erg/s) Type 2 AGN at 1.7<z<4.6 selected from a compilation of deep optical spectroscopic surveys, mostly zCOSMOS-Deep and VUDS. We measure mean velocity offsets of -150 km/s in the SFGs while in the AGN sample the velocity is much higher (-950 km/s), suggesting that the AGN is boosting the outflow up to velocities that could not be reached only with the star- formation contribution. The sample of X-ray AGN has on average a lower SFR than non-AGN SFGs of similar mass: this, combined with the enhanced outflow velocity in AGN hosts, is consistent with AGN feedback in action. We further divide our sample of AGN into two X-ray luminosity bins: we measure the same velocity offsets in both stacked spectra, at odds with results reported for the highly ionized phase in local AGN, suggesting that the two phases of the outflow may be mixed only up to relatively low velocities, while the highest velocities can be reached only by the highly ionized phase."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about AGN-enhanced outflows in star-forming galaxies, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A research team is studying the relationship between AGN activity and outflows in high-redshift galaxies.

The correct answer is C because the study found that X-ray detected AGN hosts (like Galaxy A) showed much higher outflow velocities in the low-ionization phase compared to star-forming galaxies without detected AGN activity (like Galaxy B).

The lifelong control problem of an off-grid microgrid is composed of two tasks, namely estimation of the condition of the microgrid devices and operational planning accounting for the uncertainties by forecasting the future consumption and the renewable production. The main challenge for the effective control arises from the various changes that take place over time. In this paper, we present an open-source reinforcement framework for the modeling of an off-grid microgrid for rural electrification. The lifelong control problem of an isolated microgrid is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We categorize the set of changes that can occur in progressive and abrupt changes. We propose a novel model based reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to address both types of changes. In particular the proposed algorithm demonstrates generalisation properties, transfer capabilities and better robustness in case of fast-changing system dynamics.

In the simple model of neutrino texture presented in this paper, the Majorana left-handed mass matrix is zero, the Majorana righthanded mass matrix - diagonal and degenerate, and the Dirac mass matrix has a hierarchical structure, deformed unitarily by nearly bimaximal mixing. In the case, when the Majorana righthanded term dominates over the Dirac term, the familiar seesaw mechanism leads effectively to the nearly bimaximal oscillations of active neutrinos, consistent with solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments. If the Dirac term, before its unitary deformation, is similar in shape to the known charged-lepton mass matrix, then parameters for solar $\\nu_e$'s and atmospheric $\\nu_\\mu$'s become related to each other, predicting from the SuperKamiokande value of $\\Delta m_{32}^2$ a tiny $\\Delta m_{21}^2$ typical for MSW LOW solar solution rather than for MSW Large Mixing Angle solution.

For a single hadron bunch in a circular accelerator at zero chromaticity, without multi-turn wakes and without electron clouds and other beams, only one transverse collective instability is possible, the mode-coupling instability, or TMCI. For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold of the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC tune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different methods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at strong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles. Thus, were it correct, such a beam with sufficiently strong SC, being stable at some intensity, would remain stable at higher intensity, regardless of how much higher! This paper suggests a resolution of this conundrum: while SC suppresses TMCI, it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications, which could make the beam even less stable than without SC, even if all the coherent tunes are real, i.e. all the modes are stable in the conventional {\\it absolute} meaning of the word.

While it's true that SC suppresses TMCI (Transverse Mode Coupling Instability), the paper suggests that it introduces head-to-tail convective amplifications. These amplifications can potentially make the beam less stable than without SC, even when all coherent tunes are real and modes appear stable in the conventional absolute sense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it represents the puzzling conventional wisdom that the paper aims to resolve.
