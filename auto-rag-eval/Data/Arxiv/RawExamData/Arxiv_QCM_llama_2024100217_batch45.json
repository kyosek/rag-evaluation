Although skip connections have been incorporated to combine layers, these connections have been \"shallow\" themselves, and only fuse by simple, one-step operations. We augment standard architectures with deeper aggregation to better fuse information across layers. Our deep layer aggregation structures iteratively and hierarchically merge the feature hierarchy to make networks with better accuracy and fewer parameters.

Yet, most analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work) only and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In fact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an influential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection. On this account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time choice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work start time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration economies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in work schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal schedule choices with two system performance indicators. For total commuting cost, it is found that the rigid school schedule for households may impede the benefits of flextime in commuting cost saving. In terms of total net benefit, while work schedule agglomeration of all commuters leads to the maximum in some cases, the polarized agglomeration of the two heterogenous groups can never achieve the optimum."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the study on Bottleneck Congestion And Work Starting Time Distribution Considering Household Travels, what is the primary assumption of most analytical studies regarding the work starting time choice, and how does the incorporation of household travels into the model address this limitation?\n\n**A)** Most analytical studies assume that household travels only occur during peak hours, and the incorporation of household travels into the model allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the work starting time choice.\n\n**B)** Most analytical studies assume that household travels are not a significant factor in the work starting time choice, and the incorporation of household travels into the model reveals the importance of considering these travels in the decision-making process.\n\n**C)** Most analytical studies assume that household travels only occur during non-peak hours, and the incorporation of household travels into the model highlights the need to consider these travels in the work starting time choice.\n\n**D)** Most analytical studies assume that household travels are not relevant to the work starting time choice, and the incorporation of household travels into the model demonstrates the significant impact of these travels on the decision-making process.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) Most analytical studies assume that household travels are not a significant factor in the work starting time choice, and the incorporation of household travels into the model reveals the importance of considering these travels in the decision-making process.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) Most analytical studies assume that household travels are not a significant factor in the work starting time choice, and the incorporation of household travels into the model reveals the importance of considering these travels in the decision-making process.
