Dynamic models of biochemical networks typically consist of sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations involving states (concentrations or amounts of the components of the network) and parameters describing the reaction kinetics.

In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models are universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In this work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of identifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of examples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness inherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data or noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and iv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design?

Recent papers of S. Goto, K. Nishida, A. Corso and W. Vasconcelos pushed the interest toward a more general setting. In this paper we extend an upper bound on $e_1$ proved by S. Huckaba and T. Marley. Thus we get the Cohen-Macaulayness of the ring $A$ as a consequence of the extremal behavior of the integer $e_1.$ The result can be considered a confirm of the general philosophy of the paper of W. Vasconcelos where the Chern number is conjectured to be a measure of the distance from the Cohen-Macaulyness of $A.$ This main result of the paper is a consequence of a nice and perhaps unexpected property of superficial elements. It is essentially a kind of \"Sally machine\" for local rings.

Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This paper addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgements these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets, to reflect equity choices, while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions.

These DPHE-UHTCs consist of a hexagonal high-entropy boride (HEB) phase and a cubic high-entropy carbide (HEC) phase. A thermodynamic relation that governs the compositions of the HEB and HEC phases in equilibrium is discovered and a thermodynamic model is proposed. These DPHE-UHTCs exhibit tunable grain size, Vickers microhardness, Young' and shear moduli, and thermal conductivity. The DPHE-UHTCs have higher hardness than the weighted linear average of the two single-phase HEB and HEC, which are already harder than the rule-of-mixture averages of individual binary borides and carbides. This study extends the state of the art by introducing dual-phase high-entropy ceramics (DPHECs), which provide a new platform to tailor various properties via changing the phase fraction and microstructure."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary advantage of the dual-phase high-entropy ultra-high temperature ceramics (DPHE-UHTCs) over the weighted linear average of the two single-phase high-entropy boride (HEB) and high-entropy carbide (HEC) phases?\n\nA) Higher thermal conductivity\nB) Higher Vickers microhardness\nC) Higher Young's modulus\nD) Higher hardness than the weighted linear average of the two single-phase HEB and HEC phases\n\nCorrect Answer: D) Higher hardness than the weighted linear average of the two single-phase HEB and HEC phases\n\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to understand the key finding of the study, which is that the DPHE-UHTCs exhibit higher hardness than the weighted linear average of the two single-phase HEB and HEC phases. This is a critical advantage of the DPHE-UHTCs, as it allows for the creation of materials with tailored properties. The other options are incorrect because while the DPHE-UHTCs may exhibit high thermal conductivity, Vickers microhardness, and Young's modulus, these are not the primary advantage of the material."}}
