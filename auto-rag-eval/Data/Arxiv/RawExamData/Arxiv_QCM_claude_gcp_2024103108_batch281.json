Most of our knowledge about the structure of the Milky Way has come from the study of variable stars. Among the variables, mimicking the periodic variation of pulsating stars, are the eclipsing binaries. These stars are important in astrophysics because they allow us to directly measure radii and masses of the components, as well as the distance to the system, thus being useful in studies of Galactic structure alongside pulsating RR Lyrae and Cepheids. Using the distinguishing features of their light curves, one can identify them using a semi-automated process. In this work, we present a strategy to search for eclipsing variables in the inner VVV bulge across an area of 13.4 sq. deg. within $1.68^{\\rm o}<l<7.53^{\\rm o}$ and $-3.73^{\\rm o}<b<-1.44^{\\rm o}$, corresponding to the VVV tiles b293 to b296 and b307 to b310. We accurately classify 212 previously unknown eclipsing binaries, including six very reddened sources.

Instead, it uses network metrics and transparency to influence borrowing behavior.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the model promotes a self-organized critical approach rather than centralizing all decisions under the Central Bank.\n\nThe key aspect of this model is that it allows banks to assess the true risks associated with lending to other banks by providing them with more complete information about the systemic risk posed by each institution in the network.

Recent whole-brain calcium imaging recordings of the nematode C. elegans have demonstrated that neural activity is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states.

Recent work in metric learning has significantly improved the state-of-the-art in k-nearest neighbor classification. Support vector machines (SVM), particularly with RBF kernels, are amongst the most popular classification algorithms that uses distance metrics to compare examples. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the efficacy of three of the most popular Mahalanobis metric learning algorithms as pre-processing for SVM training. We show that none of these algorithms generate metrics that lead to particularly satisfying improvements for SVM-RBF classification. As a remedy we introduce support vector metric learning (SVML), a novel algorithm that seamlessly combines the learning of a Mahalanobis metric with the training of the RBF-SVM parameters. We demonstrate the capabilities of SVML on nine benchmark data sets of varying sizes and difficulties. In our study, SVML outperforms all alternative state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and establishes itself as a serious alternative to the standard Euclidean metric with model selection by cross validation."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between traditional metric learning algorithms and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with RBF kernels, and how does Support Vector Metric Learning (SVML) address this issue?\n\nA) Traditional metric learning algorithms consistently improve SVM-RBF classification performance, while SVML offers only marginal improvements.\n\nB) Existing metric learning algorithms are ineffective for SVM-RBF classification, but SVML combines metric learning with SVM parameter training to outperform standard methods.\n\nC) Both traditional metric learning and SVML equally enhance SVM-RBF classification, making them interchangeable in practice.\n\nD) SVML is primarily designed for k-nearest neighbor classification and shows no significant advantage for SVM-RBF models compared to existing metric learning approaches.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the key findings and contributions presented in the document.

We propose RSO (random search optimization), a gradient free Markov Chain Monte Carlo search based approach for training deep neural networks. To this end, RSO adds a perturbation to a weight in a deep neural network and tests if it reduces the loss on a mini-batch. If this reduces the loss, the weight is updated, otherwise the existing weight is retained. Surprisingly, we find that repeating this process a few times for each weight is sufficient to train a deep neural network. The number of weight updates for RSO is an order of magnitude lesser when compared to backpropagation with SGD. RSO can make aggressive weight updates in each step as there is no concept of learning rate. The weight update step for individual layers is also not coupled with the magnitude of the loss. RSO is evaluated on classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with deep neural networks of 6 to 10 layers where it achieves an accuracy of 99.1% and 81.8% respectively.

One of the problems with the economic interpretation of firm selection through competition has been a weak grasp on an incomplete scientific paradigm. As I.F. Price notes, \"The biological metaphor has long lurked in the background of management theory largely because the message of 'survival of the fittest' (usually wrongly attributed to Charles Darwin rather than Herbert Spencer) provides a seemingly natural model for market competition (e.g. Alchian 1950, Merrell 1984, Henderson 1989, Moore 1993), without seriously challenging the underlying paradigms of what an organisation is.\" In this paper we examine the application of dynamic fitness landscape models to economic theory, particularly the theory of technology substitution, drawing on recent work by Kauffman, Arthur, McKelvey, Nelson and Winter, and Windrum and Birchenhall.
