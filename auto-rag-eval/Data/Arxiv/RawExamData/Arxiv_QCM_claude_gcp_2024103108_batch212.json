Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models for many graph-structured tasks. Existing models often assume that a complete structure of a graph is available during training. In practice, however, graph-structured data is usually formed in a streaming fashion so that learning a graph continuously is often necessary. In this paper, we aim to bridge GNN to lifelong learning by converting a graph problem to a regular learning problem, so that GNN can inherit the lifelong learning techniques developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this end, we propose a new graph topology based on feature cross-correlation, namely, the feature graph. It takes features as new nodes and turns nodes into independent graphs. This successfully converts the original problem of node classification to graph classification, in which the increasing nodes are turned into independent training samples. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of feature graph networks (FGN) by continuously learning a sequence of classical graph datasets. We also show that FGN achieves superior performance in two applications, i.e., lifelong human action recognition with wearable devices and feature matching. To the best of our knowledge, FGN is the first work to bridge graph learning to lifelong learning via a novel graph topology.

Background: Exonic splice enhancers are sequences embedded within exons which promote and regulate the splicing of the transcript in which they are located. A class of exonic splice enhancers are the SR proteins, which are thought to mediate interactions between splicing factors bound to the 5' and 3' splice sites. Method and results: We present a novel strategy for analysing protein-coding sequence by first randomizing the codons used at each position within the coding sequence, then applying a motif-based machine learning algorithm to compare the true and randomized sequences. This strategy identified a collection of motifs which can successfully discriminate between real and randomized coding sequence, including -- but not restricted to -- several previously reported splice enhancer elements. As well as successfully distinguishing coding exons from randomized sequences, we show that our model is able to recognize non-coding exons. Conclusions: Our strategy succeeded in detecting signals in coding exons which seem to be orthogonal to the sequences' primary function of coding for proteins.
