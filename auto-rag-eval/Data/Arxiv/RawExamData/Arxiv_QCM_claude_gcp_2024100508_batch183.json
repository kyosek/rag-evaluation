This paper describes an approach to economics that is inspired by quantum computing, and is motivated by the need to develop a consistent quantum mathematical framework for economics.

While this approach has been highly influential, it has come under increasing criticism following the financial crisis of 2007/8. The quantum approach, in contrast, is inherently probabilistic and dynamic. Decision-makers are described, not by a utility function, but by a propensity function which specifies the probability of transacting. We show how a number of cognitive phenomena such as preference reversal and the disjunction effect can be modelled by using a simple quantum circuit to generate an appropriate propensity function. Conversely, a general propensity function can be quantized to incorporate effects such as interference and entanglement that characterise human decision-making.

The efficiency of soft particles to stabilize emulsions is examined by measuring their desorption free energy, i.e., the mechanical work required to detach the particle from a fluid interface.

The energy of desorption is computed for two and three-dimensional configurations by means of the mean thermodynamic integration method.

We also comment on the connection between twistors and the Seiberg-Witten construction of quantum moduli spaces, as they arise in three dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, and briefly address the uniformization of algebraic curves in C^3 in the context of large N Toda theory.

A key challenge in condensed matter research is the optimization of topological insulator (TI) compounds for the study and future application of their unique surface states. Truly insulating bulk states would allow the exploitation of predicted surface state properties, such as protection from backscattering, dissipationless spin-polarized currents, and the emergence of novel particles. Towards this end, major progress was recently made with the introduction of highly resistive Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se, in which surface state conductance and quantum oscillations are observed at low temperatures. Nevertheless, an unresolved and pivotal question remains: while room temperature ARPES studies reveal clear evidence of TI surface states, their observation in transport experiments is limited to low temperatures. A better understanding of this surface state suppression at elevated temperatures is of fundamental interest, and crucial for pushing the boundary of device applications towards room-temperature operation. In this work, we simultaneously measure TI bulk and surface states via temperature dependent optical spectroscopy, in conjunction with transport and ARPES measurements.

We study the adiabatic time evolution of quantum resonances over time scales which are small compared to the lifetime of the resonances. We consider three typical examples of resonances: The first one is that of shape resonances corresponding, for example, to the state of a quantum-mechanical particle in a potential well whose shape changes over time scales small compared to the escape time of the particle from the well. Our approach to studying the adiabatic evolution of shape resonances is based on a precise form of the time-energy uncertainty relation and the usual adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics. The second example concerns resonances that appear as isolated complex eigenvalues of spectrally deformed Hamiltonians, such as those encountered in the N-body Stark effect. Our approach to study such resonances is based on the Balslev-Combes theory of dilatation-analytic Hamiltonians and an adiabatic theorem for nonnormal generators of time evolution. Our third example concerns resonances arising from eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum when a perturbation is turned on, such as those encountered when a small system is coupled to an infinitely extended, dispersive medium. Our approach to this class of examples is based on an extension of adiabatic theorems without a spectral gap condition.

The documentation states that mixing effects in the CP-even scalar sector of the NMSSM can give 6-8 GeV correction to the SM-like Higgs mass in moderate or large tan\u03b2 regions with a small value of \u03bb ~O(0.1). This allows for smaller radiative corrections from stop loops (hence lighter stops) compared to the MSSM. The mixing effects, particularly between the SM-like Higgs and the lighter singlet, replace the standard NMSSM mechanism of increasing the tree-level Higgs mass in the low tan\u03b2 and large \u03bb regime. This scenario also leads to clear experimental signatures, such as modified decay rates of both the 125 GeV Higgs and the lighter singlet-like scalar.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes large \u03bb, which is not consistent with the described scenario. Option B is incorrect due to the small tan\u03b2.

The paper presents a sharpened upper bound on k(d), which asymptotically satisfies k(d) \u2264 d - log_2k(d) = d - (1 + o(1))log_2k(d). This is a more precise bound than the previously known k(d) \u2264 d - 1.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses log_2(d) instead of log_2k(d), which is not the bound given in the paper.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it presents a lower bound (\u2265) instead of an upper bound (\u2264) on k(d), and it uses O(log d) instead of the more precise log_2k(d) term.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states k(d) = d - 1 for all dimensions, which is not true according to the paper. The paper actually improves upon this bound and shows that k(d) can be smaller than d - 1.\n\nThe correct asymptotic behavior of N_d(n) is indeed (1/2)(1-1/k)n^2 + o(n^2), as stated in all options, but only option C correctly represents the sharpened upper bound on k(d) presented in the paper."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Instability of stratified two-phase flows in rectangular ducts", "source": "Alexander Gelfgat, Neima Brauner", "docs_id": "2004.01384", "section": ["physics.flu-dyn"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Instability of stratified two-phase flows in rectangular ducts.
