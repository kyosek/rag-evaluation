We focus first on the cavity method, showing that it quickly provides the correct recursion equations both for single instances and at the ensemble level. We also describe an alternative replica solution that proves to be equivalent to the cavity method. Both the cavity and the replica derivations allow us to obtain the spectral density via the solution of an integral equation for an auxiliary probability density function. We show that this equation can be solved using a stochastic population dynamics algorithm, and we provide its implementation. In this formalism, the spectral density is naturally written in terms of a superposition of local contributions from nodes of given degree, whose role is thoroughly elucidated.

Over the last decades, images have become an important source of information in many domains, thus their high quality has become necessary to acquire better information. One of the important issues that arise is image denoising, which means recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples. This interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory, which is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then the original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much less, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling theories. A strong factor in Compressive Sensing (CS) theory to achieve the sparsest solution and the noise removal from the corrupted image is the selection of the basis dictionary. In this paper, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and moment transform (Tchebichef, Krawtchouk) are compared in order to achieve image denoising of Gaussian additive white noise based on compressive sensing and sparse approximation theory. The experimental results revealed that the basis dictionaries constructed by the moment transform perform competitively to the traditional DCT. The latter transform shows a higher PSNR of 30.82 dB and the same 0.91 SSIM value as the Tchebichef transform.

Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood function) in the input feature space has so far prevented its direct use on data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable, i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene co-expression.

The STORE model embeds two key sparse structures: element-wise sparsity and low-rankness. This combination allows STORE to handle both non-symmetric and symmetric tensor responses, making it applicable to both structural and functional neuroimaging data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions high-rankness instead of low-rankness and incorrectly limits the application to symmetric tensor responses only.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it states element-wise density instead of sparsity, which is the opposite of what STORE uses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it mentions tensor-wise sparsity (instead of element-wise) and high-rankness, and incorrectly limits the application to only functional neuroimaging data.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates understanding of the key features of the STORE model and its broad applicability in neuroimaging analysis."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Error AMP Chain Graphs", "source": "Jose M.
