Godels incompleteness argument is explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of IfThen arguments are allowed to grow by self assembly, based on the basic set of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last half a century old non Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open, there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the unique characteristics of the new class of computer introduced in this research?\n\nA) It uses advanced logic gates and circuit designs to process information faster than traditional computers.\n\nB) It relies on quantum entanglement principles to perform computations beyond classical limits.\n\nC) It's a self-learning system that grows through self-assembly, creating its own program without traditional coding, and utilizes frequency-fractal computing in a multilayered seed structure.\n\nD) It's a neural network-based system that mimics human brain structure using artificial synapses and neurons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the key innovations described in the research.

Here, we explore the extent to which a globally broadcast learning signal, coupled with local weight updates, enables training of DNNs. We present both a learning rule, called global error-vector broadcasting (GEVB), and a class of DNNs, called vectorized nonnegative networks (VNNs), in which this learning rule operates.

We prove that these weight updates are matched in sign to the gradient, enabling accurate credit assignment. Moreover, at initialization, these updates are exactly proportional to the gradient in the limit of infinite network width. GEVB matches the performance of BP in VNNs, and in some cases outperforms direct feedback alignment (DFA) applied in conventional networks. Unlike DFA, GEVB successfully trains convolutional layers.
