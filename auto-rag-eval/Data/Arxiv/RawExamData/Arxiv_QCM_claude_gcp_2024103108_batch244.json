Social networks play a fundamental role in the diffusion of information. However, there are two different ways of how information reaches a person in a network. Information reaches us through connections in our social networks, as well as through the influence of external out-of-network sources, like the mainstream media. While most present models of information adoption in networks assume information only passes from a node to node via the edges of the underlying network, the recent availability of massive online social media data allows us to study this process in more detail. We present a model in which information can reach a node via the links of the social network or through the influence of external sources. We then develop an efficient model parameter fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how information reaches the nodes of the network. We quantify the external influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information adoption. We discover that the information tends to \"jump\" across the network, which can only be explained as an effect of an unobservable external influence on the network. We find that only about 71% of the information volume in Twitter can be attributed to network diffusion, and the remaining 29% is due to external events and factors outside the network."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the study of information diffusion in the Twitter network, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the researchers' findings about the role of external influences?\n\nA) External influences account for approximately 50% of information volume on Twitter, with network diffusion responsible for the other half.\n\nB) The study found no significant evidence of external influences on information diffusion in Twitter, with all information passing solely through network connections.\n\nC) External influences are responsible for about 29% of information volume on Twitter, while network diffusion accounts for the remaining 71%.\n\nD) The research concluded that external influences and network diffusion contribute equally to information spread on Twitter, each accounting for about 35% of the total volume.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Our approach is based on the technique of inducing from infinite ergodic theory.

These moments may correspond to views held by experts in the portfolio risk setting and to market prices of liquid options for options pricing models.

We discuss certain specific features of the calculation of the critical temperature of a dilute repulsive Bose gas. Interactions modify the critical temperature in two different ways. First, for gases in traps, temperature shifts are introduced by a change of the density profile, arising itself from a modification of the equation of state of the gas (reduced compressibility); these shifts can be calculated simply within mean field theory. Second, even in the absence of a trapping potential (homogeneous gas in a box), temperature shifts are introduced by the interactions; they arise from the correlations introduced in the gas, and thus lie inherently beyond mean field theory - in fact, their evaluation requires more elaborate, non-perturbative, calculations. One illustration of this non-perturbative character is provided by the solution of self-consistent equations, which relate together non-linearly the various energy shifts of the single particle levels k. These equations predict that repulsive interactions shift the critical temperature (at constant density) by an amount which is positive, and simply proportional to the scattering length a; nevertheless, the numerical coefficient is difficult to compute.
