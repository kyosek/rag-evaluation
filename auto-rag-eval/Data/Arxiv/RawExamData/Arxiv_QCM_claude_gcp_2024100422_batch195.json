Intracellular bidirectional transport of cargo on microtubule filaments is achieved by the collective action of oppositely directed dynein and kinesin motors. Experiments have found that in certain cases, inhibiting the activity of one type of motor results in an overall decline in the motility of the cellular cargo in both directions. This counter-intuitive observation, referred to as {\\em paradox of codependence} is inconsistent with the existing paradigm of a mechanistic tug-of-war between oppositely directed motors. Unlike kinesin, dynein motors exhibit catchbonding, wherein the unbinding rates of these motors decrease with increasing force on them. Incorporating this catchbonding behavior of dynein in a theoretical model, we show that the functional divergence of the two motors species manifests itself as an internal regulatory mechanism, and leads to codependent transport behaviour in biologically relevant regimes. Using analytical methods and stochastic simulations, we analyse the processivity characteristics and probability distribution of run times and pause times of transported cellular cargoes. We show that catchbonding can drastically alter the transport characteristics and also provide a plausible resolution of the paradox of codependence."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What mechanism is proposed to explain the paradox of codependence in bidirectional cellular transport, and how does it affect the overall motility of cellular cargo?\n\nA) Kinesin catch bonding, which increases the unbinding rates of kinesin motors under force, leading to enhanced cooperation between motor types\nB) Dynein catch bonding, which decreases the unbinding rates of dynein motors under force, acting as an internal regulatory mechanism\nC) A tug-of-war mechanism between dynein and kinesin motors, resulting in codependent transport behavior\nD) Inhibition of both motor types simultaneously, causing a synergistic increase in cargo motility in both directions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

More precisely, we study how the capacity varies in terms of the OFDM block transmission time $T$, bandwidth $W$, amplitude $A$, and the noise spectral density $N_0$. We first find suitable discrete encoding spaces for both cases, and prove that they are convex sets that have a semi-definite programming (SDP) representation. Using tools from convex geometry, we find lower and upper bounds on the volume of these encoding sets, which we exploit to drive pretty sharp lower and upper bounds on the capacity. We also study a practical Tone-Reservation (TR) encoding algorithm and prove that its performance can be characterized by the statistical width of an appropriate convex set. Recently, it has been observed that in high-dimensional estimation problems under constraints such as those arisen in Compressed Sensing (CS) statistical width plays a crucial role.
