Physical reservoir computing is a type of recurrent neural network that applies the dynamical response from physical systems to information processing. However, the relation between computation performance and physical parameters/phenomena still remains unclear. This study reports our progress regarding the role of current-dependent magnetic damping in the computational performance of reservoir computing. The current-dependent relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect to binary inputs. A fast relaxation caused by a large input leads to a fast fading of the input memory, whereas a slow relaxation by a small input enables the reservoir to keep the input memory for a relatively long time. As a result, a step-like dependence is found for the short-term memory and parity-check capacities on the pulse width of input data, where the capacities remain at 1.5 for a certain range of the pulse width, and drop to 1.0 for a long pulse-width limit.

Fast moving classical variables can generate quantum mechanical behavior. We demonstrate how this can happen in a model. The key point is that in classically (ontologically) evolving systems one can still define a conserved quantum energy. For the fast variables, the energy levels are far separated, such that one may assume these variables to stay in their ground state. This forces them to be entangled, so that, consequently, the slow variables are entangled as well. The fast variables could be the vacuum fluctuations caused by unknown super heavy particles. The emerging quantum effects in the light particles are expressed by a Hamiltonian that can have almost any form. The entire system is ontological, and yet allows one to generate interference effects in computer models. This seemed to lead to an unsolvable paradox, which is now resolved: exactly what happens in our models if we run a quantum interference experiment in a classical computer is explained.

The paper describes a model where fast moving classical variables, which could represent vacuum fluctuations caused by unknown super heavy particles, play a crucial role in generating quantum mechanical behavior.

In summary, our mathematical results formalise the biological notion that clonal selection is driven by the self-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells and the clones that possess the highest value of this parameter are ultimately selected. Moreover, we demonstrate that the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of non-stem cells do not have a substantial impact on clonal selection.

Traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods do not perform sufficiently well for such problems, since the hyperspectral data is very expensive to be largely collected in a trade-off between time and efficiency, compared to the multispectral data.

In line with Pomeau's conjecture about the relevance of directed percolation (DP) to turbulence onset/decay in wall-bounded flows, we propose a minimal stochastic model dedicated to the interpretation of the spatially intermittent regimes observed in channel flow before its return to laminar flow. Numerical simulations show that a regime with bands obliquely drifting in two stream-wise symmetrical directions bifurcates into an asymmetrical regime, before ultimately decaying to laminar flow. The model is expressed in terms of a probabilistic cellular automaton evolving von Neumann neighbourhoods with probabilities educed from a close examination of simulation results. It implements band propagation and the two main local processes: longitudinal splitting involving bands with the same orientation, and transversal splitting giving birth to a daughter band with orientation opposite to that of its mother. The ultimate decay stage observed to display one-dimensional DP properties in a two-dimensional geometry is interpreted as resulting from the irrelevance of lateral spreading in the single-orientation regime.

The simulated detector effects include energy, position, and timing resolution, thresholds, dead strips, charge sharing, charge loss, crosstalk, dead time, and detector trigger conditions. After including these effects, the simulations closely resemble the measurements, the standard analysis pipeline used for measurements can also be applied to the simulations, and the responses computed from the simulations are accurate.
