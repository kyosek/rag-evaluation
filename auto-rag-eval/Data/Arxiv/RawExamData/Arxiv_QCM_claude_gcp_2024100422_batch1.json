The exterior of the mammalian brain - the cerebral cortex - has a conserved layered structure whose thickness varies little across species. However, selection pressures over evolutionary time scales have led to cortices that have a large surface area to volume ratio in some organisms, with the result that the brain is strongly convoluted into sulci and gyri. Here we show that the gyrification can arise as a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical instability driven by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by the white matter. A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel captures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain treated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri similar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a function of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with brain size), and are consistent with observations of a wide range of brains, ranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two simple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to qualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical anomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the mechanism of gyrification in the mammalian brain according to the study?\n\nA) Gyrification is primarily driven by genetic factors that determine the precise locations of sulci and gyri during embryonic development.\n\nB) Gyrification results from a complex interaction between neuronal migration and selective apoptosis in specific regions of the developing cortex.\n\nC) Gyrification arises as a nonlinear consequence of a mechanical instability caused by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by the white matter.\n\nD) Gyrification is the result of differential growth rates between the upper and lower layers of the cortex, leading to buckling of the surface.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Feature-based dynamic pricing is an increasingly popular model of setting prices for highly differentiated products with applications in digital marketing, online sales, real estate and so on.

In situations where the Koopman operator can be computed exactly using Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), the proposed approach yields optimal control inputs. Furthermore, a recent convergence result for EDMD suggests that the approach can be applied to more complex dynamics as well.

At 4 K, these particles produce a distribution of narrow, low energy emission peaks with short lifetimes and excitation fluence-dependent, oscillatory decays, resembling the features of superfluorescence.

Spatial association and heterogeneity are two critical areas in the research about spatial analysis, geography, statistics and so on.

Additionally, most of the traditional methods are based on distance statistic and spatial weighted matrix. However, in some abstract spatial situations, distance statistic can not be applied since we can not even observe the geographical locations directly. Meanwhile, under these circumstances, due to invisibility of spatial positions, designing of weight matrix can not absolutely avoid subjectivity. In this paper, a new entropy-based method, which is data-driven and distribution-free, has been proposed to help us investigate spatial association while fully taking the fact that heterogeneity widely exist.

Telecommunication networks play a critical role in modern society. With the arrival of 5G networks, these systems are becoming even more diversified, integrated, and intelligent. Traffic forecasting is one of the key components in such a system, however, it is particularly challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal dependency. In this work, we consider this problem from the aspect of a cellular network and the interactions among its base stations. We thoroughly investigate the characteristics of cellular network traffic and shed light on the dependency complexities based on data collected from a densely populated metropolis area. Specifically, we observe that the traffic shows both dynamic and static spatial dependencies as well as diverse cyclic temporal patterns. To address these complexities, we propose an effective deep-learning-based approach, namely, Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network (STHGCN). It employs GRUs to model the temporal dependency, while capturing the complex spatial dependency through a hybrid-GCN from three perspectives: spatial proximity, functional similarity, and recent trend similarity.
