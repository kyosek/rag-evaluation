Refundable income annuities (IA), such as cash-refund and instalment-refund, differ in material ways from the life-only version beloved by economists.

We document that refundable IAs now represent the majority of sales in the U.S., yet they are mostly ignored by insurance and pension economists. And, although their pricing, duration, and money's-worth-ratio is complicated by recursivity which will be explained, we offer a path forward to make refundable IAs tractable. A key result concerns the market price of cash-refund IAs, when the actuarial present value is grossed-up by an insurance loading.

Context. The [CII] 158micron far-infrared fine-structure line is one of the dominant cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). Hence [CII] emission originates in and thus can be used to trace a range of ISM processes. Velocity-resolved large-scale mapping of [CII] in star-forming regions provides a unique perspective of the kinematics of these regions and their interactions with the exciting source of radiation. Aims. We explore the scientific applications of large-scale mapping of velocity-resolved [CII] observations. With the [CII] observations, we investigate the effect of stellar feedback on the ISM. We present the details of observation, calibration, and data reduction using a heterodyne array receiver mounted on an airborne observatory. Results. A square-degree [CII] map with a spectral resolution of 0.3 km/s is presented. The scientific potential of this data is summarized with discussion of mechanical and radiative stellar feedback, filament tracing using [CII], [CII] opacity effects, [CII] and carbon recombination lines, and [CII] interaction with the large molecular cloud.

In this paper, we compare ten trackers based on deep learning techniques on four aerial datasets. We choose top performing trackers utilizing different approaches, specifically tracking by detection, discriminative correlation filters, Siamese networks and reinforcement learning. In our experiments, we use a subset of OTB2015 dataset with aerial style videos; the UAV123 dataset without synthetic sequences; the UAV20L dataset, which contains 20 long sequences; and DTB70 dataset as our benchmark datasets. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of different trackers in different tracking situations encountered in aerial data.

We show that for strong enough spatial heterogeneity, the well-documented high-density, high-ordered propagating bands that emerge in homogeneous space disappear. Moreover, the ordered phase does not exhibit long-range order, as occurs in homogeneous systems, but rather quasi-long range order: i.e. the SPP system becomes disordered in the thermodynamical limit. For finite size systems, we find that there is an optimal noise value that maximizes order. Interestingly, the system becomes disordered in two limits, for high noise values as well as for vanishing noise. This remarkable finding strongly suggests the existence of two critical points, instead of only one, associated to the collective motion transition. Density fluctuations are consistent with these observations, being higher and anomalously strong at the optimal noise, and decreasing and crossing over to normal for high and low noise values.
