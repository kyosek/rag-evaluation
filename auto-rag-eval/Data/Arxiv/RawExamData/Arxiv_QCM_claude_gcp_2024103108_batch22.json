Although stochastic methods of filtering or state estimation (Kalman filters and particle filters) are widely used, out of vogue variational methods are more appropriate in this tracking context, because the objects do not typically display any significant random motions at the length and time scales of interest.

The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and compositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these observables in human natural languages.
