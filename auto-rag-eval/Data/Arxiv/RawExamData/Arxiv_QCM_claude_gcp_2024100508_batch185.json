In this paper, we analyze the principles and feasibility of the knowledge base paradigm in the context of an important class of applications: interactive configuration problems. In interactive configuration problems, a configuration of interrelated objects under constraints is searched, where the system assists the user in reaching an intended configuration. It is widely recognized in industry that good software solutions for these problems are very difficult to develop. We investigate such problems from the perspective of the KB paradigm. We show that multiple functionalities in this domain can be achieved by applying different forms of logical inferences on a formal specification of the configuration domain.

A natural requirement in this context is to ask for the information structure to be calibrated in the learning sense. With this constraint, the auction needs to rank the ads by a product of the bid and an unbiased estimator of the click-through rates, and the task of designing an optimal information structure is thus reduced to the task of designing an optimal unbiased estimator. We show that in a symmetric setting with uncertainty about the click-through rates, the optimal information structure attains both social efficiency and surplus extraction.

In many engineering applications the level of nonlinear distortions in frequency response function (FRF) measurements is quantified using specially designed periodic excitation signals called random phase multisines and periodic noise. The technique is based on the concept of the best linear approximation (BLA) and it allows one to check the validity of the linear framework with a simple experiment. Although the classical BLA theory can handle measurement noise only, in most applications the noise generated by the system -- called process noise -- is the dominant noise source. Therefore, there is a need to extend the existing BLA theory to the process noise case. In this paper we study in detail the impact of the process noise on the BLA of nonlinear continuous-time systems operating in a closed loop. It is shown that the existing nonparametric estimation methods for detecting and quantifying the level of nonlinear distortions in FRF measurements are still applicable in the presence of process noise. All results are also valid for discrete-time systems and systems operating in open loop."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Best Linear Approximation (BLA) theory for nonlinear continuous-time systems, which of the following statements is correct regarding the impact of process noise?\n\nA) Process noise invalidates the use of random phase multisines and periodic noise for quantifying nonlinear distortions in frequency response function measurements.\n\nB) The classical BLA theory adequately handles process noise, making extensions unnecessary for most engineering applications.\n\nC) The presence of process noise renders nonparametric estimation methods for detecting and quantifying nonlinear distortions ineffective.\n\nD) Existing nonparametric estimation methods for detecting and quantifying nonlinear distortions in FRF measurements remain applicable even in the presence of process noise.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

The documentation states that in a theory with \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9-inspired momentum-space geometry, simultaneously-emitted massless particles do not reach a distant detector simultaneously. This is due to the non-metric connection in the momentum space.

Thus are there three parts to the model: gambling theory, human decision making, and strategic problem solving.

Recent research has shown the potential of using available mobile fog devices (such as smartphones, drones, domestic and industrial robots) as relays to minimize communication outages between sensors and destination devices, where localized Internet-of-Things services (e.g., manufacturing process control, health and security monitoring) are delivered. However, these mobile relays deplete energy when they move and transmit to distant destinations. As such, power-control mechanisms and intelligent mobility of the relay devices are critical in improving communication performance and energy utilization. In this paper, we propose a Q-learning-based decentralized approach where each mobile fog relay agent (MFRA) is controlled by an autonomous agent which uses reinforcement learning to simultaneously improve communication performance and energy utilization. Each autonomous agent learns based on the feedback from the destination and its own energy levels whether to remain active and forward the message, or become passive for that transmission phase.
