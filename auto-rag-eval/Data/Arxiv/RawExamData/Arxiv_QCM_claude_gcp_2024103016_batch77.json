Greedy-GQ is an off-policy two timescale algorithm for optimal control in reinforcement learning.

Our finite-sample analysis provides theoretical justification for choosing stepsizes for this two timescale algorithm for faster convergence in practice, and suggests a trade-off between the convergence rate and the quality of the obtained policy. Our paper extends the finite-sample analyses of two timescale reinforcement learning algorithms from policy evaluation to optimal control, which is of more practical interest.

Previous approaches for ac driven circuits need to be extended to account for the driven bath modes.

Designing manufacturing processes with high yield and strong reliability relies on effective methods for rare event estimation. Genealogical importance splitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by iteratively selecting and replicating realizations that are headed towards a rare event. The replication step is difficult when applied to deterministic systems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be modified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to differentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this random perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing for others, preventing variance reduction in the probability estimate.

Our approach avoids the need for explicit regularisation in decentralised learning problems, such as adding constraints to the empirical risk minimisation rule. Particularly for distributed methods, the use of implicit regularisation allows the algorithm to remain simple, without projections or dual methods. To prove our results, we establish graph-independent generalisation bounds for Distributed SGD that match the centralised setting (using algorithmic stability), and we establish graph-dependent optimisation bounds that are of independent interest.

This review summarizes the theoretical background on quantum-mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such transitions to tiny changes in alpha and mu for a number of molecules which are usually observed in Galactic and extragalactic sources, and discusses the possibility of testing the space- and time-invariance of fundamental constants through comparison between precise laboratory measurements of the molecular rest frequencies and their astronomical counterparts.

In the first stage, the optimal tube path is determined by considering energy consumption, instant LoS link, and UAV speed/acceleration constraints. The second stage then refines this path to obtain an accurate RISoUAV trajectory by taking into account the communication channel performance and passive beamforming.

The thesis states that \"when the cusps have lengths > 2\u03c0, we can fill in the horocycle neighbourhoods and retain negative curvature.\" This condition is crucial for maintaining the hyperbolic structure of the surface during compactification.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \u03c0 is not the critical value mentioned in the text. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the lengths must be strictly greater than 2\u03c0, not equal to it. In fact, the document mentions that there exist curves arbitrarily close to horocycles of length 2\u03c0 that cannot be filled in while retaining negative curvature.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it contradicts the given information.

This paper investigates a full-duplex orthogonal-frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled wireless-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In this paper, a swarm of UAVs is first deployed in three dimensions (3D) to simultaneously charge all devices, i.e., a downlink (DL) charging period, and then flies to new locations within this area to collect information from scheduled devices in several epochs via OFDMA due to potential limited number of channels available in Narrow Band IoT, i.e., an uplink (UL) communication period.

Robust Optimization has traditionally taken a pessimistic, or worst-case viewpoint of uncertainty which is motivated by a desire to find sets of optimal policies that maintain feasibility under a variety of operating conditions.

Thermal inversions have long been predicted to exist in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. However, detection of two species thought to be responsible -- TiO and VO -- remain elusive.

No evidence for the presence of TiO or VO was found at the terminator of WASP-121b. By injecting signals into our data at varying abundance levels, we set rough detection limits of $[\\text{VO}] \\lesssim -7.9$ and $[\\text{TiO}] \\lesssim -9.3$. However, these detection limits are largely degenerate with scattering properties and the position of the cloud deck.
