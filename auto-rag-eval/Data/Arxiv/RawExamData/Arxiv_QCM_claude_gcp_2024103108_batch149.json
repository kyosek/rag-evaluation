Device fingerprints like sensor pattern noise (SPN) are widely used for provenance analysis and image authentication.

The flexibility of camera parameter settings and the emergence of multi-frame photography algorithms, especially high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, bring new challenges to device fingerprinting. The subsequent study on these topics requires a new purposefully built image dataset. In this paper, we present the Warwick Image Forensics Dataset, an image dataset of more than 58,600 images captured using 14 digital cameras with various exposure settings.

Gaseous detectors are widely used in high energy physics, and are attractive choices in tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography. Such detectors offer high resolution and high efficiency at reasonable cost for large sizes, however, one of the drawbacks is that the gaseous detection medium must be prevented from contamination by outside air or internal outgassing. Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such \"breathing\" effect can be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contamination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system with 0.9 square meter area, total volume of 160 l, has been operated for 36 days with a flow of 3 l/day, confirming that the buffer volume, in this case a 50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufficient gas quality.

The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all cases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors.

The model is a dynamical system of a function $f$, not of variables, having a self-reference term $f \\circ f$, introduced by recalling that operation in a biological system is often applied to itself, as is typically seen in rules in the natural language or genes. Starting from an inarticulate network, two types of fixed points are formed as an invariant structure with iterations. The function is folded with time, until it has finite or infinite piecewise-flat segments of fixed points, regarded as articulation. For an initial logistic map, attracted functions are classified into step, folded step, fractal, and random phases, according to the degree of folding. Oscillatory dynamics are also found, where function values are mapped to several fixed points periodically.

The documentation states that \"Starting from an inarticulate network, two types of fixed points are formed as an invariant structure with iterations. The function is folded with time, until it has finite or infinite piecewise-flat segments of fixed points, regarded as articulation.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the model doesn't always converge to a single fixed point. Instead, it can result in multiple fixed points and various outcomes including step, folded step, fractal, and random phases.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the model doesn't exclusively produce fractal outcomes.

Economic data are often generated by stochastic processes that take place in continuous time, though observations may occur only at discrete times. For example, electricity and gas consumption take place in continuous time. Data generated by a continuous time stochastic process are called functional data. This paper is concerned with comparing two or more stochastic processes that generate functional data. The data may be produced by a randomized experiment in which there are multiple treatments. The paper presents a method for testing the hypothesis that the same stochastic process generates all the functional data. The test described here applies to both functional data and multiple treatments. It is implemented as a combination of two permutation tests. This ensures that in finite samples, the true and nominal probabilities that each test rejects a correct null hypothesis are equal.

Part I of this two-part paper characterizes the ambiguity space of blind deconvolution and shows unidentifiability of this inverse problem for almost every pair of unconstrained input signals.

Columnar jointing is a fracture pattern common in igneous rocks in which cracks self-organize into a roughly hexagonal arrangement, leaving behind an ordered colonnade.

Using measurements of moisture density, evaporation rates, and fracture advance rates as evidence, we suggest an advective-diffusive system is responsible for the rough scaling behavior of columnar joints. This theory explains the order of magnitude difference in scales between jointing in lavas and in starches. We investigated the scaling of average columnar cross-sectional areas due to the evaporation rate, the analog of the cooling rate of igneous columnar joints. We measured column areas in experiments where the evaporation rate depended on lamp height and time, in experiments where the evaporation rate was fixed using feedback methods, and in experiments where gelatin was added to vary the rheology of the starch.
