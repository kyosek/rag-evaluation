The Case of Cellular Automata. The objective of this paper is analyzing to which extent the multiverse hypothesis provides a real explanation of the peculiarities of the laws and constants in our universe. First we argue in favor of the thesis that all multiverses except Tegmark's <<mathematical multiverse>> are too small to explain the fine tuning, so that they merely shift the problem up one level. But the <<mathematical multiverse>> is surely too large. To prove this assessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of complex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical multiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular Conway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong. But if the results of our experiments can be extrapolated to our universe, we should expect to inhabit -- in the context of the multiverse -- a world in which at least some of the laws and constants of nature should show a certain time dependence.

Classical approaches to experimental design assume that intervening on one unit does not affect other units. There are many important settings, however, where this non-interference assumption does not hold, as when running experiments on supply-side incentives on a ride-sharing platform or subsidies in an energy marketplace. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to experimental design in large-scale stochastic systems with considerable cross-unit interference, under an assumption that the interference is structured enough that it can be captured via mean-field modeling. Our approach enables us to accurately estimate the effect of small changes to system parameters by combining unobstrusive randomization with lightweight modeling, all while remaining in equilibrium. We can then use these estimates to optimize the system by gradient descent. Concretely, we focus on the problem of a platform that seeks to optimize supply-side payments p in a centralized marketplace where different suppliers interact via their effects on the overall supply-demand equilibrium, and show that our approach enables the platform to optimize p in large systems using vanishingly small perturbations."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of experimental design for large-scale stochastic systems with cross-unit interference, which of the following best describes the key innovation of the approach outlined in the paper?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for randomization in experimental design.\nB) It assumes complete independence between units in the system.\nC) It combines unobtrusive randomization with lightweight modeling while maintaining equilibrium.\nD) It focuses solely on demand-side interventions in marketplaces.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

We discuss certain specific features of the calculation of the critical temperature of a dilute repulsive Bose gas. Interactions modify the critical temperature in two different ways. First, for gases in traps, temperature shifts are introduced by a change of the density profile, arising itself from a modification of the equation of state of the gas (reduced compressibility); these shifts can be calculated simply within mean field theory. Second, even in the absence of a trapping potential (homogeneous gas in a box), temperature shifts are introduced by the interactions; they arise from the correlations introduced in the gas, and thus lie inherently beyond mean field theory - in fact, their evaluation requires more elaborate, non-perturbative, calculations. One illustration of this non-perturbative character is provided by the solution of self-consistent equations, which relate together non-linearly the various energy shifts of the single particle levels k. These equations predict that repulsive interactions shift the critical temperature (at constant density) by an amount which is positive, and simply proportional to the scattering length a; nevertheless, the numerical coefficient is difficult to compute.

An advection--diffusion-limited dissolution model of an object being eroded by a two-dimensional potential flow is presented. By taking advantage of the conformal invariance of the model, a numerical method is introduced that tracks the evolution of the object boundary in terms of a time-dependent Laurent series. Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink and then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a surprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a non-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent series coefficients describing the initial shape. This result is subsequently derived using residue calculus. The structure of the non-analytic function is examined for three different test cases, and a practical approach to determine the collapse point using a generalized Newton--Raphson root-finding algorithm is outlined.
