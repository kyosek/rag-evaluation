This paper focuses on wireless energy transfer (WET) to a pair of low complex energy receivers (ER), by only utilizing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values that are fed back from the ERs to the energy transmitter (ET). Selecting the beamformer that maximizes the total average energy transfer between the ET and the ERs, while satisfying a minimum harvested energy criterion at each ER, is studied. This is a nonconvex constrained optimization problem which is difficult to solve analytically. Also, any analytical solution to the problem should only consists of parameters that the ET knows, or the ET can estimate, as utilizing only RSSI feedback values for channel estimation prohibits estimating some channel parameters. Thus, the paper focuses on obtaining a suboptimal solution analytically. It is proven that if the channels between the ET and the ERs satisfy a certain sufficient condition, this solution is in fact optimal. Simulations show that the optimality gap is negligibly small as well. Insights into a system with more than two ERs are also presented.

We therefore develop a method for accurately estimating parameter uncertainty based on random walks in parameter space using adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo after the convergence of the main optimization algorithm. We apply our method to the spiking patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons recorded with multielectrode arrays in the human temporal cortex during the wake-sleep cycle.
