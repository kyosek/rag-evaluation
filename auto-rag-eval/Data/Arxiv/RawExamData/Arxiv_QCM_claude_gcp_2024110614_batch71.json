We are approaching a new era to probe the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signal from the period of cosmic dawn.

The EDGES collaboration has recently published the first results of the global 21-cm spectrum. We demonstrate that such a signal can be used to set, unlike most observations concerning dark matter, both lower and upper limits for the mass of dark matter particles.

We revisit the linear diffusion problem in such inclusions in order to identify the structure of the effective (average) inclusion response to a chemical load applied on the inclusion boundary. We identify a chemical creep function (similar to the creep function of viscoelasticity), from which we construct estimates with a reduced number of relaxation modes. The proposed estimates admit an equivalent representation based on a finite number of internal variables. These estimates allow us to predict the average inclusion response under arbitrary time-varying boundary conditions at very low computational cost. A heuristic generalisation to concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is also presented.

Mean opinion score (MOS) is a popular subjective metric to assess the quality of synthesized speech, and usually involves multiple human judges to evaluate each speech utterance. To reduce the labor cost in MOS test, multiple methods have been proposed to automatically predict MOS scores. To our knowledge, for a speech utterance, all previous works only used the average of multiple scores from different judges as the training target and discarded the score of each individual judge, which did not well exploit the precious MOS training data. In this paper, we propose MBNet, a MOS predictor with a mean subnet and a bias subnet to better utilize every judge score in MOS datasets, where the mean subnet is used to predict the mean score of each utterance similar to that in previous works, and the bias subnet to predict the bias score (the difference between the mean score and each individual judge score) and capture the personal preference of individual judges.

In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta.

Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to address this issue while maintaining the ability to estimate technical efficiency?\n\nA) Use instrumental variables regression without modifying the stochastic frontier model\nB) Apply the proposed maximum likelihood estimator with control functions and a folded normal distribution for inefficiency\nC) Implement a two-stage least squares approach followed by standard stochastic frontier analysis\nD) Utilize a Bayesian approach with non-informative priors for all parameters\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate approach is B) Apply the proposed maximum likelihood estimator with control functions and a folded normal distribution for inefficiency. This answer directly addresses the endogeneity issue while maintaining the stochastic frontier framework for estimating technical efficiency.\n\nThe documentation describes a novel method that generalizes the normal half-normal stochastic frontier model to account for endogeneity. This method uses control functions to capture the dependence between regressors and unobservables, assumes conditional independence of error components given the control functions, and models the conditional distribution of the stochastic inefficiency term as a folded normal distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because instrumental variables regression alone doesn't maintain the stochastic frontier structure necessary for estimating technical efficiency. Option C is problematic because a two-stage approach may not fully account for the endogeneity within the stochastic frontier framework. Option D, while potentially viable, is not specifically mentioned in the documentation and may not leverage the computational efficiency of the proposed maximum likelihood approach.\n\nThe correct approach (B) allows for consistent estimation of technical efficiency in the presence of endogeneity, as it integrates the control function approach within the maximum likelihood estimation framework. This method also provides a Battese-Coelli estimator of technical efficiency, making it particularly suitable for analyzing farmer productivity in developing countries, as mentioned in the empirical application to farmers in Nepal."}, "47": {"documentation": {"title": "Anomalous Hypercharge Axial Current And The Couplings Of The eta And f_1\n  (1420) Mesons To The Nucleon", "source": "S.

DNA sequences are fundamental for encoding genetic information. The genetic information may not only be understood by symbolic sequences but also from the hidden signals inside the sequences. The symbolic sequences need to be transformed into numerical sequences so the hidden signals can be revealed by signal processing techniques. All current transformation methods encode DNA sequences into numerical values of the same length.

The correct answer, C, is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. R_AA is a measure of particle suppression in heavy-ion collisions compared to pp collisions, with lower values indicating stronger suppression.\n2. The documentation mentions that the LHC collisions have an \"unprecedented energy density\" compared to RHIC, which suggests a denser medium.\n3.

The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term sex advantage have yielded little support.
