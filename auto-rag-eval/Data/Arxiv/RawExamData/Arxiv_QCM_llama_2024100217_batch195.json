Intracellular bidirectional transport of cargo on microtubule filaments is achieved by the collective action of oppositely directed dynein and kinesin motors. Experiments have found that in certain cases, inhibiting the activity of one type of motor results in an overall decline in the motility of the cellular cargo in both directions. This counter-intuitive observation, referred to as {\\em paradox of codependence} is inconsistent with the existing paradigm of a mechanistic tug-of-war between oppositely directed motors. Unlike kinesin, dynein motors exhibit catchbonding, wherein the unbinding rates of these motors decrease with increasing force on them. Incorporating this catchbonding behavior of dynein in a theoretical model, we show that the functional divergence of the two motors species manifests itself as an internal regulatory mechanism, and leads to codependent transport behaviour in biologically relevant regimes. Using analytical methods and stochastic simulations, we analyse the processivity characteristics and probability distribution of run times and pause times of transported cellular cargoes. We show that catchbonding can drastically alter the transport characteristics and also provide a plausible resolution of the paradox of codependence."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary mechanism by which the dynein motor's unbinding rate is affected in response to increasing force, and how does this mechanism contribute to the paradox of codependence in bidirectional transport of cellular cargo?\n\n**A)** The dynein motor's unbinding rate increases with increasing force, leading to a decrease in processivity and an increase in pause times.\n\n**B)** The dynein motor's unbinding rate decreases with increasing force, leading to a decrease in processivity and an increase in run times.\n\n**C)** The dynein motor's unbinding rate is unaffected by increasing force, resulting in a constant processivity and run time.\n\n**D)** The dynein motor's unbinding rate increases with increasing force, leading to an increase in processivity and a decrease in pause times.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The dynein motor's unbinding rate decreases with increasing force, leading to a decrease in processivity and an increase in run times.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is based on the concept of catchbonding, which states that the unbinding rates of dynein motors decrease with increasing force on them. This means that as the force on the dynein motor increases, its ability to unbind and move cargo decreases, leading to a decrease in processivity and an increase in run times. This mechanism is crucial in resolving the paradox of codependence, as it explains why inhibiting the activity of one type of motor can lead to a decline in the motility of cellular cargo in both directions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Low Dimensional Embedding of fMRI datasets", "source": "Xilin Shen and Fran\\c{c}ois G.
