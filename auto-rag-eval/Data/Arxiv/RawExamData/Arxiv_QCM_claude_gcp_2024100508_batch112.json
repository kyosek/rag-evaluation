In this paper a diffuse-interface model featuring phase change, transition to supercritical conditions, thermal conduction, compressibility effects and shock wave propagation is exploited to deal with the dynamics of a cavitation bubble. At variance with previous descriptions, the model is uniformly valid for all phases (liquid, vapor and supercritical) and phase transitions involved, allowing to describe the non-equilibrium processes ongoing during the collapse. As consequence of this unitary description, rather unexpectedly for pure vapor bubbles, the numerical experiments show that the collapse is accompanied by the emission of a strong shock wave in the liquid and by the oscillation of the bubble that periodically disappears and reappears, due to transition to super/sub critical conditions. The mechanism of shock wave formation is strongly related to the transition of the vapor to supercritical state, with a progressive steepening of the compression wave to form the shock which is eventually reflected as an outward propagating wave in the liquid."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key findings and novel aspects of the diffuse-interface model for vapor nano-bubble collapse as presented in the paper?\n\nA) The model shows that pure vapor bubbles collapse without any shock wave formation or oscillations.\n\nB) The model demonstrates that the bubble collapse is accompanied by a weak shock wave in the vapor phase only.\n\nC) The model reveals that the collapse involves a strong shock wave in the liquid and periodic bubble oscillations due to super/sub critical transitions.\n\nD) The model indicates that thermal conduction is the primary driver of shock wave formation during bubble collapse.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the paper describes several key findings that align with this option:\n\n1.

This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify.

Automatic segmentation methods are an important advancement in medical image analysis. Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss functions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their robustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence. The most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose the Unified Focal loss, a new hierarchical framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based losses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on five publicly available, class imbalanced medical imaging datasets: CVC-ClinicDB, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19).

The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the information provided in the passage. The GDF is described as showing a \"leveling off and partial recovery of ENAs,\" which is attributed to changes in solar wind output.

Dynamical models of cognition play an increasingly important role in driving theoretical and experimental research in psychology.

Using hierarchical models inference is even possible for individual observers. Furthermore, our likelihood approach can be used to compare different models.

Humanoid robot reasoning about the feasibility of lifting\n  a heavy box with unknown physical properties. A robot cannot lift up an object if it is not feasible to do so. However, in most research on robot lifting, \"feasibility\" is usually presumed to exist a priori. This paper proposes a three-step method for a humanoid robot to reason about the feasibility of lifting a heavy box with physical properties that are unknown to the robot. Since feasibility of lifting is directly related to the physical properties of the box, we first discretize a range for the unknown values of parameters describing these properties and tabulate all valid optimal quasi-static lifting trajectories generated by simulations over all combinations of indices. Second, a physical-interaction-based algorithm is introduced to identify the robust gripping position and physical parameters corresponding to the box. During this process, the stability and safety of the robot are ensured. On the basis of the above two steps, a third step of mapping operation is carried out to best match the estimated parameters to the indices in the table. The matched indices are then queried to determine whether a valid trajectory exists. If so, the lifting motion is feasible; otherwise, the robot decides that the task is beyond its capability.

In the present study, as first step, the continuous-time autonomous system proposed by Khoury, Myerscoug and Barron (KMB) in 2011 was approximated by means a Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme in order to obtain a set of autonomous difference equations. Subsequently, with the aim to introduce the seasonal effects, a nonautonomous version (NAKMB) was proposed and formulated in discrete-time domain via a NSFD scheme, by introducing a time-dependent formulation for the queen bee laying rate and the recruitment rate coefficients. By means the phase-plane analysis was possible to deduce that, with an appropriate choice of the parameters, the NAKMB model admits both a limit cycle at nonzero population size and an equilibrium point marking the colony collapse, depending on the initial population size."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and findings of the nonautonomous Khoury, Myerscoug and Barron (NAKMB) model for honey bee population dynamics?\n\nA) It introduces a continuous-time model that accounts for nest temperature fluctuations and their impact on colony size.\n\nB) It demonstrates that honey bee populations always converge to a stable equilibrium regardless of initial population size.\n\nC) It uses a Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme to create a discrete-time model with time-dependent queen laying and recruitment rates, showing the possibility of both limit cycles and colony collapse depending on initial population.\n\nD) It proves that environmental temperature is the sole determining factor in honey bee colony survival.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the key elements and findings of the NAKMB model as described in the document. The model uses an NSFD scheme to create a discrete-time version of the original KMB model, introduces time-dependent (seasonal) effects through the queen laying and recruitment rates, and demonstrates that the model can produce both limit cycles (sustained oscillations in population) and colony collapse, depending on the initial population size. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the model does consider temperature effects, it is not a continuous-time model but rather a discrete-time approximation. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the model actually shows two possible outcomes (limit cycle or collapse) rather than always converging to a stable equilibrium. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while environmental temperature is important, it's not presented as the sole determining factor; the model also considers factors like colony size and its effect on nest temperature regulation."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Localization of multilayer networks by the optimized single-layer\n  rewiring", "source": "Sarika Jalan and Priodyuti Pradhan", "docs_id": "1712.04829", "section": ["eess.SP", "nlin.AO", "physics.soc-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Localization of multilayer networks by the optimized single-layer\n  rewiring.
