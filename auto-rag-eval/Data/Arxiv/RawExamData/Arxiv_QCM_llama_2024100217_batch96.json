We address the problem of diversification in religions by studying selection on cultural memes that colonize humans hosts. In analogy to studying the evolution of pathogens or symbionts colonizing animal hosts, we use models for host-pathogen dynamics known from theoretical epidemiology. In these models, religious memes colonize individual humans. Rates of transmission of memes between humans, i.e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of memes (loss of faith) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural memes, and by interactions between hosts carrying different memes. In particular, based on the notion that religion can lead to oppression of lower classes once a religious society has reached a certain size, we assume that the rate of loss increases as the number of humans colonized by a particular meme phenotype increases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural memes, and we use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can generate the emergence of coexisting clusters of different meme types.

Strongly overlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price movements of the underlying financial assets.

Proton decay constraints require the new multiplet to be both color and electroweak charged, which prompts us to include a new confining SU(3) gauge group that binds the multiplet into a neutral composite dark matter candidate. Current direct detection constraints are evaded due to the large dark matter mass; meanwhile, next-generation direct detection and proton decay experiments will probe much of the parameter space.

Model-reduction techniques aim to reduce the computational complexity of simulating dynamical systems by applying a (Petrov-)Galerkin projection process that enforces the dynamics to evolve in a low-dimensional subspace of the original state space. Frequently, the resulting reduced-order model (ROM) violates intrinsic physical properties of the original full-order model (FOM) (e.g., global conservation, Lagrangian structure, state-variable bounds) because the projection process does not generally ensure preservation of these properties. However, in many applications, ensuring the ROM preserves such intrinsic properties can enable the ROM to retain physical meaning and lead to improved accuracy and stability properties. In this work, we present a general constrained-optimization formulation for projection-based model reduction that can be used as a template to enforce the ROM to satisfy specific properties on the kinematics and dynamics.

When the number of perturbing bodies is large and many $v_{\\infty}$ levels are considered, the identification of all the possible sequences of encounters through the visual inspection of the TG becomes a laborious task. Besides, if the sequences are used as input for a numerical code for trajectory design and optimization, an automated examination of the TG is desirable. This contribution describes an automatic technique to explore the TG and find all the encounter paths. The technique is based on a tree search method, and the intersections between contours are found using the regula-falsi scheme. The method is validated through comparisons with solutions available in the open literature.

Solids with competing interactions often undergo complex phase transitions with a variety of long-periodic modulations. Among such transition, devil's staircase is the most complex phenomenon, and for it, CeSb is the most famous material, where a number of the distinct phases with long-periodic magnetostructures sequentially appear below the Neel temperature. An evolution of the low-energy electronic structure going through the devil's staircase is of special interest, which has, however, been elusive so far despite the 40-years of intense researches. Here we use bulk-sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and reveal the devil's staircase transition of the electronic structures. The magnetic reconstruction dramatically alters the band dispersions at each transition. We moreover find that the well-defined band picture largely collapses around the Fermi energy under the long-periodic modulation of the transitional phase, while it recovers at the transition into the lowest-temperature ground state.

In the heterogeneous stratification, when IGW propagate towards stronger stratification, the maximal flux Richardson number decreases with increasing wave energy, reaches zero and then becomes negative.

As a result, estimates of the star formation rate (from the GRB rate) at high redshifts may be diminished if this effect is not taken into account. In this paper, we estimate the star formation rate (SFR) using the observed GRB rate, accounting for an evolving jet opening angle.
