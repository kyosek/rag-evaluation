The perceived toxicity of language can vary based on someone's identity and beliefs, but this variation is often ignored when collecting toxic language datasets, resulting in dataset and model biases. We seek to understand the who, why, and what behind biases in toxicity annotations. In two online studies with demographically and politically diverse participants, we investigate the effect of annotator identities (who) and beliefs (why), drawing from social psychology research about hate speech, free speech, racist beliefs, political leaning, and more. We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system's ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives.

Compressed Sensing (CS) seeks to recover an unknown vector with $N$ entries by making far fewer than $N$ measurements; it posits that the number of compressed sensing measurements should be comparable to the information content of the vector, not simply $N$. CS combines the important task of compression directly with the measurement task. Since its introduction in 2004 there have been hundreds of manuscripts on CS, a large fraction of which develop algorithms to recover a signal from its compressed measurements. Because of the paradoxical nature of CS -- exact reconstruction from seemingly undersampled measurements -- it is crucial for acceptance of an algorithm that rigorous analyses verify the degree of undersampling the algorithm permits. The Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) has become the dominant tool used for the analysis in such cases. We present here an asymmetric form of RIP which gives tighter bounds than the usual symmetric one. We give the best known bounds on the RIP constants for matrices from the Gaussian ensemble. Our derivations illustrate the way in which the combinatorial nature of CS is controlled.

The sc-CNMF method extends conventional CNMF by adding two new modules: a neural enhancing module to address miniscope-specific limitations, and a seeds cleansing module that uses LSTM to select and cleanse the set of seeds for detecting regions-of-interest. This combination of modules is the key innovation that allows sc-CNMF to achieve superior performance in analyzing miniscope calcium imaging data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because single-photon based imaging is actually a limitation of miniscope imaging that results in high background and low signal-to-noise ratio. The sc-CNMF method aims to overcome these limitations, not cause them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because sc-CNMF extends conventional CNMF rather than replacing it entirely. It builds upon the existing CNMF framework by adding new modules.\n\nOption D is too narrow in scope.

It focuses on accurately identifying activated neurons and extracting calcium signals, which involves multiple steps beyond just background subtraction."}, "33": {"documentation": {"title": "Haptic Feedback Improves Human-Robot Agreement and User Satisfaction in\n  Shared-Autonomy Teleoperation", "source": "Dawei Zhang, Roberto Tron, Rebecca P.Khurshid", "docs_id": "2103.03453", "section": ["cs.RO", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Haptic Feedback Improves Human-Robot Agreement and User Satisfaction in\n  Shared-Autonomy Teleoperation.

This work addresses the question of whether it is possible to define simple pair-wise interaction terms to approximate free energies of proteins or polymers. Rather than ask how reliable a potential of mean force is, one can ask how reliable it could possibly be. In a two-dimensional, infinite lattice model system one can calculate exact free energies by exhaustive enumeration. A series of approximations were fitted to exact results to assess the feasibility and utility of pair-wise free energy terms. Approximating the true free energy with pair-wise interactions gives a poor fit with little transferability between systems of different size. Adding extra artificial terms to the approximation yields better fits, but does not improve the ability to generalise from one system size to another.

Technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitate digital contents such as images being acquired in a massive way.

In this paper, we propose a general deep neural network (DNN) based watermarking method to fulfill this goal. Instead of training a neural network for protecting a specific image, we train on an image set and use the trained model to protect a distinct test image set in a bulk manner. Respective evaluations both from the subjective and objective aspects confirm the supremacy and practicability of our proposed method. To demonstrate the robustness of this general neural watermarking mechanism, commonly used manipulations are applied to the watermarked image to examine the corresponding extracted watermark, which still retains sufficient recognizable traits.

This is innovative because it's a general approach, not limited to protecting a single specific image (ruling out A). It's not merely applying deep learning to existing techniques (ruling out B), but rather proposing a new methodology. The paper mentions both subjective and objective evaluations (ruling out D).
