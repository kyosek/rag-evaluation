The probability-scale residual (PSR) is well defined across a wide variety of variable types and models, making it useful for studies of HIV/AIDS.

As a residual, it can be useful for model diagnostics; we demonstrate its use with ordered categorical data and semiparametric transformation models. The PSR can also be used to construct tests of residual correlation. In fact, partial Spearman's rank correlation between $X$ and $Y$ while adjusting for covariates $Z$ can be constructed as the correlation between PSRs from models of $Y$ on $Z$ and of $X$ on $Z$.

In this paper we have investigated the effects of sintering time and temperature on the formation and critical current densities of Fe-clad MgB2 wires. MgB2 wires were fabricated using the powder-in-tube process and sintered for different periods of time at predetermined temperatures. All the samples were examined using XRD, SEM and magnetisation measurements. In contrast to the common practice of sintering for several hours, the present results show that there is no need for prolonged heat treatment in the fabrication of Fe-clad MgB2 wires.

Jc of 4.5 times 10 ^5 A/cm2 in zero field and above 10 ^5 A/cm2 in 2T at 15 K has been achieved for the best Fe-clad MgB2 wires.

This agrees with previous work on strength function moments. Using this modified hypothesis, we can tackle strength functions at previously intractable initial energies, using semi-converged initial states at arbitrary excitation energy.

Time-varying parameter (TVP) models often assume that the TVPs evolve according to a random walk. This assumption, however, might be questionable since it implies that coefficients change smoothly and in an unbounded manner. In this paper, we relax this assumption by proposing a flexible law of motion for the TVPs in large-scale vector autoregressions (VARs). Instead of imposing a restrictive random walk evolution of the latent states, we carefully design hierarchical mixture priors on the coefficients in the state equation. These priors effectively allow for discriminating between periods where coefficients evolve according to a random walk and times where the TVPs are better characterized by a stationary stochastic process. Moreover, this approach is capable of introducing dynamic sparsity by pushing small parameter changes towards zero if necessary. The merits of the model are illustrated by means of two applications.
