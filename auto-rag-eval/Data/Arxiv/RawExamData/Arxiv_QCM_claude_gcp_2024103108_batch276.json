Using the fact that the conformal spacetime admits conformal Killing vector and the horizon is determined by the vanishing of the norm of it, the diffemorphisms are obtained which keep the near horizon structure invariant. The Noether charge and a bracket among them corresponding to these vectors are calculated in this region.

In this paper we consider a mathematical model of RNAi with particular emphasis on time delays associated with two aspects of primed amplification: binding of siRNA to aberrant RNA, and binding of siRNA to mRNA, both of which result in the expanded production of dsRNA responsible for RNA silencing. Analytical and numerical stability analyses are performed to identify regions of stability of different steady states and to determine conditions on parameters that lead to instability.

We present a quantitative analysis of the reversibility properties of classically chaotic quantum motion.

This complexity is characterized by the number ${\\cal M}(t)$ of harmonics of the (initially isotropic, i.e. ${\\cal M}(0)=0$) Wigner function, which are generated during quantum evolution for the time $t$. We show that, in contrast to the classical exponential increase, this number can grow not faster than linearly and then relate this fact with the degree of reversibility of the quantum motion. To explore the reversibility we reverse the quantum evolution at some moment $T$ immediately after applying at this moment an instant perturbation governed by a strength parameter $\\xi$.

In this paper, we consider the problem of parameter sensitivity in models of complex dynamical systems through the lens of information geometry. We calculate the sensitivity of model behavior to variations in parameters. In most cases, models are sloppy, that is, exhibit an exponential hierarchy of parameter sensitivities. We propose a parameter classification scheme based on how the sensitivities scale at long observation times. We show that for oscillatory models, either with a limit cycle or a strange attractor, sensitivities can become arbitrarily large, which implies a high effective-dimensionality on the model manifold. Sloppy models with a single fixed point have model manifolds with low effective-dimensionality, previously described as a \"hyper-ribbon\". In contrast, models with high effective dimensionality translate into multimodal fitting problems. We define a measure of curvature on the model manifold which we call the \\emph{winding frequency} that estimates the linear density of local minima in the model's parameter space. We then show how alternative choices of fitting metrics can \"unwind\" the model manifold and give low winding frequencies.
