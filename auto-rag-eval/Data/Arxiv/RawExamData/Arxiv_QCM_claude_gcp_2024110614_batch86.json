Recent progress in genetic techniques has shed light on the complex co-evolution of malignant cell clones in leukemias. However, several aspects of clonal selection still remain unclear. In this paper, we present a multi-compartmental continuously structured population model of selection dynamics in acute leukemias, which consists of a system of coupled integro-differential equations. Our model can be analysed in a more efficient way than classical models formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations. Exploiting the analytical tractability of this model, we investigate how clonal selection is shaped by the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of leukemic cells at different maturation stages. We integrate analytical results with numerical solutions of a calibrated version of the model based on real patient data. In summary, our mathematical results formalise the biological notion that clonal selection is driven by the self-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells and the clones that possess the highest value of this parameter are ultimately selected. Moreover, we demonstrate that the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of non-stem cells do not have a substantial impact on clonal selection.

This paper addresses this question and proposes a new methodology to estimate the correlation matrix which doesn't depend on the chosen sample period.

The colors range from neutral to light red, and like the Jovian and the Saturnian irregulars (Grav et al. 2003) there is an apparent lack of the extremely red objects found among the Centaurs and Kuiper belt objects. The Uranian irregulars can be divided into three possible dynamical families, but the colors collected show that two of these dynamical families, the Caliban and Sycorax-clusters, have heterogeneous colors. Of the third possible family, the 168-degree cluster containing two objects with similar average inclinations but quite different average semi-major axis, only one object (U XXI Trinculo) was observed. The heterogeneous colors and the large dispersion of the average orbital elements leads us to doubt that they are collisional families. We favor single captures as a more likely scenario.

If we combine all past and new data it can easily become intractable to retrain the neural network model.

The documentation states that \"if the decay of the Higgs boson to \u03c7 is kinematically allowed, then this branching ratio is largely determined.\" With \u03c7 having a mass of 60 GeV, it's below the Higgs boson mass (~125 GeV), making this decay kinematically possible.\n\n3.

The input model is usually estimated using a finite amount of data, which introduces the so-called input model uncertainty to the simulation output. How to quantify input uncertainty has been studied extensively, and many methods have been proposed for the batch data setting, i.e., when all the data are available at once.

All the proteomic analyses including peptide/protein identification and quantification, differential expression analysis, biomarker discovery and so on are all based on the matching of mass spectra with peptide sequences, which is significantly influenced by the quality of the spectra, such as the peak numbers, noisy peaks, signal-to-noise ratios, etc. Hence, it is crucial to assess the quality of the spectra in order for filtering and/or post-processing after identification. The handcrafted features representing spectra quality, however, need human expertise to design and are difficult to optimize, and thus the existing assessing algorithms are still lacking in accuracy.
