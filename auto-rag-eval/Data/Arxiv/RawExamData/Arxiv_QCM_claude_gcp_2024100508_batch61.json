Travellers in autonomous vehicles (AVs) need not to walk to the destination any more after parking like those in conventional human-driven vehicles (HVs). Instead, they can drop off directly at the destination and AVs can cruise for parking autonomously. It is a revolutionary change that such parking autonomy of AVs may increase the potential parking span substantially and affect the spatial parking equilibrium. Given this, from urban planners' perspective, it is of great necessity to reconsider the planning of parking supply along the city. To this end, this paper is the first to examine the spatial parking equilibrium considering the mix of AVs and HVs with parking cruising effect. It is found that the equilibrium solution of travellers' parking location choices can be biased due to the ignorance of cruising effects. On top of that, the optimal parking span of AVs at given parking supply should be no less than that at equilibrium. Besides, the optimal parking planning to minimize the total parking cost is also explored in a bi-level parking planning design problem (PPDP). While the optimal differentiated pricing allows the system to achieve optimal parking distribution, this study suggests that it is beneficial to encourage AVs to cruise further to park by reserving less than enough parking areas for AVs."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a city with mixed autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), which of the following strategies would most likely optimize parking efficiency according to the study?\n\nA) Allocating equal parking spaces for AVs and HVs throughout the city\nB) Implementing a uniform pricing structure for all parking spaces regardless of vehicle type\nC) Providing abundant nearby parking for AVs to minimize their cruising distance\nD) Encouraging AVs to park further away by limiting their dedicated parking spaces\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The study suggests that it is beneficial to encourage AVs to cruise further to park by reserving less than enough parking areas for AVs. This approach takes advantage of AVs' ability to park autonomously without inconveniencing their passengers, who can be dropped off at their destination. By encouraging AVs to use parking spaces further away, it allows for more efficient use of parking resources in high-demand areas, potentially reducing overall parking costs and improving urban space utilization. The study also notes that the optimal parking span for AVs should be no less than that at equilibrium, further supporting the idea of having AVs park at greater distances.

Masking due to residual foregrounds, or availability of partial sky due to survey limitation, are unavoidable circumstances in CMB studies. But, masking induces additional correlations, and thus complicates the recovery of such signals. In this work, we discuss a procedure based on bipolar spherical harmonic (BipoSH) formalism to comprehensively addresses any spurious correlations induced by masking and successfully recover hidden signals of anisotropy in observed CMB maps. This method is generic, and can be applied to recover a variety of isotropy violating phenomena.

In this study, we investigate joint long-term cache allocation and short-term content delivery in cloud small cell networks (C-SCNs), where multiple smallcell BSs (SBSs) are connected to the central processor via fronthaul and can store popular contents so as to reduce the duplicated transmissions in networks.

The resultant mixed timescale design problem is an anticausal problem because the optimal cache allocation depends on the future file requests. To handle it, a two-stage optimization scheme is proposed by utilizing historical knowledge of users' requests and channel state information.

Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms.

The $N=Z=40$ self-conjugate nucleus $^{80}$Zr is of particular interest as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed.

During the last decade of network research focusing on structural and dynamical properties of networks, the role of network users has been more or less underestimated from the bird's-eye view of global perspective. In this era of global positioning system equipped smartphones, however, a user's ability to access local geometric information and find efficient pathways on networks plays a crucial role, rather than the globally optimal pathways. We present a simple greedy spatial navigation strategy as a probe to explore spatial networks. These greedy navigators use directional information in every move they take, without being trapped in a dead end based on their memory about previous routes. We suggest that the centralities measures have to be modified to incorporate the navigators' behavior, and present the intriguing effect of navigators' greediness where removing some edges may actually enhance the routing efficiency, which is reminiscent of Braess's paradox. In addition, using samples of road structures in large cities around the world, it is shown that the navigability measure we define reflects unique structural properties, which are not easy to predict from other topological characteristics.

Implementing two-qubit gates via strong coupling between quantum-dot qubits and a superconducting microwave cavity requires achieving coupling rates that are much faster than decoherence rates. Typically, this involves tuning the qubit either to a sweet spot, where it is relatively insensitive to charge noise, or to a point where it is resonant with the microwave cavity. Unfortunately, such operating points seldom coincide. Here, we theoretically investigate several schemes for performing gates between two quantum-dot hybrid qubits, mediated by a microwave cavity. The rich physics of the quantum dot hybrid qubit gives rise to two types of sweet spots, which can occur at operating points with strong charge dipole moments. Such strong interactions provide new opportunities for off-resonant gating, thereby removing one of the main obstacles for long-distance two-qubit gates.
