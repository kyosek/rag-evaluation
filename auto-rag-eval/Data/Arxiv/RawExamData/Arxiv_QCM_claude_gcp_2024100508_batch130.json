In this work we present a theoretical and numerical study of the behaviour of the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a generic coupled-map-lattice in the weak-coupling regime. We explain the observed results by introducing a suitable continuous-time formulation of the tangent dynamics. The first general result is that the deviation of the Lyapunov exponent from the uncoupled-limit limit is function of a single scaling parameter which, in the case of strictly positive multipliers, is the ratio of the coupling strength with the variance of local multipliers. Moreover, we find an approximate analytic expression for the Lyapunov exponent by mapping the problem onto the evolution of a chain of nonlinear Langevin equations, which are eventually reduced to a single stochastic equation. The probability distribution of this dynamical equation provides an excellent description for the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent. Furthermore, multipliers with random signs are considered as well, finding that the Lyapunov exponent still depends on a single scaling parameter, which however has a different expression."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the study of the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a generic coupled-map-lattice in the weak-coupling regime, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The deviation of the Lyapunov exponent from the uncoupled-limit is a function of multiple scaling parameters, regardless of the nature of the multipliers.\n\nB) For strictly positive multipliers, the scaling parameter is the product of the coupling strength and the variance of local multipliers.\n\nC) The problem can be mapped onto the evolution of a chain of linear Langevin equations, which are reduced to a single deterministic equation.\n\nD) In the case of multipliers with random signs, the Lyapunov exponent depends on a single scaling parameter, but its expression differs from that of strictly positive multipliers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

We rigorously investigate the influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature. It is shown that the HEOM in real time obtained when we include the system-bath coherence of the initial thermal equilibrium state possess the same form as those obtained from a factorized initial state.

We find that informed traders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges, traders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak signals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on price discovery.
