The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is the central hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is scheduled to undergo a major upgrade, in 2022, for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The ATLAS upgrade program for high luminosity is split into three phases: Phase-0 occurred during $2013-2014$ and prepared the LHC for Run 2; Phase-I, foreseen for 2019, will prepare the LHC for Run 3, whereafter the peak luminosity reaches $2-3 \\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{2}s^{-1}$; finally, Phase-II, which is foreseen for 2024, will prepare the collider for the HL-LHC operation ($5-7 \\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{2}s^{-1}$). The TileCal main activities for Phase-0 were the installation of the new low voltage power supplies and the activation of the TileCal third layer signal for assisting the muon trigger at $1.0<|\\eta|<1.3$ (TileMuon Project). In Phase-II, a major upgrade in the TileCal readout electronics is planned. Except for the photomultipliers tubes (PMTs), most of the on- and off-detector electronics will be replaced, with the aim of digitizing all PMT pulses at the front-end level.

Networks are widely used to model the contact structure within a population and in the resulting models of disease spread. While networks provide a high degree of realism, the analysis of the exact model is out of reach and even numerical methods fail for modest network size. Hence, mean-field models (e.g. pairwise) focusing on describing the evolution of some summary statistics from the exact model gained a lot of traction over the last few decades. In this paper we revisit the problem of deriving triple closures for pairwise models and we investigate in detail the assumptions behind some of the well-known closures as well as their validity. Using a top-down approach we start at the level of the entire graph and work down to the level of triples and combine this with information around nodes and pairs. We use our approach to derive many of the existing closures and propose new ones and theoretically connect the two well-studied models of multinomial link and Poisson link selection.

Decision-theoretic planning is a popular approach to sequential decision making problems, because it treats uncertainty in sensing and acting in a principled way. In single-agent frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs, planning can be carried out by resorting to Q-value functions: an optimal Q-value function Q* is computed in a recursive manner by dynamic programming, and then an optimal policy is extracted from Q*. In this paper we study whether similar Q-value functions can be defined for decentralized POMDP models (Dec-POMDPs), and how policies can be extracted from such value functions. We define two forms of the optimal Q-value function for Dec-POMDPs: one that gives a normative description as the Q-value function of an optimal pure joint policy and another one that is sequentially rational and thus gives a recipe for computation. This computation, however, is infeasible for all but the smallest problems. Therefore, we analyze various approximate Q-value functions that allow for efficient computation.
