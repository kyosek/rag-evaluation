Logic synthesis is a challenging and widely-researched combinatorial optimization problem during integrated circuit (IC) design.

Spurred by the success of ML in solving combinatorial and graph problems in other domains, there is growing interest in the design of ML-guided logic synthesis tools. Yet, there are no standard datasets or prototypical learning tasks defined for this problem domain.

They should realize that this eliminates any credibility to their numerical methods and therefore also to their new analysis, in which they consider many algorithms [2]. Since by their own admission the best algorithm is the Fitness one, their new claim became that the search for the best algorithm is pointless and all algorithms are alike. This is exactly the opposite of what they claimed a few days ago and it does not deserve much comments.
