In this contribution we introduce a new strategy for the compensation of plasmonic losses based on a recently proposed nonlinear mechanism: the resonant interaction between surface plasmon polaritons and spatial solitons propagating in parallel along a metal/dielectric/Kerr structure. This mechanism naturally leads to the generation of a quasi-particle excitation, the so-called soliplasmon resonance. We analyze the role played by the effective nonlinear coupling inherent to this system and how this can be used to provide a new mechanism of quasi-resonant nonlinear excitation of surface plasmon polaritons. We will pay particular attention to the introduction of asymmetric linear gain in the Kerr medium. The unique combination of nonlinear propagation, nonlinear coupling and gain give rise to a new scenario for the excitation of long- range surface plasmon polaritons with distinguishing characteristics.

For metallic (e.g. Fe on Pb) or semiconducting (e.g. InSb on Nb) nanowires, the renormalization effect is found to be very strong and weak respectively because the transverse confinement size in the two situations happens to be 0.5nm (metallic nanowire) and 20nm (semiconducting nanowire). Thus, the Majorana localization length could be very short (long) for metallic (semiconducting) nanowires even for the same values of all other parameters (except for the transverse wire size). We also show that any tunneling conductance measurements in such nanowires, carried out at temperatures and/or energy resolutions comparable to the induced superconducting energy gap, cannot distinguish between the existence of the Majorana modes or ordinary subgap fermionic states since both produce very similar broad and weak peaks in the subgap tunneling conductance independent of the localization length involved.

For multi-cell scenarios, a so-called load-coupling model has been proposed to characterize the presence of mutual interference for NOMA, and resource optimization relies on the use of fixed-point iterations [1], [2] across cells. One difficulty here is that the order of decoding for successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA is generally not known a priori. This is because the decoding order in one cell depends on interference, which, in turn, is governed by resource allocation in other cells, and vice versa.

Hyper-parameter optimization is crucial for pushing the accuracy of a deep learning model to its limits. A hyper-parameter optimization job, referred to as a study, involves numerous trials of training a model using different training knobs, and therefore is very computation-heavy, typically taking hours and days to finish. We observe that trials issued from hyper-parameter optimization algorithms often share common hyper-parameter sequence prefixes. Based on this observation, we propose Hippo, a hyper-parameter optimization system that removes redundancy in the training process to reduce the overall amount of computation significantly. Instead of executing each trial independently as in existing hyper-parameter optimization systems, Hippo breaks down the hyper-parameter sequences into stages and merges common stages to form a tree of stages (called a stage-tree), then executes a stage once per tree on a distributed GPU server environment. Hippo is applicable to not only single studies, but multi-study scenarios as well, where multiple studies of the same model and search space can be formulated as trees of stages.
