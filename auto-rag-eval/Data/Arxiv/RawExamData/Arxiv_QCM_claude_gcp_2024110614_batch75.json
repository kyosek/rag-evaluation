Many real-world time series exhibit multiple seasonality with different lengths. The removal of seasonal components is crucial in numerous applications of time series, including forecasting and anomaly detection.

Thus, existing seasonal-trend decomposition algorithms can be applied directly to obtain the rough estimates of trend and the seasonal component corresponding to the longer periodic length.

Practical problems with missing data are common, and statistical methods have been developed concerning the validity and/or efficiency of statistical procedures. On a central focus, there have been longstanding interests on the mechanism governing data missingness, and correctly deciding the appropriate mechanism is crucially relevant for conducting proper practical investigations. The conventional notions include the three common potential classes -- missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. In this paper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between missing at random and missing not at random. Since the potential alternatives of missing at random are broad, we focus our investigation on a general class of models with instrumental variables for data missing not at random. Our setting is broadly applicable, thanks to that the model concerning the missing data is nonparametric, requiring no explicit model specification for the data missingness. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy measures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when missing at random does not hold.

In this paper, we aim to bridge GNN to lifelong learning by converting a graph problem to a regular learning problem, so that GNN can inherit the lifelong learning techniques developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this end, we propose a new graph topology based on feature cross-correlation, namely, the feature graph. It takes features as new nodes and turns nodes into independent graphs.

All three set-ups had high ratio of width of the region available for flow to radius of curvature of the streamlines.

Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to capture the nuanced effects of explanatory variables across different quantiles while accounting for censoring and data characteristics?\n\nA) Classic tobit model with log-transformed dependent variable\nB) Quantile regression without accounting for censoring\nC) Log-symmetric quantile tobit model\nD) Ordinary least squares regression with robust standard errors\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The log-symmetric quantile tobit model is the most appropriate choice for this scenario. This model addresses several key aspects of the data and analysis requirements:\n\n1. Positive skewness: The documentation states that the classic tobit model assumes normality and is not recommended for cases with positive skewness. The log-symmetric quantile tobit model can handle positively skewed data.\n\n2. Heteroscedasticity: The proposed model can accommodate heteroscedasticity, which is mentioned as a characteristic of the data.\n\n3. Censoring: As a tobit model, it accounts for censored data, which is crucial in labor supply analysis where there may be a significant number of zero observations.\n\n4. Quantile analysis: The model allows for studying the influence of explanatory variables at different quantiles, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships across the distribution.\n\n5. Better fit: The documentation indicates that this model showed a better fit than the classic tobit model in the analysis of female labor supply data.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while log-transformation might help with skewness, the classic tobit model doesn't allow for quantile analysis or necessarily address heteroscedasticity.\n\nOption B fails to account for censoring, which is a crucial aspect of labor supply data analysis.\n\nOption D doesn't address censoring or allow for quantile analysis, and while robust standard errors might help with heteroscedasticity, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of the data characteristics described.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about model selection based on data characteristics and analysis goals."}, "64": {"documentation": {"title": "Stock Market Market Crash of 2008: an empirical study of the deviation\n  of share prices from company fundamentals", "source": "Taisei Kaizoji and Michiko Miyano", "docs_id": "1607.03205", "section": ["q-fin.GN", "q-fin.PR", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.ST"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Stock Market Market Crash of 2008: an empirical study of the deviation\n  of share prices from company fundamentals.

We develop a panel regression model using three financial indicators--dividends per share, cash flow per share, and book value per share--as explanatory variables for share price. We then estimate individual company fundamentals for each year by removing the time fixed effects from the two-way fixed effects model, which we identified as the best of the panel regression models. One merit of our model is that we are able to extract unobservable factors of company fundamentals by using the individual fixed effects. Based on these results, we analyze the market anomaly quantitatively using the divergence rate--the rate of the deviation of share price from a company's fundamentals. We find that share prices on average were overvalued in the period from 2005 to 2007, and were undervalued significantly in 2008, when the global financial crisis occurred.

Bacterial flagellar motor is one of the most complex and sophisticated nano machineries in nature. A duty ratio $D$ is a fraction of time that the stator and the rotor interact and is a fundamental property to characterize the motor but remains to be determined. It is known that the stator units of the motor bind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically to control the motor torque depending on the load on the motor. At low load where the kinetics such as a proton translocation speed limits the rotation rate, the dependency of the rotation rate on the number of stator units $N$ infers $D$; the dependency becomes larger for smaller $D$.
