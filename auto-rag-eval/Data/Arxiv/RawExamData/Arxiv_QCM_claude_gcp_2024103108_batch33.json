Event cameras are novel sensors that report brightness changes in the form of asynchronous \"events\" instead of intensity frames. They have significant advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Since the output of event cameras is fundamentally different from conventional cameras, it is commonly accepted that they require the development of specialized algorithms to accommodate the particular nature of events. In this work, we take a different view and propose to apply existing, mature computer vision techniques to videos reconstructed from event data. We propose a novel recurrent network to reconstruct videos from a stream of events, and train it on a large amount of simulated event data. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin (> 20%) in terms of image quality. We further apply off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms to videos reconstructed from event data on tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry, and show that this strategy consistently outperforms algorithms that were specifically designed for event data. We believe that our approach opens the door to bringing the outstanding properties of event cameras to an entirely new range of tasks.

The research proposes a novel approach that differs from the common understanding that event cameras require specialized algorithms. Instead, they suggest converting the event data into conventional video frames using a recurrent neural network, and then applying existing, well-established computer vision techniques to these reconstructed videos. This approach allows them to leverage mature algorithms for tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry, consistently outperforming methods specifically designed for event data.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it represents the conventional approach that the researchers are moving away from.

They focus on fully converting event data to video for processing with standard computer vision techniques.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the research doesn't involve modifying the hardware of event cameras.

The hierarchical structure of production planning has the advantage of assigning different decision variables to their respective time horizons and therefore ensures their manageability. However, the restrictive structure of this top-down approach implying that upper level decisions are the constraints for lower level decisions also has its shortcomings. One problem that occurs is that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences. Therefore, a planned utilisation factor has to be included into this deterministic aggregate planning problem. In practice, this decision is often based on past data and not consciously taken. In this paper, the effect of long-term forecast error on the optimal planned utilisation factor is evaluated for a production system facing stochastic demand and the benefit of exploiting this decision's potential is discussed. Overall costs including capacity, backorder and inventory costs, are determined with simulation for different multi-stage and multi-item production system structures.

Quantile is a popular performance measure for a stochastic system to evaluate its variability and risk. To reduce the risk, selecting the actions that minimize the tail quantiles of some loss distributions is typically of interest for decision makers. When the loss distribution is observed via simulations, evaluating and optimizing its quantile functions can be challenging, especially when the simulations are expensive, as it may cost a large number of simulation runs to obtain accurate quantile estimators. In this work, we propose a multi-level metamodel (co-kriging) based algorithm to optimize quantile functions more efficiently. Utilizing non-decreasing properties of quantile functions, we first search on cheaper and informative lower quantiles which are more accurate and easier to optimize.

Geometrical properties of energy bands underlie fascinating phenomena in a wide-range of systems, including solid-state materials, ultracold gases and photonics. Most famously, local geometrical characteristics like the Berry curvature can be related to global topological invariants such as those classifying quantum Hall states or topological insulators. Regardless of the band topology, however, any non-zero Berry curvature can have important consequences, such as in the semi-classical evolution of a wave packet. Here, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that wave packet dynamics can be used to directly map out the Berry curvature. To this end, we use optical pulses in two coupled fibre loops to study the discrete time-evolution of a wave packet in a 1D geometrical \"charge\" pump, where the Berry curvature leads to an anomalous displacement of the wave packet under pumping.

The experiment uses optical pulses in two coupled fiber loops to study the discrete time-evolution of a wave packet in a 1D geometrical \"charge\" pump.

To address this problem, we construct critical values of test statistics such that, if these values are used to determine significance, and if researchers optimally respond to these new significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency.

Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region.

A single-stranded RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity.

For the purpose of phase space reconstruction from nonlinear time series, delay selection is one of the most vital criteria. This is normally done by using a general measure viz., mutual information (MI). However, in that case, the delay selection is limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI between two variables only. The corresponding reconstructed phase space is also not satisfactory. To overcome the situation, a high-dimensional estimator of the MI is used; it selects more than one delay between more than two variables.

However, the organization and type of the transactions also affects the ledger's efficiency, which is increased by wallet agents transacting in a single shard whenever possible while collectively distributing their transactions uniformly across the available shards. Since there is no central authority to enforce these properties, the only means of achieving them is to design the system such that it is in agents' interest to act in a way that benefits overall throughput.
