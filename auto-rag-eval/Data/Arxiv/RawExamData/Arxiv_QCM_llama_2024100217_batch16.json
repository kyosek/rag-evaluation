In the context of current research on efficient estimation of models for large network data sets, we propose a fast algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that afords a signifcant increase in the size of networks amenable to direct empirical analysis. The algorithm we propose in this paper relies on properties of Markov chains at equilibrium, and for this reason it is called equilibrium expectation (EE). We demonstrate the performance of the EE algorithm in the context of exponential random graphmodels (ERGMs) a family of statistical models commonly used in empirical research based on network data observed at a single period in time. Thus far, the lack of efcient computational strategies has limited the empirical scope of ERGMs to relatively small networks with a few thousand nodes. The approach we propose allows a dramatic increase in the size of networks that may be analyzed using ERGMs. This is illustrated in an analysis of several biological networks and one social network with 104,103 nodes"}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary limitation of traditional statistical models used to analyze complex networks, and how does the proposed Equilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm address this limitation?\n\nA) The primary limitation is that traditional models are too computationally intensive, and the EE algorithm addresses this by using Markov chains at equilibrium to reduce computational complexity.\nB) The primary limitation is that traditional models are too simplistic, and the EE algorithm addresses this by incorporating local motifs associated with macro-structural properties.\nC) The primary limitation is that traditional models are too time-consuming to analyze large network data sets, and the EE algorithm addresses this by providing a fast algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation.\nD) The primary limitation is that traditional models are too focused on individual nodes, and the EE algorithm addresses this by analyzing the collective behavior of nodes in the network.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The primary limitation is that traditional models are too time-consuming to analyze large network data sets, and the EE algorithm addresses this by providing a fast algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that traditional statistical models used to analyze complex networks become increasingly problematic as network size increases, and that the EE algorithm provides a significant increase in the size of networks that can be analyzed using ERGMs. This suggests that the primary limitation of traditional models is their computational intensity, and that the EE algorithm addresses this limitation by providing a fast algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"title": "Semi-galois Categories III: Witt vectors by deformations of modular\n  functions", "source": "Takeo Uramoto", "docs_id": "2007.13367", "section": ["math.NT", "math.CT"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Semi-galois Categories III: Witt vectors by deformations of modular\n  functions.

An important statistical test on the pseudo-random number generators is called the spectral test.

In particular, the default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher. Therefore the spectral test is important to perform in dimensions $d > 8$ for $N=8$ generator, $d> 17$ for $N=17$ and $d> 240$ for $N=240$ generator.

In this paper, we investigate the physical-layer security for a spatial modulation (SM) based indoor visible light communication (VLC) system, which includes multiple transmitters, a legitimate receiver, and a passive eavesdropper (Eve). At the transmitters, the SM scheme is employed, i.e., only one transmitter is active at each time instant. To choose the active transmitter, a uniform selection (US) scheme is utilized. Two scenarios are considered: one is with non-negativity and average optical intensity constraints, the other is with non-negativity, average optical intensity and peak optical intensity constraints. Then, lower and upper bounds on the secrecy rate are derived for these two scenarios. Besides, the asymptotic behaviors for the derived secrecy rate bounds at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are analyzed. To further improve the secrecy performance, a channel adaptive selection (CAS) scheme and a greedy selection (GS) scheme are proposed to select the active transmitter. Numerical results show that the lower and upper bounds of the secrecy rate are tight. At high SNR, small asymptotic performance gaps exist between the derived lower and upper bounds.
