Points of interest (POI) recommendation has been drawn much attention recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, e.g., Foursquare and Yelp. Among the existing approaches to POI recommendation, Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective. However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems: (1) Expensive computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and potentially huge low rank matrices. (2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g., cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the computation and storage issue.

DDX3X is a human DEAD-box RNA helicase implicated in many cancers and in viral progression. In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core, DDX3X contains N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA structural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting only of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity.

In vivo neurons display greater variability in the interspike intervals due to the presence of synaptic noise. Noise and heterogeneity affect synchronization properties differently. In this paper we study using model simulations how robust synchronization can be in the presence of synaptic noise and neuronal heterogeneity.
