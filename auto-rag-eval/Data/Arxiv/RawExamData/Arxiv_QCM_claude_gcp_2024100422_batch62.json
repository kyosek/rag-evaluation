The year 2017 saw the rise and fall of the crypto-currency market, followed by high variability in the price of all crypto-currencies. In this work, we study the abrupt transition in crypto-currency residuals, which is associated with the critical transition (the phenomenon of critical slowing down) or the stochastic transition phenomena. We find that, regardless of the specific crypto-currency or rolling window size, the autocorrelation always fluctuates around a high value, while the standard deviation increases monotonically. Therefore, while the autocorrelation does not display signals of critical slowing down, the standard deviation can be used to anticipate critical or stochastic transitions. In particular, we have detected two sudden jumps in the standard deviation, in the second quarter of 2017 and at the beginning of 2018, which could have served as early warning signals of two majors price collapses that have happened in the following periods. We finally propose a mean-field phenomenological model for the price of crypto-currency to show how the use of the standard deviation of the residuals is a better leading indicator of the collapse in price than the time series' autocorrelation.

There is no apparent diametrically opposite counterpart either in X-ray or in the radio. It may have aged out of the observable radio band because of the cluster asymmetry.

Training is performed in an interleaved fashion; some batches undergo the regular forward and backpropagation passes with original network parameters, whereas others undergo a forward pass with pooled filters and downsampled inputs. Since pooling is differentiable, the gradients of the pooled filters propagate to the original network parameters for a standard parameter update. The latter phase requires fewer floating point operations and less storage due to the reduced spatial dimensions in feature maps and filters. The key idea is that this phase leads to smaller and approximate updates and thus slower learning, but at significantly reduced cost, followed by passes that use the original network parameters as a refinement stage.

The volatility characterizes the amplitude of price return fluctuations. It is a central magnitude in finance closely related to the risk of holding a certain asset. Despite its popularity on trading floors, the volatility is unobservable and only the price is known. Diffusion theory has many common points with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that volatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for the price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from price data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which together with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a maximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion processes. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic volatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of volatility.

Imposing this tight jet veto induces large double logarithms which significantly modify the Higgs production cross section. These jet-veto logarithms are presently only accounted for at fixed order or with the leading-logarithmic summation from parton-shower Monte Carlos. Here we consider Higgs production with an inclusive event-shape variable for the jet veto, namely beam thrust Tau_cm, which has a close correspondence with a traditional p_T jet veto.

This paper studies the finite horizon portfolio management by optimally tracking a ratcheting capital benchmark process. It is assumed that the fund manager can dynamically inject capital into the portfolio account such that the total capital dominates a non-decreasing benchmark floor process at each intermediate time. The tracking problem is formulated to minimize the cost of accumulated capital injection. We first transform the original problem with floor constraints into an unconstrained control problem, however, under a running maximum cost. By identifying a controlled state process with reflection, the problem is further shown to be equivalent to an auxiliary problem, which leads to a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with a Neumann boundary condition. By employing the dual transform, the probabilistic representation and some stochastic flow analysis, the existence of the unique classical solution to the HJB equation is established. The verification theorem is carefully proved, which gives the complete characterization of the feedback optimal portfolio.

A highly reflective sail provides a way to propel a spacecraft out of the solar system using solar radiation pressure. The closer the spacecraft is to the Sun when it starts its outward journey, the larger the radiation pressure and so the larger the final velocity. For a spacecraft starting on the Earth's orbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket engine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun. Employing the so-called Oberth effect, a second, prograde, impulse at closest approach will raise the final velocity further.

Once {\\Delta}v exceeds a threshold that depends on the lightness number of the sail (a measure of its sun-induced acceleration), the best strategy is to use all of the {\\Delta}v in the retrograde impulse to dive as close as possible to the Sun.
