Precision cosmology has recently triggered new attention on the topic of approximate methods for the clustering of matter on large scales, whose foundations date back to the period from late '60s to early '90s. Indeed, although the prospect of reaching sub-percent accuracy in the measurement of clustering poses a challenge even to full N-body simulations, an accurate estimation of the covariance matrix of clustering statistics, not to mention the sampling of parameter space, requires usage of a large number (hundreds in the most favourable cases) of simulated (mock) galaxy catalogs.

Swarming is a conspicuous behavioural trait observed in bird flocks, fish shoals, insect swarms and mammal herds. It is thought to improve collective awareness and offer protection from predators.

We argue that such local interactions alone are insufficient to explain the organization of large flocks of birds and that the mechanism for the exchange of long-ranged information necessary to control their density remains unknown. We show that large flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many directions. Such flocks are marginally opaque - an external observer can also just still see a substantial fraction of sky through the flock. Although seemingly intuitive we show that this need not be the case; flocks could easily be highly diffuse or entirely opaque. The emergence of marginal opacity strongly constrains how individuals interact with each other within large swarms. It also provides a mechanism for global interactions: An individual can respond to the projection of the flock that it sees.

Distributed training of massive machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is becoming commonplace. Several families of communication-reduction methods, such as quantization, large-batch methods, and gradient sparsification, have been proposed. To date, gradient sparsification methods - where each node sorts gradients by magnitude, and only communicates a subset of the components, accumulating the rest locally - are known to yield some of the largest practical gains. Such methods can reduce the amount of communication per step by up to three orders of magnitude, while preserving model accuracy. Yet, this family of methods currently has no theoretical justification. This is the question we address in this paper. We prove that, under analytic assumptions, sparsifying gradients by magnitude with local error correction provides convergence guarantees, for both convex and non-convex smooth objectives, for data-parallel SGD.
