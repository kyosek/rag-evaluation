We identify ground states of one-dimensional fermionic systems subject to competing repulsive interactions of finite range, and provide phenomenological and fundamental signatures of these phases and their transitions. Commensurable particle densities admit multiple competing charge-ordered insulating states with various periodicities and internal structure. Our reference point are systems with interaction range $p=2$, where phase transitions between these charge-ordered configurations are known to be mediated by liquid and bond-ordered phases. For increased interaction range $p=4$, we find that the phase transitions can also appear to be abrupt, as well as being mediated by re-emergent ordered phases that cross over into liquid behavior. These considerations are underpinned by a classification of the competing charge-ordered states in the atomic limit for varying interaction range at the principal commensurable particle densities.

The abrupt switching in a mono-domain manner allows for distinct magnetization states, while the CMR translates this magnetization loop into a hysteretic magnetoresistance loop. This combination allows the junction to store information (as magnetization orientation) and read it out by measuring junction resistance in an applied magnetic field. Importantly, this functionality works both in the superconducting state at cryogenic temperatures and in the normal state up to room temperature, providing a wide operational temperature range.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while these materials are used, it's their specific behaviors rather than just their identities that enable the memory functionality.

Earth's distant past and potentially its future include extremely warm \"hothouse\" climate states, but little is known about how the atmosphere behaves in such states.

Previous work has suggested that this could lead to temperature inversions and significant changes in cloud cover, but no previous modeling of the hothouse regime has resolved convective-scale turbulent air motions and cloud cover directly, thus leaving many questions about hothouse radiative heating unanswered. Here, we conduct simulations that explicitly resolve convection and find that lower-tropospheric radiative heating in hothouse climates causes the hydrologic cycle to shift from a quasi-steady regime to a \"relaxation oscillator\" regime, in which precipitation occurs in short and intense outbursts separated by multi-day dry spells. The transition to the oscillatory regime is accompanied by strongly enhanced local precipitation fluxes, a significant increase in cloud cover, and a transiently positive (unstable) climate feedback parameter.

Bacterial communities have rich social lives. A well-established interaction involves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the iron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with the rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and non-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used to test game theoretical predictions on the \"social dilemma\" of producers. Such an approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the public good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment. Here, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in a specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that explicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as chemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an ensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial producer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer fraction initially increases.

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics.
