Condensation phenomena arise through a collective behaviour of particles.

Recently, it has been shown that a driven and dissipative system of bosons may form multiple condensates. Which states become the condensates has, however, remained elusive thus far. The dynamics of this condensation are described by coupled birth-death processes, which also occur in evolutionary game theory. Here, we apply concepts from evolutionary game theory to explain the formation of multiple condensates in such driven-dissipative bosonic systems.

This paper presents a vision-based learning-by-demonstration approach to enable robots to learn and complete a manipulation task cooperatively. With this method, a vision system is involved in both the task demonstration and reproduction stages. An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a task, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The demonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a reference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned model, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task performance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply increasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this end, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between the robot and vision system. More importantly, the sampling rates of the reference trajectory and the robot speed are optimised adaptively according to the learned motion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing two tasks: a trajectory reproduction task and a bimanual sewing task.

We first define the concept of a sustainable social norm under which every agent has an incentive to follow the social strategy given the reputation scheme. We then formulate the problem of designing an optimal social norm, which selects a social norm that maximizes overall social welfare among all sustainable social norms.

Additionally, the study detected 4 Anomalous Cepheids and a blue plume in the Color-Magnitude Diagram, indicating the presence of younger (1-4 Gyr old) stars.
