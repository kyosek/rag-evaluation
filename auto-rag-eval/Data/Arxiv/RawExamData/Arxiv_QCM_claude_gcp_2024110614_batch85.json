We study the problem of recovering sparse signals from compressed linear measurements. This problem, often referred to as sparse recovery or sparse reconstruction, has generated a great deal of interest in recent years. To recover the sparse signals, we propose a new method called multiple orthogonal least squares (MOLS), which extends the well-known orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm by allowing multiple $L$ indices to be chosen per iteration. Owing to inclusion of multiple support indices in each selection, the MOLS algorithm converges in much fewer iterations and improves the computational efficiency over the conventional OLS algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MOLS ($L > 1$) performs exact recovery of all $K$-sparse signals within $K$ iterations if the measurement matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with isometry constant $\\delta_{LK} < \\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{K} + 2 \\sqrt{L}}.$ The recovery performance of MOLS in the noisy scenario is also studied. It is shown that stable recovery of sparse signals can be achieved with the MOLS algorithm when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scales linearly with the sparsity level of input signals."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Recovery of Sparse Signals Using Multiple Orthogonal Least Squares, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A research team is developing a new image compression algorithm using sparse signal recovery techniques. They are considering implementing the Multiple Orthogonal Least Squares (MOLS) algorithm with L=3. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the conditions under which this algorithm would guarantee exact recovery of all K-sparse signals within K iterations?\n\nA) The measurement matrix must satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) with isometry constant \u03b4\u2083\u2096 < \u221a3 / (\u221aK + 2\u221a3)\nB) The algorithm will always recover K-sparse signals regardless of the measurement matrix properties\nC) The measurement matrix must satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) with isometry constant \u03b4\u2096 < 1/3\nD) The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) must scale quadratically with the sparsity level K\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because it accurately applies the theoretical result presented in the documentation to the specific case where L=3. The documentation states that MOLS (L > 1) performs exact recovery of all K-sparse signals within K iterations if the measurement matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with isometry constant \u03b4_LK < (\u221aL) / (\u221aK + 2\u221aL). Substituting L=3 into this formula gives us exactly the condition stated in option A.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the capabilities of the algorithm; the recovery guarantee is conditional on the properties of the measurement matrix, not universal.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it presents a condition for the conventional Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) algorithm, not the MOLS algorithm with L=3. It also uses \u03b4\u2096 instead of \u03b4\u2083\u2096, which is not consistent with the MOLS theory.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses the conditions for exact recovery with those for stable recovery in noisy scenarios. While the documentation does mention that stable recovery can be achieved when SNR scales linearly (not quadratically) with sparsity, this is not the condition for exact recovery in K iterations.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (MOLS algorithm, RIP, isometry constants) and applies them to a real-world scenario (image compression).

There certainly is little or no doubt that politicians, sometimes consciously and sometimes not, exert a significant impact on stock markets. The evolving volatility over the Republican Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US presidential election is a perfect example when politicians, through announced policies, send signals to financial markets. The present paper seeks to address whether BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) stock markets equally vulnerable to Trump's plans. For this purpose, two methods were adopted. The first presents an event-study methodology based on regression estimation of abnormal returns. The second is based on vote intentions by integrating data from social media (Twitter), search queries (Google Trends) and public opinion polls. Our results robustly reveal that although some markets emerged losers, others took the opposite route. China took the biggest hit with Brazil, while the damage was much more limited for India and South Africa. These adverse responses can be explained by the Trump's neo-mercantilist attitude revolving around tearing up trade deals, instituting tariffs, and labeling China a \"currency manipulator\".

The question describes a complex model that incorporates both discrete and continuous time Markov processes within a probabilistic graphical model with latent variables, which aligns perfectly with the capabilities of BFFG as described in the documentation.\n\nBFFG is specifically designed for \"programmable inference on latent states and model parameters\" in models that combine \"discrete and continuous time Markov processes as building blocks into probabilistic graphical models with latent and observed variables.\" This makes it ideal for the social network information spread model described in the question.\n\nThe BFFG approach offers several advantages over the other options:\n\n1. It starts with a generative model and transforms it into a pre-conditional model guided by the data, which is particularly useful for complex network models with latent variables.\n\n2. It can handle both discrete and continuous time processes, which is crucial for modeling information spread that can occur in both discrete events and continuous time.\n\n3. The method provides a known likelihood-ratio between the generative and conditional models, which is valuable for parameter inference.\n\n4. BFFG can be easily incorporated into a probabilistic programming context due to its formulation as a set of transformation rules, making it more flexible and adaptable than traditional methods.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D are valid inference techniques, they don't offer the same level of integration and flexibility for this specific scenario:\n\n- MCMC with Gibbs sampling (A) might struggle with the continuous time aspects and the complexity of the latent variable structure.\n- Variational inference (B) could be applied but may not capture the temporal dynamics as effectively as BFFG.\n- The EM algorithm with particle filtering (D) is powerful but doesn't offer the same level of integration between discrete and continuous time processes that BFFG provides.\n\nTherefore, the BFFG paradigm (C) is the most effective approach for this complex social network model, as it's specifically designed to handle the combination of discrete and continuous time Markov processes within probabilistic graphical models with latent variables."}, "3": {"documentation": {"title": "Structures in 9Be, 10Be and 10B studied with tensor-optimized shell\n  model", "source": "Takayuki Myo, Atsushi Umeya, Hiroshi Toki, Kiyomi Ikeda", "docs_id": "1505.03942", "section": ["nucl-th", "nucl-ex"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Structures in 9Be, 10Be and 10B studied with tensor-optimized shell\n  model.

Here we present a new conceptual model inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and economics in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable states, each state with a different species' abundance profile. Our model's core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes' nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions, triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe.

This model is specifically designed to explain and predict multiple stable states in microbial communities, which is the core focus of the research team's study.\n\nThe stable marriage problem framework utilizes two key components: microbes' nutrient preferences and their competitive abilities. These ranked tables allow for the determination of all possible stable states and the prediction of inter-state transitions. This approach accounts for the complex interactions between microbes and nutrients, including the fact that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other.\n\nOption A (predator-prey model) is too simplistic and doesn't account for the multiple nutrients and complex interactions described in the documentation.

The calculations are performed for a wide range of neutron numbers, starting from the proton-rich side up to the neutron-rich one, by using the density-dependent meson-exchange and the density dependent point-coupling effective interactions. The obtained results are discussed and compared with available experimental data and with the already existing results of relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with NL3 functional.

Let's break down each option:\n\nA) While 150 keV is above the stated 10-50 keV range, the HCF can handle a 20cm x 20cm array (smaller than its 32cm x 32cm capability) and 400 \u03bcm pixels are within its resolution range. This is challenging but likely possible.\n\nB) The HCF is noted to be significantly faster than previous methods, completing in about a day what used to take 3 weeks. A 1D scan of a larger array in less than a week should be well within its capabilities.\n\nC) This option is the most challenging. While the HCF can handle 300 \u03bcm pixels (as mentioned for next-generation HREXI detectors), the documentation states it has a 100 \u03bcm resolution for sub-pixel scanning. Achieving 50 \u03bcm resolution across the entire array would exceed the stated capabilities of the HCF.\n\nD) This scenario directly matches the capabilities described in the documentation - a 256 cm\u00b2 tiled array of 2 x 2 cm CZT detectors at an energy within the 10-50 keV range. This is precisely what the HCF is designed to handle.\n\nThe question tests the ability to integrate multiple aspects of the HCF's capabilities (scan area, resolution, speed, and energy range) and apply them to a practical scenario in X-ray detector development.

The increasing maturity of IoT technologies and the falling costs of connected sensors has made the deployment of remote healthcare at scale an increasingly attractive prospect. In this work we demonstrate that we can measure the consistency and regularity of the behaviour of a household using sensor readings generated from interaction with the home environment.
