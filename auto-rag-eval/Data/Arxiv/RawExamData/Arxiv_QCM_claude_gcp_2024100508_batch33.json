Manufacturing industry is heading towards socialization, interconnection, and platformization. Motivated by the infiltration of sharing economy usage in manufacturing, this paper addresses a new factory model -- shared factory -- and provides a theoretical architecture and some actual cases for manufacturing sharing. Concepts related to three kinds of shared factories which deal respectively with sharing production-orders, manufacturing-resources and manufacturing-capabilities, are defined accordingly. These three kinds of shared factory modes can be used for building correspondent sharing manufacturing ecosystems. On the basis of sharing economic analysis, we identify feasible key enabled technologies for configuring and running a shared factory. At the same time, opportunities and challenges of enabling the shared factory are also analyzed in detail. In fact, shared factory, as a new production node, enhances the sharing nature of social manufacturing paradigm, fits the needs of light assets and gives us a new chance to use socialized manufacturing resources.

We propose DNN-Life, a specialized aging analysis and mitigation framework for DNNs, which jointly exploits hardware- and software-level knowledge to improve the lifetime of a DNN weight memory with reduced energy overhead. At the software-level, we analyze the effects of different DNN quantization methods on the distribution of the bits of weight values.

Swarming behaviors in animals have been extensively studied due to their implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition, and predator-prey dynamics. An important goal of these studies is discerning which evolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the structure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey density increases.

In this paper we reconstruct these composite grids using simple stellar population models from several different groups convolved with some plausible functional forms of star formation histories at fixed metallicity.

The aim of superstring phenomenology is to develop the tools and methodology needed to confront string theory with experimental data. The first mandatory task is to find string solutions which reproduce the observable data. The subsequent goal is to extract potential signatures beyond the observable data. Recently, by studying exact flat directions of non-Abelian singlet fields, we demonstrated the existence of free fermionic heterotic-string models in which the $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)_Y$-charged matter spectrum, just below the string scale, consists solely of the MSSM spectrum. In this paper we study the possibility that the exact flat directions leave a $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ symmetry unbroken at the Planck scale. We demonstrate in a specific example that such unbroken $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ is in general expected to be not of the GUT type but of intrinsic stringy origin. We study its phenomenological characteristics and the consequences in the case that $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ remains unbroken down to low energies.

In this paper, a bi-objective optimal control problem defined on DICE model, objectives of which are maximizing social welfare and minimizing the temperature deviation of atmosphere. This multi-objective optimal control problem solved using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) also it is compared to previous works on single-objective version of the problem. The resulting Pareto front rediscovers the previous results and generalizes to a wide range of non-dominant solutions to minimize the global temperature deviation while optimizing the economic welfare. The previously used single-objective approach is unable to create such a variety of possibilities, hence, its offered solution is limited in vision and reachable performance. Beside this, resulting Pareto-optimal set reveals the fact that temperature deviation cannot go below a certain lower limit, unless we have significant technology advancement or positive change in global conditions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy (DICE) was originally designed as a single-objective optimal control problem. What key advantage does the bi-objective approach using NSGA-II offer over the single-objective approach?\n\nA) It provides a more accurate prediction of global temperature changes\nB) It maximizes social welfare more effectively than the single-objective model\nC) It reveals a range of non-dominant solutions balancing economic welfare and temperature deviation\nD) It proves that temperature deviation can be reduced to zero with current technology\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The bi-objective approach using NSGA-II offers a significant advantage over the single-objective approach by revealing a range of non-dominant solutions that balance economic welfare and temperature deviation. This is evident from the statement: \"The resulting Pareto front rediscovers the previous results and generalizes to a wide range of non-dominant solutions to minimize the global temperature deviation while optimizing the economic welfare.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the text doesn't claim improved accuracy in temperature predictions. \n\nOption B is not supported by the text; the bi-objective approach doesn't necessarily maximize social welfare more effectively, but rather provides a balance between welfare and temperature deviation. \n\nOption D is actually contradicted by the text, which states that \"temperature deviation cannot go below a certain lower limit, unless we have significant technology advancement or positive change in global conditions.\"\n\nThe correct answer, C, highlights the key advantage of the bi-objective approach in providing a more comprehensive view of possible solutions, which the single-objective approach was unable to offer."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "A characterization of Banach spaces containing $c_0$", "source": "Haskell P.

While it's true that if B contains no isomorph of c0, every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence must have a strongly summing subsequence (by Corollary 1), the statement in the question is not the contrapositive and thus not necessarily true.\n\nB) This is correct. The theorem states that every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence has either a strongly summing subsequence or a convex block basis equivalent to the summing basis.

Motivation: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is among the most commonly used methods for scrutinizing proteomic profiles in different organs for biological or medical researches. All the proteomic analyses including peptide/protein identification and quantification, differential expression analysis, biomarker discovery and so on are all based on the matching of mass spectra with peptide sequences, which is significantly influenced by the quality of the spectra, such as the peak numbers, noisy peaks, signal-to-noise ratios, etc. Hence, it is crucial to assess the quality of the spectra in order for filtering and/or post-processing after identification. The handcrafted features representing spectra quality, however, need human expertise to design and are difficult to optimize, and thus the existing assessing algorithms are still lacking in accuracy. Thus, there is a critical need for the robust and adaptive algorithm for mass spectra quality assessment. Results: We have developed a novel mass spectrum assessment software DeepQuality, based on the state-of-the-art compressed sensing and deep learning algorithms. We evaluated the algorithm on two publicly available tandem MS data sets, resulting in the AUC of 0.96 and 0.92, respectively, a significant improvement compared with the AUC of 0.85 and 0.91 of the existing method SpectrumQuality v2.0.

The user gives a command and enters its intent through an interface, after which the model learns to map the speech directly to the right action. Since the effort of the user should be as low as possible, capsule networks have drawn interest due to potentially needing little training data compared to deeper neural networks.
