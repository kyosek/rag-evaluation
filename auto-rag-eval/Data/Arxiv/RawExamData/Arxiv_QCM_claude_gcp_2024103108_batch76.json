We extend the recently introduced divergence-conforming immersed boundary (DCIB) method [1] to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems involving closed co-dimension one solids. We focus on capsules and vesicles, whose discretization is particularly challenging due to the higher-order derivatives that appear in their formulations. In two-dimensional settings, we employ cubic B-splines with periodic knot vectors to obtain discretizations of closed curves with C^2 inter-element continuity. In three-dimensional settings, we use analysis-suitable bi-cubic T-splines to obtain discretizations of closed surfaces with at least C^1 inter-element continuity. Large spurious changes of the fluid volume inside closed co-dimension one solids is a well-known issue for IB methods. The DCIB method results in volume changes orders of magnitude lower than conventional IB methods. This is a byproduct of discretizing the velocity-pressure pair with divergence-conforming B-splines, which lead to negligible incompressibility errors at the Eulerian level. The higher inter-element continuity of divergence-conforming B-splines is also crucial to avoid the quadrature/interpolation errors of IB methods becoming the dominant discretization error.

In the Complex Scaling Method, resonance and scattering solutions do not exhibit an outgoing or scattering wave asymptotic behavior, but rather have decaying asymptotics. This change in the asymptotic behavior of the solutions is a direct consequence of the complex rotation of coordinates and momenta. To accurately calculate expectation values of operators for these states, it's necessary to complex rotate the operators as well. This rotation compensates for the decaying asymptotics of the complex scaled solutions, ensuring that the expectation values are calculated correctly within the framework of the CSM.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the CSM actually changes the outgoing wave asymptotic behavior to decaying asymptotics.\n\nOption C, while mentioning an aspect of the CSM (resolving the complex rotated Hamiltonian), is not the primary reason for rotating the operators when calculating expectation values.\n\nOption D describes an alternative approach mentioned in the text for calculating expectation values, but it's not the reason why operators are typically rotated in the CSM."}, "12": {"documentation": {"title": "Coastal Flood Risk in the Mortgage Market: Storm Surge Models'\n  Predictions vs. Flood Insurance Maps", "source": "Amine Ouazad", "docs_id": "2006.02977", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Coastal Flood Risk in the Mortgage Market: Storm Surge Models'\n  Predictions vs. Flood Insurance Maps. Prior literature has argued that flood insurance maps may not capture the extent of flood risk. This paper performs a granular assessment of coastal flood risk in the mortgage market by using physical simulations of hurricane storm surge heights instead of using FEMA's flood insurance maps. Matching neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests that coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm surge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when using flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of originations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The share of agency mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in the flood insurance 100-year floodplain. Mortgages in storm surge areas are more likely to be complex: non-fully amortizing features such as interest-only or adjustable rates. Households may also be more vulnerable in storm surge areas: median household income is lower, the share of African Americans and Hispanics is substantially higher, the share of individuals with health coverage is lower.

Due to the scarcity of quantitative details about biological phenomena, quantitative modeling in systems biology can be compromised, especially at the subcellular scale. One way to get around this is qualitative modeling because it requires few to no quantitative information. One of the most popular qualitative modeling approaches is the Boolean network formalism. However, Boolean models allow variables to take only two values, which can be too simplistic in some cases. The present work proposes a modeling approach derived from Boolean networks where continuous logical operators are used and where edges can be tuned. Using continuous logical operators allows variables to be more finely valued while remaining qualitative. To consider that some biological interactions can be slower or weaker than other ones, edge states are also computed in order to modulate in speed and strength the signal they convey. The proposed formalism is illustrated on a toy network coming from the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. The obtained simulations show that continuous results are produced, thus allowing finer analysis.

Gene drives have the potential to rapidly replace a harmful wild-type allele with a gene drive allele engineered to have desired functionalities. However, an accidental or premature release of a gene drive construct to the natural environment could damage an ecosystem irreversibly. Thus, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal consequences of the super-Mendelian population genetics prior to potential applications. Here, we employ a reaction-diffusion model for sexually reproducing diploid organisms to study how a locally introduced gene drive allele spreads to replace the wild-type allele, even though it possesses a selective disadvantage $s>0$. Using methods developed by N. Barton and collaborators, we show that socially responsible gene drives require $0.5<s<0.697$, a rather narrow range.
