Ordering of such anisotropic particles increases the free volume entropy by reducing the excluded volume between them.

This mechanism is rooted in free volume entropy and excluded volume arguments, rather than specific chemical interactions.\n\nThe concept of entropic patchiness is crucial here because it explains how the addition of depletants leads to complex phase behavior without invoking electrostatic, van der Waals, or hydrogen bonding interactions (ruling out options A, C, and D). The orientation-dependent attraction arises from the entropy-driven tendency to maximize free volume in the system.\n\nThis phenomenon has significant implications for industrial applications, particularly in the oil industry, as mentioned in the documentation.

The key observation is that sigma_L/sigma_T increases with Q^2 but not with W or t.\n\nIn perturbative QCD, the ratio sigma_L/sigma_T is sensitive to the gluon distribution in the proton. As Q^2 increases, we probe smaller distance scales within the proton. The increase of sigma_L/sigma_T with Q^2 suggests that at higher resolutions (higher Q^2), the longitudinal component becomes more important.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with an increasing gluon density at small Bjorken-x values.

This paper provides a decision theoretic analysis of bandit experiments. The bandit setting corresponds to a dynamic programming problem, but solving this directly is typically infeasible. Working within the framework of diffusion asymptotics, we define a suitable notion of asymptotic Bayes risk for bandit settings. For normally distributed rewards, the minimal Bayes risk can be characterized as the solution to a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation (PDE). Using a limit of experiments approach, we show that this PDE characterization also holds asymptotically under both parametric and non-parametric distribution of the rewards. The approach further describes the state variables it is asymptotically sufficient to restrict attention to, and therefore suggests a practical strategy for dimension reduction. The upshot is that we can approximate the dynamic programming problem defining the bandit setting with a PDE which can be efficiently solved using sparse matrix routines.

Contemporary debates on filter bubbles and polarization in public and social media raise the question to what extent news media of the past exhibited biases.

We measure bias related to gender by comparing local changes in word embedding models trained on newspapers with divergent ideological backgrounds. We demonstrate clear differences in gender bias and changes within and between newspapers over time. In relation to themes such as sexuality and leisure, we see the bias moving toward women, whereas, generally, the bias shifts in the direction of men, despite growing female employment number and feminist movements.

This choice is based on several key factors from the documentation:\n\n1. Higher-order continuity: Red blood cells, like vesicles and capsules, require higher-order derivatives in their formulation. The DCIB method uses cubic B-splines (2D) or bi-cubic T-splines (3D) to achieve C^2 or at least C^1 inter-element continuity, respectively.

The DCIB method results in volume changes that are orders of magnitude lower than conventional IB methods, which is critical for maintaining the physical accuracy of the simulation.\n\n3. Incompressibility: The DCIB method uses divergence-conforming B-splines to discretize the velocity-pressure pair, leading to negligible incompressibility errors at the Eulerian level. This is important for accurately modeling the fluid behavior both inside and outside the cell.\n\n4. Reduced discretization errors: The higher inter-element continuity of divergence-conforming B-splines helps to minimize quadrature/interpolation errors, which are often a dominant source of discretization error in conventional IB methods.\n\n5. Applicability to fluid-structure interaction: The DCIB method is specifically extended to handle fluid-structure interaction problems involving closed co-dimension one solids, which perfectly describes the case of red blood cells in fluid flow.\n\nOption A is incorrect because conventional IB methods with linear elements would not provide the necessary continuity and would likely suffer from larger volume conservation errors.

The key observation is the ordering and squeezing together of the vorticity moments D_m.\n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The consistent ordering D_(m+1) < D_m suggests that higher-order moments of vorticity are becoming relatively smaller compared to lower-order moments. This is a characteristic of intermittency in turbulent flows.\n\n2. The fact that D_(m+1)/D_m approaches 1 as m increases indicates that the differences between successive moments become less pronounced at higher orders. This \"squeezing together\" of moments is another hallmark of intermittent behavior in turbulence.\n\n3. Intermittency in turbulence is associated with the presence of localized, intense vorticity structures that contribute disproportionately to higher-order statistics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because isotropy is not directly related to the ordering of vorticity moments. In fact, the documentation mentions that one simulation involves very anisotropic decaying turbulence, yet still exhibits this behavior.\n\nOption B is incorrect because numerical instability would typically lead to divergence or erratic behavior in higher-order moments, not the consistent ordering observed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the energy cascade direction is not directly inferable from the vorticity moment behavior described. The energy cascade is a separate concept related to the transfer of energy between scales in turbulence.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to interpret complex numerical results in the context of turbulence theory, requiring critical thinking and application of fluid dynamics concepts to a real-world simulation scenario."}, "84": {"documentation": {"title": "Estimation of Graphical Models using the $L_{1,2}$ Norm", "source": "Khai X.

Due to the scarcity of quantitative details about biological phenomena, quantitative modeling in systems biology can be compromised, especially at the subcellular scale. One way to get around this is qualitative modeling because it requires few to no quantitative information. One of the most popular qualitative modeling approaches is the Boolean network formalism. However, Boolean models allow variables to take only two values, which can be too simplistic in some cases. The present work proposes a modeling approach derived from Boolean networks where continuous logical operators are used and where edges can be tuned. Using continuous logical operators allows variables to be more finely valued while remaining qualitative. To consider that some biological interactions can be slower or weaker than other ones, edge states are also computed in order to modulate in speed and strength the signal they convey. The proposed formalism is illustrated on a toy network coming from the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. The obtained simulations show that continuous results are produced, thus allowing finer analysis.
