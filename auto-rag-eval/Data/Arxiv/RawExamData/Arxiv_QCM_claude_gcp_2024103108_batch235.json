In this As-deficient system with almost homogeneously distributed As-vacancies (AV), as suggested by the (75)As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements,we observe a strong enhancement of the spin-susceptibility by a factor of 3-7. This observation is attributed to the presence of an electronically localized state around each AV, carrying a magnetic moment of about 3.2 mu_Bohr per AV or 0.8 mu_Bohr/Fe atom. From theoretical considerations we find that the formation of a local moment on neighboring iron sites of an AV sets in when the local Coulomb interaction exceeds a critical value of about 1.0 eV in the dilute limit. Its estimated value amounts to ~ 2.5 eV and implies an upper bound of ~ 2 eV for the Coulomb repulsion at Fe sites beyond the first neighbor-shell of an AV. Electronic correlations are thus moderate/weak in doped La-1111.

Past studies have investigated style conversion in TTS synthesis, yet degraded synthesized quality often leads to worse intelligibility.

In this paper, a novel scenario-based SMPC approach is proposed by actively learning a data-driven uncertainty set from available data with machine learning techniques. A systematical procedure is then proposed to further calibrate the uncertainty set, which gives appropriate probabilistic guarantee. The resulting data-driven uncertainty set is more compact than traditional norm-based sets, and can help reducing conservatism of control actions. Meanwhile, the proposed method requires less data samples than traditional scenario-based SMPC approaches, thereby enhancing the practicability of SMPC. Finally the optimal control problem is cast as a single-stage robust optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by deriving the robust counterpart problem. The feasibility and stability issue is also discussed in detail. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a two-mass-spring system and a building energy control problem under uncertain disturbances."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary advantage of the novel scenario-based SMPC approach proposed in this paper compared to traditional SMPC methods?\n\nA) It requires exact knowledge of probabilistic distributions\nB) It uses a larger number of scenarios to represent uncertainties\nC) It actively learns a more compact data-driven uncertainty set\nD) It increases the conservatism of control actions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The novel approach proposed in this paper actively learns a data-driven uncertainty set from available data using machine learning techniques.

Furthermore, fast development cycles of the system additionally introduce hardware changes, such as sensor types and vehicle setups, and the required knowledge transfer from simulation.

To this end, we advance recently established results to obtain analytic expressions for the mean degree of 3D networks for simple but practical anisotropic gain profiles, including those of patch, dipole and end-fire array antennas. Our analysis reveals that for homogeneous systems (i.e. neglecting boundary effects) directional radiation patterns are superior to the isotropic case only when the path loss exponent is less than the spatial dimension. Moreover, we establish that ad hoc networks utilizing directional transmit and isotropic receive antennas (or vice versa) are always sub-optimally connected regardless of the environment path loss. We extend our analysis to investigate boundary effects in inhomogeneous systems, and study the geometrical reasons why directional radiating nodes are at a disadvantage to isotropic ones.
