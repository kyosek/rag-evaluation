In the edge computing paradigm, mobile devices offload the computational tasks to an edge server by routing the required data over the wireless network. The full potential of edge computing becomes realized only if a smart device selects the most appropriate server in terms of the latency and energy consumption, among many available ones. The server selection problem is challenging due to the randomness of the environment and lack of prior information about the environment. Therefore, a smart device, which sequentially chooses a server under uncertainty, aims to improve its decision based on the historical time and energy consumption. The problem becomes more complicated in a dynamic environment, where key variables might undergo abrupt changes. To deal with the aforementioned problem, we first analyze the required time and energy to data transmission and processing. We then use the analysis to cast the problem as a budget-limited multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm is associated with a reward and cost, with time-variant statistical characteristics. We propose a policy to solve the formulated problem and prove a regret bound. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to a number of existing solutions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of edge computing with dynamic networks and uncertainty, which of the following statements best describes the approach and benefits of using a multi-armed bandit algorithm for server selection?\n\nA) It allows for optimal server selection based on complete prior knowledge of the network, minimizing energy consumption but potentially increasing latency.\n\nB) It enables learning-based server selection that adapts to changing network conditions, optimizing both latency and energy consumption over time without requiring prior information about the environment.\n\nC) It provides a static solution for server selection that guarantees minimum latency but may result in higher energy consumption due to lack of adaptability.\n\nD) It focuses solely on minimizing transmission time by always selecting the closest server, disregarding energy consumption and network dynamics.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the key aspects of the multi-armed bandit approach described in the document.

Incident spectra from parent star flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts are modeled and compared to energetic particles in importance. We find that terrestrial-like exoplanets with atmospheres thinner than about 100 g cm^-2 transmit and reprocess a significant fraction of incident gamma-rays, producing a characteristic, flat surficial spectrum.

Within the last decade powerful methods have been developed to study surfaces using bright low-energy positron beams. These novel analysis tools exploit the unique properties of positron interaction with surfaces, which comprise the absence of exchange interaction, repulsive crystal potential and positron trapping in delocalized surface states at low energies. By applying reflection high-energy positron diffraction (RHEPD) one can benefit from the phenomenon of total reflection below a critical angle that is not present in electron surface diffraction. Therefore, RHEPD allows the determination of the atom positions of (reconstructed) surfaces with outstanding accuracy. The main advantages of positron annihilation induced Auger-electron spectroscopy (PAES) are the missing secondary electron background in the energy region of Auger-transitions and its topmost layer sensitivity for elemental analysis. In order to enable the investigation of the electron polarization at surfaces low-energy spin-polarized positrons are used to probe the outermost electrons of the surface. Furthermore, in fundamental research the preparation of well defined surfaces tailored for the production of bound leptonic systems plays an outstanding role. In this report, it is envisaged to cover both, the fundamental aspects of positron surface interaction and the present status of surface studies using modern positron beam techniques."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Reflection High-Energy Positron Diffraction (RHEPD) is NOT correct?\n\nA) It allows for the determination of atom positions in reconstructed surfaces with high accuracy.\nB) It utilizes the phenomenon of total reflection below a critical angle.\nC) It is less sensitive to surface structures compared to electron diffraction techniques.\nD) It benefits from the absence of exchange interaction between positrons and surface electrons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is correct according to the text, which states that \"RHEPD allows the determination of the atom positions of (reconstructed) surfaces with outstanding accuracy.\"\n\nB) is correct as the passage mentions \"the phenomenon of total reflection below a critical angle that is not present in electron surface diffraction.\"\n\nC) is incorrect.

Recent evidence of a young progenitor population for many Type-Ia SNe (SNe-Ia) raises the possibility that evolved intermediate-mass progenitor stars may be detected in pre-explosion images. NGC 1316, a radio galaxy in the Fornax cluster, is a prolific producer of SNe-Ia, with four detected since 1980. We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-explosion images of the sites of two of the SNe-Ia that exploded in this galaxy, SN2006dd (a normal Type-Ia) and SN2006mr (likely a subluminous, 1991bg-like, SN-Ia).

We here propose a unified model based on our new, global, two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By controlling a density normalization we could for the first time reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow and outflow with one numerical code.

The magnetic energy is amplified within the disk up to about twice, 30%, and 20% of the gas energy in models A, B, and C, respectively.
