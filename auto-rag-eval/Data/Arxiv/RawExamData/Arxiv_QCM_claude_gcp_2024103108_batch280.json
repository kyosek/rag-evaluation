In recent years, the tendency of the number of financial institutions including cryptocurrencies in their portfolios has accelerated.

It is therefore important to summarise existing research papers and results on cryptocurrency trading, including available trading platforms, trading signals, trading strategy research and risk management. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptocurrency trading research, by covering 146 research papers on various aspects of cryptocurrency trading (e.g., cryptocurrency trading systems, bubble and extreme conditions, prediction of volatility and return, crypto-assets portfolio construction and crypto-assets, technical trading and others).

To address the answer, we emphasize the role of hysteresis in economic networks.

In order to maximize the cooperation gain in the cell-free systems, acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) at the BSs is crucial. While this task is relatively easy for the time division duplexing (TDD) systems due to the channel reciprocity, it is not easy for the frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems due to the CSI feedback overhead. This issue is even more pronounced in the cell-free systems since the user needs to feed back the CSIs of multiple BSs. In this paper, we propose a novel feedback reduction technique for the FDD-based cell-free systems.

In this article, we consider dynamic routing over two parallel routes, where the sensing on each link is subject to recurrent and random faults. The faults occur and clear according to a finite-state Markov chain. When the sensing is faulty on a link, the traffic state on that link appears to be zero to the controller.

We use these results to study how a variety of key parameters affect the resilience score of the network. The main conclusions are: (i) Sensing faults can reduce throughput and destabilize a nominally stable network; (ii) A higher failure rate does not necessarily reduce throughput, and there may exist a worst rate that minimizes throughput; (iii) Higher correlation between the failure probabilities of two links leads to greater throughput; (iv) A large difference in capacity between two links can result in a drop in throughput."}, "answer": "Question: In a dynamic routing system with two parallel routes subject to recurrent and random sensing faults, which of the following statements is NOT a conclusion drawn from the study?\n\nA) Sensing faults can destabilize a network that would otherwise be stable under normal conditions.\n\nB) The relationship between failure rate and throughput is always linear, with higher failure rates consistently resulting in lower throughput.\n\nC) Increased correlation between the failure probabilities of two links tends to improve overall throughput.\n\nD) A significant disparity in capacity between two parallel links can lead to a reduction in throughput.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it contradicts the findings of the study.

Therefore, it is preferable to assess the statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures.

A dipole model describes the channel coefficient as a function of link distance and antenna orientations. In many use cases the orientations are random, causing a random fading channel. This paper presents a closed-form description of the channel statistics and the resulting outage performance for the case of i.i.d. uniformly distributed antenna orientations in 3D space. For reception in AWGN after active transmission, we show that the high-SNR outage probability scales like $p_\\mathrm{e} \\propto \\mathrm{SNR}^{-1/2}$ in the near- or far-field region, i.e. the diversity exponent is just 1/2 (even 1/4 with backscatter or load modulation).
