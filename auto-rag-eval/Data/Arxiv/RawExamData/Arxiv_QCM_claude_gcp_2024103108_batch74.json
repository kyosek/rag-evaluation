Real-time adaptation is imperative to the control of robots operating in complex, dynamic environments. Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear systems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain dynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features. However, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for aerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a manipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven modeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive controller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our key insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with control-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather than regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data. Specifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking simulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the meta-objective.

Over the past decade, several targeted therapies (e.g. imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) have been developed to treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).

Recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist treatment can be detected in a substan- tial number of patients, and that this may be associated with eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to extend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted therapies. However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence, etc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model the dynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the impact of combination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with preexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization problem to find the best schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of CML according to our ordinary differential equation model. This resulting optimiza- tion problem is nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints and integer variables.

Our primary tool is {\\em obfuscation}, relying on the properties of natural language. Specifically, a given English text is obfuscated using a neural model that aims to preserve the syntactic relationships of the original sentence so that the obfuscated sentence can be parsed instead of the original one. The model works at the word level, and learns to obfuscate each word separately by changing it into a new word that has a similar syntactic role. The text obfuscated by our model leads to better performance on three syntactic parsers (two dependency and one constituency parsers) in comparison to an upper-bound random substitution baseline. More specifically, the results demonstrate that as more terms are obfuscated (by their part of speech), the substitution upper bound significantly degrades, while the neural model maintains a relatively high performing parser. All of this is done without much sacrifice of privacy compared to the random substitution upper bound. We also further analyze the results, and discover that the substituted words have similar syntactic properties, but different semantic content, compared to the original words."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary goal and mechanism of the obfuscation technique introduced in the Arxiv paper for privacy-preserving syntactic parsing?\n\nA) It encrypts data using homomorphic encryption to allow parsing without exposing the original content.\n\nB) It randomly substitutes words to preserve privacy while maintaining syntactic structure for parsing.\n\nC) It uses a neural model to replace words with syntactically similar but semantically different words, preserving parsing capability while obfuscating meaning.\n\nD) It applies part-of-speech tagging to mask the original text while retaining its grammatical structure for parsing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The paper introduces an obfuscation technique that uses a neural model to replace words in a sentence with new words that have similar syntactic roles but different semantic content. This approach aims to preserve the syntactic relationships of the original sentence, allowing for effective parsing of the obfuscated text while protecting the privacy of the original content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the technique is inspired by homomorphic encryption, it doesn't actually use encryption. Instead, it uses obfuscation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the technique doesn't use random substitution. In fact, the paper compares its neural model approach to a random substitution baseline and shows that it performs better.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the technique does consider parts of speech, it goes beyond simple POS tagging. It uses a neural model to learn substitutions that preserve syntactic roles while changing semantic content.\n\nThe key aspect of this technique is its ability to maintain parsing performance even as more terms are obfuscated, which is achieved through the neural model's learned substitutions rather than random replacements or simple POS-based masking."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Accurate Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Relation-Aware Pyramid\n  Network", "source": "Jialin Gao, Zhixiang Shi, Jiani Li, Guanshuo Wang, Yufeng Yuan,\n  Shiming Ge, and Xi Zhou", "docs_id": "2003.04145", "section": ["cs.CV"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Accurate Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Relation-Aware Pyramid\n  Network.
