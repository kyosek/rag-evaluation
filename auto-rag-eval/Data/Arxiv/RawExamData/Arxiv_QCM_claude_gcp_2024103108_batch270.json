GRB 060505 was the first well-observed nearby possible long-duration GRB that had no associated supernova. Here we present spatially resolved spectra of the host galaxy of GRB 060505, an Sbc spiral, at redshift z=0.0889. The GRB occurred inside a star-forming region in the northern spiral arm at 6.5 kpc from the center. From the position of the emission lines, we determine a maximum rotational velocity for the galaxy of v~212km/s corresponding to a mass of 1.14x10^11 M_solar within 11 kpc from the center. By fitting single-age spectral synthesis models to the stellar continuum, we derive a very young age for the GRB site, confirmed by photometric and Halpha line measurements, of around 6 Myr which corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 M_solar star. The metallicity derived from several emission line measurements is lowest at the GRB site with 1/5 Z_solar but roughly solar in the rest of the galaxy. Using the 2dF galaxy redshift survey we can locate the host galaxy in its large scale (Mpc) environment. The galaxy lies in the foreground of a filamentary overdensity extending south west from the galaxy cluster Abell 3837 at z=0.0896.

The GRB's location in a star-forming region indicates an environment conducive to massive star formation. The very young age of about 6 Myr for the stellar population at the GRB site corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 M_solar star, which is consistent with a massive star progenitor. Finally, the low metallicity (1/5 Z_solar) at the GRB site is a characteristic often associated with long-duration GRB environments and massive star progenitors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because high rotational velocity and solar metallicity throughout the galaxy are not specific indicators of a massive star progenitor. Option C focuses on general properties of the host galaxy that don't directly relate to the GRB progenitor.

Previous studies showed that replying to a user review usually has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to the app. For example, Hassan et al. found that responding to a review increases the chances of a user updating their given rating by up to six times compared to not responding. To alleviate the labor burden in replying to the bulk of user reviews, developers usually adopt a template-based strategy where the templates can express appreciation for using the app or mention the company email address for users to follow up. However, reading a large number of user reviews every day is not an easy task for developers. Thus, there is a need for more automation to help developers respond to user reviews.

Modern deep learning based classifiers show very high accuracy on test data but this does not provide sufficient guarantees for safe deployment, especially in high-stake AI applications such as medical diagnosis.

We discuss a class of explicitly solvable mean field type control problems/mean field games with a clear economic interpretation. More precisely, we consider long term average impulse control problems with underlying general one-dimensional diffusion processes motivated by optimal harvesting problems in natural resource management. We extend the classical stochastic Faustmann models by allowing the prices to depend on the state of the market using a mean field structure. In a competitive market model, we prove that, under natural conditions, there exists an equilibrium strategy of threshold-type and furthermore characterize the threshold explicitly. If the agents cooperate with each other, we are faced with the mean field type control problem. Using a Lagrange-type argument, we prove that the optimizer of this non-standard impulse control problem is of threshold-type as well and characterize the optimal threshold. Furthermore, we compare the solutions and illustrate the findings in an example."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the mean field impulse control problems discussed in the paper, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the comparison between competitive market models and cooperative scenarios?\n\nA) In competitive markets, the equilibrium strategy is always of threshold-type, while in cooperative scenarios, the optimal strategy is always continuous.\n\nB) The optimal threshold in cooperative scenarios is always higher than the equilibrium threshold in competitive markets, leading to more conservative resource management.\n\nC) Both competitive and cooperative models result in threshold-type strategies, but the specific thresholds and their economic implications may differ.\n\nD) Cooperative scenarios always lead to more efficient resource utilization compared to competitive markets, regardless of the underlying diffusion process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that in both the competitive market model and the cooperative scenario (mean field type control problem), the optimal strategies are of threshold-type. For the competitive market, it's mentioned that \"there exists an equilibrium strategy of threshold-type,\" while for the cooperative case, it's stated that \"the optimizer of this non-standard impulse control problem is of threshold-type as well.\"\n\nThe key difference lies in how these thresholds are characterized and their potential economic implications. The paper indicates that they compare the solutions, suggesting that the thresholds and their effects may differ between competitive and cooperative scenarios.

Image demosaicking and denoising are the two key fundamental steps in digital camera pipelines, aiming to reconstruct clean color images from noisy luminance readings. In this paper, we propose and study Wild-JDD, a novel learning framework for joint demosaicking and denoising in the wild. In contrast to previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color moire and residual noise. Then we formulate a two-stage data degradation process to capture such ground truth uncertainty, where a conjugate prior distribution is imposed upon a base distribution. After that, we derive an evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates the parameters of the conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded input. Finally, to further enhance the performance for out-of-distribution input, we design a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy by taking the input as a weakly informative prior. Taking into account ground truth uncertainty, Wild-JDD enjoys good interpretability during optimization. Extensive experiments validate that it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes on joint demosaicking and denoising tasks on both synthetic and realistic raw datasets."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the key innovation of the Wild-JDD framework for joint demosaicking and denoising?\n\nA) It uses a single-stage data degradation process to capture ground truth uncertainty\nB) It assumes perfect ground truth data for training, unlike previous approaches\nC) It employs a two-stage data degradation process with a conjugate prior distribution to model ground truth uncertainty\nD) It focuses solely on reducing zipper effects and color moire artifacts in images\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key innovation of Wild-JDD is its approach to handling ground truth uncertainty in training data for joint demosaicking and denoising.

Gamma-ray catalogs contain a considerable amount of unidentified sources. Many of these are located out of the Galactic plane and therefore may have extragalactic origin. Here we assume that the formation of massive black holes in galactic nuclei proceeds through a quasi-star stage and consider the possibility of jet production by such objects. Those jets would be the sources of collimated synchrotron and Compton emission, extending from radio to gamma rays. The expected lifetimes of quasi-stars are of the order of million of years while the jet luminosities, somewhat smaller than that of quasar jets, are sufficient to account for the unidentified gamma-ray sources. The jet emission dominates over the thermal emission of a quasi-star in all energy bands, except when the jet is not directed towards an observer. The predicted synchrotron emission peaks in the IR band, with the flux close to the limits of the available IR all sky surveys. The ratio of the $\\gamma$-ray flux to the IR flux is found to be very large ($\\sim 60$), much larger than in BL Lac objects but reached by some radio-loud quasars.
