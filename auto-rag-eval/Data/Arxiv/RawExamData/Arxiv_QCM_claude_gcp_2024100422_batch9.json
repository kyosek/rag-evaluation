Advances in NIDSs have made it challenging for attackers, who must execute attacks without being detected by these systems.

Hydrogen can contribute substantially to the reduction of carbon emissions in industry and transportation.

In this study, we link a electrolytic hydrogen supply chain model with an electricity system dispatch model, for a cross-sectoral case study of Germany in 2030. We find that hydrogen infrastructure investments and their effects on the electricity system are strongly influenced by electricity prices. Given current uniform prices, hydrogen production increases congestion costs in the electricity grid by 17%. In contrast, passing spatially resolved electricity price signals leads to electrolyzers being placed at low-cost grid nodes and further away from consumption centers. This causes lower end-use costs for hydrogen. Moreover, congestion management costs decrease substantially, by up to 20% compared to the benchmark case without hydrogen.
