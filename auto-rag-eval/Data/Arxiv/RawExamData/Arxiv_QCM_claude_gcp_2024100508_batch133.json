The conventional wisdom of mean-variance (MV) portfolio theory asserts that the nature of the relationship between risk and diversification is a decreasing asymptotic function, with the asymptote approximating the level of portfolio systematic risk or undiversifiable risk. This literature assumes that investors hold an equally-weighted or a MV portfolio and quantify portfolio diversification using portfolio size. However, the equally-weighted portfolio and portfolio size are MV optimal if and only if asset returns distribution is exchangeable or investors have no useful information about asset expected return and risk. Moreover, the whole of literature, absolutely all of it, focuses only on risky assets, ignoring the role of the risk free asset in the efficient diversification. Therefore, it becomes interesting and important to answer this question: how valid is this conventional wisdom when investors have full information about asset expected return and risk and asset returns distribution is not exchangeable in both the case where the risk free rate is available or not?

It points out several limitations, but the most comprehensive answer is C. The text explicitly states that \"the whole of literature, absolutely all of it, focuses only on risky assets, ignoring the role of the risk free asset in the efficient diversification.\" Additionally, it mentions that the equally-weighted portfolio is only optimal \"if and only if asset returns distribution is exchangeable or investors have no useful information about asset expected return and risk.\" These assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, making C the most accurate representation of the limitations described in the passage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the conventional wisdom does acknowledge systematic risk (it's mentioned as the asymptote of the risk-diversification function).

We study the non-adiabatic effects in braidings of Ising-type anyons, namely Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, using the formalism of time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Using this formalism, we consider non-adiabatic corrections to non-Abelian statistics from: (1) tunneling splitting of anyons imposing an additional dynamical phase to the transformation of ground states; (2) transitions to excited states that are potentially destructive to non-Abelian statistics since the non-local fermion occupation can be spoiled by such processes.

By explicitly modeling the changes, one can even generate data in new domains using the generating process with new values for the latent variables in G-DAN.

The color sensation evoked by an object depends on both the spectral power distribution of the illumination and the reflectance properties of the object being illuminated. The color sensation can be characterized by three color-space values, such as XYZ, RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, etc. It is straightforward to compute the three values given the illuminant and reflectance curves. The converse process of computing a reflectance curve given the color-space values and the illuminant is complicated by the fact that an infinite number of different reflectance curves can give rise to a single set of color-space values (metamerism). This paper presents five algorithms for generating a reflectance curve from a specified sRGB triplet, written for a general audience. The algorithms are designed to generate reflectance curves that are similar to those found with naturally occurring colored objects. The computed reflectance curves are compared to a database of thousands of reflectance curves measured from paints and pigments available both commercially and in nature, and the similarity is quantified. One particularly useful application of these algorithms is in the field of computer graphics, where modeling color transformations sometimes requires wavelength-specific information, such as when modeling subtractive color mixture."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of color science and computer graphics, which of the following statements best describes the challenge and significance of generating reflectance curves from sRGB triplets?\n\nA) It's a trivial process with a unique solution for each sRGB triplet.\nB) It's complex due to metamerism, but has limited practical applications.\nC) It's straightforward and primarily used for calibrating digital cameras.\nD) It's complicated by metamerism and has important applications in modeling color transformations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

One strategy for winning a coevolutionary struggle is to evolve rapidly. Most of the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and looks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative strategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid evolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we construct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process information, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing. In this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a way that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure of the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the adversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep fitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We suggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, we cite evidence that the immune control logic is phylogenetically conserved in mammalian lineages.
