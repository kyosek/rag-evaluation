Concepts related to three kinds of shared factories which deal respectively with sharing production-orders, manufacturing-resources and manufacturing-capabilities, are defined accordingly. These three kinds of shared factory modes can be used for building correspondent sharing manufacturing ecosystems. On the basis of sharing economic analysis, we identify feasible key enabled technologies for configuring and running a shared factory. At the same time, opportunities and challenges of enabling the shared factory are also analyzed in detail. In fact, shared factory, as a new production node, enhances the sharing nature of social manufacturing paradigm, fits the needs of light assets and gives us a new chance to use socialized manufacturing resources.

The classical term is sub-dominant, while the non-classical term is dominant.\n\nCorrect Answer: A) The two large deviation terms are a classical term related to the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations and a non-classical term related to the concept of \"sub-instantons\" emanating from the repelling line. The classical term is sub-dominant, while the non-classical term is dominant.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A) because the documentation states that the stationary distribution of the system satisfies a large deviation principle containing two competing terms: i) a classical but sub-dominant large deviation term, which can be derived from the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations by studying the fluctuation paths or instantons of the system near the attracting line, and ii) a dominant large deviation term, which does not follow from the Freidlin-Wentzell theory, as it is related to fluctuation paths of zero action, referred to as sub-instantons, emanating from the repelling line."}, "19": {"documentation": {"title": "A Smeary Central Limit Theorem for Manifolds with Application to High\n  Dimensional Spheres", "source": "Benjamin Eltzner and Stephan F.

In this work we study a setting where relaxation to a steady state is exact, namely for the Bose-Hubbard model where the system is quenched from a Mott quantum phase to the strong superfluid regime. We find that the evolving state locally relaxes to a steady state with maximum entropy constrained by second moments, maximizing the entanglement, to a state which is different from the thermal state of the new Hamiltonian. Remarkably, in the infinite system limit this relaxation is true for all large times, and no time average is necessary. For large but finite system size we give a time interval for which the system locally \"looks relaxed\" up to a prescribed error. Our argument includes a central limit theorem for harmonic systems and exploits the finite speed of sound. Additionally, we show that for all periodic initial configurations, reminiscent of charge density waves, the system relaxes locally.

We find that the fluctuations of the population making certain decisions (the volatility) depends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of strategies. When the diversity decreases, more agents tend to adapt their strategies together.
