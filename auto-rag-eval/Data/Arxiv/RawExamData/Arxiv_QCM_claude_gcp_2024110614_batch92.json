We show that within a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model the critical density for a phase transition to color superconducting quark matter under neutron star conditions can be low enough for these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below 1.3 M_solar. We study the cooling of these objects in isolation for different values of the gravitational mass. Our equation of state (EoS) allows for 2SC quark matter with a large quark gap \\~100 MeV for u and d quarks of two colors that coexists with normal quark matter within a mixed phase in the hybrid star interior. We argue that, if the phases with unpaired quarks were allowed, the corresponding hybrid stars would cool too fast. If they occured for M < 1.3 M_solar, as it follows from our EoS, one could not appropriately describe the neutron star cooling data existing by today. We discuss a \"2SC+X\" phase, as a possibility to have all quarks paired in two-flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints, where the X-gap is of the order of 10 keV - 1 MeV. Density independent gaps do not allow to fit the cooling data.

Condensation phenomena arise through a collective behaviour of particles. They are observed in both classical and quantum systems, ranging from the formation of traffic jams in mass transport models to the macroscopic occupation of the energetic ground state in ultra-cold bosonic gases (Bose-Einstein condensation). Recently, it has been shown that a driven and dissipative system of bosons may form multiple condensates. Which states become the condensates has, however, remained elusive thus far. The dynamics of this condensation are described by coupled birth-death processes, which also occur in evolutionary game theory. Here, we apply concepts from evolutionary game theory to explain the formation of multiple condensates in such driven-dissipative bosonic systems. We show that vanishing of relative entropy production determines their selection. The condensation proceeds exponentially fast, but the system never comes to rest. Instead, the occupation numbers of condensates may oscillate, as we demonstrate for a rock-paper-scissors game of condensates."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a driven-dissipative bosonic system exhibiting multiple condensates, researchers observe oscillating occupation numbers among the condensates.

As the heavy-traffic parameter \u03b5 approaches zero, which of the following best describes the behavior of the mean queue length in the prelimit system compared to its heavy-traffic limit?\n\nA) It will be exactly O(1/\u03b5) away from the heavy-traffic limit\nB) It will be O(log(1/\u03b5)) away from the heavy-traffic limit, regardless of the Complete Resource Pooling (CRP) condition\nC) It will be O(log(1/\u03b5)) away from the heavy-traffic limit only if the CRP condition is satisfied\nD) It will be O(\u03b5) away from the heavy-traffic limit as \u03b5 approaches zero\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the key findings in the paper regarding the behavior of queue lengths in heavy traffic conditions. The correct answer is B because the documentation states: \"we show that the mean queue length of the prelimit system is only O(log(1/\u03b5)) away from its heavy-traffic limit. We do this even when the so called complete resource pooling (CRP) condition is not satisfied.\"\n\nThis result is significant because it holds true regardless of whether the CRP condition is met. Option A is incorrect because O(1/\u03b5) represents the steady-state mean queue length in the heavy-traffic regime, not the difference between the prelimit system and its limit. Option C is a distractor that might appeal to those who misunderstand the role of the CRP condition; while the CRP condition is mentioned, it's not required for the O(log(1/\u03b5)) bound. Option D is incorrect and represents a much smaller difference than what is actually observed.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (heavy traffic analysis, MaxWeight algorithm, CRP condition) and applies them to a real-world scenario (cloud computing data center).

Frequently, the resulting reduced-order model (ROM) violates intrinsic physical properties of the original full-order model (FOM) (e.g., global conservation, Lagrangian structure, state-variable bounds) because the projection process does not generally ensure preservation of these properties.

This answer aligns with the key insights from the documentation:\n\n1. The paper introduces \"a novel approach to nonmyopic approximations of the optimal policy that admits efficient computation.\"\n2.

The goal of active search is to \"identify as many members of a given class as possible,\" which matches the team's objective of maximizing successful drug candidate identifications.\n\nOption A (greedy algorithm) is suboptimal because it would likely focus too heavily on exploitation without adequate exploration, potentially missing valuable candidates in unexplored areas of the database.\n\nOption B (random sampling) would not take advantage of the information gained from previous queries and would be inefficient in identifying drug candidates.\n\nOption D (fixed batch querying) is not the best choice because the documentation mentions an \"adaptivity gap\" in batch settings, indicating that batch querying can be less effective than sequential querying. Additionally, using a fixed batch size doesn't allow for the dynamic balancing of exploration and exploitation.\n\nThe correct answer (C) represents a more sophisticated approach that aligns with the paper's findings on efficient nonmyopic active search, which can \"automatically trade off exploration and exploitation\" and has demonstrated \"superior performance\" in drug discovery applications."}, "92": {"documentation": {"title": "Spin Wave Based Approximate 4:2 Compressor", "source": "Abdulqader Mahmoud, Frederic Vanderveken, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph\n  Adelmann, Said Hamdioui, and Sorin Cotofana", "docs_id": "2109.09554", "section": ["cond-mat.mes-hall", "physics.app-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Spin Wave Based Approximate 4:2 Compressor.

To empirically test this prediction, I compile one of the most comprehensive datasets to date on the political careers of all district attorneys in office during the steepest rise in incarceration in U.S. history (roughly 1986-2006). Using quasi-experimental methods, I find causal evidence that being in a DA election year increases total admissions per capita and total months sentenced per capita.
