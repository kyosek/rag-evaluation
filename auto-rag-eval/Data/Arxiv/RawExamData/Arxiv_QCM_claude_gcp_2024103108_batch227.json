We develop an analytical framework to study experimental design in two-sided marketplaces. Many of these experiments exhibit interference, where an intervention applied to one market participant influences the behavior of another participant. This interference leads to biased estimates of the treatment effect of the intervention. We develop a stochastic market model and associated mean field limit to capture dynamics in such experiments, and use our model to investigate how the performance of different designs and estimators is affected by marketplace interference effects. Platforms typically use two common experimental designs: demand-side (\"customer\") randomization (CR) and supply-side (\"listing\") randomization (LR), along with their associated estimators. We show that good experimental design depends on market balance: in highly demand-constrained markets, CR is unbiased, while LR is biased; conversely, in highly supply-constrained markets, LR is unbiased, while CR is biased. We also introduce and study a novel experimental design based on two-sided randomization (TSR) where both customers and listings are randomized to treatment and control.

Graphs with well-defined limits can be seen as samples from manifolds. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the stability properties of convolutional neural networks on manifolds to understand the stability of GNNs on large graphs.

We empirically find that when the order flow predictability increases in one direction, the liquidity in the opposite side decreases, but the probability that a trade moves the price decreases significantly. While the last mechanism is able to counterbalance the persistence of order flow and restore efficiency and diffusivity, the first acts in opposite direction. We introduce a statistical order book model where the persistence of the order flow is mitigated by adjusting the market order volume to the predictability of the order flow. The model reproduces the diffusive behaviour of prices at all time scales without fine-tuning the values of parameters, as well as the behaviour of most order book quantities as a function of the local predictability of order flow."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the adaptive nature of liquidity taking in limit order books, which combination of mechanisms best describes how market efficiency is maintained despite the persistence of order flow?\n\nA) Asymmetric liquidity and increased price movement probability\nB) Decreased liquidity on the opposite side and increased price movement probability\nC) Asymmetric liquidity and decreased price movement probability\nD) Decreased liquidity on the opposite side and decreased price movement probability\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the complex interplay between order flow persistence, market efficiency, and adaptive mechanisms in limit order books. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while asymmetric liquidity is a key mechanism, increased price movement probability would exacerbate the issue rather than maintain efficiency.\n\nOption B is incorrect on both counts.

Likelihood-free methods are an established approach for performing approximate Bayesian inference for models with intractable likelihood functions. However, they can be computationally demanding. Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) is a popular such method that approximates the likelihood function of the summary statistic with a known, tractable distribution -- typically Gaussian -- and then performs statistical inference using standard likelihood-based techniques. However, as the number of summary statistics grows, the number of model simulations required to accurately estimate the covariance matrix for this likelihood rapidly increases. This poses significant challenge for the application of BSL, especially in cases where model simulation is expensive. In this article we propose whitening BSL (wBSL) -- an efficient BSL method that uses approximate whitening transformations to decorrelate the summary statistics at each algorithm iteration.

The passage explicitly mentions that for heavy triplets with masses in the TeV scale, their decay products (including SM gauge bosons or Higgs boson) can be sufficiently boosted, leading to a fat jet. This is a key detection strategy for these particles at electron-positron and electron-proton colliders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the triplets have zero hypercharge, this doesn't make them undetectable. In fact, the passage discusses how to detect them.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it mentions GeV range masses and distinct jets, whereas the passage specifically talks about TeV scale masses and fat jets (which are not easily distinguishable as separate jets).\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage emphasizes that the mixings between light and heavy mass eigenstates of neutral leptons play important roles in studying the charged and neutral multiplets of triplet fermions at colliders."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Log-Periodic Oscillation Analysis and Possible Burst of the \"Gold\n  Bubble\" in April - June 2011", "source": "Sergey V.

Our calculations indicate that this dynamics is close to the one of the \"bubbles\" studied by Sornette and that the most probable timing of the \"burst of the gold bubble\" is April - June 2011. The obtained result has been additionally checked with two different methods. First of all, we have compared the pattern of changes of the forecasted timing of the gold bubble crash with the retrospective changes of forecasts of the oil bubble crash (that took place in July 2008). This comparison indicates that the period when the timing of the crash tended to change is close to the end, and the burst of the gold bubble is the most probable in May or June 2011. Secondly, we used the estimates of critical time for the hyperbolic trend (that has been shown in our previous publications to be typical for many socioeconomic processes). Our calculations with this method also indicate May - June 2011 as the most probable time of the burst of the gold bubble. Naturally, this forecast should not be regarded as an exact prediction as this implies the stability of the finance policies of the USA, European Union, and China, whereas a significant intervention of giant players (like the Federal Reserve System, or the Central Bank of China) could affect the course of the exchange game in a rather significant way.

Expanding evolutionary ecology with learning\n  theory. Understanding how the structure of community interactions is modified by coevolution is vital for understanding system responses to change at all scales. However, in absence of a group selection process, collective community behaviours cannot be organised or adapted in a Darwinian sense. An open question thus persists: are there alternative organising principles that enable us to understand how coevolution of component species creates complex collective behaviours exhibited at the community level? We address this issue using principles from connectionist learning, a discipline with well-developed theories of emergent behaviours in simple networks. We identify conditions where selection on ecological interactions is equivalent to 'unsupervised learning' (a simple type of connectionist learning) and observe that this enables communities to self organize without community-level selection.
