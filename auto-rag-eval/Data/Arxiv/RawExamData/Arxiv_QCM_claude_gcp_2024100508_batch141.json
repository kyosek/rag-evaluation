To study the implications of such a scenario, the dynamical evolution of a chemically nonequilibrated system is described by the ideal (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics with a time dependent (anti)quark fugacity.

As a result of the analysis, in addition to economic factor variables, variables of climatic, amenity, and human factors correlated with the inflow rate, and it was shown that the model has the greatest explanatory power when multiple factors were used in addition to specific factors.

Deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have been successful for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification.

This domain can utilize CNNs to translate histopathological images into precise diagnostics. This is challenging since these complex biopsies are heterogeneous and require multiple levels of assessment. This is mainly due to structural similarities in different parts of the GI tract and shared features among different gut diseases.

There is an opportunity in modern power systems to explore the demand flexibility by incentivizing consumers with dynamic prices. In this paper, we quantify demand flexibility using an efficient tool called time-varying elasticity, whose value may change depending on the prices and decision dynamics. This tool is particularly useful for evaluating the demand response potential and system reliability. Recent empirical evidences have highlighted some abnormal features when studying demand flexibility, such as delayed responses and vanishing elasticities after price spikes. Existing methods fail to capture these complicated features because they heavily rely on some predefined (often over-simplified) regression expressions.

The Bayesian paradigm is becoming an increasingly popular framework for estimation and uncertainty quantification of unknown parameters in geo-physical inversion problems.
