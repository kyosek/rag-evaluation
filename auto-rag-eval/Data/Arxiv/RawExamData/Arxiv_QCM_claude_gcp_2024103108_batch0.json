            "text": "Active particles in reactive disordered media: how does adsorption\n  affects diffusion?. In this work we study analytically and numerically the transport properties of non-interacting active particles moving on a $d$-dimensional disordered media. The disorder in the space is modeled by means of a set of non-overlapping spherical obstacles. We assume that obstacles are reactive in the sense that they react in the presence of the particles in an attractive manner: when the particle collides with an obstacle, it is attached during a random time (adsorption time), i.e., it gets adsorbed by an obstacle; thereafter the particle is detached from the obstacle and continues its motion in a random direction. We give an analytical formula for the effective diffusion coefficient when the mean adsorption time is finite. When the mean adsorption time is infinite, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a normal to anomalous diffusion regime. We also show that another transition takes place in the mean number of adsorbed particles: in the anomalous diffusion phase all the particles become adsorbed in the average. We show that the fraction of adsorbed particles, seen as an order parameter of the system, undergoes a second-order-like phase transition, because the fraction of adsorbed particles is not differentiable but changes continuously as a function of a parameter of the model."

The system undergoes a transition from a normal to anomalous diffusion regime.\n2. In the anomalous diffusion phase, all the particles become adsorbed on average.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the system does not maintain normal diffusion when the mean adsorption time is infinite; it transitions to anomalous diffusion.\n\nAnswer B is not mentioned in the given information and is likely incorrect, as the study focuses on the transition to anomalous diffusion rather than the diffusion coefficient becoming zero.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the fraction of adsorbed particles is described as undergoing a \"second-order-like phase transition\" where the fraction changes continuously but is not differentiable, rather than a first-order phase transition.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of the complex behavior of the system when the mean adsorption time becomes infinite, requiring them to synthesize multiple pieces of information from the text."

Representations of probability measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces provide a flexible framework for fully nonparametric hypothesis tests of independence, which can capture any type of departure from independence, including nonlinear associations and multivariate interactions. However, these approaches come with an at least quadratic computational cost in the number of observations, which can be prohibitive in many applications. Arguably, it is exactly in such large-scale datasets that capturing any type of dependence is of interest, so striking a favourable tradeoff between computational efficiency and test performance for kernel independence tests would have a direct impact on their applicability in practice. In this contribution, we provide an extensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context of independence testing, contrasting block-based, Nystrom and random Fourier feature approaches. Through a variety of synthetic data experiments, it is demonstrated that our novel large scale methods give comparable performance with existing methods whilst using significantly less computation time and memory."

The passage states that kernel independence tests \"come with an at least quadratic computational cost in the number of observations, which can be prohibitive in many applications.\" This identifies the main challenge. The proposed solution is then described: \"we provide an extensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context of independence testing.\" The goal is to strike \"a favourable tradeoff between computational efficiency and test performance.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage actually states that these tests can already capture nonlinear associations.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the text mentions that these tests can already capture \"multivariate interactions.\"\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in identifying memory as an issue, but it's too narrow.

We investigate the use of the Hurst exponent, dynamically computed over a moving time-window, to evaluate the level of stability/instability of financial firms. Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 2007-2010 credit crisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the period preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to other market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show opposite behaviors. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling behavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we introduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns larger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way large fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent past. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the log-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated with the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price dynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling."

The biconical region contains a variety of complex features, including two arc-like structures within $\\sim 2\\arcsec$ of the active nucleus that appear to be associated with the extended radio continuum emission in the sense that the radio lobes lie just inside the centroids of the emission-line arcs.

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C4.2 circular-ribbon flare in active region (AR) 12434 on 2015 October 16. The short-lived flare was associated with positive magnetic polarities and a negative polarity inside, as revealed by the photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Such magnetic pattern is strongly indicative of a magnetic null point and spine-fan configuration in the corona. The flare was triggered by the eruption of a mini-filament residing in the AR, which produced the inner flare ribbon (IFR) and the southern part of a closed circular flare ribbon (CFR). When the eruptive filament reached the null point, it triggered null point magnetic reconnection with the ambient open field and generated the bright CFR and a blowout jet.

The 2008 financial crisis illustrated the need for a thorough, functional understanding of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures. Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult, most recent studies of this problem have relied on numerical simulations. Here we report analytical results in a network model of interbank lending based on directly relevant financial parameters, such as interest rates and leverage ratios. Using a mean-field approach, we obtain a closed-form formula for the \"critical degree\", viz. the number of creditors per bank below which an individual shock can propagate throughout the network. We relate the failures distribution (probability that a single shock induces $F$ failures) to the degree distribution (probability that a bank has $k$ creditors), showing in particular that the former is fat-tailed whenever the latter is. Our criterion for the onset of contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for cooperation to evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent calls for a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology."

We compute the distributions of charged particles at large transverse momenta in $p\\bar p(p)$, $pA$ and $AA$ collisions in the framework of perturbative QCD, by using collinear factorization and the modern PDFs and fragmentation functions. At the highest cms-energies the shape of the spectra measured in $p\\bar p(p)$ collisions at large $q_T$ can be well explained. The difference between the data and the lowest-order computation is quantified in terms of a constant $K$-factor for each energy. The $K$-factor is found to systematically decrease with growing $\\sqrt s$. Also a lower limit for the partonic transverse momentum, $p_0$, is extracted for each $\\sqrt s$ based on the comparison with the measurements. A systematic increase of $p_0$ as a function of $\\sqrt s$ is found. Nuclear effects in the charged-particle spectra in $pA$ and $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC are studied in the framework of collinear factorization by applying the EKS98 nuclear corrections to the parton distributions.

Research in diabetes, especially when it comes to building data-driven models to forecast future glucose values, is hindered by the sensitive nature of the data.

This paper aims at comparing the most promising algorithms in the field, namely Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks, Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gaussian Processes (GP). They are personalized and trained on a population of 10 virtual children from the Type 1 Diabetes Metabolic Simulator software to predict future glucose values at a prediction horizon of 30 minutes. The performances of the models are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Continuous Glucose-Error Grid Analysis (CG-EGA). While most of the models end up having low RMSE, the GP model with a Dot-Product kernel (GP-DP), a novel usage in the context of glucose prediction, has the lowest. Despite having good RMSE values, we show that the models do not necessarily exhibit a good clinical acceptability, measured by the CG-EGA.

Writing magnetic bits by spin-orbit torques (SOTs) arising from spin Hall effect creates new possibilities for ultrafast and low-power magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). For perpendicular MRAM, an extra in-plane field is required to break the symmetry for the deterministic SOT writing of the perpendicular storage layer. Although schemes have been demonstrated in external-field-free SOT switching of a perpendicular layer, practically integrating them with perpendicular MTJs still appears to be challenging. Here, we present experimental demonstration of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) switching a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device without applying an external magnetic field. An Ir layer is used to serve dual-purpose of both injecting the pure spin current via spin Hall effect and mediating an in-plane exchange field to the perpendicular free layer of the MTJ. Robust field-free SOT switching with pulsed write path current is demonstrated for various MTJ sizes ranging from 50 nm to 500 nm.

According to the documentation, the Iridium (Ir) layer serves a dual purpose in the field-free spin-orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions. First, it injects pure spin current via the spin Hall effect, which is crucial for generating the spin-orbit torques needed for switching.

Advances in computational cognitive neuroimaging research are related to the availability of large amounts of labeled brain imaging data, but such data are scarce and expensive to generate. While powerful data generation mechanisms, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been designed in the last decade for computer vision, such improvements have not yet carried over to brain imaging. A likely reason is that GANs training is ill-suited to the noisy, high-dimensional and small-sample data available in functional neuroimaging. In this paper, we introduce Conditional Independent Components Analysis (Conditional ICA): a fast functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data augmentation technique, that leverages abundant resting-state data to create images by sampling from an ICA decomposition. We then propose a mechanism to condition the generator on classes observed with few samples. We first show that the generative mechanism is successful at synthesizing data indistinguishable from observations, and that it yields gains in classification accuracy in brain decoding problems. In particular it outperforms GANs while being much easier to optimize and interpret. Lastly, Conditional ICA enhances classification accuracy in eight datasets without further parameters tuning."

The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has now operated in space for 7 years and returned nearly continuous observations that have led to scientific discoveries and reshaped our entire understanding of the outer heliosphere and its interaction with the local interstellar medium. Here we extend prior work, adding the 2014-2015 data for the first time, and examine, validate, initially analyze, and provide a complete 7-year set of Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations from ~0.1 to 6 keV. The data, maps, and documentation provided here represent the 10th major release of IBEX data and include improvements to various prior corrections to provide the citable reference for the current version of IBEX data. We are now able to study time variations in the outer heliosphere and interstellar interaction over more than half a solar cycle. We find that the Ribbon has evolved differently than the globally distributed flux (GDF), with a leveling off and partial recovery of ENAs from the GDF, owing to solar wind output flattening and recovery. The Ribbon has now also lost its latitudinal ordering, which reflects the breakdown of solar minimum solar wind conditions and exhibits a greater time delay than for the surrounding GDF. Together, the IBEX observations strongly support a secondary ENA source for the Ribbon, and we suggest that this be adopted as the nominal explanation of the Ribbon going forward."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The IBEX observations over 7 years have revealed differences in the evolution of the Ribbon compared to the globally distributed flux (GDF) of Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs). Which of the following statements best describes these differences and their implications?\n\nA) The Ribbon has shown a consistent increase in ENA flux, while the GDF has remained stable, suggesting that the Ribbon is primarily influenced by local interstellar medium conditions.\n\nB) Both the Ribbon and GDF have exhibited similar patterns of ENA flux variation, indicating that they are equally affected by solar wind output changes.\n\nC) The GDF has shown a leveling off and partial recovery of ENA flux due to solar wind output changes, while the Ribbon has lost its latitudinal ordering and exhibits a greater time delay, supporting a secondary ENA source for the Ribbon.\n\nD) The Ribbon has maintained its latitudinal ordering throughout the observation period, while the GDF has shown more dramatic fluctuations, suggesting that the Ribbon is more directly linked to solar wind conditions than previously thought.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the key findings presented in the documentation. The passage states that the GDF has shown a \"leveling off and partial recovery of ENAs\" due to \"solar wind output flattening and recovery.\" In contrast, the Ribbon has \"lost its latitudinal ordering\" and \"exhibits a greater time delay than for the surrounding GDF.\" These observations are said to \"strongly support a secondary ENA source for the Ribbon.\" This difference in behavior between the Ribbon and the GDF, and the implications for the Ribbon's source, are central to the new understanding gained from the 7-year IBEX data set."

Signomial Programming (SP) has proven to be a powerful tool for engineering design optimization, striking a balance between the computational efficiency of Geometric Programming (GP) and the extensibility of more general optimization methods like Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). But when an existing engineering analysis tool is incompatible with the mathematics of the SP formulation, options are limited. Previous literature has suggested schemes for fitting GP compatible models to pre-computed data, but no methods have yet been proposed that take advantage of the increased modeling flexibility available in SP. This paper describes a new Soft Difference of Max Affine (SDMA) function class that is constructed from existing methods of GP compatible fitting and the theory of Difference of Convex (DC) functions. When a SDMA function is fit to data in log-log transformed space, it becomes either a signomial or a set of signomials upon inverse transformation. Three examples of fitting are presented here, including simple test cases in 2D and 3D, and a fit to the performance data of the NACA 24xx family of airfoils. In each case, RMS error is driven to less than 1%."

In this paper, we study the design and analysis of optimal detection scheme for sensors that are deployed to monitor the change in the environment and are powered by the energy harvested from the environment. In this type of applications, detection delay is of paramount importance. We model this problem as quickest change detection problem with a stochastic energy constraint. In particular, a wireless sensor powered by renewable energy takes observations from a random sequence, whose distribution will change at a certain unknown time. Such a change implies events of interest. The energy in the sensor is consumed by taking observations and is replenished randomly. The sensor cannot take observations if there is no energy left in the battery. Our goal is to design a power allocation scheme and a detection strategy to minimize the worst case detection delay, which is the difference between the time when an alarm is raised and the time when the change occurs. Two types of average run length (ARL) constraint, namely an algorithm level ARL constraint and an system level ARL constraint, are considered. We propose a low complexity scheme in which the energy allocation rule is to spend energy to take observations as long as the battery is not empty and the detection scheme is the Cumulative Sum test.

This study evaluates the replacing of the recurrent LSTM network previously investigated by a convolutive U-net under more stressing conditions with an additional second competitive speaker.

Second, each expanded lattice is converted into a minimal list of hypotheses that covers every arc. Each hypothesis is constrained to be the best path for at least one arc it includes. For each lattice, the neural LM scores of the minimal list are computed in parallel and are then integrated back to the lattice in the rescoring stage.

However, the applicability of such a relaxation is poorly understood. We define a broad class of friendly graphs characterized by an easily verifiable spectral property. We prove that for friendly graphs, the convex relaxation is guaranteed to find the exact isomorphism or certify its inexistence. This result is further extended to approximately isomorphic graphs, for which we develop an explicit bound on the amount of weight disagreement under which the relaxation is guaranteed to find the globally optimal approximate isomorphism. We also show that in many cases, the graph matching problem can be further harmlessly relaxed to a convex quadratic program with only n separable linear equality constraints, which is substantially more efficient than the standard relaxation involving 2n equality and n^2 inequality constraints.

Yet reference protein interaction networks lack such contextualization, thereby limiting the study of where protein interactions likely occur in the human body and how they may be altered in disease. Contextualized protein interactions could better characterize genes with disease-specific interactions and elucidate diseases' manifestation in specific cell types. Here, we introduce AWARE, a graph neural message passing approach to inject cellular and tissue context into protein embeddings. AWARE optimizes for a multi-scale embedding space, whose structure reflects network topology at a single-cell resolution. We construct a multi-scale network of the Human Cell Atlas and apply AWARE to learn protein, cell type, and tissue embeddings that uphold cell type and tissue hierarchies. We demonstrate AWARE's utility on the novel task of predicting whether a protein is altered in disease and where that association most likely manifests in the human body. To this end, AWARE outperforms generic embeddings without contextual information by at least 12.5%, showing AWARE's potential to reveal context-dependent roles of proteins in disease."

Ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the laboratory provide a unique chance to study quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme temperature (${\\approx}150\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) and density (${\\approx}1\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathrm{fm}^3$) conditions. Over the past decade, experimental results from LHC have shown further evidence for the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a phase that is thought to permeate the early Universe and is formed in the high-density neutron-star cores. Various QCD predictions that model the behavior of the low-$x$ gluon nuclear density, a poorly explored region, are also tested. Since the photon flux per ion scales as the square of the emitting electric charge $Z^2$, cross sections of so far elusive photon-induced processes are extremely enhanced as compared to nucleon-nucleon collisions. Here, we review recent progress on CMS measurements of particle production with large transverse momentum or mass, photon-initiated processes, jet-induced medium response, and heavy quark production.

We derive the quantum kinetic theory for fermions with arbitrary mass in a background electromagnetic field from the Wigner-function approach. Since spin of massive fermions is a dynamical degree of freedom, the kinetic equations with the leading-order quantum corrections describe entangled dynamics of not only the vector- and axial-charge distributions but also of the spin polarization. Therefore, we obtain one scalar and one axial-vector kinetic equations with magnetization currents pertinent to the spin-orbit interaction. We show that our results smoothly reduce to the massless limit where the spin of massless fermions is no longer an independent dynamical degree of freedom but is enslaved by the chirality and momentum and the accordingly kinetic equations turn into the chiral kinetic theory for Weyl fermions. We provide a kinetic theory covering both the massive and massless cases, and hence resolves the problem in constructing the bridge between them.

Key performance factors are weather resistance and the possibility to directly measure velocity. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data in early processing stages are required to run directly on specialized hardware, i.e. the radar sensor. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. However, these models typically contain millions of parameters, stored in hundreds of megabytes of memory, and require additional memory during execution. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization potential of different CNN-based model architectures and sizes by considering (i) quantized weights and (ii) piecewise constant activation functions, which results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and during the inference step respectively."

There, cross section calculations and particle production cannot be treated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy conservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not concerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend crucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero.

Responsible for many complex human diseases including cancers, disrupted or abnormal gene interactions can be identified through their expression changes correlating with the progression of a disease. However, the examination of all possible combinatorial interactions between gene features in a genome-wide case-control study is computationally infeasible as the search space is exponential in nature. In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach, QUIRE, to identify discriminative complex interactions among informative gene features for cancer diagnosis. QUIRE works in two stages, where it first identifies functionally relevant feature groups for the disease and, then explores the search space capturing the combinatorial relationships among the genes from the selected informative groups. Using QUIRE, we explore the differential patterns and the interactions among informative gene features in three different types of cancers, Renal Cell Carcinoma(RCC), Ovarian Cancer(OVC) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Our experimental results show that QUIRE identifies gene-gene interactions that can better identify the different cancer stages of samples and can predict CRC recurrence and death from CRC more successfully, as compared to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods. A literature survey shows that many of the interactions identified by QUIRE play important roles in the development of cancer."

In the first stage, it identifies functionally relevant feature groups for the disease. This step helps to narrow down the search space to genes that are likely to be involved in the disease process. In the second stage, QUIRE explores the search space capturing the combinatorial relationships among the genes from the selected informative groups. This two-stage approach allows QUIRE to efficiently identify complex gene-gene interactions that may be important in cancer development and progression, without having to examine all possible combinations of genes in the entire genome, which would be computationally infeasible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because QUIRE doesn't start with all gene-gene interactions, but rather begins by identifying relevant feature groups. Option B is incorrect because QUIRE doesn't explore the entire genome first, as this would be computationally inefficient.

            "text": "Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures. Discrete choice experiments are frequently used to quantify consumer preferences by having respondents choose between different alternatives. Choice experiments involving mixtures of ingredients have been largely overlooked in the literature, even though many products and services can be described as mixtures of ingredients. As a consequence, little research has been done on the optimal design of choice experiments involving mixtures. The only existing research has focused on D-optimal designs, which means that an estimation-based approach was adopted. However, in experiments with mixtures, it is crucial to obtain models that yield precise predictions for any combination of ingredient proportions. This is because the goal of mixture experiments generally is to find the mixture that optimizes the respondents' utility. As a result, the I-optimality criterion is more suitable for designing choice experiments with mixtures than the D-optimality criterion because the I-optimality criterion focuses on getting precise predictions with the estimated statistical model. In this paper, we study Bayesian I-optimal designs, compare them with their Bayesian D-optimal counterparts, and show that the former designs perform substantially better than the latter in terms of the variance of the predicted utility."

The D-optimality criterion, on the other hand, adopts an estimation-based approach, which may not be as effective for achieving precise predictions across all possible mixture combinations.

By complying with the induced socially accepted behavior, agents experience utility. Also, agents get utility from a pay-for-performance incentive mechanism. Thus, agents pursue two objectives. We place the interaction between social norms and performance-based incentive mechanisms in the complex environment of an organization with distributed decision-makers, in which a set of interdependent tasks is allocated to multiple agents.

We identify the symmetries of the system made of a heavy quark, a heavy antiquark, and glue in the static limit. Corrections to this limit can be obtained order by order in an expansion in the inverse of the mass $m$ of the heavy quark. At order $1/m$ in the expansion, we obtain at the level of potential Non-Relativistic QCD a system of coupled Schr\\\"odinger equations that describes hybrid spin-symmetry multiplets, including the mixing of different static energies into the hybrid states, an effect known as $\\Lambda$-doubling in molecular physics. In the short distance, the static potentials depend on two nonperturbative parameters, the gluelump mass and the quadratic slope, which can be determined from lattice calculations. We adopt a renormalon subtraction scheme for the calculation of the perturbative part of the potential. We numerically solve the coupled Schr\\\"odinger equations and obtain the masses for the lowest lying spin-symmetry multiplets for $c\\bar{c}$, $b\\bar{c}$, and $b\\bar{b}$ hybrids. The $\\Lambda$-doubling effect breaks the degeneracy between opposite parity spin-symmetry multiplets and lowers the mass of the multiplets that get mixed contributions of different static energies.

According to the documentation, this effect breaks the degeneracy between opposite parity spin-symmetry multiplets. More importantly, it lowers the mass of the multiplets that receive mixed contributions from different static energies.

Complex, asymmetric curvatures are employed to enhance the performance of optical components while minimizing their weight and size. Unfortunately, these asymmetric forms are often difficult to manufacture at the nanoscale with current technologies. Metasurfaces are planar sub-wavelength structures that can control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light, and can thereby mimic complex geometric curvatures on a flat, wavelength-scale thick surface. We present a methodology for designing analogues of freeform optics using a low contrast dielectric metasurface platform for operation at visible wavelengths. We demonstrate a cubic phase plate with a point spread function exhibiting enhanced depth of field over 300 {\\mu}m along the optical axis with potential for performing metasurface-based white light imaging, and an Alvarez lens with a tunable focal length range of over 2.5 mm with 100 {\\mu}m of total mechanical displacement.

By extending our recently developed approach based on a nonperturbative functional renormalization group combined with a supersymmetric formalism, we find that such a critical value indeed exists, provided one chooses a specific relation between the decay exponents of the interactions and of the disorder correlations.

The pre-thermal contribution is calculated by considering interaction among partons having large transverse momenta (jet-partons) after the initial interaction, and from passage of these partons through a thermalized quark gluon plasma. Charm production from pre-thermal processes is found to be comparable to that from prompt (initial) interactions at LHC.

We estimate the sensitivity of the upcoming CTA gamma-ray telescope to DM annihilation at the Galactic centre, improving on previous analyses in a number of significant ways. First, we perform a detailed analyses of all backgrounds, including diffuse astrophysical emission for the first time in a study of this type. Second, we present a statistical framework for including systematic errors and estimate the consequent degradation in sensitivity. These errors may come from e.g. event reconstruction, Monte Carlo determination of the effective area or uncertainty in atmospheric conditions. Third, we show that performing the analysis on a set of suitably optimised regions of interest makes it possible to partially compensate for the degradation in sensitivity caused by systematics and diffuse emission. To probe dark matter with the canonical thermal annihilation cross-section, CTA systematics like non-uniform variations in acceptance over a single field of view must be kept below the 0.3% level, unless the dark matter density rises more steeply in the centre of the Galaxy than predicted by a typical Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto profile.

In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by the percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving), and large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the upward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small particles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in large particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and the connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing large particles. Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes rotation and empowers more large particles to reach the top layer, implying that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our findings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add new evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective for the study of segregation."

The formula we obtain is able to reproduce with reasonable accuracy the results from available numerical simulations, but, more importantly, it can be used to investigate what configurations might give rise to interesting dynamics. In particular, we discuss scenarios which might give rise to a ``flip'' in the direction of the total angular momentum of the system.

Black hole B has a mass of 5 solar masses and is spinning slowly in the retrograde direction. Based on the approach described in the Arxiv documentation, which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the final black hole after the merger?\n\nA) The final black hole will have a spin close to the extremal value (a \u2248 1) due to the combination of the larger black hole's prograde spin and the orbital angular momentum.\n\nB) The final black hole will have a moderate spin value, as the retrograde spin of the smaller black hole will partially cancel out the prograde spin and orbital angular momentum contributions.\n\nC) The direction of the final black hole's spin will be opposite to the initial orbital angular momentum due to a \"flip\" caused by the retrograde spin of the smaller black hole.\n\nD) The final black hole will have zero spin, as the opposing spins and orbital angular momentum will cancel each other out completely.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The approach described in the documentation estimates the final angular momentum as the sum of individual spins plus the orbital angular momentum at the last stable orbit. In this scenario, we have competing factors:\n\n1. The larger black hole's prograde spin and the orbital angular momentum contribute positively to the final spin.\n2. The smaller black hole's retrograde spin contributes negatively to the final spin.\n3. The mass ratio (2:1) means the larger black hole's spin will have a more significant impact than the smaller one's.\n\nThe document states that \"it is not possible to spin-up a black hole to extremal values through merger scenarios irrespective of the mass ratio,\" ruling out option A. Option C is unlikely because a \"flip\" in angular momentum direction would require more extreme conditions, such as very high retrograde spins. Option D is implausible given the unequal masses and spins.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a moderate final spin value, as the retrograde spin of the smaller black hole will partially, but not completely, cancel out the prograde spin and orbital angular momentum contributions, making option B the best choice."

Model selection is crucial to high-dimensional learning and inference for contemporary big data applications in pinpointing the best set of covariates among a sequence of candidate interpretable models. Most existing work assumes implicitly that the models are correctly specified or have fixed dimensionality. Yet both features of model misspecification and high dimensionality are prevalent in practice. In this paper, we exploit the framework of model selection principles in misspecified models originated in Lv and Liu (2014) and investigate the asymptotic expansion of Bayesian principle of model selection in the setting of high-dimensional misspecified models. With a natural choice of prior probabilities that encourages interpretability and incorporates Kullback-Leibler divergence, we suggest the high-dimensional generalized Bayesian information criterion with prior probability (HGBIC_p) for large-scale model selection with misspecification. Our new information criterion characterizes the impacts of both model misspecification and high dimensionality on model selection. We further establish the consistency of covariance contrast matrix estimation and the model selection consistency of HGBIC_p in ultra-high dimensions under some mild regularity conditions. The advantages of our new method are supported by numerical studies."

Although Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived in the continent. Using random forest methodology, we analyse Afrobarometer data (N = 45,732), joint with climatic data, to explore what shapes climate change perceptions in Africa. We include 5 different dimensions of climate change perceptions: awareness, belief in its human cause, risk perception, need to stop it and self-efficacy. Results indicate that perceived agriculture conditions are crucial for perceiving climate change. Country-level factors and long-term changes in local weather conditions are among the most important predictors. Moreover, education level, access to information, poverty, authoritarian values, and trust in institutions shape individual climate change perceptions. Demographic effects -- including religion -- seem negligible. These findings suggest policymakers and environmental communicators how to frame climate change in Africa to raise awareness, gather public support and induce adaptation."

The phenomenon of jet quenching provides essential information about the properties of hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Recent results from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show evidence for an unexpectedly similar suppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. Furthermore, the role of radiative energy loss of heavy quarks is still under active discussion within the theoretical community. By employing the parton cascade Boltzmann Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings (BAMPS), which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann equation both for light and heavy flavor partons, we calculate the nuclear modification factor of inclusive and b-tagged reconstructed jets in 0-10% central $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm LHC}}$ = 2.76 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions. Based on perturbative QCD cross sections we find a suppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. While the inclusive jets are slightly too strong suppressed within BAMPS in comparison with data, both elastic+radiative and only elastic interactions lead to a realistic b-tagged jet suppression. To further investigate light and heavy flavor energy loss we predict the R dependence of inclusive and b-tagged jet suppression. Furthermore, we propose the medium modification of b-tagged jet shapes as an observable for discriminating between different heavy quark energy loss scenarios."

Relaxation oscillations in a real system are usually coupled to environmental noise, which further enriches their dynamics, but makes theoretical analysis of such systems and determination of the equation's parameter values a difficult task. In a companion paper we have proposed an analytic approach to a similar problem for another classical nonlinear model, the bistable Duffing oscillator.

We discuss a possible answer to the fundamental question of why nature would actually prefer low-scale supersymmetry, but end up with a supersymmetry scale that is not completely natural. This question is inevitable if we postulate that low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null observation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. As we argue in this paper, superparticles masses in the multi-TeV range can, in fact, be reconciled with the concept of naturalness by means of a cosmological selection effect--a selection effect based on the assumption of an exact discrete R-symmetry that is spontaneously broken by gaugino condensation in a pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In such theories, the dynamical scale of the Yang-Mills gauge interactions is required to be higher than the inflationary Hubble scale, in order to avoid the formation of domain walls. This results in a lower limit on the superparticle masses and leads us to conclude that, according to the idea of naturalness, the most probable range of superparticle masses is potentially located at the multi-TeV, if the inflationary Hubble rate is of O(10^{14}) GeV.

            "text": "Non-boost-invariant anisotropic dynamics. We study the non-boost-invariant evolution of a quark-gluon plasma subject to large early-time momentum-space anisotropies. Rather than using the canonical hydrodynamical expansion of the distribution function around an isotropic equilibrium state, we expand around a state which is anisotropic in momentum space and parameterize this state in terms of three proper-time and spatial-rapidity dependent parameters. Deviations from the Bjorken scaling solutions are naturally taken into account by the time evolution of the spatial-rapidity dependence of the anisotropic ansatz. As a result, we obtain three coupled partial differential equations for the momentum-space anisotropy, the typical momentum of the degrees of freedom, and the longitudinal flow. Within this framework (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion is obtained as an asymptotic limit. Finally, we make quantitative comparisons of the temporal and spatial-rapidity evolution of the dynamical parameters and resulting pressure anisotropy in both the strong and weak coupling limits."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of non-boost-invariant anisotropic dynamics of a quark-gluon plasma, which of the following statements is correct regarding the expansion of the distribution function and the resulting system of equations?\n\nA) The distribution function is expanded around an isotropic equilibrium state, resulting in five coupled partial differential equations.\n\nB) The distribution function is expanded around an anisotropic state in momentum space, parameterized by two time-dependent variables, leading to two coupled ordinary differential equations.\n\nC) The distribution function is expanded around an anisotropic state in momentum space, parameterized by three proper-time and spatial-rapidity dependent parameters, resulting in three coupled partial differential equations.\n\nD) The distribution function is expanded using a boost-invariant approach, leading to a single partial differential equation for the momentum-space anisotropy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that rather than using the canonical hydrodynamical expansion around an isotropic equilibrium state, the authors expand around a state which is anisotropic in momentum space. This anisotropic state is parameterized by three proper-time and spatial-rapidity dependent parameters. As a result, they obtain three coupled partial differential equations for the momentum-space anisotropy, the typical momentum of the degrees of freedom, and the longitudinal flow. This approach allows for deviations from the Bjorken scaling solutions and naturally accounts for the spatial-rapidity dependence in the time evolution."
