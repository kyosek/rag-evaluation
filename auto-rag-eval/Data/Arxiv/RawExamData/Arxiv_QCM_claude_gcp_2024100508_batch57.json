Diffusion has been widely used to describe a random walk of particles or waves, and it requires only one parameter -- the diffusion constant. For waves, however, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of interference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing diffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive interference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed paths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return probability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where waves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of localization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion coefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental observation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave transport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random media and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third dimension.

As an alternative, we propose that one should consider multiple interpretations of each event, generalizing the Qjets procedure to event-level analysis. With multiple interpretations, an event is no longer restricted to either satisfy cuts or not satisfy them - it can be assigned a weight between 0 and 1 based on how well it satisfies the cuts.

When the packet propagates along a chiral quantum Hall edge, we find that its electron density profile becomes more distorted from Lorentzian due to the generation of electron-hole excitations, as the interaction strength increases yet stays in a weak interaction regime. However, as the interaction strength becomes larger and enters a strong interaction regime, the distortion becomes weaker and eventually the Lorentzian packet shape is recovered. The recovery of the packet shape leads to an interesting feature of the interference visibility of the symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose two arms have the same interaction strength.

The Image-Based Rendering (IBR) approach using Shearlet Transform (ST) is one of the most effective methods for Densely-Sampled Light Field (DSLF) reconstruction. The ST-based DSLF reconstruction typically relies on an iterative thresholding algorithm for Epipolar-Plane Image (EPI) sparse regularization in shearlet domain, involving dozens of transformations between image domain and shearlet domain, which are in general time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, a novel learning-based ST approach, referred to as Deep Residual Shearlet Transform (DRST), is proposed in this paper. Specifically, for an input sparsely-sampled EPI, DRST employs a deep fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the residuals of the shearlet coefficients in shearlet domain in order to reconstruct a densely-sampled EPI in image domain. The DRST network is trained on synthetic Sparsely-Sampled Light Field (SSLF) data only by leveraging elaborately-designed masks.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles the dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still unable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This paper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the direction/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the literature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its magnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size based on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the optimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate past gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of AngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for computing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits the same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods reveal a superior performance of AngularGrad.
