This time, we treated the prey as the natural resources while the predator as the human population (still borrowed from the T-Function). After carefully choosing appropriate parameters to match the maximum carrying capacity with the saturated number of the human population predicted by the T-Function, we successfully calculated the natural resources as a function of time.

Recent efforts to address this issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones using label attributes.

In particular, cycleGAN has been demonstrated as a powerful unsupervised learning scheme to improve the low-dose CT image quality without requiring matched high-dose reference data. Unfortunately, one of the main limitations of the cycleGAN approach is that it requires two deep neural network generators at the training phase, although only one of them is used at the inference phase. The secondary auxiliary generator is needed to enforce the cycle-consistency, but the additional memory requirement and increases of the learnable parameters are the main huddles for cycleGAN training. To address this issue, here we propose a novel cycleGAN architecture using a single switchable generator.

We propose a stabilized Nitsche-based cut finite element formulation for the Oseen problem in which the boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the elements of an easy-to-generate background mesh.

Since the mesh does not fit the boundary, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed weakly by a stabilized Nitsche-type approach. The addition of CIP-like ghost-penalties in the boundary zone allows to prove that our method is inf-sup stable and to derive optimal order a priori error estimates in an energy-type norm, irrespective of how the boundary cuts the underlying mesh.
