Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink and then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a surprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a non-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent series coefficients describing the initial shape.

The main innovation of this method is that it simultaneously considers the internal geometric structures of the condition manifold and the gene manifold. Specifically, we obtain principal components (PCs) to represent the data and approximate the cluster membership indicators through Laplacian embedding. This new method is endowed with internal geometric structures, such as the condition manifold and gene manifold, which are both suitable for bi-clustering. A closed-form solution is provided for DGPCA. We apply this new method to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions (e.g., different samples) with the aim of finding internal \"checkerboard\" structures on gene expression data, if they exist. Then, we use this new method to identify regulatory genes under the particular conditions and to compare the results with those of other state-of-the-art PCA-based methods.
