We develop a theory of regularity for continuum Schr\\\"odinger operators based on the Martin compactification of the complement of the essential spectrum. This theory is inspired by Stahl--Totik regularity for orthogonal polynomials, but requires a different approach, since Stahl--Totik regularity is formulated in terms of the potential theoretic Green function with a pole at $\\infty$, logarithmic capacity, and the equilibrium measure for the support of the measure, notions which do not extend to the case of unbounded spectra. For any half-line Schr\\\"odinger operator with a bounded potential (in a locally $L^1$ sense), we prove that its essential spectrum obeys the Akhiezer--Levin condition, and moreover, that the Martin function at $\\infty$ obeys the two-term asymptotic expansion $\\sqrt{-z} + \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{-z}} + o(\\frac 1{\\sqrt{-z}})$ as $z \\to -\\infty$.

The correct answer is D because the two-term asymptotic expansion of the Martin function, given as \u221a(-z) + a/(2\u221a(-z)) + o(1/\u221a(-z)) as z \u2192 -\u221e, introduces a constant 'a' that plays a crucial role in defining regularity for Schr\u00f6dinger operators.\n\nThis constant 'a' is described as a \"renormalized Robin constant suited for Schr\u00f6dinger operators\" and is linked to a universal inequality: a \u2264 liminf[x\u2192\u221e] (1/x) \u222b[0 to x] V(t)dt. This inequality relates the constant 'a' to the asymptotic behavior of the potential V(t), thus providing a criterion for regularity based on the potential's asymptotic behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the expansion doesn't directly prove the existence of a discrete spectrum.

The correct answer, B, reflects the key insight that the solution landscape is similar to that of spin-glasses, with very different configurations being quasi-degenerate.

In the monograph Kounchev, O. I., Multivariate Polysplines. Applications to Numerical and Wavelet Analysis, Academic Press, San Diego-London, 2001, and in the paper Kounchev O., Render, H., Cardinal interpolation with polysplines on annuli, Journal of Approximation Theory 137 (2005) 89--107, we have introduced and studied a new paradigm for cardinal interpolation which is related to the theory of multivariate polysplines. In the present paper we show that this is related to a new sampling paradigm in the multivariate case, whereas we obtain a Shannon type function $S(x) $ and the following Shannon type formula: $f(r\\theta) =\\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{\\QTR{Bbb}{S}^{n-1}}S(e^{-j}r\\theta ) f(e^{j}\\theta) d\\theta .$ This formula relies upon infinitely many Shannon type formulas for the exponential splines arising from the radial part of the polyharmonic operator $\\Delta ^{p}$ for fixed $p\\geq 1$.

The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that \"By increasing the excitation energy step-wise towards and then above the electronic band gap, the dispersion and the helicity systematically decrease due to contributions of incoherent excitons and emission from plasma.\"\n\nThis phenomenon occurs because as the excitation energy increases beyond the resonant condition, the system starts to generate more incoherent excitons (excitons that have lost their phase relationship with the excitation light) and free carriers that form a plasma.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated.\"\n\n2. This high efficiency implies that when positions become liquidable, they are quickly acted upon by liquidators.

The weighted SI-SNR loss imposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker's duration and returns zero when the target speaker is absent.
