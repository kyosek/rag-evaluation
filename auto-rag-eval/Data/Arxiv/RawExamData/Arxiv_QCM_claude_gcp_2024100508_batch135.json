We consider the problem of statistical inference in a parametric finite Markov chain model and develop a robust estimator of the parameters defining the transition probabilities via minimization of a suitable (empirical) version of the popular density power divergence.

Performance of the MDPDEs is illustrated theoretically as well as empirically for some common examples of finite Markov chain models. Its applications in robust testing of statistical hypotheses are also discussed along with (parametric) comparison of two Markov chain sequences.

The celebrated van der Waals model describes simple fluids in the thermodynamic limit and predicts the existence of a critical point associated to the gas-liquid phase transition. However the behaviour of critical isotherms according to the equation of state, where a gas-liquid phase transition occurs, significantly departs from experimental observations. The correct critical isotherms are heuristically re-established via the Maxwell equal areas rule. A long standing open problem in mean field theory is concerned with the analytic description of van der Waals isotherms for a finite size system that is consistent, in the thermodynamic limit, with the Maxwell prescription. Inspired by the theory of nonlinear conservation laws, we propose a novel mean field approach, based on statistical mechanics, that allows to calculate the van der Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles $N$. Our partition function naturally extends to the whole space of thermodynamic variables, reproduces, in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to \\infty$, the classical results outside the critical region and automatically encodes Maxwell's prescription. We show that isothermal curves evolve in the space of thermodynamic variables like nonlinear breaking waves and the criticality is explained as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: The van der Waals model for simple fluids predicts a critical point associated with the gas-liquid phase transition. However, the behavior of critical isotherms according to the equation of state deviates from experimental observations. A new approach has been proposed to address this issue. Which of the following statements best describes this novel approach and its implications?\n\nA) The approach uses quantum mechanics to calculate the van der Waals partition function, resulting in perfect agreement with experimental observations for all system sizes.\n\nB) The method employs nonlinear conservation laws to calculate the van der Waals partition function for a large but finite number of particles, automatically incorporating Maxwell's equal areas rule in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nC) The approach uses machine learning algorithms to predict critical isotherms, eliminating the need for the Maxwell equal areas rule entirely.\n\nD) The method introduces a new equation of state that replaces the van der Waals equation, providing exact solutions for all thermodynamic variables in both finite and infinite systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation describes a novel mean field approach inspired by the theory of nonlinear conservation laws. This method calculates the van der Waals partition function for a system with a large but finite number of particles N. In the thermodynamic limit (N\u2192\u221e), this approach reproduces classical results outside the critical region and automatically incorporates Maxwell's equal areas rule.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the approach is based on statistical mechanics and nonlinear conservation laws, not quantum mechanics. It also doesn't claim perfect agreement with experimental observations for all system sizes.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the approach doesn't involve machine learning algorithms, and it doesn't eliminate the need for Maxwell's rule but rather incorporates it naturally.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the method doesn't introduce a new equation of state to replace the van der Waals equation. Instead, it provides a new way to calculate the partition function based on the existing van der Waals model.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the key aspects of the novel approach: its basis in nonlinear conservation laws, its application to finite but large systems, and its ability to automatically incorporate Maxwell's rule in the thermodynamic limit."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Energy Correlations In Random Transverse Field Ising Spin Chains", "source": "Gil Refael, Daniel S.

The end-to-end energy - energy correlations of random transverse-field quantum Ising spin chains are computed using a generalization of an asymptotically exact real-space renormalization group introduced previously. Away from the critical point, the average energy - energy correlations decay exponentially with a correlation length that is the same as that of the spin - spin correlations.

The critical energy-energy correlations behave very similarly to the smallest gap, computed previously; this is explained in terms of the RG flow and the excitation structure of the chain.
