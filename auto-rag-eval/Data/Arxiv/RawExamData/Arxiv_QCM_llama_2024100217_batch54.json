We explore several major neural architectures and a range of standard benchmark datasets for NLP, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and computer vision tasks to show that these architectures, with the same hyper-parameter settings as reported in the literature, perform comparably or better when trained with the square loss, even after equalizing computational resources.

Since it is economically challenging to deploy wired backhaul every few hundred meters, relays (e.g., wireless access points) have been proposed to extend the coverage of a base station which has wired connection to the core network. These relays, deployed every few hundred meters, serve the users in their vicinity and are backhauled to the base station through wireless connections. In this work, the wireless relayed backhaul design has been formulated as a topology-bandwidth-power joint optimization problem, and the influence of path loss, angular spread, array size, and RF power limitation on the user rate has been evaluated. It has been shown that for a linear network deployed along the street at 28 GHz, when high joint directional gain (50 dBi) is available, 1 Gbps user rate within cell range of 1 km can be delivered using 1.5 GHz of bandwidth (using single polarization antennas). The user rates drop precipitously when joint directional gain is reduced, or when the path loss is much more severe.

Evolution is simultaneously driven by a number of processes such as mutation, competition and random sampling. Understanding which of these processes is dominating the collective evolutionary dynamics in dependence on system properties is a fundamental aim of theoretical research. Recent works quantitatively studied coevolutionary dynamics of competing species with a focus on linearly frequency-dependent interactions, derived from a game-theoretic viewpoint. However, several aspects of evolutionary dynamics, e.g. limited resources, may induce effectively nonlinear frequency dependencies. Here we study the impact of nonlinear frequency dependence on evolutionary dynamics in a model class that covers linear frequency dependence as a special case. We focus on the simplest non-trivial setting of two genotypes and analyze the co-action of nonlinear frequency dependence with asymmetric mutation rates. We find that their co-action may induce novel metastable states as well as stochastic switching dynamics between them.
