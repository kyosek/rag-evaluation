We investigate the possibility to reproduce power law statistics, probability density function and power spectral density, using ARCH family models. For this purpose we derive stochastic differential equations from the GARCH processes in consideration. We find the obtained equations to be similar to a general class of stochastic differential equations known to reproduce power law statistics.

Numerous methods for alleviating catastrophic forgetting are currently being proposed, but differences in evaluation protocols make it difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, here we identified three distinct scenarios for continual learning based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred.

The early diagnosis and screening of glaucoma are important for patients to receive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) based models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of glaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a dataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from another new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene are limited.

Then, the reconstruction model is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which makes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level features both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification, simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL strategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two public glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG.

In many fields such as bioinformatics, high energy physics, power distribution, etc., it is desirable to learn non-linear models where a small number of variables are selected and the interaction between them is explicitly modeled to predict the response. In principle, neural networks (NNs) could accomplish this task since they can model non-linear feature interactions very well. However, NNs require large amounts of training data to have a good generalization. In this paper we study the datastarved regime where a NN is trained on a relatively small amount of training data. For that purpose we study feature selection for NNs, which is known to improve generalization for linear models. As an extreme case of data with feature selection and feature interactions we study the XOR-like data with irrelevant variables. We experimentally observed that the cross-entropy loss function on XOR-like data has many non-equivalent local optima, and the number of local optima grows exponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. To deal with the local minima and for feature selection we propose a node pruning and feature selection algorithm that improves the capability of NNs to find better local minima even when there are irrelevant variables.

The key advantage of this approach is that it allows the electric and magnetic fields to decouple gracefully in the static limit (as \u03c9 \u2192 0), similar to the behavior observed in the Lorenz-Debye-Mie representation for spherical geometries. This decoupling provides improved stability at low frequencies, making it immune to the low-frequency breakdown experienced by the traditional method.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the generalized Debye source approach is specifically designed to avoid numerical instability at low frequencies.\n\nOption C is partially true but ultimately incorrect. While the approach is inspired by the Lorenz-Debye-Mie representation, it has been extended to work with planar geometries and is not limited to spherical ones.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation does not suggest higher computational complexity or reduced efficiency for planar geometries.
