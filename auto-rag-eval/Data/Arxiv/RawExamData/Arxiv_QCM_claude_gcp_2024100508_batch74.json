The conventional view on economic development simplifies a country's production to one aggregate variable, GDP.

A country's product diversity reflects the country's diversity of productive knowhow, or \"capabilities\". Researchers derive from algorithms (inspired by network theory) metrics that measure the number of capabilities in an economy, notably the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), argued to predict economic growth better than traditional variables such as human capital, and the country Fitness index. This paper offers an alternative economic complexity measure (founded on information theory) that derives from a simple model of production as a combinatorial process whereby a set of capabilities combine with some probability to transform raw materials into a product. A country's number of capabilities is given by the logarithm of its product diversity, as predicts the model, which also predicts a linear dependence between log-diversity, ECI, and log-fitness.

Including translation matrices in covariant non-unitary Poincare representations also introduces new gauge terms in the construction of massless particle fields from canonical unitary fields. In the usual procedure without spacetime translation matrices, gauge terms arise from `translations' of the massless little group; the little group combines spacetime rotations and boosts making a group isomorphic with the Euclidean group E2, including E2 translations.

As these networks are of great interest as dynamical models of biological and cognitive processes, it is useful to understand how particular graphs can be realised as robust heteroclinic networks that are attracting. This paper presents two methods of realizing arbitrarily complex directed graphs as robust heteroclinic networks for flows generated by ODEs---we say the ODEs {\\em realise} the graphs as heteroclinic networks between equilibria that represent the vertices.

Achieving same notion of time within these CR nodes is essential to fulfill the requirements for simultaneous quiet periods for spectrum sensing. Current application layer time synchronization protocols require multiple timestamp exchanges to estimate skew between the clocks of CRN nodes. The proposed symbol timing recovery method already estimates the skew of hardware clock at the physical layer and use it for skew correction of application layer clock of each node. The heart of application layer clock is the hardware clock and hence application layer clock skew will be same as of physical layer and can be corrected from symbol timing recovery process.

Indeed, considering a mixing of continuous, integer and ordinal variables (thus all having a cumulative distribution function), this copula mixture model defines intra-component dependencies similar to a Gaussian mixture, so with classical correlation meaning. Simultaneously, it preserves standard margins associated to continuous, integer and ordered features, namely the Gaussian, the Poisson and the ordered multinomial distributions.

Credit and liquidity risks represent main channels of financial contagion for interbank lending markets. On one hand, banks face potential losses whenever their counterparties are under distress and thus unable to fulfill their obligations. On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover lost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses in the presence of fire sales - that is, when funding shortcomings are widespread over the market.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that the deterministic approach (rate equations) predicts coexistence of species with regular oscillations of population densities. In contrast, the stochastic approach with a finite number of agents predicts that fluctuations lead to extinction, where two of the three species die out after a long enough time.

Despite significant recent progress in the area of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), there are numerous shortcomings associated with collecting Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in real-world environments. These include, but are not limited to, subject and session data variance, long and arduous calibration processes and predictive generalisation issues across different subjects or sessions. This implies that many downstream applications, including Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based classification systems, can suffer from a shortage of reliable data. Generating meaningful and realistic synthetic data can therefore be of significant value in circumventing this problem.
