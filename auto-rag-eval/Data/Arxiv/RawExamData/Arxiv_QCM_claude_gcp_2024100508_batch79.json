We study the problem of learning such functions under conditions of context-dependence of preferences, which means that the preference in favor of a certain choice alternative may depend on what other options are also available. In spite of its practical relevance, this kind of context-dependence has received little attention in preference learning so far. We propose a suitable model based on context-dependent (latent) utility functions, thereby reducing the problem to the task of learning such utility functions. Practically, this comes with a number of challenges. For example, the set of alternatives provided as input to a choice function can be of any size, and the output of the function should not depend on the order in which the alternatives are presented. To meet these requirements, we propose two general approaches based on two representations of context-dependent utility functions, as well as instantiations in the form of appropriate end-to-end trainable neural network architectures.

Using methods of statistical physics, we analyse the error of learning couplings in large Ising models from independent data (the inverse Ising problem). We concentrate on learning based on local cost functions, such as the pseudo-likelihood method for which the couplings are inferred independently for each spin. Assuming that the data are generated from a true Ising model, we compute the reconstruction error of the couplings using a combination of the replica method with the cavity approach for densely connected systems. We show that an explicit estimator based on a quadratic cost function achieves minimal reconstruction error, but requires the length of the true coupling vector as prior knowledge. A simple mean field estimator of the couplings which does not need such knowledge is asymptotically optimal, i.e. when the number of observations is much large than the number of spins.

In the theory of Toeplitz quantization of algebras, as developed by the second author, coherent states are defined as eigenvectors of a Toeplitz annihilation operator.

In usual quantization schemes one starts with a classical phase space, then quantizes it in order to produce annihilation operators and then their eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
