Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an infectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.

A pandemic crisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a long-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic cost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to manage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for COVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The social distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently accessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community mobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven economic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the search of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control problem.

First of all, the constraints on the fraction $\\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be driven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters.

In this paper, we present results of analyzing detailed dynamics in the Renren social network, covering a period of 2 years when the network grew from 1 user to 19 million users and 199 million edges. Rather than validate a single model of network dynamics, we analyze dynamics at different granularities (user-, community- and network- wide) to determine how much, if any, users are influenced by dynamics processes at different scales. We observe in- dependent predictable processes at each level, and find that while the growth of communities has moderate and sustained impact on users, significant events such as network merge events have a strong but short-lived impact that is quickly dominated by the continuous arrival of new users."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best represents the findings of the study on dynamics in the Renren social network?\n\nA) Network-wide events have a strong and long-lasting impact on user behavior, overshadowing community growth effects.\n\nB) User-level, community-level, and network-wide dynamics all exhibit independent predictable processes, with community growth having a moderate, sustained impact on users.\n\nC) The continuous arrival of new users has little effect on network dynamics compared to significant network-wide events.\n\nD) Citation graphs and content-sharing networks provide more comprehensive insights into social network dynamics than the Renren dataset.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately summarizes the key findings of the study.

It is well known that skyrmions can be driven using spin-orbit torques due to the spin-Hall effect.

This additional interfacial spin torque is similar in form to the in-plane spin transfer torque, but is significantly enhanced in ultra-thin films and acts in the opposite direction to the electron flow. The combination of this diffusive spin torque and the spin-orbit torque results in skyrmion motion which helps to explain the observation of small skyrmion Hall angles even with moderate magnetisation damping values.

In this paper we analyze predator-prey dynamical systems and extend the method of generalized models to periodic solutions. First, we adapt the equilibrium generalized modeling approach and compute the unique Floquet multiplier of the periodic solution which depends upon so-called generalized elasticity and scale functions. We prove that these functions also have to satisfy a flow on parameter (or moduli) space. Then we use Fourier analysis to provide computable conditions for stability and the moduli space flow. The final stability analysis reduces to two discrete convolutions which can be interpreted to understand when the predator-prey system is stable and what factors enhance or prohibit stable oscillatory behaviour.
