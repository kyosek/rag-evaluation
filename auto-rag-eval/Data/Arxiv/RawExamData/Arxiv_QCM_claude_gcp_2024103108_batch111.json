This paper presents an observer-integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, called Disturbance OBserver Network (DOB-Net), for robots operating in environments where disturbances are unknown and time-varying, and may frequently exceed robot control capabilities. The DOB-Net integrates a disturbance dynamics observer network and a controller network. Originated from conventional DOB mechanisms, the observer is built and enhanced via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), encoding estimation of past values and prediction of future values of unknown disturbances in RNN hidden state. Such encoding allows the controller generate optimal control signals to actively reject disturbances, under the constraints of robot control capabilities. The observer and the controller are jointly learned within policy optimization by advantage actor critic. Numerical simulations on position regulation tasks have demonstrated that the proposed DOB-Net significantly outperforms a conventional feedback controller and classical RL algorithms."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The DOB-Net approach integrates two key components for handling unknown and time-varying disturbances in robotic control.

A survey of the voluminous literature on decentralization suggests that the question of the links between decentralization and macroeconomic stability has been relatively scantily analyzed. Even though there is still a lot of room for analysis as far as the effects of decentralization on other aspects of the economy are concerned, we believe that it is in this area that a more thorough analyses are mostly called for. Through this paper, we will try to shed more light on the issue notably by looking at other dimension of macroeconomic stability than the ones usually employed in previous studies as well as by examining other factors that might accentuate or diminish the effects of decentralization on macroeconomic stability.

We present a theoretical model for supernova (SN) 2008D associated with the luminous X-ray transient 080109. The bolometric light curve and optical spectra of the SN are modelled based on the progenitor models and the explosion models obtained from hydrodynamic/nucleosynthetic calculations. We find that SN 2008D is a more energetic explosion than normal core-collapse supernovae, with an ejecta mass of Mej = 5.3 +- 1.0 Msun and a kinetic energy of E = 6.0 +- 2.5 x 10^{51} erg. The progenitor star of the SN has a 6-8 Msun He core with essentially no H envelope (< 5 x 10^{-4} Msun) prior to the explosion. The main-sequence mass of the progenitor is estimated to be Mms =20-25 Msun, with additional systematic uncertainties due to convection, mass loss, rotation, and binary effects.

The performance of these algorithms depends heavily on the choice of the Riemannian metric.

Single nanopores have attracted much scientific interest due to their versatile applications. The majority of experiments have been performed with nanopores being in contact with the same electrolyte on both sides of the membrane, while solution gradients across semi-permeable membranes are omnipresent in natural systems. In this manuscript, we studied ionic and fluidic movement through thin nanopores under viscosity gradients both experimentally and using simulations. Ionic current rectification was observed under these conditions, due to solutions with different conductivities filled across the pore under different biases caused by electroosmotic flow. We found that a pore filled with high viscosity solutions exhibited current increase with applied voltage in a steeper slope beyond a threshold voltage, which abnormally reduced the current rectification ratio. Through simulations, we found reversed electroosmotic flow that filled the pore with aqueous solutions of lower viscosities was responsible for this behavior. The reversed electroosmotic flow could be explained by slower depletion of coions than counterions along the pore.

We find that the phase velocity of the wave propagating along the strip respectively increases/decreases with the frequency for no-slip/no-stress boundary conditions. This is so because when the frequency or strip width goes to zero (alternatively, viscosity go to infinity), the wavelength of the current pattern tends to infinity in the no-stress case and to a finite value in a general case. We also show that for DC current across a strip with no-stress boundary, there only one pair of vortices, while there is an infinite vortex chain for all other types of boundary conditions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In viscous electronics, how does the phase velocity of a shear wave propagating along a long strip change with frequency under different boundary conditions?\n\nA) It increases with frequency for both no-slip and no-stress boundary conditions\nB) It decreases with frequency for both no-slip and no-stress boundary conditions\nC) It increases with frequency for no-slip and decreases for no-stress boundary conditions\nD) It increases with frequency for no-stress and decreases for no-slip boundary conditions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the relationship between boundary conditions, frequency, and phase velocity in viscous electronics. The correct answer is C because the documentation states: \"We find that the phase velocity of the wave propagating along the strip respectively increases/decreases with the frequency for no-slip/no-stress boundary conditions.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't differentiate between the boundary conditions. Option B is wrong for the same reason, but in the opposite direction. Option D is the reverse of the correct relationship and is therefore incorrect.\n\nThe key to understanding this is recognizing that the behavior of the shear wave is fundamentally different depending on the boundary conditions at the edges of the strip.

This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the only supernova from which we have detected neutrinos - SN 1987A.

Diffusion has been widely used to describe a random walk of particles or waves, and it requires only one parameter -- the diffusion constant. For waves, however, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of interference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing diffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive interference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed paths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return probability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where waves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of localization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion coefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental observation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave transport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random media and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third dimension. By varying the geometry of the system or the dissipation which also limits the size of loop trajectories, we are able to control the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient.

The text explains that Anderson localization, which is caused by constructive interference of waves in loop trajectories, leads to a spatially varying diffusion coefficient inside the system. This effect is particularly noticeable near the boundaries of finite-sized systems where waves can escape, reducing the return probability through loop paths. The self-consistent theory of localization and supersymmetric field theory both predict this spatial variation of the diffusion coefficient.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while Anderson localization is most prominent in infinite systems (where it can lead to a vanishing diffusion coefficient), it still affects finite-sized systems, causing spatial variations in the diffusion coefficient.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as it contradicts the main finding of the research, which demonstrates that the diffusion coefficient does vary spatially within the system.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it misrepresents the effect of Anderson localization.
