Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) has broad application in open-set verification tasks, such as speaker verification.

An interesting research therefore is how to improve modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper presents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple and generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the global model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents the details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this direction and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global and local models.

For local bijectivity of the linearization at a root, a radius of quadratic convergence was explicitly calculated in terms of local Lipschitz constants of the underlying PS function.

Ad blockers allow users to browse websites without viewing ads. Online news providers that rely on advertising revenue tend to perceive users adoption of ad blockers purely as a threat to revenue. Yet, this perception ignores the possibility that avoiding ads, which users presumably dislike, may affect users online news consumption behavior in positive ways. Using 3.1 million anonymized visits from 79,856 registered users on a news website, we find that adopting an ad blocker has a robust positive effect on the quantity and variety of articles users consume (21.5% - 43.3% more articles and 13.4% - 29.1% more content categories). An increase in repeat user visits of the news website, rather than the number of page impressions per visit, drives the news consumption. These visits tend to start with direct navigation to the news website, indicating user loyalty. The increase in news consumption is more substantial for users who have less prior experience with the website.

In this context, algorithms based on factors recognition are among the best solutions. In this paper, we present a simple and very efficient algorithm for string matching based on a weak factor recognition and hashing. Our algorithm has a quadratic worst-case running time. However, despite its quadratic complexity, experimental results show that our algorithm obtains in most cases the best running times when compared, under various conditions, against the most effective algorithms present in literature. In the case of small alphabets and long patterns, the gain in running times reaches 28%. This makes our proposed algorithm one of the most flexible solutions in practical cases."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary motivation behind the development of algorithms for speeding up string matching, and how does the proposed algorithm in the paper \"Speeding Up String Matching by Weak Factor Recognition\" address this challenge?\n\nA) The primary motivation is to improve the accuracy of string matching, and the proposed algorithm uses a combination of hashing and factor recognition to achieve this goal.\nB) The primary motivation is to reduce the computational complexity of string matching, and the proposed algorithm uses a weak factor recognition approach to achieve a quadratic worst-case running time.\nC) The primary motivation is to increase the flexibility of string matching algorithms, and the proposed algorithm uses a hashing technique to achieve this goal.\nD) The primary motivation is to improve the efficiency of string matching algorithms, and the proposed algorithm uses a factor recognition approach to achieve a significant gain in running times.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The primary motivation is to reduce the computational complexity of string matching, and the proposed algorithm uses a weak factor recognition approach to achieve a quadratic worst-case running time.\n\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to understand the context of the paper and the motivation behind the development of the proposed algorithm.

By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent's attention strategy.

Prediction of events in financial markets is every investor's dream and, usually, wishful thinking. From a more general, economic and societal viewpoint, the identification of indicators for large events is highly desirable to assess systemic risks. Unfortunately, the very nature of financial markets, particularly the predominantly non-Markovian character as well as non-stationarity, make this challenge a formidable one, leaving little hope for fully fledged answers. Nevertheless, it is called for to collect pieces of evidence in a variety of observables to be assembled like the pieces of a puzzle that eventually might help to catch a glimpse of long-term indicators or precursors for large events - if at all in a statistical sense. Here, we present a new piece for this puzzle. We use the quasi-stationary market states which exist in the time evolution of the correlation structure in financial markets. Recently, we identified such market states relative to the collective motion of the market as a whole. We study their precursor properties in the US stock markets over 16 years, including two crises, the dot-com bubble burst and the pre-phase of the Lehman Brothers crash.

This paper provides a study and discussion of earlier as well as novel more efficient schemes for the precise evaluation of finite-temperature response functions of strongly correlated quantum systems in the framework of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG). The computational costs and bond dimensions as functions of time and temperature are examined for the example of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain in the critical XY phase and the gapped N\\'eel phase. The matrix product state purifications occurring in the algorithms are in one-to-one relation with corresponding matrix product operators. This notational simplification elucidates implications of quasi-locality on the computational costs.

In this paper, we investigate using FL for a sound event detection task using audio from the FSD50K dataset. Audio is split into clients based on uploader metadata. This results in highly imbalanced subsets of data between clients, noted as a key issue in FL scenarios. A series of models is trained using `high-volume' clients that contribute 100 audio clips or more, testing the effects of varying FL parameters, followed by an additional model trained using all clients with no minimum audio contribution. It is shown that FL models trained using the high-volume clients can perform similarly to a centrally-trained model, though there is much more noise in results than would typically be expected for a centrally-trained model.
