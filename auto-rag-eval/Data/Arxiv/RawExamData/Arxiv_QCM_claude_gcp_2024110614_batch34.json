Modern network-on-chip (NoC) systems face reliability issues due to process and environmental variations. The power supply noise (PSN) in the power delivery network of a NoC plays a key role in determining reliability. PSN leads to voltage droop, which can cause timing errors in the NoC. This paper makes a novel contribution towards formally analyzing PSN in NoC systems. We present a probabilistic model checking approach to observe the PSN in a generic 2x2 mesh NoC with a uniform random traffic load. Key features of PSN are measured at the behavioral level. To tackle state explosion, we apply incremental abstraction techniques, including a novel probabilistic choice abstraction, based on observations of NoC behavior. The Modest Toolset is used for probabilistic modeling and verification. Results are obtained for several flit injection patterns to reveal their impacts on PSN. Our analysis finds an optimal flit pattern generation with zero probability of PSN events and suggests spreading flits rather than releasing them in consecutive cycles in order to minimize PSN."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Probabilistic Verification for Reliability of a Two-by-Two Network-on-Chip System, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a 2x2 mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC) system and wants to minimize the probability of power supply noise (PSN) events.

A new method of distortion mitigation for multitarget interferometric angular velocity estimation in millimeter-wave radar is presented. In general, when multiple targets are present, the response of a correlation interferometer is corrupted by intermodulation distortion, making it difficult to estimate individual target angular velocities. We present a distortion mitigation method that works by decomposing the responses at each antenna element into the responses from the individual targets. Data association is performed to match individual target responses at each antenna such that cross-correlation is performed only between associated targets. Thus, the intermodulation distortion (cross-terms) from correlating unlike targets are eliminated, and the result is a frequency response whose individual frequencies are proportional to the angular velocities of the targets. We demonstrate the approach with a custom 40 GHz interferometric radar, a high-accuracy motion capture system which provides ground-truth position measurements, and two robotic platforms. The multitarget experiments consist of three scenarios, designed to represent easy, medium, and difficult cases for the distortion mitigation technique.

Extraction of electromagnetic energy by an antenna from impinging external radiation is at the basis of wireless communications and power transfer (WPT). The maximum of transferred energy is ensured when the antenna is conjugately matched, i.e., when it is resonant and it has an equal coupling with free space and its load, which is not easily implemented in near-field WPT. Here, we introduce the concept of coherently enhanced wireless power transfer. We show that a principle similar to the one underlying the operation of coherent perfect absorbers can be employed to improve the overall performance of WPT and potentially achieve its dynamic control. The concept relies on coherent excitation of the waveguide connected to the antenna load with a backward propagating signal of specific amplitude and phase. This signal creates a suitable interference pattern at the load resulting in a modification of the local wave impedance, which in turn enables conjugate matching and a largely increased amount of energy extracted to the waveguide.

The ubiquitous availability of wearable sensors is responsible for driving the Internet-of-Things but is also making an impact on sport sciences and precision medicine.

We propose a new approach to solving this problem for a subset of pulsars with a high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum from the Pushchino catalogue (the \"Pushchino\" sample). We provide a theoretical explanation of the observed dependence of the high-frequency cutoff from the pulsar period. The dependence of the cutoff position from the magnetic field is predicted. This explanation is based on a new mechanism for electron radio emission in pulsars. Namely, radiation occurs in the inner (polar) gap, when electrons are accelerated in the electric field that is increasing from zero level at the star surface. In this case acceleration of electrons passes through a maximum and goes to zero when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light. All the radiated power is located within the radio frequency band.

In the context of current research on efficient estimation of models for large network data sets, we propose a fast algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that afords a signifcant increase in the size of networks amenable to direct empirical analysis.

The statistical problem of using an initial sample to estimate the number of species in a larger sample has found important applications in fields far removed from ecology.

The number r indicates species with sufficient observations, which are commonly used as a necessary condition for any robust statistical inference. We derive a procedure to construct consistent estimators that apply universally for a given population: once constructed, they can be evaluated as a simple function of r.

Active microrheology differs from its passive counterpart in that the probe is actively forced through the material, rather than allowed to diffuse. Unlike in passive microrheology, active forcing allows the material to be driven out of equilibrium, and its nonlinear response to be probed. However, this also renders inoperable the fluctuation-dissipation theorem used to justify passive microrheology. Here we explore a question at the heart of active microrheology: are its results consistent with macrorheology? We study a simple model material -- a generalized Newtonian fluid, with a small but arbitrary shear-rate-dependent component -- and derive a general expression for dissipation due to probe motion, which remarkably does not require the non-Newtonian flow to be solved. We demonstrate that the straightforward application of active microrheology gives results that are inconsistent with macrorheology, even when the probe is large enough for material to behave as a continuum, unless the forcing is gentle enough to probe only the linear response.

The Majorana versus Dirac nature of neutrinos remains an open question. This is due, in part, to the fact that virtually all the experimentally accessible neutrinos are ultra-relativistic. Noting that Majorana neutrinos can behave quite differently from Dirac ones when they are non-relativistic, we show that, at leading order, the angular distribution of the daughters in the decay of a heavy neutrino into a lighter one and a self-conjugate boson is isotropic in the parent's rest frame if the neutrinos are Majorana, independent of the parent's polarization.

This trade-off can be hypothesized as being evident in the behaviour of plankton, which inhabit a dilute 3D environment with few refuges or orienting landmarks. We present an analysis of the swimming path geometries based on a volumetric Monte Carlo sampling approach, which is particularly adept at revealing such trade-offs by measuring the self-overlap of the trajectories. Application of this method to experimentally measured trajectories reveals that swimming patterns in copepods are shaped to efficiently explore volumes at small scales, while achieving a large overlap at larger scales.

Accordingly, different symptom profiles could be more predictive in certain studies, or even symptoms of the same name could have different meanings in different contexts. We assess state-of-the-art transfer learning methods for improving prediction of infection from symptom data in multiple types of health care data ranging from clinical, to home-visit as well as crowdsourced studies.
