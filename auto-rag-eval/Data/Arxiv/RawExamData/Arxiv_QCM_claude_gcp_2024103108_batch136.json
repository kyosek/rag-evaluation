Machine Learning (ML) In and For\n  Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). In recent years, many scholars praised the seemingly endless possibilities of using machine learning (ML) techniques in and for agent-based simulation models (ABM). To get a more comprehensive understanding of these possibilities, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and classify the literature on the application of ML in and for ABM according to a theoretically derived classification scheme. We do so to investigate how exactly machine learning has been utilized in and for agent-based models so far and to critically discuss the combination of these two promising methods. We find that, indeed, there is a broad range of possible applications of ML to support and complement ABMs in many different ways, already applied in many different disciplines. We see that, so far, ML is mainly used in ABM for two broad cases: First, the modelling of adaptive agents equipped with experience learning and, second, the analysis of outcomes produced by a given ABM. While these are the most frequent, there also exist a variety of many more interesting applications. This being the case, researchers should dive deeper into the analysis of when and how which kinds of ML techniques can support ABM, e.g. by conducting a more in-depth analysis and comparison of different use cases. Nonetheless, as the application of ML in and for ABM comes at certain costs, researchers should not use ML for ABMs just for the sake of doing it."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current state and implications of using Machine Learning (ML) in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), according to the systematic literature review?\n\nA) ML is primarily used in ABM for creating complex environmental models and has limited applications in agent behavior modeling.\n\nB) The use of ML in ABM is widespread across all aspects of modeling, with equal distribution among different applications.\n\nC) ML is mainly used in ABM for modeling adaptive agents with experience learning and analyzing ABM outcomes, but there are various other interesting applications as well.\n\nD) The review found that ML techniques are rarely used in ABM due to their complexity and high computational costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the systematic literature review found that ML is primarily used in ABM for two main purposes: modeling adaptive agents with experience learning and analyzing outcomes produced by ABMs. However, the review also notes that there are various other interesting applications beyond these two main areas. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the review doesn't specifically mention ML being used primarily for environmental modeling in ABM. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the review doesn't suggest an equal distribution of ML applications across all aspects of ABM.

The quantitative study of traffic dynamics is crucial to ensure the efficiency of urban transportation networks. The current work investigates the spatial properties of congestion, that is, we aim to characterize the city areas where traffic bottlenecks occur. The analysis of a large amount of real road networks in previous works showed that congestion points experience spatial abrupt transitions, namely they shift away from the city center as larger urban areas are incorporated. The fundamental ingredient behind this effect is the entanglement of central and arterial roads, embedded in separated geographical regions. In this paper we extend the analysis of the conditions yielding abrupt transitions of congestion location. First, we look into the more realistic situation in which arterial and central roads, rather than lying on sharply separated regions, present spatial overlap. It results that this affects the position of bottlenecks and introduces new possible congestion areas. Secondly, we pay particular attention to the role played by the edge distribution, proving that it allows to smooth the transitions profile, and so to control the congestion displacement.

In this paper, we consider dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with the identification of the scalar field coupled though the Pontryagin density with the axion dark matter, and we discuss the effects of the parametric resonance on gravitational waves (GWs). When we consider GWs in a coherently oscillating axion cloud, we confirm that significant resonant amplification of GWs occurs in a narrow frequency band, and the amplification is restricted to the late epoch after the passage of the incident waves. We also identify the condition that an axion cloud spontaneously emits GWs.

We find that resonant amplification is difficult to be tested from GW observations in the standard scenario of the axion DM model, in which the axion is the dominant component of DM.

Therefore, this provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability.
