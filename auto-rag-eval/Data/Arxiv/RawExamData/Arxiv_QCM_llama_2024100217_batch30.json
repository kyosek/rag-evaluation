An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox. In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash.

We present Boundary IoU (Intersection-over-Union), a new segmentation evaluation measure focused on boundary quality. We perform an extensive analysis across different error types and object sizes and show that Boundary IoU is significantly more sensitive than the standard Mask IoU measure to boundary errors for large objects and does not over-penalize errors on smaller objects. The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on Boundary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision) and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show that the new evaluation metrics track boundary quality improvements that are generally overlooked by current Mask IoU-based evaluation metrics.

Relativistic bulk motion with large Lorentz factors has recently been inferred for gamma-ray bursts regardless of whether they are of galactic or cosmological origin. This conclusion results from calculations of internal pair production transparency in bursts that usually assume an infinite power-law source spectrum for simplicity, an approximation that is quite adequate for some bursts detected by EGRET. However, for a given bulk Lorentz factor \\teq{\\Gamma}, photons above the EGRET range can potentially interact with sub-MeV photons in such calculations. Hence it is essential to accurately address the spectral curvature in bursts seen by BATSE. In this paper we present the major properties induced in photon-photon opacity considerations by such spectral curvature. The observed spectral breaks around 1 MeV turn out to be irrelevant to opacity in cosmological bursts, but are crucial to estimates of source transparency in the 1 GeV -- 1 TeV range for sources located in the galactic halo. We find that broad absorption troughs can arise at these energies for suitable bulk motion parameters \\teq{\\Gamma}.

In practice, however, a DRL agent may receive faulty observation by abrupt interferences such as black-out, frozen-screen, and adversarial perturbation. How to design a resilient DRL algorithm against these rare but mission-critical and safety-crucial scenarios is an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we consider a generative DRL framework training with an auxiliary task of observational interferences such as artificial noises. Under this framework, we discuss the importance of the causal relation and propose a causal inference based DRL algorithm called causal inference Q-network (CIQ). We evaluate the performance of CIQ in several benchmark DRL environments with different types of interferences as auxiliary labels. Our experimental results show that the proposed CIQ method could achieve higher performance and more resilience against observational interferences."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary motivation behind the development of the Causal Inference Q-Network (CIQ) algorithm, and how does it address the challenges posed by observational interferences in deep reinforcement learning?\n\n**A)** CIQ is designed to improve the performance of DRL agents in scenarios with high levels of noise, but it does not explicitly address the issue of observational interferences. Instead, it focuses on developing a more robust Q-learning algorithm.\n\n**B)** CIQ is motivated by the need to develop DRL algorithms that can learn from noisy observations, and it achieves this by incorporating an auxiliary task that trains the agent to recognize and adapt to different types of interferences.\n\n**C)** CIQ is primarily focused on improving the performance of DRL agents in scenarios with high levels of competition, rather than addressing the issue of observational interferences.\n\n**D)** CIQ is designed to be a general-purpose DRL algorithm that can be applied to a wide range of tasks, without any specific consideration for the issue of observational interferences.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) CIQ is motivated by the need to develop DRL algorithms that can learn from noisy observations, and it achieves this by incorporating an auxiliary task that trains the agent to recognize and adapt to different types of interferences.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is B) because the paper explicitly states that the development of CIQ is motivated by the need to address the challenges posed by observational interferences in DRL. The algorithm is designed to learn from noisy observations and adapt to different types of interferences, making it more resilient in the face of adversarial perturbations and other forms of interference."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "The VMC survey -- XLIV: Mapping metallicity trends in the Large\n  Magellanic Cloud using near-infrared passbands", "source": "Samyaday Choudhury, Richard de Grijs, Kenji Bekki, Maria-Rosa L.\n  Cioni, Valentin D.

We have derived high-spatial-resolution metallicity maps covering $\\sim$105~deg$^2$ across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using near-infrared passbands from the VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds. We attempt to understand the metallicity distribution and gradients of the LMC up to a radius of $\\sim$ 6~kpc. We identify red giant branch (RGB) stars in spatially distinct $Y, (Y-K_{\\rm s})$ colour-magnitude diagrams. In any of our selected subregions, the RGB slope is used as an indicator of the average metallicity, based on calibration to metallicity using spectroscopic data. The mean LMC metallicity is [Fe/H] = $-$0.42~dex ($\\sigma$[Fe/H] = 0.04~dex). We find the bar to be mildly metal-rich compared with the outer disc, showing evidence of a shallow gradient in metallicity ($-0.008 \\pm 0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) from the galaxy's centre to a radius of 6~kpc. Our results suggest that the LMC's stellar bar is chemically similar to the bars found in large spiral galaxies. The LMC's radial metallicity gradient is asymmetric. It is metal-poor and flatter towards the southwest, in the direction of the Bridge. This hints at mixing and/or distortion of the spatial metallicity distribution, presumably caused by tidal interactions between the Magellanic Clouds."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\n**Question:** The authors of the VMC survey study the metallicity distribution and gradients of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) up to a radius of approximately 6 kpc.

This is supported by the fact that the gradient is -0.008 \u00b1 0.001 dex kpc^-1, which is a relatively shallow slope. The other options are incorrect because they either contradict the authors' findings (A and D) or do not accurately describe the gradient (C)."}}
