This article considers a robust hierarchical Bayesian approach to deal with random effects of small area means when some of these effects assume extreme values, resulting in outliers. In presence of outliers, the standard Fay-Herriot model, used for modeling area-level data, under normality assumptions of the random effects may overestimate random effects variance, thus provides less than ideal shrinkage towards the synthetic regression predictions and inhibits borrowing information. Even a small number of substantive outliers of random effects result in a large estimate of the random effects variance in the Fay-Herriot model, thereby achieving little shrinkage to the synthetic part of the model or little reduction in posterior variance associated with the regular Bayes estimator for any of the small areas. While a scale mixture of normal distributions with known mixing distribution for the random effects has been found to be effective in presence of outliers, the solution depends on the mixing distribution. As a possible alternative solution to the problem, a two-component normal mixture model has been proposed based on noninformative priors on the model variance parameters, regression coefficients and the mixing probability.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The SI framework allows for inferring N x D causal parameters (where N is the number of units and D is the number of interventions) while observing each of the N units under at most two interventions, regardless of the total number of interventions (D). This is a key efficiency feature of the framework.\n\n2. The framework is based on a novel tensor factor model across units, measurements, and interventions.

The most likely explanation for the hybrid model underperforming both individual models is that the five-dimensional feature set used to train the logistic regression classifier is not capturing all relevant information about the captions' quality.\n\nThe hybrid model's strength comes from its ability to choose the best caption between the NIC and k-nearest neighbor approaches.

As an example, we looked at the resource-sharing problem typical of economic activities and assumed the distribution of individual actions to define the (1) norm function fostered through mutual comparison of value/action ratio based on the equity theory (progressive tax-like), (2) norm function proportional to resource utilization (proportional tax-like) and (3) fixed norm function independent of resource utilization (fixed tax-like). By carrying out numerical simulation, we showed that the progressive tax-like norm function (i) does not increase disparity for the distribution of the actions, unlike the other norm functions, and (ii) has high resource productivity and low Gini coefficient.

Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network.

Earth Mover's Distance (EMD): This metric computes structural distances between dense image representations, allowing for effective comparison of images even with limited examples.\n\n2. Cross-reference mechanism: This feature is specifically designed to \"effectively alleviate the adverse impact caused by the cluttered background and large intra-class appearance variations.\" This directly addresses the concern about performance in cluttered environments.\n\n3.

Social learning is defined as the ability of a population to aggregate information, a process which must crucially depend on the mechanisms of social interaction. Consumers choosing which product to buy, or voters deciding which option to take respect to an important issues, typically confront external signals to the information gathered from their contacts. Received economic models typically predict that correct social learning occurs in large populations unless some individuals display unbounded influence. We challenge this conclusion by showing that an intuitive threshold process of individual adjustment does not always lead to such social learning. We find, specifically, that three generic regimes exist. And only in one of them, where the threshold is within a suitable intermediate range, the population learns the correct information. In the other two, where the threshold is either too high or too low, the system either freezes or enters into persistent flux, respectively.
