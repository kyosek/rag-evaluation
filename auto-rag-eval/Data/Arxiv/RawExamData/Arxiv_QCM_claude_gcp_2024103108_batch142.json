We consider a profit-maximizing model for pricing contracts as an extension of the unit-demand envy-free pricing problem: customers aim to choose a contract maximizing their utility based on a reservation price and multiple price coefficients (attributes). Classical approaches suppose that the customers have deterministic utilities; then, the response of each customer is highly sensitive to price since it concentrates on the best offer. To circumvent the intrinsic instability of deterministic models, we introduce a quadratically regularized model of customer's response, which leads to a quadratic program under complementarity constraints (QPCC). This provides an alternative to the classical logit approach, still allowing to robustify the model, while keeping a strong geometrical structure. In particular, we show that the customer's response is governed by a polyhedral complex, in which every polyhedral cell determines a set of contracts which is effectively chosen.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received much attention recently because of their excellent performance on graph-based tasks.

In this paper, we propose self-enhanced GNN (SEG), which improves the quality of the input data using the outputs of existing GNN models for better performance on semi-supervised node classification. As graph data consist of both topology and node labels, we improve input data quality from both perspectives. For topology, we observe that higher classification accuracy can be achieved when the ratio of inter-class edges (connecting nodes from different classes) is low and propose topology update to remove inter-class edges and add intra-class edges. For node labels, we propose training node augmentation, which enlarges the training set using the labels predicted by existing GNN models.

Motivated by the work of Guillot (2010), we present a semi-analytical formalism for calculating the temperature-pressure profiles in hot Jovian atmospheres which includes the effects of clouds/hazes and collision-induced absorption. Using the dual-band approximation, we assume that stellar irradiation and thermal emission from the hot Jupiter occur at distinct wavelengths (\"shortwave\" versus \"longwave\"). For a purely absorbing cloud/haze, we demonstrate its dual effect of cooling and warming the upper and lower atmosphere, respectively, which modifies, in a non-trivial manner, the condition for whether a temperature inversion is present in the upper atmosphere. The warming effect becomes more pronounced as the cloud/haze deck resides at greater depths. If it sits below the shortwave photosphere, the warming effect becomes either more subdued or ceases altogether. If shortwave scattering is present, its dual effect is to warm and cool the upper and lower atmosphere, respectively, thus counteracting the effects of enhanced longwave absorption by the cloud/haze.

With the development of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is shown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation of the Dynamic Interference Steering (DIS) scheme as presented in the document?\n\nA) It completely eliminates interference in heterogeneous cellular networks without any associated costs.\n\nB) It uses only Channel State Information (CSI) to suppress interference at the receiver.\n\nC) It generates a signal that modifies the spatial characteristics of interference to achieve partial or full cancellation at the victim receiver.\n\nD) It solely focuses on reducing the transmitter's power consumption without considering interference management.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.
