Dynamic discrete choice models often discretize the state vector and restrict its dimension in order to achieve valid inference. I propose a novel two-stage estimator for the set-identified structural parameter that incorporates a high-dimensional state space into the dynamic model of imperfect competition. In the first stage, I estimate the state variable's law of motion and the equilibrium policy function using machine learning tools. In the second stage, I plug the first-stage estimates into a moment inequality and solve for the structural parameter. The moment function is presented as the sum of two components, where the first one expresses the equilibrium assumption and the second one is a bias correction term that makes the sum insensitive (i.e., orthogonal) to first-stage bias. The proposed estimator uniformly converges at the root-N rate and I use it to construct confidence regions.

We probe the cosmological consequences of a recently proposed class of solutions to the cosmological constant problem. In these models, the universe undergoes a long period of inflation followed by a contraction and a bounce that sets the stage for the hot big bang era. A requirement of any successful early universe model is that it must reproduce the observed scale-invariant density perturbations at CMB scales. While these class of models involve a long period of inflation, the inflationary Hubble scale during their observationally relevant stages is at or below the current Hubble scale, rendering the de Sitter fluctuations too weak to seed the CMB anisotropies. We show that sufficiently strong perturbations can still be sourced thermally if the relaxion field serving as the inflaton interacts with a thermal bath, which can be generated and maintained by the same interaction. We present a simple model where the relaxion field is derivatively (i.e. technically naturally) coupled to a non-abelian gauge sector, which gets excited tachyonically and subsequently thermalizes due to its nonlinear self-interactions.

The model addresses the cosmological constant problem through a relaxation mechanism involving a long period of inflation followed by contraction and a bounce. However, the inflationary Hubble scale during observationally relevant stages is too low to generate sufficient de Sitter fluctuations for CMB anisotropies. Instead, the model proposes that the relaxion field (acting as the inflaton) interacts with a thermal bath, specifically a non-abelian gauge sector. This interaction generates thermal perturbations strong enough to source the observed CMB anisotropies.

But these models require a considerable number of patient-specific seizures to be recorded for extracting the preictal and interictal EEG data for training a classifier. The increase in sensitivity and specificity for seizure prediction using the machine learning models is noteworthy. However, the need for a significant number of patient-specific seizures and periodic retraining of the model because of non-stationary EEG creates difficulties for designing practical device for a patient. To mitigate this process, we propose a Siamese neural network based seizure prediction method that takes a wavelet transformed EEG tensor as an input with convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base network for detecting change-points in EEG.

In this paper, we develop a completely different approach in using a non-probabilistic framework based on the algorithmic information theory initially developed by Kolmogorov (1965). We present some elements of this theory and show why it is particularly relevant to Finance, and potentially to other sub-fields of Economics as well. We develop a generic method to estimate the Kolmogorov complexity of numeric series. This approach is based on an iterative \"regularity erasing procedure\" implemented to use lossless compression algorithms on financial data. Examples are provided with both simulated and real-world financial time series. The contributions of this article are twofold. The first one is methodological : we show that some structural regularities, invisible with classical statistical tests, can be detected by this algorithmic method. The second one consists in illustrations on the daily Dow-Jones Index suggesting that beyond several well-known regularities, hidden structure may in this index remain to be identified."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the novel approach and findings of the research on estimating the algorithmic complexity of stock markets, as presented in the Arxiv documentation?\n\nA) The study applies traditional probabilistic methods to analyze stock market regularities and concludes that the Dow-Jones Index has no hidden structures.\n\nB) The research uses Kolmogorov complexity to identify structural regularities in financial time series that are undetectable by classical statistical tests, suggesting potential hidden structures in the Dow-Jones Index.\n\nC) The paper develops a new probabilistic framework based on Kolmogorov's work to estimate the randomness in stock markets, proving the efficient market hypothesis.\n\nD) The study applies lossless compression algorithms to financial data to calculate exact Kolmogorov complexity values, disproving the existence of any regularities in the Dow-Jones Index.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the key elements and findings of the research described in the Arxiv documentation.
