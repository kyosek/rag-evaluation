Different relativistic quantum mechanics approaches have recently been used to calculate properties of various systems, form factors in particular.

It was shown that accounting for constraints related to space-time translations could considerably reduce this range. It is shown here that predictions can be made identical for a large range of cases. These ones include the following approaches: instant form, front form, and \"point-form\" in arbitrary momentum configurations and a dispersion-relation approach which can be considered as the approach which the other ones should converge to.
