We show that these neutron stars are relatively young and are going through a transition from the propeller state to the accretor state. The pulsars activity in the gamma-rays is connected with their relative youth and is provided by the energy stored in the non-equilibrium layer located in the crust of low-mass neutron stars. This energy can be released due to mixing of matter in the neutron star crust with super heavy nuclei approaching its surface and getting unstable. The nuclei fission in the low-density region initiates chain reactions leading to the nuclear explosion.

This paper studies a penalized statistical decision rule for the treatment assignment problem. Consider the setting of a utilitarian policy maker who must use sample data to allocate a binary treatment to members of a population, based on their observable characteristics. We model this problem as a statistical decision problem where the policy maker must choose a subset of the covariate space to assign to treatment, out of a class of potential subsets. We focus on settings in which the policy maker may want to select amongst a collection of constrained subset classes: examples include choosing the number of covariates over which to perform best-subset selection, and model selection when approximating a complicated class via a sieve. We adapt and extend results from statistical learning to develop the Penalized Welfare Maximization (PWM) rule. We establish an oracle inequality for the regret of the PWM rule which shows that it is able to perform model selection over the collection of available classes.

Real-world social and economic networks typically display a number of particular topological properties, such as a giant connected component, a broad degree distribution, the small-world property and the presence of communities of densely interconnected nodes. Several models, including ensembles of networks also known in social science as Exponential Random Graphs, have been proposed with the aim of reproducing each of these properties in isolation. Here we define a generalized ensemble of graphs by introducing the concept of graph temperature, controlling the degree of topological optimization of a network. We consider the temperature-dependent version of both existing and novel models and show that all the aforementioned topological properties can be simultaneously understood as the natural outcomes of an optimized, low-temperature topology. We also show that seemingly different graph models, as well as techniques used to extract information from real networks, are all found to be particular low-temperature cases of the same generalized formalism. One such technique allows us to extend our approach to real weighted networks. Our results suggest that a low graph temperature might be an ubiquitous property of real socio-economic networks, placing conditions on the diffusion of information across these systems."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between graph temperature and the topological properties of social and economic networks, as presented in the article?\n\nA) Graph temperature is inversely related to the degree of topological optimization, with lower temperatures resulting in more optimized network structures.\n\nB) Higher graph temperatures lead to the emergence of properties such as giant connected components and broad degree distributions.\n\nC) Graph temperature has no significant impact on the topological properties of social and economic networks.\n\nD) The concept of graph temperature is only applicable to weighted networks and cannot be used to analyze other network properties.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A.

The magneto-rotational instability is presently the most promising source of turbulent transport in accretion disks. However, some important issues still need to be addressed to quantify the role of MRI in disks; in particular no systematic investigation of the role of the physical dimensionless parameters of the problem on the dimensionless transport has been undertaken yet. First, we complete existing investigations on the field strength dependence by showing that the transport in high magnetic pressure disks close to marginal stability is highly time-dependent and surprisingly efficient. Second, we bring to light a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl number, with $\\alpha\\propto Pm^\\delta$ for the explored range: $0.12<Pm<8$ and $200<Re<6400$ ($\\delta$ being in the range 0.25 to 0.5).
