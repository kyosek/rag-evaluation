Likelihood-free methods are an established approach for performing approximate Bayesian inference for models with intractable likelihood functions. However, they can be computationally demanding. Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) is a popular such method that approximates the likelihood function of the summary statistic with a known, tractable distribution -- typically Gaussian -- and then performs statistical inference using standard likelihood-based techniques. However, as the number of summary statistics grows, the number of model simulations required to accurately estimate the covariance matrix for this likelihood rapidly increases.

The mechanism of atrial fibrillation (AF) is poorly understood, resulting in disappointing success rates of ablative treatment. Different mechanisms defined largely by different atrial activation patterns have been proposed and, arguably, this dispute has slowed the progress of AF research. Recent clinical evidence suggests a unifying mechanism based on sustained re-entrant circuits in the complex atrial architecture. Here, we present a simple computational model showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a theoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation. We show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct consequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells through which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface. The model naturally follows the clinical spectrum of AF spanning sinus rhythm, paroxysmal and persistent AF as the decoupling of myocardial cells results in the lattice approaching the percolation threshold. This allows the model to make additional predictions beyond the current clinical understanding, showing that for paroxysmal AF re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium, but in persistent AF they emerge deeper in the bulk of the atrial wall where endocardial ablation is less effective.

It suggests that in paroxysmal AF, re-entrant circuits emerge near the endocardium (the inner layer of the heart). In contrast, for persistent AF, the model predicts that these circuits form deeper within the bulk of the atrial wall. This difference in location could explain why endocardial ablation is less effective in treating long-lasting persistent AF, as the targets for ablation are situated deeper in the tissue and may be harder to reach.

A Case Study in\n  Financial Risk Behavior Forecasting. The paper examines the potential of deep learning to support decisions in financial risk management. We develop a deep learning model for predicting whether individual spread traders secure profits from future trades. This task embodies typical modeling challenges faced in risk and behavior forecasting. Conventional machine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-target relationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, and revision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable, heterogeneous patterns such as trader behavior is challenging. Deep learning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations of the data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncovers generative features that determine the target (e.g., trader's profitability), avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g. dynamic market conditions).

While these class of models involve a long period of inflation, the inflationary Hubble scale during their observationally relevant stages is at or below the current Hubble scale, rendering the de Sitter fluctuations too weak to seed the CMB anisotropies. We show that sufficiently strong perturbations can still be sourced thermally if the relaxion field serving as the inflaton interacts with a thermal bath, which can be generated and maintained by the same interaction. We present a simple model where the relaxion field is derivatively (i.e. technically naturally) coupled to a non-abelian gauge sector, which gets excited tachyonically and subsequently thermalizes due to its nonlinear self-interactions.

Diversity is a central concept in many fields. Despite its importance, there is no unified methodological framework to measure diversity and its three components of variety, balance and disparity. Current approaches take into account disparity of the types by considering their pairwise similarities. Pairwise similarities between types do not adequately capture total disparity, since they fail to take into account in which way pairs are similar. Hence, pairwise similarities do not discriminate between similarity of types in terms of the same feature and similarity of types in terms of different features. This paper presents an alternative approach which is based similarities of features between types over the whole set. The proposed measure of diversity properly takes into account the aspects of variety, balance and disparity, and without having to set an arbitrary weight for each aspect of diversity. Based on this measure, the 'ABC decomposition' is introduced, which provides separate measures for the variety, balance and disparity, allowing them to enter analysis separately.
