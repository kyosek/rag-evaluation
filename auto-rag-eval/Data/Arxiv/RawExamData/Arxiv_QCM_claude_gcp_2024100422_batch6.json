Though three distinct wounding mechanisms (permanent cavity, temporary cavity, and ballistic pressure wave) are described in the wound ballistics literature, they all have their physical origin in the retarding force between bullet and tissue as the bullet penetrates. If the bullet path is the same, larger retarding forces produce larger wounding effects and a greater probability of rapid incapacitation. By Newton's third law, the force of the bullet on the tissue is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the tissue on the bullet. For bullets penetrating with constant mass, the retarding force on the bullet can be determined by frame by frame analysis of high speed video of the bullet penetrating a suitable tissue simulant such as calibrated 10% ballistic gelatin. Here the technique is demonstrated with 9mm NATO bullets, 32 cm long blocks of gelatin, and a high speed video camera operating at 20,000 frames per second. It is found that different 9mm NATO bullets have a wide variety of potential for wounding and rapid incapacitation. This technique also determines the energy transfer in the first 15 cm and/or first 30 cm of tissue, which are important parameters in estimating the probability of rapid incapacitation in some of the ARL/BRL models.

A volatility surface is an important tool for pricing and hedging derivatives. The surface shows the volatility that is implied by the market price of an option on an asset as a function of the option's strike price and maturity. Often, market data is incomplete and it is necessary to estimate missing points on partially observed surfaces. In this paper, we show how variational autoencoders can be used for this task. The first step is to derive latent variables that can be used to construct synthetic volatility surfaces that are indistinguishable from those observed historically. The second step is to determine the synthetic surface generated by our latent variables that fits available data as closely as possible. As a dividend of our first step, the synthetic surfaces produced can also be used in stress testing, in market simulators for developing quantitative investment strategies, and for the valuation of exotic options. We illustrate our procedure and demonstrate its power using foreign exchange market data."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A quant is using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to estimate missing points on a partially observed volatility surface.

Here we present numerical evidence for a modified `local' Brink-Axel hypothesis for Gamow-Teller transitions for $pf$-shell nuclei relevant to astrophysical applications. Specifically, while the original Brink-Axel hypothesis does not hold globally, strength functions from initial states nearby in energy are similar within statistical fluctuations. This agrees with previous work on strength function moments. Using this modified hypothesis, we can tackle strength functions at previously intractable initial energies, using semi-converged initial states at arbitrary excitation energy.

In this paper we consider a mathematical model of RNAi with particular emphasis on time delays associated with two aspects of primed amplification: binding of siRNA to aberrant RNA, and binding of siRNA to mRNA, both of which result in the expanded production of dsRNA responsible for RNA silencing. Analytical and numerical stability analyses are performed to identify regions of stability of different steady states and to determine conditions on parameters that lead to instability.

Here, we use high-speed imaging of single pipette-held cells to quantify the rich dynamics exhibited by their flagella. Underlying this variability in behaviour, are biological dissimilarities between the two flagella - termed cis and trans, with respect to a unique eyespot. With emphasis on the wildtype, we use digital tracking with sub-beat-cycle resolution to obtain limit cycles and phases for self-sustained flagellar oscillations.

For a Mn impurity on the surface, the associated acceptor-hole wavefunction tends to be more localized around the Mn than for an impurity in bulk GaAs. The magnetic anisotropy energy for isolated Mn impurities is of the order of 1 meV, and can be related to the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment of the Mn acceptor hole. Typically Mn pairs have their spin magnetic moments parallel aligned, with an exchange energy that strongly depends on the pair orientation on the surface.
