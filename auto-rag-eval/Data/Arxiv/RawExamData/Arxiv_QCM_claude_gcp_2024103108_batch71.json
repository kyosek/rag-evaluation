Glassy polymers show strain hardening: at constant extensional load, their flow first accelerates, then arrests. Recent experiments under such loading have found this to be accompanied by a striking dip in the segmental relaxation time. This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify. Here we present new results for the corresponding behavior under step-stress shear loading, to which very similar physics applies. To explain the unloading behavior in the extensional case requires introduction of a crinkle factor describing a rapid loss of segmental ordering. We discuss in more detail here the physics of this, which we argue involves non-entropic contributions to the polymer stress, and which might lead to some important differences between shear and elongation. We also discuss some fundamental and possibly testable issues concerning the physical meaning of entropic elasticity in vitrified polymers. Finally we present new results for the startup of steady shear flow, addressing the possible role of transient shear banding."}, "answer": "Here's a challenging multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between segmental relaxation time and strain hardening in glassy polymers under extensional load, according to recent experiments?\n\nA) Segmental relaxation time increases steadily as strain hardening occurs.\nB) There is no significant change in segmental relaxation time during strain hardening.\nC) Segmental relaxation time exhibits a pronounced dip coinciding with strain hardening.\nD) Segmental relaxation time shows random fluctuations unrelated to strain hardening.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of a key experimental finding described in the document.

Biomass is the renewable key player in the heterogeneous heat sector today.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a likelihood-free approach for Bayesian inferences based on a rejection algorithm method that applies a tolerance of dissimilarity between summary statistics from observed and simulated data.

A continuous variable changing between 0 and 1 is introduced to characterise contentment, or satisfaction with life, of an individual and an equation governing its evolution is postulated from analysis of several factors likely to affect the contentment.

The equation so obtained is used to compute evolution of this joint distribution in a society with initially low variation of wealth and contentment over a long period time. As illustration of this model capabilities, effects of the wealth tax rate are simulated and it is shown that a higher taxation in the longer run may lead to a wealthier and more content society.

We show that, contrary to the prevailing opinion, the NLM weights do not allow to get a reliable measure of the similarity in a noisy image, unless one add a locality constraint. As an image denoising method, the Non-Local Means prove to be local. Some works had already pointed out that to get the best denoising performances with the NLM algorithm, one should run it locally. But no general conclusion has been yet proposed and the only explanation that was proposed to justify the experimental results is not sufficient. Our study based on experimental evidence proves that, on average on natural images, the bias of the NLM estimator is an increasing function of the radius of the similarity searching zone. The reason for this phenomenon is that noise disrupts the order of similarity between patches. Hence the mean squared error between the original image and the NLM estimation, which is the sum of the bias, the variance and the covariance of the estimator, has an absolute minimum for a disk of radius 3 to 4 pixels."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason that the Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm is considered a local image denoising method, despite its name and initial conception?\n\nA) The algorithm only processes neighboring pixels in small local regions.\nB) The NLM weights are unreliable for measuring similarity in noisy images without a locality constraint.\nC) The bias of the NLM estimator decreases as the radius of the similarity searching zone increases.\nD) The algorithm performs best when applied globally across the entire image.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the counterintuitive nature of the Non-Local Means algorithm.
