The weights are given by the conditional density function of the innovation term in the QR structural model, conditional on the endogeneous and exogenous covariates, and the instruments as well, at a given quantile.

To alleviate these perception costs, we develop a novel simultaneous perception-action design framework wherein an agent senses only the task-relevant information. This formulation differs from that of a partially observable Markov decision process, since the agent is free to synthesize not only its policy for action selection but also its belief-dependent observation function.

We explicate, clarify and extend the proofs of these theorems to some standard matter (scalar and electromagnetic) field theories in curved spacetime, and then we show why these proofs fail in general relativity; due to properties of the gravitational Hamiltonian and phase space measures, the second law of thermodynamics holds. As a concrete application, we focus on the consequences of these results for the gravitational two-body problem, and in particular, we prove the non-compactness of the phase space of perturbed Schwarzschild-Droste spacetimes.

The small but nonzero v3 value (approximately 0.01) that shows no significant dependence on jet pT or centrality suggests that fluctuations in the initial state play a small but distinct role in jet energy loss. This is because v3 is primarily driven by initial-state geometry fluctuations rather than the overall collision geometry.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because a large v2 is not indicative of strong initial-state fluctuations; rather, it reflects the path-length dependent energy loss in the elliptical overlap region.\n\n4. Option B is partly correct about v2 but misinterprets v3. A constant v3 does not indicate uniform energy loss, but rather the presence of initial-state fluctuations.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect because while final-state interactions (i.e., jet quenching) are important for v2, the v3 result is more consistent with initial-state effects.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze and interpret complex experimental results, requiring a deep understanding of heavy-ion collision dynamics, jet quenching phenomena, and the physical meaning of different azimuthal anisotropy coefficients."}, "29": {"documentation": {"title": "Collective and synchronous dynamics of photonic spiking neurons", "source": "Takahiro Inagaki, Kensuke Inaba, Timoth\\'ee Leleu, Toshimori Honjo,\n  Takuya Ikuta, Koji Enbutsu, Takeshi Umeki, Ryoichi Kasahara, Kazuyuki Aihara,\n  Hiroki Takesue", "docs_id": "2009.11454", "section": ["physics.optics", "cs.ET", "nlin.AO"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Collective and synchronous dynamics of photonic spiking neurons.

We find that the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime happens at a time scale $\\tau_c$ that attains a minimum at zero friction, meaning that both injection and dissipation of energy delay the relaxation of tracers. We explain this by proposing that $\\tau_c \\sim 2 \\ell^*/u_{\\text{rms}}$, where $\\ell^*$ is a dominant length scale extracted from energy spectrum peak, and $u_{\\text{rms}}$ is a velocity scale that sets the kinetic energy at steady state, both scales monotonically decrease with friction. Finally, we predict robust scaling laws for $\\ell^*$, $u_{\\text{rms}}$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\mathcal{D} \\sim \\ell^* u_{\\text{rms}} / 2$, that are valid over a wide range of fluid friction. Our findings might be relevant to transport phenomena in a generic active fluid."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about friction scaling laws in bacterial turbulence, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the transport of passive tracers in a bacterial suspension using a continuum model. They observe that the time scale for the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime, \u03c4c, varies with different levels of Ekmann friction. Which of the following best explains the relationship between \u03c4c and friction, and why?\n\nA) \u03c4c increases monotonically with friction due to increased energy dissipation slowing down tracer relaxation\nB) \u03c4c decreases monotonically with friction because higher friction reduces the dominant length scale and velocity\nC) \u03c4c exhibits a minimum at zero friction, as both energy injection and dissipation delay tracer relaxation\nD) \u03c4c remains constant regardless of friction, as it depends only on the initial bacterial concentration\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that \"the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime happens at a time scale \u03c4c that attains a minimum at zero friction, meaning that both injection and dissipation of energy delay the relaxation of tracers.\" This non-monotonic relationship between \u03c4c and friction is counterintuitive and requires analysis of multiple concepts.\n\nThe explanation provided in the documentation is that \u03c4c ~ 2\u2113*/urms, where \u2113* is a dominant length scale extracted from the energy spectrum peak, and urms is a velocity scale that sets the kinetic energy at steady state. Both \u2113* and urms monotonically decrease with friction. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes a monotonic increase, which contradicts the documented minimum at zero friction. Option B is incorrect for similar reasons, assuming a monotonic decrease. Option D is incorrect because \u03c4c does vary with friction, and it depends on more factors than just bacterial concentration.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (friction, energy dissipation, length scales, and velocity scales) and tests the ability to analyze the complex relationship between these factors in a real-world scenario of bacterial turbulence.

This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a soft growing robot manipulator, and demonstrates them in both real and simulated scenarios.

The energy loss of charm quarks in the hot and dense medium created in PbPb collisions would affect both $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ and D$^0$ production similarly, leading to suppression of both particles but maintaining their relative production ratio.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if charm quarks were preferentially suppressed, we would expect to see a change in the $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$/D$^0$ ratio between pp and PbPb collisions.\n\nOption B is also incorrect for the same reason as A; a change in hadronization favoring D$^0$ over $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ would alter the production ratio, which is not observed.\n\nOption D is a distractor based on the different $p_\\mathrm{T}$ ranges mentioned in the documentation, but it's incorrect because the comparison for the possible suppression is made within the same $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range (10-20 GeV/c) for both collision systems.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze complex data, integrate multiple concepts, and apply critical thinking to a real-world scenario in particle physics research."}, "84": {"documentation": {"title": "Network induces burst synchronisation in cat brain", "source": "Ewandson L.

The agreement with CLAS data for one specific resonance doesn't prove that relativistic effects are negligible. In fact, the documentation mentions that a relativistic version of the hCQM was used for calculating elastic nucleon form factors, indicating the importance of relativistic considerations.\n\nThe correct answer (B) requires analyzing the implications of the model's predictions beyond simply reproducing known data.
