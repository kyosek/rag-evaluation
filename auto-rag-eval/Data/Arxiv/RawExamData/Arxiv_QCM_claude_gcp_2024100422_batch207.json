Objective: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a time-consuming process involving iterative adjustments of hyperparameters. To automate the treatment planning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner (MP).

This aligns with option B, which correctly summarizes these findings and their potential implications.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it describes the old view of QGP, which the text says has been changed.\n\nOption C is wrong because the text indicates that the formation of these structures occurs in the same temperature range as binary states, which is around 1-1.5 times T_c, not much higher.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the presence of these structures is associated with stronger interactions, not weaker ones, and the text suggests this could potentially increase, not decrease, effects like charm quenching."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Generalized Energy Based Models", "source": "Michael Arbel and Liang Zhou and Arthur Gretton", "docs_id": "2003.05033", "section": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Generalized Energy Based Models. We introduce the Generalized Energy Based Model (GEBM) for generative modelling.

We show that both training stages are well-defined: the energy is learned by maximising a generalized likelihood, and the resulting energy-based loss provides informative gradients for learning the base. Samples from the posterior on the latent space of the trained model can be obtained via MCMC, thus finding regions in this space that produce better quality samples. Empirically, the GEBM samples on image-generation tasks are of much better quality than those from the learned generator alone, indicating that all else being equal, the GEBM will outperform a GAN of the same complexity.

The documentation states that GEBMs combine two trained components: a base distribution and an energy function. The base distribution, which is generally an implicit model, learns the support of data with low intrinsic dimension in a high dimensional space. The energy function then refines the probability mass on this learned support.

However, at higher instantaneous luminosity or in detectors with coarse calorimeter segmentation, the overlaps of calorimeter energy deposits from charged and neutral particles significantly complicate particle energy reconstruction, reducing the overall energy resolution of the method.

We propose a simple, practical and intuitive approach to improve the performance of a conventional controller in uncertain environments using deep reinforcement learning while maintaining safe operation. Our approach is motivated by the observation that conventional controllers in industrial motion control value robustness over adaptivity to deal with different operating conditions and are suboptimal as a consequence. Reinforcement learning on the other hand can optimize a control signal directly from input-output data and thus adapt to operational conditions, but lacks safety guarantees, impeding its use in industrial environments. To realize adaptive control using reinforcement learning in such conditions, we follow a residual learning methodology, where a reinforcement learning algorithm learns corrective adaptations to a base controller's output to increase optimality. We investigate how constraining the residual agent's actions enables to leverage the base controller's robustness to guarantee safe operation. We detail the algorithmic design and propose to constrain the residual actions relative to the base controller to increase the method's robustness.
