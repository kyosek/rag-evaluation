Clustering is ubiquitous in data analysis, including analysis of time series. It is inherently subjective: different users may prefer different clusterings for a particular dataset. Semi-supervised clustering addresses this by allowing the user to provide examples of instances that should (not) be in the same cluster. This paper studies semi-supervised clustering in the context of time series. We show that COBRAS, a state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering method, can be adapted to this setting. We refer to this approach as COBRAS-TS. An extensive experimental evaluation supports the following claims: (1) COBRAS-TS far outperforms the current state of the art in semi-supervised clustering for time series, and thus presents a new baseline for the field; (2) COBRAS-TS can identify clusters with separated components; (3) COBRAS-TS can identify clusters that are characterized by small local patterns; (4) a small amount of semi-supervision can greatly improve clustering quality for time series; (5) the choice of the clustering algorithm matters (contrary to earlier claims in the literature)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantages of COBRAS-TS in the context of semi-supervised clustering for time series data?\n\nA) It eliminates the need for user input in clustering time series data\nB) It performs equally well as existing methods but with less computational complexity\nC) It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and can identify clusters with specific characteristics\nD) It proves that the choice of clustering algorithm is irrelevant for time series data\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C because the passage explicitly states that COBRAS-TS \"far outperforms the current state of the art in semi-supervised clustering for time series\" and can identify clusters with separated components and those characterized by small local patterns.

Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with probabilistic dynamical models are amongst the most data-efficient learning methods.

However, while most algorithms distinguish these two uncertainties for learning the model, they ignore it when optimizing the policy, which leads to greedy and insufficient exploration. At the same time, there are no practical solvers for optimistic exploration algorithms. In this paper, we propose a practical optimistic exploration algorithm (H-UCRL). H-UCRL reparameterizes the set of plausible models and hallucinates control directly on the epistemic uncertainty. By augmenting the input space with the hallucinated inputs, H-UCRL can be solved using standard greedy planners. Furthermore, we analyze H-UCRL and construct a general regret bound for well-calibrated models, which is provably sublinear in the case of Gaussian Process models.

The aim of this study is to investigate bursts- related EEG signals in a focal hand dystonia patient. Despite of considering time domain and frequency domain techniques as mutually exclusive analysis, in this contribution we have taken advantage from both of them: particularly, in the frequency domain, coherence was used to identify the most likely frequency bands of interaction between brain and muscles, then, in the time domain, cross-correlation was exploited to verify the physiological reliability of such a relationship in terms of signal transmission delay from the centre to the periphery. Our preliminary results suggest - in line with recent literature - that activity in the high beta band (around 30 Hz) could represent an electroencephalographic correlate for the pathological electromyographic bursts affecting the focal hand dystonia condition. Even though a future study on a larger sample is needed to statistically support these preliminary findings, this contribution allows to think of new kinds of rehabilitation from focal hand dystonia that could target the actual electroencephalographic correlate of the pathology, i.e. phenotypically expressed by bursts, with the consequence of a relevant functional improvement."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the coherence study on EEG and EMG signals for focal hand dystonia, which of the following combinations of analysis techniques and findings best describes the research approach and results?\n\nA) Time domain analysis using cross-correlation to identify frequency bands, followed by frequency domain coherence to verify signal transmission delay.\n\nB) Frequency domain coherence to identify interaction frequency bands, followed by time domain cross-correlation to verify signal transmission delay from brain to muscles.\n\nC) Time domain analysis to identify bursts, followed by frequency domain coherence to determine the electroencephalographic correlate of pathological bursts.\n\nD) Simultaneous time and frequency domain analysis to identify bursts and their corresponding brain activity, without considering signal transmission delay.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the study used a two-step approach that combined frequency and time domain techniques.

In this paper, we present a novel flexible image enoising network (CFMNet) by equipping an U-Net backbone with multi-layer conditional feature modulation (CFM) modules. In comparison to channel-wise shifting only in the first layer, CFMNet can make better use of noise level information by deploying multiple layers of CFM. Moreover, each CFM module takes onvolutional features from both noisy image and noise level map as input for better trade-off between noise removal and detail preservation. Experimental results show that our CFMNet is effective in exploiting noise level information for flexible non-blind denoising, and performs favorably against the existing deep image denoising methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the key innovation of the Conditional Feature Modulation Network (CFMNet) for flexible non-blind image denoising, as compared to existing deep networks?\n\nA) It uses an entirely new backbone architecture instead of U-Net\nB) It applies noise level information only to the first convolutional layer\nC) It incorporates multi-layer conditional feature modulation modules throughout the network\nD) It eliminates the need for a noise level map input altogether\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key innovation of CFMNet is its use of multi-layer conditional feature modulation (CFM) modules throughout the network.

We define a model of non-deterministic, 2-way, concurrent automata working on series-parallel graphs and communicating through shared registers on the nodes of the graph. We consider the following verification problem: given a family of series-parallel graphs described by a context-free graph transformation system (GTS), and a concurrent automaton over series-parallel graphs, is some graph generated by the GTS accepted by the automaton?

Specifically, when the automata are restricted to a fixed number of reversals along the graph and use a fixed number of shared registers, the problem becomes decidable.

The momentum anisotropy is included explicitly in the leading term, allowing for a large difference between the longitudinal and transverse pressures as well as for non trivial transverse dynamics.

The two objects are chemically very similar to the 21micron objects discussed in Van Winckel & Reyniers (2000). A homogeneous comparison with the results of these objects reveals that the relation between the third dredge-up efficiency and the neutron nucleosynthesis efficiency found for the 21micron objects, is further strengthened.
