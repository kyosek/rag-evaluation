Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction in the field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy in visual recognition. Recent works have pushed the performance of GPU implementations of CNNs to significantly improve their classification and training times. With these improvements, many frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs on both CPUs and GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work we present a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized FPGA implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device when necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device, simple-to-use test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer implementations. To validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel environment to implement an FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and show that the FPGA layer can be used alongside other layers running on a host processor to run several popular CNNs (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A, Overfeat). The results show that our framework achieves 50 GFLOPS across 3x3 convolutions in the benchmarks.

The primary innovation of the \"Caffeinated FPGAs\" framework is that it modifies the popular Caffe CNN framework to support FPGA implementations.

The spatial variation features of the magnetic fields are analyzed in detail for non-central Pb - Pb collisions at LHC $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 900, 2760 and 7000 GeV and Au-Au collisions at RHIC $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV. The dependencies of magnetic field on proper time, collision energies and impact parameters are investigated in this paper. It is shown that a enormous with highly inhomogeneous spatial distribution magnetic field can indeed be created in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions in RHIC and LHC energy regions. The enormous magnetic field is quite large, especially just after the collision, and then decreases rapidly with time. We are surprised to find that the magnetic effect decreases with increasing energy from RHIC to LHC energy region.

The decrease could be explained by the faster expansion of the collision system at higher energies, which would cause the charges responsible for generating the magnetic field to spread out more quickly, thereby reducing the field strength.
