The question asks about a 2048x2048 pixel image, which has 4 times as many pixels as the 1024x1024 image. Assuming the speed-up scales linearly with image size (which is a reasonable assumption given the complexity reduction from O(N_x^2 N_y^2) to O(N_x N_y)), we would expect the speed-up to be approximately 4 times greater for the larger image.
