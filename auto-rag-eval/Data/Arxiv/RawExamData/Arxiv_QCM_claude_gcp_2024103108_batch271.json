End-to-end (E2E) models have achieved promising results on multiple speech recognition benchmarks, and shown the potential to become the mainstream. However, the unified structure and the E2E training hamper injecting contextual information into them for contextual biasing. Though contextual LAS (CLAS) gives an excellent all-neural solution, the degree of biasing to given context information is not explicitly controllable. In this paper, we focus on incorporating context information into the continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) based model that supports contextual biasing in a more controllable fashion. Specifically, an extra context processing network is introduced to extract contextual embeddings, integrate acoustically relevant context information and decode the contextual output distribution, thus forming a collaborative decoding with the decoder of the CIF-based model. Evaluated on the named entity rich evaluation sets of HKUST/AISHELL-2, our method brings relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 8.83%/21.13% and relative named entity character error rate (NE-CER) reduction of 40.14%/51.50% when compared with a strong baseline.

In this paper, we propose a continual learning method that is able to learn additional tasks while retaining the performance of previously learned tasks by stacking parameters.

This dissertation comprises three collections of results, all united by a common theme. The theme is the study of categories via algebraic techniques, considering categories themselves as algebraic objects. This algebraic approach to category theory is central to noncommutative algebraic geometry, as realized by recent advances in the study of noncommutative motives. We have success proving algebraic results in the general setting of symmetric monoidal and semiring $\\infty$-categories, which categorify abelian groups and rings, respectively. For example, we prove that modules over the semiring category Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\\infty$-categories, and modules over Burn (the Burnside $\\infty$-category) are additive $\\infty$-categories. As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic $\\text{Fin}^\\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher categorical study of Lawvere theories. We prove that Lawvere theories function as a home for an algebraic Yoneda lemma. Finally, we provide evidence for a formal duality between naive and genuine equivariant homotopy theory, in the form of a group-theoretic Eilenberg-Watts Theorem. This sets up a parallel between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory, where Burnside constructions are analogous to Morita theory. We conjecture that this relationship could be made precise within the context of noncommutative motives over the field with one element."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between Lawvere theories and modules over the semiring category Fin of finite sets, as presented in the dissertation?\n\nA) Lawvere theories are isomorphic to Fin-modules in the category of \u221e-categories.\n\nB) Lawvere theories can be regarded as cyclic Fin^op-modules, providing an algebraic foundation for their higher categorical study.\n\nC) Lawvere theories are equivalent to additive \u221e-categories, similar to modules over the Burnside \u221e-category.\n\nD) Lawvere theories form a subcategory of cocartesian monoidal \u221e-categories, which are modules over Fin.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

One way of determining such avenues would be to calculate the ``potential field'' caused by placing sources at possible goals for the enemy. This requires postulating a functional form for the potential, and also takes long time. Here we instead seek a method for quickly obtaining an effective potential. ANTS, which has previously been used to obtain approximate solutions to various optimization problems, is well suited for this. The output of our method describes possible avenues of approach for the enemy, i.e, areas where we should be prepared for attack.

It has been suggested that multiple agent classes operate in this system, with a non-trivial hierarchy of top-down and bottom-up causation classes with different effective models governing each level. We conjecture that agent classes may in fact operate at different time scales and thus act differently in response to the same perceived market state. Given scale-specific temporal state trajectories and action sequences estimated from aggregate market behaviour, we use Inverse Reinforcement Learning to compute the effective reward function for the aggregate agent class at each scale, allowing us to assess the relative attractiveness of feature vectors across different scales.

Medley has previously been used in many measurements at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL) in Uppsala mainly with a quasi-mono-energetic neutron beam at 96 and 175 MeV.

The documentation states that to conduct measurements at NFS, which uses a white neutron beam, Medley needs to detect reaction products with high temporal resolution to provide the Time of Flight (ToF) of the primary neutron. This is crucial because, unlike the quasi-mono-energetic beam used previously, a white beam contains neutrons of various energies, and determining the energy of each incident neutron is essential for accurate cross-section measurements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of increasing the number of telescopes.

The current Delta E-Delta E-E configuration is presented as adequate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while PPACs are mentioned as potentially useful for detecting fission fragments, they are not suggested as a complete replacement for the silicon detectors.

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has recently shown promising advances on speeding up learning, improving the exploration, and discovering intertask transferable skills.

However, HRL with multiple levels is usually needed in many real-world scenarios, whose ultimate goals are highly abstract, while their actions are very primitive.

By deploying a model of policy prioritization with endogenous government behavior, we estimate the performance of different policy regimes. We find that, while strictly adhering to policy recommendations increases efficiency, the nature of such recipes has a bigger effect. In other words, while it is true that lack of discipline is detrimental to prescription outcomes (a common defense of failed recommendations), it is more important that such prescriptions consider the systemic and adaptive nature of the policymaking process (something neglected by traditional technocratic advice)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best captures the key methodological insights and findings of the research on ex ante policy evaluation for macro models of economic development?\n\nA) Parameter instability can be addressed by using fixed exogenous parameters, and strict adherence to policy recommendations is the most crucial factor for successful outcomes.\n\nB) Social constructs should be represented as stable functional relationships, and agent computing can be used to estimate policy performance, with the nature of policy prescriptions being more important than strict adherence.\n\nC) Learning dynamics are irrelevant in overcoming behavioral constancy issues, and government behavior should be modeled as purely exogenous in policy prioritization.\n\nD) The systemic and adaptive nature of policymaking is less important than discipline in following technocratic advice, and social norms should be treated as fixed parameters.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the two main methodological insights presented in the document:\n\n1.
