A Wasserstein spaces is a metric space of sufficiently concentrated probability measures over a general metric space. The main goal of this paper is to estimate the largeness of Wasserstein spaces, in a sense to be precised. In a first part, we generalize the Hausdorff dimension by defining a family of bi-Lipschitz invariants, called critical parameters, that measure largeness for infinite-dimensional metric spaces. Basic properties of these invariants are given, and they are estimated for a naturel set of spaces generalizing the usual Hilbert cube. In a second part, we estimate the value of these new invariants in the case of some Wasserstein spaces, as well as the dynamical complexity of push-forward maps. The lower bounds rely on several embedding results; for example we provide bi-Lipschitz embeddings of all powers of any space inside its Wasserstein space, with uniform bound and we prove that the Wasserstein space of a d-manifold has \"power-exponential\" critical parameter equal to d."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Wasserstein spaces and critical parameters, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the properties of Wasserstein spaces and their relationship to manifolds.

In this thesis, we develop various techniques for working with sets in machine learning.

Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks. The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations (sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many experiments. The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output). Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some extremely simple datasets.

A particularly simple and elegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and coworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with other networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has to be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises.

Here we numerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded perturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss depends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the kind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an increase of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of polarization.

Understanding the emergence and sustainability of cooperation is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology and is frequently studied by the framework of evolutionary game theory. A very powerful mechanism to promote cooperation is network reciprocity, where the interaction patterns and opportunities for strategy spread of agents are constrained to limited sets of permanent interactions partners. Cooperation survives because it is possible for close-knit communities of cooperation to be shielded from invasion by defectors. Here we show that parameter ranges in which cooperation can survive are strongly expanded if game play on networks is skewed towards more frequent interactions with more successful neighbours. In particular, if agents exclusively select neighbors for game play that are more successful than themselves, cooperation can even dominate in situations in which it would die out if interaction neighbours were chosen without a bias or with a preference for less successful opponents.

This creates pile-up events in the energy region of interest due to the fast half-life of this decay mode combined with the slow response of cryogenic calorimeters.\n\nOption C is correct because the documentation specifically mentions that this background can be suppressed using \"fast and high sensitivity cryogenic light detectors.\" The researchers developed a technique using Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) to simultaneously measure both phonon and scintillation signals, which addresses the background issue while maintaining the crystal's high energy resolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because increasing crystal size doesn't address the pile-up event issue and may even exacerbate it.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation shows that the scintillation time constant remains constant between 10 and 190 mK, so further cooling below 10 mK is unlikely to provide significant benefits.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while CaMoO\u2084 is mentioned as another candidate, it doesn't solve the \u00b9\u2070\u2070Mo decay issue, as molybdenum is still present.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate information about detector properties, background sources, and mitigation strategies in the context of a real-world experimental design challenge."}, "73": {"documentation": {"title": "General Price Bounds for Guaranteed Annuity Options", "source": "Raj Kumari Bahl and Sotirios Sabanis", "docs_id": "1707.00807", "section": ["q-fin.PR", "math.PR", "stat.CO"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "General Price Bounds for Guaranteed Annuity Options.

With a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we demonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase synchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in inducing out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) oscillations compete with each other and give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states and interesting multistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and anti-synchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death (OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter (${\\lambda}$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system, the attractive coupling favours the emergence of an anti-symmetric OD state via a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favours the emergence of a similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation. We show that an increase in the repulsive coupling not only destabilizes the IPS state but also facilitates the re-entrance of the IPS state."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators with both attractive and repulsive couplings, a researcher observes an unexpected transition from in-phase synchronized (IPS) oscillations to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states as the repulsive coupling strength is increased.

Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error correction (QEC).

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that while the inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general, it \"observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states).\" This implies that for GHZ states, which are commonly used in quantum error correction, the algorithm performs in O(n^2) time, offering a significant performance advantage over the general case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the time complexity.

One strategy for winning a coevolutionary struggle is to evolve rapidly. Most of the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and looks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative strategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid evolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we construct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process information, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing. In this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a way that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure of the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the adversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep fitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We suggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their vertebrate hosts.

While it could be useful, using a high discount factor would emphasize long-term transitions, which may not be ideal for detecting small discrepancies in this case.\n\nOption B provides the best balance of accuracy (by allowing small errors) and computational efficiency (PTIME complexity) for comparing PA models in a critical system where small discrepancies need to be accounted for.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (epsilon-bisimulation, computational complexity, logic characterizations, and distance metrics) and apply them to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "Long-range two-hybrid-qubit gates mediated by a microwave cavity with\n  red sidebands", "source": "J.

Implementing two-qubit gates via strong coupling between quantum-dot qubits and a superconducting microwave cavity requires achieving coupling rates that are much faster than decoherence rates. Typically, this involves tuning the qubit either to a sweet spot, where it is relatively insensitive to charge noise, or to a point where it is resonant with the microwave cavity. Unfortunately, such operating points seldom coincide. Here, we theoretically investigate several schemes for performing gates between two quantum-dot hybrid qubits, mediated by a microwave cavity. The rich physics of the quantum dot hybrid qubit gives rise to two types of sweet spots, which can occur at operating points with strong charge dipole moments. Such strong interactions provide new opportunities for off-resonant gating, thereby removing one of the main obstacles for long-distance two-qubit gates. Our results suggest that the numerous tuning knobs of quantum dot hybrid qubits make them good candidates for strong coupling. In particular, we show that off-resonant red-sideband-mediated two-qubit gates can exhibit fidelities $>$95\\% for realistic operating parameters, and we describe improvements that could potentially yield gate fidelities $>$99\\%."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about long-range two-hybrid-qubit gates mediated by a microwave cavity, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is designing a quantum computing system using quantum-dot hybrid qubits and a superconducting microwave cavity. They aim to implement high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates. Which of the following strategies would most likely achieve this goal while addressing the challenges mentioned in the documentation?\n\nA) Tune the qubits to be exactly resonant with the microwave cavity to maximize coupling strength\nB) Operate the qubits at a charge noise sweet spot, sacrificing strong cavity coupling for reduced decoherence\nC) Utilize off-resonant red-sideband-mediated gates at operating points with strong charge dipole moments\nD) Increase the cavity's quality factor to compensate for weak qubit-cavity coupling at sweet spots\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a real-world quantum computing scenario. The correct answer, C, is the strategy that best addresses the challenges and leverages the unique properties of quantum-dot hybrid qubits described in the text.\n\nThe documentation mentions that typically, achieving strong coupling between qubits and the cavity requires either tuning to a sweet spot (to minimize charge noise) or making the qubit resonant with the cavity. However, these conditions rarely coincide, creating a challenge for implementing high-fidelity gates.\n\nThe key insight provided in the documentation is that quantum-dot hybrid qubits have two types of sweet spots that can occur at operating points with strong charge dipole moments. This unique property allows for strong interactions even in off-resonant conditions, which is crucial for long-distance two-qubit gates.\n\nSpecifically, the text states that \"off-resonant red-sideband-mediated two-qubit gates can exhibit fidelities >95% for realistic operating parameters.\" This approach directly addresses the goal of implementing high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates while overcoming the typical obstacles.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while resonant coupling maximizes interaction strength, it doesn't take advantage of the sweet spots that reduce charge noise sensitivity.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it prioritizes reduced decoherence at the expense of strong coupling, which is necessary for long-distance gates.\n\nOption D is incorrect because merely increasing the cavity's quality factor doesn't address the fundamental challenge of achieving both strong coupling and reduced noise sensitivity.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a practical scenario, and identify the most promising approach based on the unique properties of the quantum system described."}}
