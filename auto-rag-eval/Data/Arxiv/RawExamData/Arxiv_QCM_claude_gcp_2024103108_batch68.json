We study nonzero-sum stochastic switching games. Two players compete for market dominance through controlling (via timing options) the discrete-state market regime $M$.

We construct threshold-type Feedback Nash Equilibria which characterize stationary strategies describing long-run dynamic equilibrium market organization. Two sequential approximation schemes link the switching equilibrium to (i) constrained optimal switching, (ii) multi-stage timing games.

Similar to other IR tasks, the output of a vertex nomination scheme is a ranked list of the vertices in the second graph, with the heretofore unknown vertices of interest ideally concentrating at the top of the list. Vertex nomination schemes provide a useful suite of tools for efficiently mining complex networks for pertinent information. In this paper, we explore, both theoretically and practically, the dual roles of content (i.e., edge and vertex attributes) and context (i.e., network topology) in vertex nomination. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which vertex nomination schemes that leverage both content and context outperform schemes that leverage only content or context separately.

This time scale is extracted from the space-time measurement of the deformation of the plate by studying the temporal dynamics of wavelet coefficients of the turbulent field. The central hypothesis of the theory is the time scale separation between dissipative time scale, nonlinear time scale and the period of the wave ($T_d>>T_{NL}>>T$). We observe that this scale separation is valid in our system. The discrete modes due to the finite size effects are responsible for the disagreement between observations and theory.

Cells process external and internal signals through chemical interactions. Cells that constitute the immune system (e.g., antigen presenting cell, T-cell, B-cell, mast cell) can have different functions (e.g., adaptive memory, inflammatory response) depending on the type and number of receptor molecules on the cell surface and the specific intracellular signaling pathways activated by those receptors. Explicitly modeling and simulating kinetic interactions between molecules allows us to pose questions about the dynamics of a signaling network under various conditions. However, the application of chemical kinetics to biochemical signaling systems has been limited by the complexity of the systems under consideration. Rule-based modeling (BioNetGen, Kappa, Simmune, PySB) is an approach to address this complexity.
