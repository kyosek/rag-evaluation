While physical activity has been described as a primary prevention against chronic diseases, strenuous physical exertion under adverse ambient conditions has also been reported as a major contributor to exacerbation of chronic respiratory conditions.

This paper explores the potentiality of motion sensors in Smartphones to estimate physical activity thresholds that could trigger symptoms of exercise induced respiratory conditions (EiRCs). The focus is on the extraction of measurements from the embedded motion sensors to determine the activity level and the type of activity that is tolerable to individuals respiratory health. The calculations are based on the correlation between Signal Magnitude Area (SMA) and Energy Expenditure (EE). We also consider the effect of changes in the ambient conditions like temperature and humidity, as contributing factors to respiratory distress during physical exercise.

The action presents quadratic and quartic terms in derivatives of the Skyrme fields, but instead of the group indices being contracted by the SU(2) Killing form, they are contracted with the h-matrix in the quadratic term, and by its inverse on the quartic term.

Termite colonies construct towering, complex mounds, in a classic example of distributed agents coordinating their activity via interaction with a shared environment. The traditional explanation for how this coordination occurs focuses on the idea of a \"cement pheromone\", a chemical signal left with deposited soil that triggers further deposition. Recent research has called this idea into question, pointing to a more complicated behavioral response to cues perceived with multiple senses. In this work, we explored the role of topological cues in affecting early construction activity in Macrotermes. We created artificial surfaces with a known range of curvatures, coated them with nest soil, placed groups of major workers on them, and evaluated soil displacement as a function of location at the end of one hour. Each point on the surface has a given curvature, inclination, and absolute height; to disambiguate these factors, we conducted experiments with the surface in different orientations. Soil displacement activity is consistently correlated with surface curvature, and not with inclination nor height. Early exploration activity is also correlated with curvature, to a lesser degree.

Whenever customers' choices (e.g. to buy or not a given good) depend on others choices (cases coined 'positive externalities' or 'bandwagon effect' in the economic literature), the demand may be multiply valued: for a same posted price, there is either a small number of buyers, or a large one -- in which case one says that the customers coordinate. This leads to a dilemma for the seller: should he sell at a high price, targeting a small number of buyers, or at low price targeting a large number of buyers? In this paper we show that the interaction between demand and supply is even more complex than expected, leading to what we call the curse of coordination: the pricing strategy for the seller which aimed at maximizing his profit corresponds to posting a price which, not only assumes that the customers will coordinate, but also lies very near the critical price value at which such high demand no more exists. This is obtained by the detailed mathematical analysis of a particular model formally related to the Random Field Ising Model and to a model introduced in social sciences by T C Schelling in the 70's."}, "answer": "Question: A company is selling a product with strong bandwagon effects. They've determined that at a price of $100, they could sell either 1,000 units (low coordination) or 10,000 units (high coordination). At $90, they're confident of selling 12,000 units. Which pricing strategy maximizes expected profit, and what challenge does this present?\n\nA) Set the price at $100, as the potential profit from high coordination ($1,000,000) exceeds the certain profit at $90 ($1,080,000).\n\nB) Set the price at $90 to guarantee a large profit without relying on uncertain customer coordination.\n\nC) Set the price at $99, aiming for high coordination while maximizing per-unit profit.\n\nD) Alternate between $100 and $90 pricing to capture both coordination states over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This question tests understanding of the \"curse of coordination\" described in the paper. The optimal strategy for the seller is to price very close to the critical point where high coordination (high demand) can occur, but not below it. By pricing at $99, the company aims for the high coordination outcome (10,000 units) while maximizing per-unit profit. This strategy yields a potential profit of $990,000, higher than the guaranteed $1,080,000 at $90.\n\nHowever, this strategy is risky and illustrates the \"curse of coordination.\" By pricing so close to the critical point, there's a significant risk that high coordination might fail, resulting in only 1,000 units sold and a much lower profit of $99,000. This dilemma highlights the complex interaction between supply and demand in markets with bandwagon goods.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't maximize potential profit. Option B is too conservative and misses the potential upside of coordination. Option D misunderstands the nature of coordination in these markets."}, "33": {"documentation": {"title": "Policy Transforms and Learning Optimal Policies", "source": "Thomas M.

Time-reversal (TR) refocusing of waves is one of fundamental principles in wave physics. Using the TR approach, \"Time-reversal mirrors\" can physically create a time-reversed wave that exactly refocus back, in space and time, to its original source regardless of the complexity of the medium as if time were going backwards. Lately, laboratory experiments proved that this approach can be applied not only in acoustics and electromagnetism but also in the field of linear and nonlinear water waves. Studying the range of validity and limitations of the TR approach may determine and quantify its range of applicability in hydrodynamics. In this context, we report a numerical study of hydrodynamic TR using a uni-directional numerical wave tank, implemented by the nonlinear high-order spectral method, known to accurately model the physical processes at play, beyond physical laboratory restrictions. The applicability of the TR approach is assessed over a variety of hydrodynamic localized and pulsating structures' configurations, pointing out the importance of high-order dispersive and particularly nonlinear effects in the refocusing of hydrodynamic stationary envelope solitons and breathers.

Furthermore, in a realistic setting, the variables of interest or their errors may have non-normal distributions which complicates the modeling.
