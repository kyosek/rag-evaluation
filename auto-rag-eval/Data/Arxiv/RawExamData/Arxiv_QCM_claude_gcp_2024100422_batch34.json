An uncollateralized swap hedged back-to-back by a CCP swap is used to introduce FVA.

By dynamically trading the CCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure hedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully replicated, leaving out no IR01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a liability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate.

In order to calculate the response functions including the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations, we map the Bose-Hubbard model onto an effective pseudospin-one model and use a perturbative expansion based on the imaginary-time Green's function theory.

Recent results from animal irradiation studies have rekindled interest in the potential of ultra-high dose rate irradiation (also known as FLASH) for reducing normal tissue toxicity. However, despite mounting evidence of a \"FLASH effect\", a mechanism has yet to be elucidated. This article hypothesizes that the radioprotecting effect of FLASH irradiation could be due to the specific sparing of hypoxic stem cell niches, which have been identified in several organs including the bone marrow and the brain. To explore this hypothesis, a new computational model is presented that frames transient radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) during FLASH irradiation in terms of its effect on the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). The model takes into consideration oxygen diffusion through the tissue, its consumption by metabolic cells, and its radiolytic depletion to estimate the relative decrease in radiosensitivity of cells receiving FLASH irradiation. Based on this model, several predictions are made that could be tested in future experiments: (1) the FLASH effect should gradually disappear as the radiation pulse duration is increased from <1s to 10 s; (2) dose should be deposited using the smallest number of radiation pulses to achieve the greatest FLASH effect; (3) a FLASH effect should only be observed in cells that are already hypoxic at the time of irradiation; and (4) changes in capillary oxygen tension (increase or decrease) should diminish the FLASH effect."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the computational model of radiolytic oxygen depletion during FLASH irradiation, which of the following combinations of factors would likely produce the strongest FLASH effect in terms of normal tissue protection?\n\nA) Multiple short radiation pulses, increased capillary oxygen tension, and irradiation of well-oxygenated cells\nB) A single long radiation pulse lasting 10 seconds, normal capillary oxygen tension, and irradiation of hypoxic cells\nC) A single short radiation pulse lasting <1 second, normal capillary oxygen tension, and irradiation of hypoxic cells\nD) Multiple long radiation pulses, decreased capillary oxygen tension, and irradiation of both hypoxic and well-oxygenated cells\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it aligns with several key predictions made by the model:\n\n1.

Born in rapidly evolving mini-halos during the first billion years of the Universe, super- massive black holes (SMBH) feed from gas flows spanning many orders of magnitude, from the cosmic web in which they are embedded to their event horizon. As such, accretion onto SMBHs constitutes a formidable challenge to tackle numerically, and currently requires the use of sub-grid models to handle the flow on small, unresolved scales. In this paper, we study the impact of resolution on the accretion pattern of SMBHs initially inserted at the heart of dense galactic gas clouds, using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the black hole (BH) gravitational zone of influence. We find that once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved, accretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently of the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early stages of cloud collapse. For a pristine gas mix of hydrogen and helium, a slim disc develops around the BH on sub-parsec scales, turning the otherwise chaotic BH accretion duty cycle into an episodic one, with potentially important consequences for BH feedback.

With the imminent slowing down of DRAM scaling, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth, and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.

This paper studies cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks where secondary users collect local energy statistics and report their findings to a secondary base station, i.e., a fusion center. First, the average error probability is quantitively analyzed to capture the dynamic nature of both observation and fusion channels, assuming fixed amplifier gains for relaying local statistics to the fusion center. Second, the system level overhead of cooperative spectrum sensing is addressed by considering both the local processing cost and the transmission cost. Local processing cost incorporates the overhead of sample collection and energy calculation that must be conducted by each secondary user; the transmission cost accounts for the overhead of forwarding the energy statistic computed at each secondary user to the fusion center. Results show that when jointly designing the number of collected energy samples and transmission amplifier gains, only one secondary user needs to be actively engaged in spectrum sensing.
