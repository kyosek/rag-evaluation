Hydraulic accumulators play a central role as energy storage in nearly all fluid power systems. The accumulators serve as pulsation dampers or energy storage devices in hydro-pneumatic suspensions. The energy carrying gas is compressed and decompressed, often periodically. Heat transfer to the outside significantly determines the transfer behaviour of the accumulator since heat transfer changes the thermodynamic state of the enclosed gas. The accumulators operating mode ranges from isothermal to adiabatic. Simulating fluid power systems adequately requires knowledge of the transfer behaviour of the accumulators and therefore of the heat transfer. The Engineer's approach to model heat transfer in technical system is Newton's law. However, research shows, that in harmonically oscillating gas volumes, heat flux and bulk temperature difference change their phase. Newton's law is incapable of representing this physical phenomenon. We performed measurements on two sizes of commercial membrane accumulators. Experimental data confirm the failure of Newton's approach. Instead the heat transfer can be modelled with an additional rate dependent term and independently of the accumulator's size.
