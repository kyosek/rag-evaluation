Prior works on IRS have mostly assumed the availability of channel state information (CSI) for designing its passive beamforming. However, the acquisition of CSI requires substantial training overhead that increases with $N$. In contrast, we propose in this letter a novel \\emph{random passive beamforming} scheme, where the IRS performs independent random reflection for $Q\\geq 1$ times in each channel coherence interval without the need of CSI acquisition. For the proposed scheme, we first derive a closed-form approximation of the outage probability, based on which the optimal $Q$ with best outage performance can be efficiently obtained.

In such cases, the designer is forced to decide on heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not comparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a Bayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable controllers prior to data collection: Nothing, except that it should be a somewhat large number.

The prediction of critical transitions, such as extinction events, is vitally important to preserving vulnerable populations in the face of a rapidly changing climate and continuously increasing human resource usage. Predicting such events in spatially distributed populations is challenging because of the high dimensionality of the system and the complexity of the system dynamics. Here, we reduce the dimensionality of the problem by quantifying spatial patterns via Betti numbers ($\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$), which count particular topological features in a topological space. Spatial patterns representing regions occupied by the population are analyzed in a coupled patch population model with Ricker map growth and nearest-neighbors dispersal on a two-dimensional lattice. We illustrate how Betti numbers can be used to characterize spatial patterns by type, which in turn may be used to track spatiotemporal changes via Betti number time series and characterize asymptotic dynamics of the model parameter space. En route to a global extinction event, we find that the Betti number time series of a population exhibits characteristic changes. We hope these preliminary results will be used to aide in the prediction of critical transitions in spatially extended systems.
