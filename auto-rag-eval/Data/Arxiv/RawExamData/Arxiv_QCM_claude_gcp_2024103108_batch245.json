In this essay, I argue that mathematics is a natural science---just like physics, chemistry, or biology---and that this can explain the alleged \"unreasonable\" effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences. The main challenge for this view is to explain how mathematical theories can become increasingly abstract and develop their own internal structure, whilst still maintaining an appropriate empirical tether that can explain their later use in physics. In order to address this, I offer a theory of mathematical theory-building based on the idea that human knowledge has the structure of a scale-free network and that abstract mathematical theories arise from a repeated process of replacing strong analogies with new hubs in this network. This allows mathematics to be seen as the study of regularities, within regularities, within ..., within regularities of the natural world. Since mathematical theories are derived from the natural world, albeit at a much higher level of abstraction than most other scientific theories, it should come as no surprise that they so often show up in physics. This version of the essay contains an addendum responding to Slyvia Wenmackers' essay and comments that were made on the FQXi website."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the essay, how does mathematics maintain its empirical tether to physics while becoming increasingly abstract?\n\nA) Through a process of random theory generation and selection based on physical applicability\nB) By developing theories based on a scale-free network structure of human knowledge, where abstract theories arise from replacing strong analogies with new hubs\nC) Through direct experimental validation of each new mathematical concept in physics laboratories\nD) By restricting mathematical advancements to only those concepts with immediate applications in physics\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The essay proposes that mathematics maintains its connection to the physical world while becoming more abstract through a theory-building process based on the structure of human knowledge as a scale-free network. Abstract mathematical theories are said to arise from \"a repeated process of replacing strong analogies with new hubs in this network.\" This allows mathematics to study \"regularities, within regularities, within ..., within regularities of the natural world,\" thus maintaining an empirical tether to physics while developing increasingly abstract concepts.

We consider a simple model for the diffusion of heavy quarks in a hot bath, modeling the latter by an ensemble of oscillators distributed accorded to either a thermal distribution or to an out-of-equilibrium distribution with a saturation scale. Within this model it is easy to introduce memory effects by changing the distribution of oscillators: we model these by introducing a gaussian distribution, $dN/d\\omega$, which can be deformed continuously from a $\\delta-$function giving a Markov dissipation to a broad kernel with memory. Deriving the equation of motion of the heavy quark in the bath we remark how dissipation comes out naturally as an effect of the back-reaction on the bath of oscillators. Moreover, the exact solution of this equation allows for the definition of a thermalization time as the time necessary to remove any memory of the initial condition. We find that the broadening the dissipative kernel while keeping the coupling fixed lowers the thermalization time. We also derive the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the bath, and use this to estimate the kinematic regime in which momentum diffusion of the heavy quark dominates over drift: we find that diffusion is more important as long as $K_0/{\\cal E}$ is small, where $K_0$ and ${\\cal E}$ denote the initial energy of the heavy quark and the average energy of the bath respectively."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A classical model for heavy quark diffusion in a hot medium introduces memory effects by modifying the distribution of oscillators in the bath.

Unfortunately, most estimators are not scalable enough to handle the sizes of modern high-dimensional data sets (often on the order of terabytes), and assume Gaussian samples. To address these deficiencies, we introduce HP-CONCORD, a highly scalable optimization method for estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix based on a regularized pseudolikelihood framework, without assuming Gaussianity.

Today's supercapacitor energy storages are typically discrete devices aimed for printed boards and power applications.

Nanostructures based on porous silicon (PS) provide a route towards integration due to the very high inherent surface area to volume ratio and compatibility with microelectronics fabrication processes. Unfortunately, pristine PS has limited wettability and poor chemical stability in electrolytes and the high resistance of the PS matrix severely limits the power efficiency.

Finite energy density states are constrained states of these DOF and the resulting relation between asymptotic energy and the number of constraints, explains the relation between black hole entropy and energy, as well as the critical energy/impact parameter regime in which particle scattering leads to black hole formation. The results of a general class of models, implementing these principles, are described, and applied to understand the firewall paradox, and to construct a finite model of the early universe, which implements inflation with only the minimal fine tuning needed to obtain a universe containing localized excitations more complex than large black holes."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Holographic Space-time (HST) models of quantum gravity, what is the key feature of the degrees of freedom (DOF) localized in a finite causal diamond, and how does this relate to black hole entropy?\n\nA) They are independent of asymptotic currents and have no relation to black hole entropy.\n\nB) They are restrictions of an algebra of asymptotic currents describing flows to null infinity, and the constraints on finite energy density states explain the relation between black hole entropy and energy.\n\nC) They are fundamental particles that directly correspond to black hole microstates, with no relation to asymptotic currents.\n\nD) They are emergent properties of spacetime foam, indirectly related to black hole entropy through quantum tunneling effects.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Understanding how chemical anisotropy (or patchiness) of the protein surface due to the variety of amino acid side chains in contact with solvent, contributes to protein protein contact formation in the crystal lattice is a major obstacle to predicting and optimising crystallization.

This term is proportional to \u03c3_R (not \u03c3_C) multiplied by \u03c3_* and the square root of log(p1 \u2227 p2).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the upper bound includes \u03c3_C \u03c3_R, not \u03c3_C^2 + \u03c3_R^2.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the upper bound does include terms with \u03c3_*^2, specifically C \u03c3_*^2 log(p1 \u2227 p2).\n\nOption D is incorrect because the term involving \u221alog(p1 \u2227 p2) is multiplied by \u03c3_R \u03c3_*, not just \u03c3_*.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex upper bound formula and the ability to correctly identify its components."}, "53": {"documentation": {"title": "Expected Values for Variable Network Games", "source": "Subhadip Chakrabarti, Loyimee Gogoi, Robert P Gilles, Surajit\n  Borkotokey, Rajnish Kumar", "docs_id": "2108.07047", "section": ["cs.GT", "econ.TH", "physics.soc-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Expected Values for Variable Network Games.
