The transport sector is witnessing unprecedented levels of disruption. Privately owned cars that operate on internal combustion engines have been the dominant modes of passenger transport for much of the last century. However, recent advances in transport technologies and services, such as the development of autonomous vehicles, the emergence of shared mobility services, and the commercialization of alternative fuel vehicle technologies, promise to revolutionise how humans travel. The implications are profound: some have predicted the end of private car dependent Western societies, others have portended greater suburbanization than has ever been observed before. If transport systems are to fulfil current and future needs of different subpopulations, and satisfy short and long-term societal objectives, it is imperative that we comprehend the many factors that shape individual behaviour. This chapter introduces the technologies and services most likely to disrupt prevailing practices in the transport sector. We review past studies that have examined current and future demand for these new technologies and services, and their likely short and long-term impacts on extant mobility patterns. We conclude with a summary of what these new technologies and services might mean for the future of mobility."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the complex relationship between new transport technologies and future mobility patterns, as suggested by the passage?\n\nA) New transport technologies will inevitably lead to the end of private car ownership in Western societies.\n\nB) The impact of new transport technologies on mobility patterns is straightforward and predictable.\n\nC) Autonomous vehicles and shared mobility services will definitely result in greater suburbanization.\n\nD) The effects of new transport technologies on future mobility are uncertain and potentially contradictory, requiring careful study of individual behavior and societal objectives.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The passage presents a nuanced view of the potential impacts of new transport technologies.

Caching at base stations (BSs) is a promising approach for supporting the tremendous traffic growth of content delivery over future small-cell wireless networks with limited backhaul. This paper considers exploiting spatial caching diversity (i.e., caching different subsets of popular content files at neighboring BSs) that can greatly improve the cache hit probability, thereby leading to a better overall system performance. A key issue in exploiting spatial caching diversity is that the cached content may not be located at the nearest BS, which means that to access such content, a user needs to overcome strong interference from the nearby BSs; this significantly limits the gain of spatial caching diversity.

We present large scale computer simulations of the nonlinear bulk rheology of lamellar phases (smectic liquid crystals) at moderate to large values of the shear rate (Peclet numbers 10-100), in both two and three dimensions. In two dimensions we find that modest shear rates align the system and stabilise an almost regular lamellar phase, but high shear rates induce the nucleation and proliferation of defects, which in steady state is balanced by the annihilation of defects of opposite sign. The critical shear rate at onset of this second regime is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; we offer a scaling analysis that relates the critical shear rate to a critical \"capillary number\" involving those variables. Within the defect proliferation regime, the defects may be partially annealed by slowly decreasing the applied shear rate; this causes marked memory effects, and history-dependent rheology. Simulations in three dimensions show instead shear-induced ordering even at the highest shear rates studied here. This suggests that the critical shear rate shifts markedly upward on increasing dimensionality. This may in part reflect the reduced constraints on defect motion, allowing them to find and annihilate each other more easily. Residual edge defects in the 3D aligned state mostly point along the flow velocity, an orientation impossible in two dimensions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a study of the rheology of lamellar liquid crystals, researchers observed different behaviors in 2D and 3D simulations at high shear rates. Which of the following statements accurately describes the key difference between the 2D and 3D results, and provides a plausible explanation for this difference?\n\nA) 2D simulations showed defect proliferation, while 3D simulations exhibited shear-induced ordering. This is likely due to the increased degrees of freedom for defect motion in 3D.\n\nB) 3D simulations showed defect proliferation, while 2D simulations exhibited shear-induced ordering. This is because 3D structures are inherently less stable under shear.\n\nC) Both 2D and 3D simulations showed defect proliferation at high shear rates, but the critical shear rate was lower in 3D due to increased instability.\n\nD) 2D simulations showed shear-induced ordering, while 3D simulations exhibited defect proliferation. This is because defects are more easily trapped in 3D structures.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. The documentation states that in 2D simulations, high shear rates induced \"nucleation and proliferation of defects,\" while in 3D, simulations showed \"shear-induced ordering even at the highest shear rates studied.\" The explanation provided in the text suggests that this difference may be due to \"reduced constraints on defect motion\" in 3D, allowing defects to \"find and annihilate each other more easily.\" This aligns with the statement in option A about increased degrees of freedom for defect motion in 3D.\n\nOptions B and D are incorrect as they reverse the observed behaviors in 2D and 3D. Option C is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the different behaviors observed in 2D and 3D, and it mistakenly suggests that 3D structures have a lower critical shear rate, which is contrary to the documentation's suggestion that the critical shear rate \"shifts markedly upward on increasing dimensionality.\""}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Dust Formation In Early Galaxies", "source": "H L.

We investigate the sources and amount of dust in early galaxies.

The implications of chemical evolution models for high redshift galaxies are investigated and we show there is no difficulty in producing dusty galaxies at redshifts above 5 if supernovae are a dominant source of interstellar dust. If dust does not condense efficiently in SNe then significant dust masses can only be generated at by galaxies with a high star formation efficiency. We find the visual optical depth for individual star forming clouds can reach values greater than 1 at very low metallicity (1/100 solar) provided that the mass-radius exponent of molecular clouds is less than two. Most of the radiation from star formation will emerge at IR wavelengths in the early universe provided that dust is present.

The document states that the \"TPAGB phase of intermediate mass stars is likely to be the most promising site for dust formation in stellar winds.\"\n2. It also mentions that \"there is no difficulty in producing dusty galaxies at redshifts above 5 if supernovae are a dominant source of interstellar dust.\"\n3. The text implies that if dust doesn't form efficiently in supernovae, then \"significant dust masses can only be generated at by galaxies with a high star formation efficiency.\" However, since this answer includes supernovae as a major dust source, high star formation efficiency is not necessary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it emphasizes low-mass stars and minor supernova contribution, which contradicts the text's findings.

The recent popularity of post-denitrification processes in the greater Paris area wastewater treatment plants has caused a resurgence of the presence of nitrite in the Seine river. Controlling the production of nitrite during the post-denitrification has thus become a major technical issue. Research studies have been led in the MOCOPEE program (www.mocopee.com) to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind the production of nitrite during wastewater denitrification and to develop technical tools (measurement and control solutions) to assist on-site reductions of nitrite productions. Prior studies have shown that typical methanol dosage strategies produce a varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the reactor, which in turn leads to unstable nitrite concentrations in the effluent. The possibility of adding a model-free control to the actual classical dosage strategy has thus been tested on the SimBio model, which simulates the behavior of wastewater biofilters. The corresponding \"intelligent\" feedback loop, which is using effluent nitrite concentrations, compensates the classical strategy only when needed.
