In this article, we propose a novel ECG classification framework for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using spectro-temporal representation (i.e., time varying spectrum) and deep convolutional networks.

Next, we derive an alternative model based on a stochastic oscillator differential equation to accelerate the estimation of the spectro-temporal representation in lengthy signals. Finally, after comparative evaluations of different convolutional architectures, we propose an efficient deep convolutional neural network to classify the 2D spectro-temporal ECG data. The ECG spectro-temporal data are classified into four different classes: AF, non-AF normal rhythm (Normal), non-AF abnormal rhythm (Other), and noisy segments (Noisy).

A Section Pursuit Index for Finding Hidden Structure in\n  Multiple Dimensions. Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for problems when data distributions depart from uniform or normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by complex inequality conditions from multiple parameter model.

Important trait features, such as the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple Fourier interpretation. Roughness at a gene location corresponds to high sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces such sensitivity. Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated in identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait organizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data.

The expansion of inverter-connected generation facilities (i.e. wind and photovoltaics) and the removal of conventional power plants is necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Since the underlying power system and the control mechanisms that keep it close to a desired reference state, were not designed for such a low inertia system, this might make the system vulnerable to disturbances. In this paper, we will investigate whether the currently used control mechanisms are able to keep a low inertia system stable and how this is effected by the time delay between a frequency deviation and the onset of the control action. We integrate the control mechanisms used in continental Europe into a model of coupled oscillators which resembles the second order Kuramoto model. This model is then used to investigate how the interplay of changing inertia, network topology and delayed control effects the stability of the interconnected power system.
