Unlike other industries in which intellectual property is patentable, the financial industry relies on trade secrecy to protect its business processes and methods, which can obscure critical financial risk exposures from regulators and the public.

Our approach employs secure multi-party computation techniques from cryptography in which multiple parties are able to compute joint functions without revealing their individual inputs. In our framework, individual financial institutions evaluate a protocol on their proprietary data which cannot be inverted, leading to secure computations of real-valued statistics such a concentration indexes, pairwise correlations, and other single- and multi-point statistics. The proposed protocols are computationally tractable on realistic sample sizes.

This paper illustrates the intergenerational transmission of the gender gap in education among first and second-generation immigrants.

A one standard deviation increase of the ancestral country female-male difference in schooling is associated with 17.2% and 2.5% of a standard deviation increase in the gender gap among first and second generations, respectively. Since gender perspective in education uncovers a new channel for cultural transmission among families, we interpret the findings as evidence of cultural persistence among first generations and partial cultural assimilation of second generations. Moreover, Disaggregation into country-groups reveals different paths for this transmission: descendants of immigrants of lower-income countries show fewer attachments to the gender opinions of their home country.

Gene drives have the potential to rapidly replace a harmful wild-type allele with a gene drive allele engineered to have desired functionalities. However, an accidental or premature release of a gene drive construct to the natural environment could damage an ecosystem irreversibly. Thus, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal consequences of the super-Mendelian population genetics prior to potential applications. Here, we employ a reaction-diffusion model for sexually reproducing diploid organisms to study how a locally introduced gene drive allele spreads to replace the wild-type allele, even though it possesses a selective disadvantage $s>0$. Using methods developed by N. Barton and collaborators, we show that socially responsible gene drives require $0.5<s<0.697$, a rather narrow range. In this \"pushed wave\" regime, the spatial spreading of gene drives will be initiated only when the initial frequency distribution is above a threshold profile called \"critical propagule\", which acts as a safeguard against accidental release. We also study how the spatial spread of the pushed wave can be stopped by making gene drives uniquely vulnerable (\"sensitizing drive\") in a way that is harmless for a wild-type allele.

We study whether such measures improve consumer welfare in monopolistic and competitive markets. We find that consumer control can improve consumer welfare relative to both perfect price discrimination and no personalized pricing. First, consumers can use disclosure to amplify competitive forces. Second, consumers can disclose information to induce even a monopolist to lower prices. Whether consumer control improves welfare depends on the disclosure technology and market competitiveness. Simple disclosure technologies suffice in competitive markets.

What is the most likely explanation for this observation, and what should the astronomer do to obtain the most accurate metallicity estimate?\n\nA) The non-linearity is due to the cluster's age, and the astronomer should apply an age correction factor before estimating metallicity.\nB) The observed non-linearity is expected and the astronomer should focus on stars within a small magnitude interval to approximate a linear relationship.\nC) The non-linearity indicates that the Ca II triplet method is not applicable to this cluster, and the astronomer should use a different metallicity indicator.\nD) The astronomer should use the entire sequence of stars and apply a second-order polynomial fit to determine the metallicity accurately.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests the understanding of the Ca II triplet method's application in real-world scenarios and requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B because the documentation states: \"We report the first empirical study of the variation of the CaII triplet lines strength, for given metallicities, with respect to luminosity. We find that the sequence defined by each cluster in the Luminosity-$\\Sigma$Ca plane is not exactly linear. However, when only stars in a small magnitude interval are observed, the sequences can be considered as linear.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while age does have a weak influence on the relationship, it's not the primary factor causing the non-linearity observed, and applying an age correction factor is not mentioned as a solution in the documentation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Ca II triplet method is applicable across a wide range of ages (0.25 to 13 Gyr) and metallicities (-2.2 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 +0.47), so the observed non-linearity doesn't invalidate the method.\n\nOption D is plausible but incorrect. While the documentation mentions that a second-order term is needed for the Zinn & West (1984) metallicity scale, this applies to the relationship between reduced equivalent width and metallicity, not the luminosity-$\\Sigma$Ca relationship described in the question.\n\nThis question requires the application of knowledge from the documentation to a realistic scenario, testing the understanding of the method's limitations and best practices for its application."}, "38": {"documentation": {"title": "A Multi-criteria Approach to Evolve Sparse Neural Architectures for\n  Stock Market Forecasting", "source": "Faizal Hafiz, Jan Broekaert, Davide La Torre, Akshya Swain", "docs_id": "2111.08060", "section": ["cs.NE", "q-fin.ST"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "A Multi-criteria Approach to Evolve Sparse Neural Architectures for\n  Stock Market Forecasting.

More initial seed black holes would result in more mergers and, consequently, more binary systems.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because fewer galaxy mergers would reduce the number of MBH binary formations, leading to fewer detectable events.\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because less gas accretion would result in less massive black holes, potentially making their gravitational wave signals weaker and harder to detect.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because the documentation emphasizes that gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final coalescence.

The documentation states that \"for certain values of q and y, some quantitatively different but traditional up-crossing strategies are still optimal, while for other values we may have two disconnected continuation regions, resulting in the optimality of two-sided exit strategies.\"\n\nA low threshold level (y) means the underlying asset doesn't need to drop much to start the \"clock\" on the option expiration.

However, if the asset value rises too high, the holder might miss out on potential gains if they wait too long to exercise.

A researcher observes that one type of sideband is growing faster than the others but not as rapidly as the longitudinal sideband. What is the most likely explanation for this observation, and what implications does it have for the system's evolution?\n\nA) The observed sideband is transverse, indicating that the system will quickly develop into a turbulent state\nB) The sideband is oblique, suggesting it's an important decay channel that will contribute to vortex merging\nC) It's a longitudinal sideband with dampened growth, implying that particle trapping is less significant than expected\nD) The sideband is a hybrid type not mentioned in the documentation, hinting at a novel physical phenomenon\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires analysis of the growth rates of different sideband types and their implications for system evolution. The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"oblique sidebands are important decay channels of Langmuir waves, and the growth rate of oblique sideband is smaller than the longitudinal sideband but higher than the transverse sideband.\" This matches the description in the question of a sideband growing faster than others but not as rapidly as the longitudinal sideband.\n\nThe implication for system evolution is also correct, as the documentation mentions that when sideband amplitudes become comparable to the Langmuir wave, \"vortex merging occurs following the broadening of longitudinal and transverse wavenumbers, and finally the system is developed into a turbulent state.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because transverse sidebands have the slowest growth rate according to the documentation.

The correct answer, D, reflects the key findings of the model:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"The global evolution ends in a stable distribution of the social agents over a quasi-stable and fluctuating stationary number of remaining parties.\" This directly supports option D.\n\n2.

The performance of the max-margin classifier has been recently analyzed. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we present and study a more general setting, where the underlying parameters of the logistic model possess certain structures (sparse, block-sparse, low-rank, etc.) and introduce a more general framework (which is referred to as \"Generalized Margin Maximizer\", GMM).

In this case, scenario A is the most appropriate choice for using GMM.\n\nThe documentation states that GMM can handle cases where \"the underlying parameters of the logistic model possess certain structures (sparse, block-sparse, low-rank, etc.)\".

The $\\ell_1$ norm is known for its ability to induce sparsity in the solution, making it particularly suitable for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets where only a few features are relevant.\n\nOption B is incorrect because GMM is primarily designed for linearly separable data, as indicated by the title mentioning \"Separable Data\".

First, increasing an arbitrary entry of a pairwise comparison matrix is not allowed to result in a counter-intuitive rank reversal, that is, the favoured alternative in the corresponding row cannot be ranked lower than any other alternative if this was not the case before the change (rank monotonicity). Second, the same modification should not decrease the normalised weight of the favoured alternative (weight monotonicity).

The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that the eigenvector method violates both rank monotonicity and weight monotonicity axioms. \n\nIncreasing an entry in the pairwise comparison matrix could lead to a rank reversal, where the favored alternative ends up ranked lower than it was before the change. This outcome is counter-intuitive and violates the rank monotonicity axiom.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation indicates that changes can indeed affect the ranking.
