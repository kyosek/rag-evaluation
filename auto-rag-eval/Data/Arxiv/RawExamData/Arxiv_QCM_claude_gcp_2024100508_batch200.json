Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an important data assimilation method for high dimensional geophysical systems. Efficient implementation of EnKF in practice often involves the localization technique, which updates each component using only information within a local radius. This paper rigorously analyzes the local EnKF (LEnKF) for linear systems, and shows that the filter error can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, as long as 1) the sample size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends only on the local radius; 2) the forecast covariance matrix admits a stable localized structure. In particular, this indicates that with small system and observation noises, the filter error will be accurate in long time even if the initialization is not. The analysis also reveals an intrinsic inconsistency caused by the localization technique, and a stable localized structure is necessary to control this inconsistency. While this structure is usually taken for granted for the operation of LEnKF, it can also be rigorously proved for linear systems with sparse local observations and weak local interactions. These theoretical results are also validated by numerical implementation of LEnKF on a simple stochastic turbulence in two dynamical regimes."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the conditions under which the local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) error can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, according to the analysis presented in the paper?\n\nA) The sample size must be larger than the state dimension, and the forecast covariance matrix must be diagonal.\n\nB) The sample size must exceed the logarithm of the state dimension plus a constant dependent on the local radius, and the forecast covariance matrix must admit a stable localized structure.\n\nC) The system and observation noises must be large, and the initialization must be accurate.\n\nD) The sample size must be equal to the state dimension, and the forecast covariance matrix must be invertible.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with probabilistic dynamical models are amongst the most data-efficient learning methods. This is often attributed to their ability to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. However, while most algorithms distinguish these two uncertainties for learning the model, they ignore it when optimizing the policy, which leads to greedy and insufficient exploration. At the same time, there are no practical solvers for optimistic exploration algorithms. In this paper, we propose a practical optimistic exploration algorithm (H-UCRL). H-UCRL reparameterizes the set of plausible models and hallucinates control directly on the epistemic uncertainty. By augmenting the input space with the hallucinated inputs, H-UCRL can be solved using standard greedy planners. Furthermore, we analyze H-UCRL and construct a general regret bound for well-calibrated models, which is provably sublinear in the case of Gaussian Process models.

Vine copulas are pair-copula constructions enabling multivariate dependence modeling in terms of bivariate building blocks. One of the main tasks of fitting a vine copula is the selection of a suitable tree structure. For this the prevalent method is a heuristic called Di{\\ss}mann's algorithm. It sequentially constructs the vine's trees by maximizing dependence at each tree level, where dependence is measured in terms of absolute Kendall's $\\tau$. However, the algorithm disregards any implications of the tree structure on the simplifying assumption that is usually made for vine copulas to keep inference tractable. We develop two new algorithms that select tree structures focused on producing simplified vine copulas for which the simplifying assumption is violated as little as possible. For this we make use of a recently developed statistical test of the simplifying assumption. In a simulation study we show that our proposed methods outperform the benchmark given by Di{\\ss}mann's algorithm by a great margin. Several real data applications emphasize their practical relevance."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is developing a new algorithm for selecting tree structures in vine copulas.

However, the approach in Kleinegesse et al., 2020 requires a pathwise sampling path to compute the gradient of the MI lower bound with respect to the design variables, and such a pathwise sampling path is usually inaccessible for implicit models.

Numerous solar system atmospheres possess aerosols including the characteristic organic hazes of Titan and Pluto. Haze particles substantially impact atmospheric temperatures structures and may provide organic material to the surface of a world, thereby affecting its habitability. Observations of exoplanet atmospheres suggest the presence of aerosols, especially in cooler (<800 K), smaller (<0.3 times Jupiter's mass) exoplanets. It remains unclear if the aerosols muting the spectroscopic features of exoplanet atmospheres are condensate clouds or photochemical hazes, which is difficult to predict from theory alone. We present here the first laboratory haze simulation experiments for atmospheric compositions expected for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We explored temperatures from 300 to 600 K and a range of atmospheric metallicities (100x, 1000x, 10000x solar); all simulated atmospheres produced particles, and the cooler (300 and 400 K) 1000x solar metallicity (\"H2O-dominated\", CH4-rich) experiments exhibited haze production rates higher than our standard Titan simulation (~10 mg/hr versus 7.4 mg/hr for Titan). However the particle production rates varied greatly, with measured rates as low as 0.04 mg/hr (100x solar metallicity, 600 K).

The Maunder Minimum was the period between 1645 and 1715 whose main characteristic was abnormally low and prolonged solar activity. However, some authors have doubted this low level of solar activity during that period by questioning the accuracy and objectivity of the observers. This work presents a particular case of a sunspot observed during the Maunder Minimum with an unusual shape of its umbra and penumbra: a hexagon. This sunspot was observed by Cassini in November 1676, just at the core of the Maunder Minimum. This historical observation is compared with a twin case that occurred recently in May 2016. The conclusion reached is that Cassini's record is another example of the good quality observations made during the Maunder Minimum, showing the meticulousness of the astronomers of that epoch. This sunspot observation made by Cassini does not support the conclusions of Zolotova and Ponyavin (Astrophys. J. 800, 42, 2015) that professional astronomers in the 17th century only registered round sunspots.
