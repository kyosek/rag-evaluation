For the two versions of the KdV equation on the positive half-line an initial-boundary value problem is well posed if one prescribes an initial condition plus either one boundary condition if $q_{t}$ and $q_{xxx}$ have the same sign (KdVI) or two boundary conditions if $q_{t}$ and $q_{xxx}$ have opposite sign (KdVII). Constructing the generalized Dirichlet to Neumann map for the above problems means characterizing the unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial and boundary conditions. For example, if $\\{q(x,0),q(0,t) \\}$ and $\\{q(x,0),q(0,t),q_{x}(0,t) \\}$ are given for the KdVI and KdVII equations, respectively, then one must construct the unknown boundary values $\\{q_{x}(0,t),q_{xx}(0,t) \\}$ and $\\{q_{xx}(0,t) \\}$, respectively. We show that this can be achieved without solving for $q(x,t)$ by analysing a certain ``global relation'' which couples the given initial and boundary conditions with the unknown boundary values, as well as with the function $\\Phi^{(t)}(t,k)$, where $\\Phi^{(t)}$ satisifies the $t$-part of the associated Lax pair evaluated at $x=0$. Indeed, by employing a Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko triangular representation for $\\Phi^{(t)}$, the global relation can be solved \\emph{explicitly} for the unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial and boundary conditions and the function $\\Phi^{(t)}$.

Often in macroeconomics, however, many candidate explanatory variables are available and the number of possible models becomes too large for DMA to be applied in its original form.

The spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in a wide energy range can usually be well described by the Band function, which is a two smoothly jointed power laws cutting at a breaking energy. Below the breaking energy, the Band function reduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple power law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working energy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can be fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy band of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well even using a simple power law.

Social scientists have long appreciated that relationships between individuals cannot be described from observing a single domain, and that the structure across domains of interaction can have important effects on outcomes of interest (e.g., cooperation).1 One debate explicitly about this surrounds food sharing. Some argue that failing to find reciprocal food sharing means that some process other than reciprocity must be occurring, whereas others argue for models that allow reciprocity to span domains in the form of trade.2 Multilayer networks, high-dimensional networks that allow us to consider multiple sets of relationships at the same time, are ubiquitous and have consequences, so processes giving rise to them are important social phenomena. The analysis of multi-dimensional social networks has recently garnered the attention of the network science community.3 Recent models of these processes show how ignoring layer interdependencies can lead one to miss why a layer formed the way it did, and/or draw erroneous conclusions.6 Understanding the structuring processes that underlie multiplex networks will help understand increasingly rich datasets, giving more accurate and complete pictures of social interactions."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the importance of understanding multiplex social network structuring processes in relation to human behavior and social interactions?\n\nA) It allows researchers to focus exclusively on single-domain relationships, simplifying social network analysis.\n\nB) It helps in developing models that only consider reciprocity within a single domain of interaction.\n\nC) It enables a more comprehensive understanding of complex social interactions across multiple domains, potentially revealing interconnected patterns that might be missed in single-layer analyses.\n\nD) It proves that food sharing is always reciprocal across all cultures and societies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the passage emphasizes the importance of understanding multiplex social networks to gain a more accurate and complete picture of social interactions. The text states that \"relationships between individuals cannot be described from observing a single domain\" and that \"multilayer networks...are ubiquitous and have consequences.\" It also mentions that ignoring layer interdependencies can lead to missing why a layer formed or drawing erroneous conclusions. This supports the idea that understanding multiplex networks enables a more comprehensive view of complex social interactions across multiple domains.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage argues against focusing on single-domain relationships, stating that this approach is insufficient.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the text actually discusses the debate about reciprocity spanning across domains, not limiting it to a single domain.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage presents food sharing as a debated topic, with some arguing for models that allow reciprocity to span domains, but it doesn't claim that food sharing is always reciprocal across all cultures."}, "54": {"documentation": {"title": "Wavefield reconstruction inversion via physics-informed neural networks", "source": "Chao Song and Tariq Alkhalifah", "docs_id": "2104.06897", "section": ["physics.geo-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Wavefield reconstruction inversion via physics-informed neural networks. Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) formulates a PDE-constrained optimization problem to reduce cycle skipping in full-waveform inversion (FWI).

The self-driving based on deep reinforcement learning, as the most important application of artificial intelligence, has become a popular topic. Most of the current self-driving methods focus on how to directly learn end-to-end self-driving control strategy from the raw sensory data. Essentially, this control strategy can be considered as a mapping between images and driving behavior, which usually faces a problem of low generalization ability. To improve the generalization ability for the driving behavior, the reinforcement learning method requires extrinsic reward from the real environment, which may damage the car. In order to obtain a good generalization ability in safety, a virtual simulation environment that can be constructed different driving scene is designed by Unity. A theoretical model is established and analyzed in the virtual simulation environment, and it is trained by double Deep Q-network. Then, the trained model is migrated to a scale car in real world. This process is also called a sim2real method. The sim2real training method efficiently handle the these two problems.
