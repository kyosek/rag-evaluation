Hydraulic accumulators play a central role as energy storage in nearly all fluid power systems. The accumulators serve as pulsation dampers or energy storage devices in hydro-pneumatic suspensions. The energy carrying gas is compressed and decompressed, often periodically. Heat transfer to the outside significantly determines the transfer behaviour of the accumulator since heat transfer changes the thermodynamic state of the enclosed gas. The accumulators operating mode ranges from isothermal to adiabatic. Simulating fluid power systems adequately requires knowledge of the transfer behaviour of the accumulators and therefore of the heat transfer. The Engineer's approach to model heat transfer in technical system is Newton's law. However, research shows, that in harmonically oscillating gas volumes, heat flux and bulk temperature difference change their phase. Newton's law is incapable of representing this physical phenomenon. We performed measurements on two sizes of commercial membrane accumulators. Experimental data confirm the failure of Newton's approach. Instead the heat transfer can be modelled with an additional rate dependent term and independently of the accumulator's size.

II: Chiral condensate\n  and collective meson excitations. We develop a quantum kinetic theory of the chiral condensate and meson quasi-particle excitations using the O(N) linear sigma model which describe the chiral phase transition both in and out of equilibrium in a unified way. A mean field approximation is formulated in the presence of mesonic quasi-particle excitations which are described by generalized Wigner functions. It is shown that in equilibrium our kinetic equations reduce to the gap equations which determine the equilibrium condensate amplitude and the effective masses of the quasi-particle excitations, while linearization of transport equations, near such equilibrium, determine the dispersion relations of the collective mesonic excitations at finite temperatures. Although all mass parameters for the meson excitations become at finite temperature, apparently violating the Goldstone theorem, the missing Nambu-Goldstone modes are retrieved in the collective excitations of the system as three degenerate phonon-like modes in the symmetry-broken phase. We show that the temperature dependence of the pole masses of the collective pion excitations has non-analytic kink behavior at the threshold of the quasi-particle excitations in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking interaction."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the O(N) linear sigma model describing the chiral phase transition, what is the relationship between the Nambu-Goldstone modes and the collective mesonic excitations at finite temperatures in the symmetry-broken phase?\n\nA) The Nambu-Goldstone modes disappear completely at finite temperatures, violating the Goldstone theorem.\n\nB) The Nambu-Goldstone modes manifest as three degenerate phonon-like modes in the collective excitations of the system.\n\nC) The Nambu-Goldstone modes remain unchanged at finite temperatures, preserving their zero-mass character.\n\nD) The Nambu-Goldstone modes split into multiple non-degenerate modes with finite masses at finite temperatures.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The first reason is that the capture cross section of the latter reaction is larger than the one of the $^{34}$S+$^{208}$Pb reaction since the nucleus-nucleus potential is more attractive in the $^{36}$S+$^{206}$Pb reaction due to two more neutrons in isotope $^{36}$S.
