In this study, we will study investor attention measurement using the Search Volume Index in the recent market. Since 2009, the popularity of mobile devices and the spread of the Internet have made the speed of information delivery faster and the investment information retrieval data for obtaining investment information has increased dramatically. In these circumstances, investor attention measurement using search volume data can be measured more accurately and faster than before mobile device popularization. To confirm this, we will compare the effect of measuring investor attention using search volume data before and after mobile device popularization. In addition, it is confirmed that the measured investor attention is that of retail traders, not institutional traders or professional traders, and the relationship between investor attention and short-term price pressure theory. Using SVI data provided by Google Trends, we will experiment with Russell 3000 stocks and IPO stocks and compare the results. In addition, the results of investigating the investor's interest using the search volume data from various angles through experiments such as the comparison of the results based on the inclusion of the noise ticker group, the comparison of the limitations of the existing investor attention measurement method, and the comparison of explanatory variables with existing IPO related studies.

We study a periodically driven central site coupled to a disordered environment. In comparison to the static model, transport features are either enhanced or reduced, depending on the frequency of the drive. We demonstrate this by analyzing the statistics of quasienergies and the logarithmic entanglement growth between bipartitions, which show similar features: For frequencies larger than disorder strength, localization is enhanced due to a reduced effective coupling to the central site. Remarkably, localization can even be increased up to almost perfect freezing at particular frequencies, at which the central site decouples due to the emergence of `dark Floquet states'. This high-frequency domain of our model is bounded by a critical frequency $\\omega_c$, where transport increases abruptly.

Transducer-based models, such as RNN-Transducer and transformer-transducer, have achieved great success in speech recognition.

Statistically, The number of blank tokens in the prediction results accounts for nearly 90\\% of all tokens. It takes a lot of computation and time to predict the blank tokens, but only the non-blank tokens will appear in the final output sequence. Therefore, we propose a method named fast-skip regularization, which tries to align the blank position predicted by a transducer with that predicted by a CTC model. During the inference, the transducer model can predict the blank tokens in advance by a simple CTC project layer without many complicated forward calculations of the transducer decoder and then skip them, which will reduce the computation and improve the inference speed greatly.

Fast-Skip Regularization (FSR) works by aligning the blank token positions predicted by the transducer model with those predicted by a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) model. This alignment allows the transducer to predict blank tokens in advance using a simple CTC projection layer during inference, without requiring complex forward calculations of the transducer decoder. As a result, the model can skip these predicted blank tokens, significantly reducing computation and improving inference speed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because FSR doesn't actually reduce the number of blank tokens; it just predicts and skips them more efficiently. The documentation states that blank tokens still account for nearly 90% of all tokens.\n\nOption B is incorrect as FSR doesn't specifically use a transformer architecture or focus on predicting non-blank tokens more efficiently. It's about predicting and skipping blank tokens.\n\nOption D is incorrect because FSR aims to reduce complexity and computation, not increase it.

Humans can master a new task within a few trials by drawing upon skills acquired through prior experience.

We propose a method, which leverages the hierarchical structure to train the combination function and adapt the set of diverse primitive polices alternatively, to efficiently produce a range of complex behaviors on challenging new tasks.

In this work, a method to describe the production of colour-singlet processes which combines these two approaches is presented. The core idea is that the contribution from power corrections involving the heavy-quark mass can be numerically isolated from the rest of the massive computation. These power corrections can then be combined with a massless computation (where they are absent), enabling the construction of differential cross-section predictions in a massive variable flavour number scheme.

We also predict the degree of polarization of thermal dust emission at 353 GHz to be ~ 11 percent and 14 percent for the lines of sight to the HD 197770 and HD 147933-4 stars, respectively."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the study on the polarization of electric dipole emission from spinning dust, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the polarization of spinning dust emission and its implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation experiments?\n\nA) Spinning dust emission shows a constant degree of polarization of 1.6% across all frequencies, significantly contaminating CMB measurements.\n\nB) The degree of polarization of spinning dust emission is highest (about 1.6%) at around 3 GHz and decreases to less than 0.9% above 20 GHz, suggesting minimal contamination of CMB measurements at higher frequencies.\n\nC) Thermal dust emission at 353 GHz shows a lower degree of polarization (about 5-7%) compared to spinning dust emission, making it less of a concern for CMB experiments.\n\nD) The study conclusively proves that spinning dust emission does not contribute to polarized CMB contamination at any frequency.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The study finds that the degree of polarization of spinning dust emission is about 1.6% at frequency ~3 GHz and declines to below 0.9% for frequencies above 20 GHz. This suggests that while there is some polarization at lower frequencies, it becomes less significant at higher frequencies typically used for CMB measurements. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the polarization is not constant across all frequencies. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the study actually predicts a higher degree of polarization for thermal dust emission at 353 GHz (11% and 14% for the two studied lines of sight), which is higher than the spinning dust polarization.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the study does not conclusively prove that spinning dust emission doesn't contribute to polarized CMB contamination at all; it merely constrains the degree of polarization at different frequencies."}, "58": {"documentation": {"title": "Parity Violating Measurements of Neutron Densities", "source": "C.

Parity violating electron nucleus scattering is a clean and powerful tool for measuring the spatial distributions of neutrons in nuclei with unprecedented accuracy. Parity violation arises from the interference of electromagnetic and weak neutral amplitudes, and the $Z^0$ of the Standard Model couples primarily to neutrons at low $Q^2$. The data can be interpreted with as much confidence as electromagnetic scattering. After briefly reviewing the present theoretical and experimental knowledge of neutron densities, we discuss possible parity violation measurements, their theoretical interpretation, and applications. The experiments are feasible at existing facilities. We show that theoretical corrections are either small or well understood, which makes the interpretation clean. The quantitative relationship to atomic parity nonconservation observables is examined, and we show that the electron scattering asymmetries can be directly applied to atomic PNC because the observables have approximately the same dependence on nuclear shape."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between parity violating electron nucleus scattering and neutron density measurements?\n\nA) Parity violating electron nucleus scattering is an indirect method that relies on complex theoretical models to infer neutron densities.\n\nB) Parity violating electron nucleus scattering provides a clean and accurate tool for measuring neutron spatial distributions, with interpretations as confident as electromagnetic scattering.\n\nC) Parity violating electron nucleus scattering is primarily useful for measuring proton distributions due to the electromagnetic interaction.\n\nD) Parity violating electron nucleus scattering requires significant theoretical corrections, making the interpretation of neutron densities challenging.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

In this paper, we explore the implications of a two-point discretization of an extra-dimension in a five-dimensional quantum setup. We adopt a pragmatic attitude by considering the dynamics of spin-half particles through the simplest possible extension of the existing Dirac and Pauli equations. It is shown that the benefit of this approach is to predict new physical phenomena while maintaining the number of constitutive hypothesis at minimum. As the most striking feature of the model, we demonstrate the possibility of fermionic matter oscillations between the two four-dimensional sections and hyper-fast displacements in case of asymmetric warping (without conflicting special relativity). This result, similar to previous reported ones in brane-world theories, is completely original as it is derived by using quantum mechanics only without recourse to general relativity and bulk geodesics calculation.
