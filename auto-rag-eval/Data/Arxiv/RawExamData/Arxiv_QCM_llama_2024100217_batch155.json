Electric-field control of spin-dependent properties has become one of the most attractive phenomena in modern materials research due the promise of new device functionalities. One of the paradigms in this approach is to electrically toggle the spin polarization of carriers injected into a semiconductor using ferroelectric polarization as a control parameter. Using first-principles density functional calculations, we explore the effect of ferroelectric polarization of electron-doped BaTiO3 (n-BaTiO3) on the spin-polarized transmission across the SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface. Our study reveals that the interface transmission is negatively spin-polarized and that ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a change in the transport spin polarization from -65% to -98%. We show that this effect stems from the large difference in Fermi wave vectors between up- and down-spins in ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and a change in the transport regime driven by ferroelectric polarization switching. The predicted sizeable change in the spin polarization provides a non-volatile mechanism to electrically control spin injection in semiconductor-based spintronics devices."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary mechanism by which ferroelectric polarization reversal affects the spin-polarized transmission across the SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface, according to the study?\n\nA) A change in the Fermi wave vectors between up- and down-spins in ferromagnetic SrRuO3\nB) A change in the transport regime driven by ferroelectric polarization switching\nC) A decrease in the spin polarization due to increased scattering at the interface\nD) An increase in the spin polarization due to enhanced spin injection\n\nCorrect Answer: B) A change in the transport regime driven by ferroelectric polarization switching\n\nExplanation: The study reveals that ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a change in the transport spin polarization from -65% to -98%, indicating a significant change in the transport regime.
