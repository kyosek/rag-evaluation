Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have reached a degree of maturity that makes it possible to investigate the lipid polymorphism of model bilayers over a wide range of temperatures.

The documentation states that capturing non-local interactions between amino acids that are close in spatial structure but not in sequence is a long-standing challenge in bioinformatics.

Here we review the prototypical package model of Niesert et al. 1981 which guarantees the greatest possible region of viability of the protocell population, and show that this model, and hence the entire package approach, does not resolve the information crisis. This is so because to secure survival the total information content of the protocell, $Ld$, must tend to a constant value that depends only on the spontaneous error rate per nucleotide of the template replication mechanism. As a result, an increase of $d$ must be followed by a decrease of $L$ to ensure the protocell viability, so that the net information gain is null."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the package model approach to the information crisis of prebiotic evolution, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the number of distinct templates (d) and the length of each template (L) within a protocell?\n\nA) Increasing d allows for a proportional increase in L, resulting in a net gain of information content.\n\nB) d and L can be increased independently, allowing for unlimited information content growth within the protocell.\n\nC) The product of d and L must remain constant to maintain protocell viability, resulting in no net information gain.\n\nD) Increasing d necessitates a decrease in L, but the total information content (Ld) can still increase beyond a certain threshold.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage states that \"to secure survival the total information content of the protocell, Ld, must tend to a constant value that depends only on the spontaneous error rate per nucleotide of the template replication mechanism.\" This means that the product of the number of distinct templates (d) and the length of each template (L) must remain constant to maintain protocell viability.

Recent developments in the multi-messenger astronomy through gravitational waves (LIGO/Virgo) or X-ray timing data (NICER) have provided new constraints on the theories of nuclear physics, where an absolute energy density functional from ab-initio modelling is still not available. General relativity guarantees a unique one-to-one correspondence between static observables of neutron stars (NSs) such as mass-radius or tidal deformability and the equation of state (EoS) of beta equilibrated matter. However, these static properties are not enough to predict the composition of the interiors of NSs, even if one assumes that hadrons present in the neutron star core are only neutrons and protons. This statement is demonstrated through a simple analytical method based on a polynomial expansion of the EoS, and it is further reinforced by a full Bayesian analysis. We show that even additional empirical information on symmetric matter at high densities are not sufficient to pin down the composition, if uncertainties on measurements are accounted for.
