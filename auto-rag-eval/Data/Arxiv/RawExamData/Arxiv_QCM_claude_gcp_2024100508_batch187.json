Weight pruning of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been proposed to satisfy the limited storage and computing capability of mobile edge devices. However, previous pruning methods mainly focus on reducing the model size and/or improving performance without considering the privacy of user data. To mitigate this concern, we propose a privacy-preserving-oriented pruning and mobile acceleration framework that does not require the private training dataset. At the algorithm level of the proposed framework, a systematic weight pruning technique based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is designed to iteratively solve the pattern-based pruning problem for each layer with randomly generated synthetic data. In addition, corresponding optimizations at the compiler level are leveraged for inference accelerations on devices. With the proposed framework, users could avoid the time-consuming pruning process for non-experts and directly benefit from compressed models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms three state-of-art end-to-end DNN frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow-Lite, TVM, and MNN, with speedup up to 4.2X, 2.5X, and 2.0X, respectively, with almost no accuracy loss, while preserving data privacy."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary innovation of the proposed privacy-preserving-oriented DNN pruning and mobile acceleration framework?\n\nA) It focuses solely on reducing model size without considering privacy concerns.\nB) It uses real user data to train the pruned model for better accuracy.\nC) It employs ADMM-based weight pruning using synthetic data to preserve privacy while optimizing performance.\nD) It relies on existing frameworks like TensorFlow-Lite to achieve acceleration on mobile devices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

In this paper we introduce Jiffy, the first lock-free, linearizable ordered key-value index that offers both (1) batch updates, which are put and remove operations that are executed atomically, and (2) consistent snapshots used by, e.g., range scan operations. Jiffy is built as a multiversioned lock-free skip list and relies on CPU's Time Stamp Counter register to generate version numbers at minimal cost. For faster skip list traversals and better utilization of the CPU caches, key-value entries are grouped into immutable objects called revisions.

Structure modifications to the index, which result in changing the size of revisions, happen through (lock-free) skip list node split and merge operations that are carefully coordinated with the update operations.

We proposed a calculational framework for describing induced fission that avoids the Bohr-Wheeler assumption of well-defined fission channels. The building blocks of our approach are configurations that form a discrete, orthogonal basis and can be characterized by both energy and shape. The dynamics is to be determined by interaction matrix elements between the states rather than by a Hill-Wheeler construction of a collective coordinate. Within our approach, several simple limits can be seen: diffusion; quantized conductance; and ordinary decay through channels. The specific proposal for the discrete basis is to use the $K^\\pi$ quantum numbers of the axially symmetric Hartree-Fock approximation to generate the configurations. Fission paths would be determined by hopping from configuration to configuration via the residual interaction. We show as an example the configurations needed to describe a fictitious fission decay $^{32}{\\rm S} \\rightarrow ^{16}{\\rm O} + ^{16}{\\rm O}$.

The method \"investigates the relationships among multiple passages in the answer generation process.\"\n2. It determines token matches between positive and negative passages.\n3. It identifies tokens matched across passages assigned to the same question and investigates the topics in which they match.\n4. It \"encodes the token sequences with the above two matching results into unified memories in the passage encoders.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because GUM-MP uses a multiple-pointer-generator mechanism, not a single-pointer-generator.\nOption B is incomplete, as GUM-MP also analyzes matches with negative passages.\nOption D is incorrect because the method doesn't focus solely on negative passages; it considers both positive and negative passages.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the core concept and distinguishing features of the GUM-MP method compared to other approaches."}}
