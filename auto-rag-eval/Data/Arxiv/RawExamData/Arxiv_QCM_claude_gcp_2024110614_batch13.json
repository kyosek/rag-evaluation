Grid cells, discovered more than a decade ago [5], are neurons in the brain of mammals that fire when the animal is located near certain specific points in its familiar terrain. Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a two-dimensional triangular grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely believed to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a location state through the summation of small displacements. We provide theoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like tuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In particular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the sensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the displacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid tuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under additional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is optimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern. We discuss the connection of our results to the triangular grid pattern observed in animals."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about grid cells, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A neuroscientist is developing a computational model for path integration in mammals.

Ten years ago we presented a modified version of Okun law for the biggest developed economies and reported its excellent predictive power.

The initial results show that the change in unemployment rate can be accurately predicted by variations in the rate of real economic growth. There is a discrete version of the model which is represented by a piece wise linear dependence of the annual increment in unemployment rate on the annual rate of change in real GDP per capita. The lengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP measurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and GDP deflator (dGDP).

In fact, the use of terms like \"central limit theorem\" and \"concentration inequality\" implies that there is some level of uncertainty or error in the estimates.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that it mentions convergence to the true latent position, which is supported by the documentation's mention of a \"central limit theorem about the true latent position of the out-of-sample vertex.\" However, it incorrectly limits this to the stochastic block model, whereas the documentation states that the results apply to the more general random dot product graph model, which includes the stochastic block model as a special case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it contradicts the main thrust of the research described in the documentation, which aims to provide theoretical guarantees for out-of-sample extensions, making them a valid and useful approach for handling new nodes in graph embeddings.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze and apply the theoretical results presented in the documentation to a practical scenario, requiring critical thinking about the implications of these results for real-world applications of graph embeddings."}, "18": {"documentation": {"title": "Exploiting Unlabeled Data in CNNs by Self-supervised Learning to Rank", "source": "Xialei Liu, Joost van de Weijer, Andrew D.

In this paper we demonstrate how one can perform a bifurcation analysis of the behaviour of a periodically-forced system with delay in dependence on key parameters. As an example we consider the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a sea surface temperature oscillation on a multi-year scale in the basin of the Pacific Ocean.

The correct answer is D for the following reasons:\n\n1. d-d transitions are typically localized excitations that don't show strong momentum dependence. They often require high energy resolution to resolve closely spaced energy levels. The high resolution configuration of PEAXIS, providing <40meV FWHM at ~400 eV, is ideal for this measurement.\n\n2. Magnetic excitations, especially in 2D materials, can be dispersive (i.e., their energy depends on momentum transfer). To study these effectively, two aspects of PEAXIS are crucial:\n   a) The ability to rotate the spectrometer arm by 106\u00b0 in the horizontal plane, allowing for probing different momentum transfers.\n   b) Higher flux, which is beneficial for detecting typically weak magnetic excitations and for efficiently mapping their dispersion across multiple momentum transfers.\n\n3. The high flux configuration, providing up to 10^12 photons/s, would be more suitable for studying the potentially weak and dispersive magnetic excitations.\n\n4. Switching between high resolution and high flux configurations is possible with PEAXIS, as mentioned in the documentation: \"The monochromator optics can be operated in different configurations for the benefit of either high flux...or high energy resolution.\"\n\nThis strategy combines the strengths of PEAXIS for both types of measurements, demonstrating a deep understanding of both the instrument capabilities and the nature of the physical phenomena being studied.

We devise a computationally efficient (polynomial in the support size of the marginals) algorithm that computes the worst-case joint distribution for any choice of item prices.

In a-MoGe thin films, the two-dimensional vortex lattice melting follows the BKTHNY (Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young) theory, which predicts a two-step melting process through an intermediate hexatic phase.

This leads us to propose a rather elegant approach based on a \\emph{shadowing filter}. The resulting filter is efficient (reduces to the solution of linear equations) and robust (uneffected by missing data and singular correlations that would cause catastrophic failure of Bayesian filters.)

The complex organization of syntax in hierarchical structures is one of the core design features of human language.

The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way.

The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly states that \"the reciprocal of market's depth, i.e. Kyle's lambda, is a uniformly integrable supermartingale.\" This is a significant departure from the original Kyle model.\n\nThe implications of this behavior are profound:\n1.

Here we present a network-based framework to detect potential cartels in bidding markets based on the idea that the chance a group of firms can overcome this obstacle and sustain cooperation depends on the patterns of its interactions. We create a network of firms based on their co-bidding behavior, detect interacting groups, and measure their cohesion and exclusivity, two group-level features of their collective behavior.

Social choice functions (SCFs) map the preferences of a group of agents over some set of alternatives to a non-empty subset of alternatives.

For set-valued SCFs, or so-called social choice correspondences, the situation is less clear. There are miscellaneous - mostly negative - results using a variety of strategyproofness notions and additional requirements. The simple and intuitive notion of Kelly-strategyproofness has turned out to be particularly compelling because it is weak enough to still allow for positive results.

While competition for binding sites could theoretically cause variable activation patterns, the documentation doesn't mention this mechanism. Instead, it focuses on the scaffold's role in assembling multiple proteins into a complex.\n\nThe correct answer, D, accurately reflects the documentation's explanation that scaffold proteins facilitate \"the competition of processes occurring at many time scales.\" This competition of processes leads to the broadening of kinase activation times, which is consistent with the researcher's observations of widely distributed activation times.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply theoretical concepts to experimental observations and requires critical thinking about the role of scaffold proteins in signal transduction kinetics."}}
