The author studied the growth of the amplitude in a Mathieu-like equation with multiplicative white noise. The approximate value of the exponent at the extremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by introducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated numerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic numerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\alpha$ that is determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling between the variable and the noise. The value of $\\alpha$ was restricted not to be negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent decreases with $\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was also found that the exponent as a function of $\\alpha$ has only one minimum at $\\alpha \\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\alpha = 0$.

This paper investigates the decoding process of asynchronous convolutional-coded physical-layer network coding (PNC) systems.

Our framework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony between the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient feature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral symbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and reduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset. Moreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is BER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC. Extending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding algorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms the previously proposed XOR-CD algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by 2dB for synchronous PNC. For phase-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC is 4dB better than the other two algorithms.

Finding the most \"influential\" nodes is key to understand the functioning and robustness of networked systems.

Conservation laws in the form of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to the modeling of many problems such as heat transfer and flow in porous media. Many of such PDEs are stochastic due to the presence of uncertainty in the conductivity field. Based on the relation between stochastic diffusion processes and PDEs, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are available to solve these PDEs. These methods are especially relevant for cases where we are interested in the solution in a small subset of the domain. The existing MC methods based on the stochastic formulation require restrictively small time steps for high variance conductivity fields. Moreover, in many applications the conductivity is piecewise constant and the existing methods are not readily applicable in these cases.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of nonlinear dynamical systems often used to model sequence-to-sequence maps. RNNs have excellent expressive power but lack the stability or robustness guarantees that are necessary for many applications. In this paper, we formulate convex sets of RNNs with stability and robustness guarantees. The guarantees are derived using incremental quadratic constraints and can ensure global exponential stability of all solutions, and bounds on incremental $ \\ell_2 $ gain (the Lipschitz constant of the learned sequence-to-sequence mapping). Using an implicit model structure, we construct a parametrization of RNNs that is jointly convex in the model parameters and stability certificate. We prove that this model structure includes all previously-proposed convex sets of stable RNNs as special cases, and also includes all stable linear dynamical systems. We illustrate the utility of the proposed model class in the context of non-linear system identification."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key innovation and advantage of the convex parameterization of RNNs proposed in this paper?\n\nA) It ensures that all RNNs are globally exponentially stable, regardless of their parameters.\n\nB) It provides a method to convert any existing RNN into a stable and robust version without changing its structure.\n\nC) It introduces a jointly convex formulation in both model parameters and stability certificate, encompassing all previously proposed convex sets of stable RNNs.\n\nD) It guarantees that the trained RNNs will always outperform linear dynamical systems in sequence-to-sequence mapping tasks.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key innovation described in the paper is the development of a convex parameterization of RNNs that is jointly convex in both the model parameters and the stability certificate.

A well-behaved adjoint sensitivity technique for chaotic dynamical systems is presented. The method arises from the specialisation of established variational techniques to the unstable periodic orbits of the system. On such trajectories, the adjoint problem becomes a time periodic boundary value problem. The adjoint solution remains bounded in time and does not exhibit the typical unbounded exponential growth observed using traditional methods over unstable non-periodic trajectories (Lea et al., Tellus 52 (2000)). This enables the sensitivity of period averaged quantities to be calculated exactly, regardless of the orbit period, because the stability of the tangent dynamics is decoupled effectively from the sensitivity calculations. We demonstrate the method on two prototypical systems, the Lorenz equations at standard parameters and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation with chaotic behaviour. We report a statistical analysis of the sensitivity of these two systems based on databases of unstable periodic orbits of size 10^5 and 4x10^4, respectively.

The paper presents a novel adjoint sensitivity technique for chaotic dynamical systems that focuses on unstable periodic orbits. The key advantage of this method is that it enables the adjoint solution to remain bounded in time, avoiding the typical unbounded exponential growth seen in traditional methods.
