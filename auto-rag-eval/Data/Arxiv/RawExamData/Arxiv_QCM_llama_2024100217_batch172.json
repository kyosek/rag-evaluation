In this work we study the phenomenological consequences of the environment dependence of neutrino mass on solar and reactor neutrino phenomenology. Such dependence can be induced, for example, by Yukawa interactions with a light scalar particle which couples to neutrinos and matter and it is expected, among others, in mass varying neutrino scenarios. Under the assumption of one mass scale dominance, we perform a global analysis of solar and KamLAND neutrino data which depends on 4 parameters: the two standard oscillation parameters, Delta m^2 and tan^2(theta), and two new coefficients, which parameterize the environment dependence of the neutrino mass. We find that, generically, the inclusion of the environment dependent terms does not lead to a very statistically significant improvement on the description of the data in the most favoured MSW LMA (or LMA-I) region. It does, however, substantially improve the fit in the high-Delta m^2 LMA (or LMA-II) region which can be allowed at 98.9% CL. Conversely the analysis allow us to place stringent constraints on the size of the environment dependence terms, which can be translated on a bound on the product of the effective neutrino-scalar (lambda^\\nu) and matter-scalar (lambda^N) Yukawa couplings, as a function of the scalar field mass (m_S) in these models."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** In the context of the study \"Effects of Environment Dependence of Neutrino Mass versus Solar and Reactor Neutrino Data\", what is the primary conclusion regarding the inclusion of environment-dependent terms in the analysis of solar and KamLAND neutrino data?\n\n**A)** The inclusion of environment-dependent terms leads to a statistically significant improvement in the description of the data in the most favored MSW LMA (or LMA-I) region.\n\n**B)** The inclusion of environment-dependent terms does not lead to a statistically significant improvement in the description of the data in any region of the parameter space.\n\n**C)** The inclusion of environment-dependent terms substantially improves the fit in the high-\u0394m^2 LMA (or LMA-II) region, which can be allowed at 98.9% CL.\n\n**D)** The inclusion of environment-dependent terms leads to a statistically significant improvement in the description of the data in the high-\u0394m^2 LMA (or LMA-II) region, but not in the most favored MSW LMA (or LMA-I) region.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) The inclusion of environment-dependent terms substantially improves the fit in the high-\u0394m^2 LMA (or LMA-II) region, which can be allowed at 98.9% CL.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is C) because the study finds that the inclusion of environment-dependent terms does not lead to a statistically significant improvement in the description of the data in the most favored MSW LMA (or LMA-I) region, but it does substantially improve the fit in the high-\u0394m^2 LMA (or LMA-II) region, which can be allowed at 98.9% CL."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Load Forecasting Model and Day-ahead Operation Strategy for City-located\n  EV Quick Charge Stations", "source": "Zeyu Liu, Yaxin Xie, Donghan Feng, Yun Zhou, Shanshan Shi, Chen Fang", "docs_id": "1909.00971", "section": ["eess.SY", "cs.SY", "math.OC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Load Forecasting Model and Day-ahead Operation Strategy for City-located\n  EV Quick Charge Stations. Charging demands of electric vehicles (EVs) are sharply increasing due to the rapid development of EVs. Hence, reliable and convenient quick charge stations are required to respond to the needs of EV drivers. Due to the uncertainty of EV charging loads, load forecasting becomes vital for the operation of quick charge stations to formulate the day-ahead plan. In this paper, based on trip chain theory and EV user behaviour, an EV charging load forecasting model is established for quick charge station operators. This model is capable of forecasting the charging demand of a city-located quick charge station during the next day, where the Monte-Carlo simulation method is applied. Furthermore, based on the forecasting model, a day-ahead profit-oriented operation strategy for such stations is derived. The simulation results support the effectiveness of this forecasting model and the operation strategy.

On the one hand, topological monopoles are constructed in Lorentz invariant quantum field theories, while on the other hand, the low-energy effective theory for such monopoles will reproduce Weinberg's result.

Self-organization and pattern formation in network-organized systems emerges from the collective activation and interaction of many interconnected units. A striking feature of these non-equilibrium structures is that they are often localized and robust: only a small subset of the nodes, or cell assembly, is activated. Understanding the role of cell assemblies as basic functional units in neural networks and socio-technical systems emerges as a fundamental challenge in network theory. A key open question is how these elementary building blocks emerge, and how they operate, linking structure and function in complex networks.

This is a paradigm shift: A change in the fundamental understanding of how the brain solves problems and how we can best guide students to learn to solve problems in the physical sciences. One implication is that for students, knowledge of concepts and big ideas is not sufficient to solve most problems assigned in physics and chemistry courses for STEM majors.
