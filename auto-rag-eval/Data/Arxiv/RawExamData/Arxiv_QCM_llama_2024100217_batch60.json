This article concerns a cost-efficient method for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a comprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is utilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs some visually assessed cytological covariates, which are pertinent to determination of breast cancer, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample.

The $L_{1,1}$ norm is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in $\\Omega$.

This paper considers the segmentation, identification and localization of vertebrae in CT images. Although these three tasks are related, they face specific problems that add up when they are addressed together. For example neighboring vertebrae with similar shapes perturb the identification and vertebrae with complex or even pathological morphologies impact the segmentation. Consequently, the three tasks tend to be approached independently, e.g. labelling (localization and identification) or segmenting only, or, when treated globally, a sequential strategy is used. Sequential methods however are prone to accumulate errors as they are not able to recover from mistakes of the previous module. In this work, we propose to combine all three tasks and leverage their interdependence: locations ease the segmentation, the segmentations in turn improve the locations and they all contribute and benefit from the identification task. To this purpose we propose a virtuous cycle to enforce coherence between the three tasks. Within such a cycle, the tasks interoperate and are iterated until a global consistency criterion is satisfied.
