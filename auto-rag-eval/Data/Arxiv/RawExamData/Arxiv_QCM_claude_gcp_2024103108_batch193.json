With limited studies that compared myopic and global strategies, the expectation was not challenged and researchers are still investing heavily to achieve global optimization.

This paper provides a discouraging answer based on experimental simulations comparing the performance improvement and computation burden between global and myopic strategies in parameter estimation of multiple models.
