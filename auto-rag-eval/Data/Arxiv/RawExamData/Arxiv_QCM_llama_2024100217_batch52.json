Fourier ptychographic microscopy is a computational imaging technique that provides quantitative phase information and high resolution over a large field-of-view. Although the technique presents numerous advantages over conventional microscopy, model mismatch due to unknown optical aberrations can significantly limit reconstruction quality. Many attempts to address this issue rely on embedding pupil recovery into the reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of a purely algorithmic approach and evaluate the merits of implementing a simple, dedicated calibration procedure. In simulations, we find that for a target sample reconstruction error, we can image without any aberration corrections up to a maximum aberration magnitude of $\\lambda$/40. When we use algorithmic self-calibration, we can increase the aberration magnitude up to $\\lambda$/10, and with our in situ speckle calibration technique, this working range is extended further to a maximum aberration magnitude of $\\lambda$/3. Hence, one can trade-off complexity for accuracy by using a separate calibration process, which is particularly useful for larger aberrations."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary limitation of algorithmic self-calibration in Fourier ptychographic microscopy when dealing with unknown optical aberrations, and how does a dedicated calibration procedure address this issue?\n\nA) Algorithmic self-calibration can accurately correct for aberrations up to a maximum magnitude of \u03bb/10, but a dedicated calibration procedure can extend this range to \u03bb/3.\nB) A dedicated calibration procedure can only correct for aberrations up to a maximum magnitude of \u03bb/40, while algorithmic self-calibration can correct for aberrations up to \u03bb/10.\nC) Algorithmic self-calibration can correct for aberrations up to a maximum magnitude of \u03bb/3, but a dedicated calibration procedure can only correct for aberrations up to \u03bb/10.\nD) A dedicated calibration procedure can only correct for aberrations up to a maximum magnitude of \u03bb/40, while algorithmic self-calibration can correct for aberrations up to \u03bb/3.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) A dedicated calibration procedure can only correct for aberrations up to a maximum magnitude of \u03bb/40, while algorithmic self-calibration can correct for aberrations up to \u03bb/10.\n\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to understand the limitations of algorithmic self-calibration and the benefits of a dedicated calibration procedure.

The correct answer states that the combination of the two approaches allows for the accurate reproduction of velocity statistics and the prediction of extreme events, which is a key benefit of the proposed method. The other options are incorrect because they either focus on a different aspect of the method (A and C) or are too narrow in scope (D)."}, "59": {"documentation": {"title": "Higher-order exceptional point and Landau-Zener Bloch oscillations in\n  driven non-Hermitian photonic Lieb lattices", "source": "Shiqiang Xia, Carlo Danieli, Yingying Zhang, Xingdong Zhao, Liqin\n  Tang, Hai Lu, Denghui Li, Daohong Song, and Zhigang Chen", "docs_id": "2108.12602", "section": ["physics.optics"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Higher-order exceptional point and Landau-Zener Bloch oscillations in\n  driven non-Hermitian photonic Lieb lattices. We propose a scheme to realize parity-time (PT) symmetric photonic Lieb lattices of ribbon shape and complex couplings, thereby demonstrating the higher-order exceptional point (EP) and Landau-Zener Bloch (LZB) oscillations in presence of a refractive index gradient. Quite different from non-Hermitian flatband lattices with on-site gain/loss, which undergo thresholdless PT symmetry breaking, the spectrum for such quasi-one-dimensional Lieb lattices has completely real values when the index gradient is applied perpendicular to the ribbon, and a triply degenerated (third-order) EP with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors emerges only when the amplitude of gain/loss ratio reaches a certain threshold value. When the index gradient is applied parallel to the ribbon, the LZB oscillations exhibit intriguing characteristics including asymmetric energy transition and pseudo-Hermitian propagation as the flatband is excited. Meanwhile, a secondary emission occurs each time when the oscillatory motion passes through the EP, leading to distinct energy distribution in the flatband when a dispersive band is excited. Such novel phenomena may appear in other non-Hermitian flatband systems. Our work may also bring insight and suggest a photonic platform to study the symmetry and topological characterization of higher-order EPs that may find unique applications in for example enhancing sensitivity."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary effect of applying a refractive index gradient perpendicular to a ribbon-shaped PT symmetric photonic Lieb lattice, and how does it relate to the emergence of a triply degenerated (third-order) exceptional point (EP)?\n\nA) The refractive index gradient causes a shift in the flatband, leading to a triply degenerated EP with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nB) The refractive index gradient breaks the PT symmetry, resulting in a triply degenerated EP with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nC) The refractive index gradient has no effect on the flatband, and the triply degenerated EP emerges only when the amplitude of gain/loss ratio reaches a certain threshold value.\nD) The refractive index gradient causes a triply degenerated EP with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but only when the index gradient is applied parallel to the ribbon.\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The refractive index gradient has no effect on the flatband, and the triply degenerated EP emerges only when the amplitude of gain/loss ratio reaches a certain threshold value.\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, when the index gradient is applied perpendicular to the ribbon, the spectrum for the quasi-one-dimensional Lieb lattice has completely real values, and a triply degenerated (third-order) EP with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors emerges only when the amplitude of gain/loss ratio reaches a certain threshold value.
