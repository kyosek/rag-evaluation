Our goal is to capture the pose of neuroscience model organisms, without using any manual supervision, to be able to study how neural circuits orchestrate behaviour. Human pose estimation attains remarkable accuracy when trained on real or simulated datasets consisting of millions of frames. However, for many applications simulated models are unrealistic and real training datasets with comprehensive annotations do not exist. We address this problem with a new sim2real domain transfer method. Our key contribution is the explicit and independent modeling of appearance, shape and poses in an unpaired image translation framework. Our model lets us train a pose estimator on the target domain by transferring readily available body keypoint locations from the source domain to generated target images. We compare our approach with existing domain transfer methods and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy on Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Danio rerio (zebrafish), without requiring any manual annotation on the target domain and despite using simplistic off-the-shelf animal characters for simulation, or simple geometric shapes as models.

The research team's situation closely mirrors the problem described: they have unlabeled data of laboratory animals (fruit flies) and need to develop a pose estimation model without manual annotation.\n\nThe sim2real domain transfer method with independent modeling of appearance, shape, and poses is specifically designed to address this issue.

Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bus ridership in the United States had attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency on weekdays using passenger count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive in terms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to changes in frequency.

Shape of the cells is given as a superposition of a finite number of convective rolls with different wave vectors. For numerical simulation of the obtained systems of amplitude equations a few numerical schemes based on modern ETD (exponential time differencing) pseudo-spectral methods were developed.

The spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in a wide energy range can usually be well described by the Band function, which is a two smoothly jointed power laws cutting at a breaking energy. Below the breaking energy, the Band function reduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple power law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working energy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can be fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy band of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well even using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample of Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the empirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the reconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity correlations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate these two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are modeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both luminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.

We consider the question: what is the abstraction that should be implemented by the computational engine of a machine learning system? Current machine learning systems typically push whole tensors through a series of compute kernels such as matrix multiplications or activation functions, where each kernel runs on an AI accelerator (ASIC) such as a GPU. This implementation abstraction provides little built-in support for ML systems to scale past a single machine, or for handling large models with matrices or tensors that do not easily fit into the RAM of an ASIC.

Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units.

A market-oriented pricing of energy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal local market based on the marginal pricing scheme. The market aims at maximizing the social welfare of the community, thanks to the more efficient allocation of resources, the reduction of the peak power to be paid, and the increased amount of reserve, achieved at an aggregate level.

Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) formulates a PDE-constrained optimization problem to reduce cycle skipping in full-waveform inversion (FWI).
