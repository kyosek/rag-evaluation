The recent detailed study of quasi-one-dimensional iron-based ladders, with the $3d$ iron electronic density $n = 6$, has unveiled surprises, such as orbital-selective phases. However, similar studies for $n=6$ iron chains are still rare. Here, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model was constructed to study the magnetic and electronic properties of the quasi-one-dimensional $n=6$ iron chain Ce$_2$O$_2$FeSe$_2$, with focus on the effect of doping. Specifically, introducing the Hubbard $U$ and Hund $J_{H}$ couplings and studying the model via the density matrix renormalization group, we report the ground-state phase diagram varying the electronic density away from $n=6$. For the realistic Hund coupling $J_{H}/U = 1/4$, several electronic phases were obtained, including a metal, orbital-selective Mott, and Mott insulating phases. Doping away from the parent phase, the competition of many tendencies leads to a variety of magnetic states, such as ferromagnetism, as well as several antiferromagnetic and magnetic \"block\" phases. In the hole-doping region, two different interesting orbital-selective Mott phases were found: OSMP1 (with one localized orbital and two itinerant orbitals) and OSMP2 (with two localized orbitals and one itinerant orbital).

The user's decisions are based on the output of the aid and on the information, the user obtains independently. We present a simple method for computing the maximal benefits a user can derive from a binary aid as a function of the user's and the aid's sensitivities. Combining the user and the aid often adds little to the performance the better detector could achieve alone. Also, if users assign non-optimal weights to the aid, performance may drop dramatically.

An accurate and efficient event reconstruction is required to realize the full scientific capability of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs). The current and future neutrino experiments that rely on massive LArTPCs create a need for new ideas and reconstruction approaches. Wire-Cell, proposed in recent years, is a novel tomographic event reconstruction method for LArTPCs. The Wire-Cell 3D imaging approach capitalizes on charge, sparsity, time, and geometry information to reconstruct a topology-agnostic 3D image of the ionization electrons prior to pattern recognition. A second novel method, the many-to-many charge-light matching, then pairs the TPC charge activity to the detected scintillation light signal, thus enabling a powerful rejection of cosmic-ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector. A robust processing of the scintillation light signal and an appropriate clustering of the reconstructed 3D image are fundamental to this technique. In this paper, we describe the principles and algorithms of these techniques and their successful application in the MicroBooNE experiment. A quantitative evaluation of the performance of these techniques is presented.

Thus, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal consequences of the super-Mendelian population genetics prior to potential applications. Here, we employ a reaction-diffusion model for sexually reproducing diploid organisms to study how a locally introduced gene drive allele spreads to replace the wild-type allele, even though it possesses a selective disadvantage $s>0$.

Given the properties of Si\u2083N\u2084 nanobeam optomechanical crystals, which of the following applications would be most challenging to implement with this system?\n\nA) A high-precision thermometer operating at room temperature\nB) A quantum memory device for storing optical qubits\nC) An optomechanical accelerometer for inertial sensing\nD) A frequency stabilization system for a laser operating at 980 nm\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, testing critical thinking rather than mere recall. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\nA) While not ideal, this could potentially be implemented. The documentation mentions temperature-dependent measurements of mechanical damping between 6K and 300K, suggesting the system can operate at room temperature. The high frequency-mechanical quality factor product (f\u00d7Qm \u2248 2.6\u00d710\u00b9\u00b3 Hz) indicates good mechanical sensitivity, which could be utilized for temperature sensing.\n\nB) This is the most challenging application and thus the correct answer. Quantum memory devices typically require long coherence times and the ability to reversibly transfer quantum states between light and matter. While the system does have co-localized optical and mechanical modes, the relatively low optical Q-factor (up to 4\u00d710\u2075) and the dispersive nature of the optomechanical coupling (rather than resonant) make it unsuitable for efficient quantum state transfer and storage.\n\nC) This could be implemented. The high mechanical quality factor and the ability to detect small displacements through optomechanical coupling make this system potentially suitable for accelerometry applications.\n\nD) This is feasible. The nanobeam is designed to work with 980 nm band photons, and the optomechanical coupling could be used to stabilize the laser frequency. The sideband-resolved regime (optical sidebands outside the cavity linewidth) is particularly advantageous for this application.\n\nThe question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (optical and mechanical properties, coupling mechanisms, temperature dependence) and apply them to real-world scenarios, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

There is a similar definition of the operator log_theta B, when the spectral cut is at a general angle theta. When B has spectral cuts at two angles theta < phi, one can define the sectorial projection Pi_{theta,phi}(B) whose range contains the generalized eigenspaces for eigenvalues with argument in ] theta, phi [; this is studied in the last part of the paper. The operator Pi_{theta,phi}(B) is shown to be proportional to the difference between log_theta B and log_phi B, having slightly better symbol properties than they have.

We consider a pursuit-evasion game [11] played between two agents, 'Blue' (the pursuer) and 'Red' (the evader), over $T$ time steps. Red aims to attack Blue's territory. Blue's objective is to intercept Red by time $T$ and thereby limit the success of Red's attack.

If the threshold energy \u039b is significantly larger than the Hubble scale H, and the decay rate of the dissipative effects decreases more slowly than H^3, what would be the expected impact on the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations?\n\nA) Increased power at all scales with superimposed high-frequency oscillations\nB) Decreased power at the largest scales with no significant oscillations\nC) Increased power at the largest scales with superimposed high-frequency oscillations\nD) No change in the power spectrum compared to standard inflationary models\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a real-world scenario in cosmology. The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that when \u039b is much larger than H, and the extra degrees of freedom are in their ground state, the standard spectrum is recovered as a baseline.\n\n2. However, the question specifies that the decay rate decreases more slowly than H^3. The documentation indicates that \"The modification is negative when the decay rate decreases slower than the cube of H,\" which means there is a loss of power on the largest scales.\n\n3. The documentation also explicitly states that \"high frequency superimposed oscillations are not generated\" for a large class of dissipative models.\n\n4. The leading modification is described as being linear in the decay rate evaluated at horizon exit, in an expansion of H/\u039b.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the documentation on both the direction of the power change and the presence of oscillations. Option C is incorrect for similar reasons, getting both the direction of power change and the presence of oscillations wrong. Option D is incorrect because it fails to account for the specified condition about the decay rate, which does lead to a modification of the spectrum.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a cosmological context, and critically think about the consequences of specific conditions on observable phenomena like the CMB power spectrum."}, "99": {"documentation": {"title": "Narratives in economics", "source": "Michael Roos and Matthias Reccius", "docs_id": "2109.02331", "section": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Narratives in economics. There is growing awareness within the economics profession of the important role narratives play in the economy. Even though empirical approaches that try to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no theory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about narratives in economics, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A team of economists is studying the impact of a new government policy on consumer behavior. They've collected a large dataset of social media posts, news articles, and economic indicators. Which approach would be most effective in identifying and analyzing the collective economic narratives surrounding this policy?\n\nA) Apply topic modeling to the dataset to identify key themes and track their prevalence over time\nB) Use sentiment analysis on social media posts to gauge public reaction to the policy\nC) Combine natural language processing techniques with contextual analysis to identify action-oriented stories that emerge and spread within social groups\nD) Conduct a keyword frequency analysis across all data sources to track changes in economic terminology usage\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concepts presented in the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer, C, aligns with the proposed definition of collective economic narratives outlined in the text. \n\nThe documentation emphasizes that a collective economic narrative must be a \"sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group.\" It also states that \"the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics.\"\n\nOption A (topic modeling) is a common approach but is criticized in the text as insufficient for capturing true narratives. It may identify themes but doesn't necessarily capture the action-oriented, socially emergent nature of narratives.\n\nOption B (sentiment analysis) might provide insight into public opinion but doesn't capture the full complexity of narratives as defined in the document.\n\nOption D (keyword frequency analysis) is too simplistic and wouldn't capture the story-like, action-suggesting nature of narratives.\n\nOption C combines NLP techniques with contextual analysis, which aligns with the document's suggestion for more comprehensive methods. It also specifically looks for action-oriented stories emerging in social groups, matching the given definition of collective economic narratives.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the concepts from the documentation to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple ideas and critical thinking about research methodologies in narrative economics."}}
