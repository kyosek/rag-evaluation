Here we identify key mechanisms through which noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for excitation transfer.

We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian.

In the era of a growing population, systemic change of the world, and rising risk of crises, humanity has been facing an unprecedented challenge of resource scarcity. Confronting and addressing the issues concerning the scarce resource's conservation, competition, and stimulation by grappling their characters and adopting viable policy instruments calls the decision-makers' attention to a paramount priority. In this paper, we develop the first general decentralized cross-sector supply chain network model that captures the unique features of the scarce resources under fiscal-monetary policies. We formulate the model as a network equilibrium problem with finite-dimensional variational inequality theories. We then characterize the network equilibrium with a set of classic theoretical properties, as well as some novel properties (with $\\lambda_{min}$) that are new to the literature of network games application.

While the traditional network-theoretic viewpoint is commonly restricted to their topological characteristics (often disregarding existing spatial constraints), this work takes a geometric perspective, which considers vertices and edges as objects in a metric space and quantifies the corresponding spatial distribution and alignment. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of edge anisotropy and define a class of measures characterizing the spatial directedness of connections. Specifically, we demonstrate that the local anisotropy of edges incident to a given vertex provides useful information about the local geometry of geophysical flows based on networks constructed from spatio-temporal data, which is complementary to topological characteristics of the same flow networks. Taken both structural and geometric viewpoints together can thus assist the identification of underlying flow structures from observations of scalar variables."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about edge anisotropy and flow networks, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A climate scientist is analyzing oceanic currents using a spatial network approach.
