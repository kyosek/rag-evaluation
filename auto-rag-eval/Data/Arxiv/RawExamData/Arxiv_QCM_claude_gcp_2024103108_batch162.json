With the advent of software-defined networking, network configuration through programmable interfaces becomes practical, leading to various on-demand opportunities for network routing update in multi-tenant datacenters, where tenants have diverse requirements on network routings such as short latency, low path inflation, large bandwidth, high reliability, etc. Conventional solutions that rely on topology search coupled with an objective function https:// www.overleaf.com/project/5beb742041ab9c0e3caec84f to find desired routings have at least two shortcomings: (i) they run into scalability issues when handling consistent and frequent routing updates and (ii) they restrict the flexibility and capability to satisfy various routing requirements. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel search and optimization decoupled design, which not only saves considerable topology search costs via search result reuse, but also avoids possible sub-optimality in greedy routing search algorithms by making decisions based on the global view of all possible routings.

Prior literature has argued that flood insurance maps may not capture the extent of flood risk. This paper performs a granular assessment of coastal flood risk in the mortgage market by using physical simulations of hurricane storm surge heights instead of using FEMA's flood insurance maps. Matching neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests that coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm surge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when using flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of originations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The share of agency mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in the flood insurance 100-year floodplain. Mortgages in storm surge areas are more likely to be complex: non-fully amortizing features such as interest-only or adjustable rates. Households may also be more vulnerable in storm surge areas: median household income is lower, the share of African Americans and Hispanics is substantially higher, the share of individuals with health coverage is lower.

The document states that heavy quarks provide \"a new dimension to QCD, allowing tests of fundamental theory, the nature of color confinement, and the production of new exotic multiquark states.\" It also mentions that heavy quarks can potentially explain several anomalous experimental results, such as the large tt forward-backward asymmetry observed at the Tevatron and the strong nuclear absorption of J/\u03c8 at the LHC.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it understates the importance of heavy quarks, which do offer new insights rather than just confirming existing theories. Option C is wrong because the text emphasizes the relevance of heavy quarks to high-energy phenomena, not just low-energy QCD.

Gaussian graphical models are recently used in economics to obtain networks of dependence among agents. A widely-used estimator is the Graphical Lasso (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the $L_{1,1}$ matrix norm on the precision matrix $\\Omega$. The $L_{1,1}$ norm is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in $\\Omega$. We propose a new estimator called Structured Graphical Lasso (SGLASSO) that uses the $L_{1,2}$ mixed norm. The use of the $L_{1,2}$ penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in $\\Omega$. We show that when the network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model.
