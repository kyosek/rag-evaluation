An adaptive variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE) approach is introduced that yields efficient representations of ground states for interacting Hamiltonians on near-term quantum computers.

The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather than working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is constrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands the ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a chosen threshold. This ensures the state is able to follow the quantum imaginary time evolution path in the system Hilbert space rather than in a restricted variational manifold set by a predefined fixed ansatz.

Genetic stability is a key factor in maintaining, survival and reproduction of biological cells. It relies on many processes, but one of the most important is a {\\it homologous recombination}, in which the repair of breaks in double-stranded DNA molecules is taking place with a help of several specific proteins. In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are active as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA. A critical step in the homologous recombination is a search for a corresponding homologous region on DNA, which is called a {\\it homology search}. Recent single-molecule experiments clarified some aspects of this process, but its molecular mechanisms remain not well understood. We developed a quantitative theoretical approach to analyze the homology search. It is based on a discrete-state stochastic model that takes into account the most relevant physical-chemical processes in the system. Using a method of first-passage processes, a full dynamic description of the homology search is presented. It is found that the search dynamics depends on the degree of extension of DNA molecules and on the size of RecA nucleoprotein filaments, in agreement with experimental single-molecule measurements of DNA pairing by RecA proteins.

The past decade has seen a dramatic increase of practical applications of the microwave gyrosynchrotron emission for plasma diagnostics and three-dimensional modeling of solar flares and other astrophysical objects.

However, the available fast codes are limited in that they could only be used for a factorized distribution over the energy and pitch-angle, while the distributions of electrons over energy or pitch-angle are limited to a number of predefined analytical functions. In realistic simulations, these assumptions do not hold; thus, the codes free from the mentioned limitations are called for. To remedy this situation, we extended our fast codes to work with an arbitrary input distribution function of radiating electrons. We accomplished this by implementing fast codes for a distribution function described by an arbitrary numerically-defined array. In addition, we removed several other limitations of the available fast codes and improved treatment of the free-free component. The Ultimate Fast Codes presented here allow for an arbitrary combination of the analytically and numerically defined distributions, which offers the most flexible use of the fast codes.

Droplets bouncing on a vibrated liquid bath open ways to methods of manipulating droplets, creating double emulsion and performing pilot wave model experiments.

To be under this favorable conditions, low viscous oil droplet are dropped over a highly viscous oil bath. These droplets bounce vertically on the surface of the bath and exhibit many periodic trajectories and resonant modes when tuning the forcing parameters, i.e. the oscillation of the bath. This complex dynamics emphasizes the interplay between elastic energy storage and energy dissipation in droplets at each bounce.
