In this paper we merge environmental, epidemiological and genetic data to reconstruct spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of FMDV serotypes A and O dispersal in South America. Our dating analysis suggests that serotype A emerged in South America around 1930, while serotype O emerged around 1990. The rate of evolution for serotype A was significantly higher compared to serotype O. Phylogeographic inference identified two well-connected sub networks of viral flow, one including Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador; another including Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The spread of serotype A was best described by geographic distances, while trade of live cattle was the predictor that best explained serotype O spread.

We propose a new window into training called Loss Change Allocation (LCA), in which credit for changes to the network loss is conservatively partitioned to the parameters. This measurement is accomplished by decomposing the components of an approximate path integral along the training trajectory using a Runge-Kutta integrator. This rich view shows which parameters are responsible for decreasing or increasing the loss during training, or which parameters \"help\" or \"hurt\" the network's learning, respectively.

Drought is a costly natural hazard, many aspects of which remain poorly understood. It has many contributory factors, driving its outset, duration, and severity, including land surface, anthropogenic activities, and, most importantly, meteorological anomalies. Prediction plays a crucial role in drought preparedness and risk mitigation. However, this is a challenging task at socio-economically critical lead times (1-2 years), because meteorological anomalies operate at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Among them, past studies have shown a correlation between the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly and the amount of precipitation in various locations in Africa.

Given the intrinsic shortcomings of correlation coefficients, we investigate the association among SST modes of variability and the monthly fraction of grid points in Ethiopia, which are in drought conditions in terms of causality. Using the empirical extreme quantiles of precipitation distribution as a proxy for drought, We show that the level of SST second mode of variability in the prior year influences the occurrence of drought in Ethiopia.

These standard siren events act as \"standard candles\" in gravitational wave astronomy, allowing for direct distance measurements without relying on the traditional cosmic distance ladder.\n\nThis capability is crucial for breaking parameter degeneracies in cosmological models, especially for dynamical dark energy models.

Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This paper addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgements these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets, to reflect equity choices, while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions.

A central model in theoretical ecology considers the competition of a range of species for a broad spectrum of resources. Recent studies have shown that essentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum, or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space. Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel, which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard competition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped species distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary mechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model. We analyze the origin of this sensitivity and discuss it in the context of recent applications of the model."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A team of ecologists is studying species distributions in a tropical rainforest.

This choice is justified by several factors from the documentation:\n\n1. The problem involves a complex robotic control task, which likely has uncertain and potentially varying rewards. The distributional stochastic MDP framework assumes that the distribution of the reward function is ambiguous, which aligns well with this scenario.\n\n2. The need for exploration in the task suggests that a framework encouraging diverse behavior would be beneficial. While an entropy-regularized MDP (option B) could provide this, the distributional stochastic MDP is more flexible and powerful.\n\n3. The documentation states that the distributional stochastic MDP is equivalent to the regularized MDP in terms of optimal policies. This means it can provide the benefits of regularization (like improved exploration) while also handling the ambiguity in the reward structure.\n\n4. This approach allows for a more nuanced modeling of the uncertainty in the environment, which is crucial for complex robotic tasks where the outcomes of actions may not be fully predictable.\n\n5. The framework's ability to handle ambiguous reward distributions makes it more robust to potential changes or misspecifications in the reward structure, which is common in real-world applications.\n\nOption A (standard MDP) is too simplistic for this complex task and doesn't account for the uncertainty in rewards. Option B (entropy-regularized MDP) is a step in the right direction but is shown to be subsumed by the more general regularized MDP, which the distributional stochastic MDP is equivalent to.
