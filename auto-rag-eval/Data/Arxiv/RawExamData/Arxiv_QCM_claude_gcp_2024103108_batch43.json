A novel conceptual framework is presented in this paper with an aim to standardize and virtualize Internet of Things(IoT) infrastructure through deploying OpenFlow technology.

Moreover it is capable to model placement of physical objects, manage the system and to collect information for services deployed on an IoT infrastructure. Our proposed IoT virtualization is applicable to a random topology scenario which makes it possible to 1) share flow sensors resources 2) establish multioperational sensor networks, and 3) extend reachability within the framework without establishing any further physical networks.
