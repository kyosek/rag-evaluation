In the scenario of the narrow escape problem (NEP) a particle diffuses in a finite container and eventually leaves it through a small \"escape window\" in the otherwise impermeable boundary, once it arrives to this window and over-passes an entropic barrier at the entrance to it. This generic problem is mathematically identical to that of a diffusion-mediated reaction with a partially-reactive site on the container's boundary. Considerable knowledge is available on the dependence of the mean first-reaction time (FRT) on the pertinent parameters. We here go a distinct step further and derive the full FRT distribution for the NEP. We demonstrate that typical FRTs may be orders of magnitude shorter than the mean one, thus resulting in a strong defocusing of characteristic temporal scales. We unveil the geometry-control of the typical times, emphasising the role of the initial distance to the target as a decisive parameter. A crucial finding is the further FRT defocusing due to the barrier, necessitating repeated escape or reaction attempts interspersed with bulk excursions. These results add new perspectives and offer a broad comprehension of various features of the by-now classical NEP that are relevant for numerous biological and technological systems."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary implication of the derived full distribution of first exit times in the narrow escape problem, and how does it relate to the mean first-reaction time (FRT) in diffusion-mediated reactions?\n\nA) The full distribution of first exit times implies that the mean FRT is directly proportional to the initial distance to the target.\nB) The full distribution of first exit times suggests that the mean FRT is significantly shorter than previously thought, leading to a strong defocusing of characteristic temporal scales.\nC) The full distribution of first exit times indicates that the mean FRT is independent of the geometry of the container and only depends on the diffusion coefficient.\nD) The full distribution of first exit times implies that the mean FRT is only affected by the presence of an entropic barrier at the entrance to the escape window.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) The full distribution of first exit times suggests that the mean FRT is significantly shorter than previously thought, leading to a strong defocusing of characteristic temporal scales.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) because the documentation states that \"typical FRTs may be orders of magnitude shorter than the mean one, thus resulting in a strong defocusing of characteristic temporal scales.\" This implies that the derived full distribution of first exit times reveals a significant difference between the typical FRT and the mean FRT, leading to a defocusing of temporal scales."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Length sensing and control of a Michelson interferometer with Power\n  Recycling and Twin Signal Recycling cavities", "source": "Christian Gr\\\"af, Andr\\'e Th\\\"uring, Henning Vahlbruch, Karsten\n  Danzmann and Roman Schnabel", "docs_id": "1211.7037", "section": ["physics.optics", "gr-qc", "quant-ph"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Length sensing and control of a Michelson interferometer with Power\n  Recycling and Twin Signal Recycling cavities.

Owing to the delayed feedback, simply separating the positive and negative data causes a sample selection bias. One solution is to assume that a long time window after first observing a sample reduces the sample selection bias.

The proposed approach differs from the demand-supply framework in that it is based on physical laws of vehicle movement, rather than economic principles.\n\n**Explanation:** The study's authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional curve-fitting methods, which can suffer from confounding/endogeneity bias due to omitted variables such as driving behavior and weather. The proposed causal approach uses a Bayesian non-parametric spline-based regression approach with instrumental variables to adjust for these biases.

The Sharpe ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the excess expected return of an investment to its standard deviation, has been widely cited in the financial literature by researchers and practitioners. However, very little attention has been paid to the statistical properties of the estimation of the ratio. Lo (2002) derived the $\\sqrt{n}$-normality of the ratio's estimation errors for returns which are iid or stationary with serial correlations, and pointed out that to make inference on the accuracy of the estimation, the serial correlation among the returns needs to be taken into account. In the present paper a class of time series models for returns is introduced to demonstrate that there exists a factor other than the serial correlation of the returns that dominates the asymptotic behavior of the Sharpe ratio statistics. The model under consideration is a linear process whose innovation sequence has summable coefficients and contains a latent volatility component which is long-memory.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in face recognition, which can be partially attributed to the availability of large-scale labeled face datasets.

While collecting labeled faces with larger variations could be helpful, it is practically infeasible due to privacy and labor cost. In comparison, it is easier to acquire a large number of unlabeled faces from different domains, which could be used to regularize the learning of face representations. We present an approach to use such unlabeled faces to learn generalizable face representations, where we assume neither the access to identity labels nor domain labels for unlabeled images.
