The model developed is approximately 10,000 times faster than common molecular simulations. We apply this model to a set of carbon structures with well-defined pore sizes and investigate the solvation effect by doing simulations with neat ionic liquids as well as acetonitrile-based electrolytes. We show that our model is able to predict quantities of adsorbed ions and capacitances in a range compatible with experimental values.

We experimentally demonstrate an all-optical input-agnostic polarization transformer (AI-APT), which transforms all input states of polarization to a particular state that can be polarized or partially polarized. The output state of polarization and intensity depends solely on setup parameters, and not on the input state, thereby the AI-APT functions differently from simple polarizers and polarization rotators. The AI-APT is completely passive, and thus can be used as a polarization controller or stabilizer for single photons and ultrafast pulses. To achieve this, we, for the first time, experimentally realize complete kinematic state controllability of an open single-qubit by Kraus maps put forth in [Wu et al. J. Phys. A 40, 5681 (2007)].

Unlike simple polarizers that output a fixed polarized state or change intensity based on input, and unlike polarization rotators that rotate the Stokes vector, the AI-APT transforms all input states of polarization to a particular state (polarized or partially polarized) that depends only on setup parameters, not on the input state.

This effect was described as \"more surprising\" in the text, indicating it was an unanticipated result of the research.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study actually found alterations in the phagocytic capacity of the cells, not necessarily an increase.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the study mentioned alterations in the ability to respond to bacterial stimuli, but did not specify enhancement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the inflammatory potential of amorphous silica nanoparticles was described as \"appreciable, although reversible,\" not irreversible."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Wind Power Providing Flexible Ramp Product", "source": "Runze Chen, Jianhui Wang, Audun Botterud, Hongbin Sun", "docs_id": "1601.02729", "section": ["math.OC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Wind Power Providing Flexible Ramp Product. The deepening penetration of renewables in power systems has contributed to the increasing needs for generation scheduling flexibility. Specifically, for short-term operations, flexibility here indicates that sufficient ramp capacities should be reserved to respond to the expected changes in the load and intermittent generation, also covering a certain amount of their uncertainty. To address the growing requirements for flexible ramp capacity, markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in California ISO and Midcontinent ISO. Some-times, to guarantee sufficient ramp capacity, expensive fast start units have to be committed in real-time. Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable generation, the flexibility provided by the conventional units might not be enough. Actually, wind power producers are physically capable of offering flexibility, which is sometimes also economically efficient to the entire system. In this paper, we aim to explore the mechanism and possibility of including wind power producers as ramp providers to increase the supply of flexibility. To conduct the anal-yses, a two-stage stochastic real-time unit commitment model considering ramp capacity adequacy is formulated.

The documentation states that wind power producers are physically capable of offering flexibility, which can sometimes be economically efficient for the entire system.

In this paper we aim to show that the concept of ensemble of trajectories can be applied to a variety of stochastic models of gene expression ranging from a simple birth-death process to a more sophisticate model containing burst and switch. By considering the protein numbers as a relevant dynamical observable, apart from asymptotic behavior of remote tails of probability distribution, generating function for the cumulants of this observable can also be obtained.

This paper further solves non-state variables, e.g. current injections and bus voltages, directly with a realistic DAE model of power grids. These non-state variables, nonlinearly coupled in network equations, are conventionally solved by numerical methods with time-consuming iterations, but their differential transformations are proved to satisfy formally linear equations in this paper.

One of the main challenges is to build TTS systems with low-resource constraints, particularly for the case of Shanghai dialect, of which about three hours data are available to participants. To overcome the constraint, we adopt an average-speaker modeling method. That is, we first employ external Mandarin data to train both End-to-end acoustic model and WaveNet vocoder, then we use Shanghai dialect to tune the acoustic model and WaveNet vocoder respectively. Apart from this, we have no Shanghai dialect lexicon despite syllable transcripts are provided for the training data. Since we are not sure if similar syllable transcripts are provided for the evaluation data during the training stage, we use Mandarin lexicon for Shanghai dialect instead.

Chiral topological semimetals are materials that break both inversion and mirror symmetries.

In this work, we report a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the linear and non-linear optical responses of the chiral topological semimetal RhSi, which is known to host multifold fermions. We show that the characteristic features of the optical conductivity, which display two distinct quasi-linear regimes above and below 0.4 eV, can be linked to excitations of different kinds of multifold fermions. The characteristic features of the CPGE, which displays a sign change at 0.4 eV and a large non-quantized response peak of around 160 $\\mu \\textrm{A V}^{-2}$ at 0.7 eV, are explained by assuming that the chemical potential crosses a flat hole band at the Brillouin zone center.
