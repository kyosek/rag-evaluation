In particular, describing wavefunction delocalisation requires a quantum treatment, which is difficult in disordered materials that lack periodicity.

The delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) approach described in the document combines aspects of quantum mechanics (through polaron-transformed Redfield theory) with kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. This novel combination allows for the modeling of partially delocalised charge transport in three-dimensional systems, which is particularly useful for materials with moderate disorder.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because dKMC is not limited to highly ordered materials and does not exclusively use quantum mechanical calculations.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the approach goes beyond traditional hopping conduction models, which are typically used for highly disordered materials. dKMC is designed to address the limitations of such models in moderately disordered systems.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because band conduction theory is typically applied to highly ordered materials, not those with intermediate disorder. The dKMC approach is specifically designed to bridge the gap between band conduction and hopping conduction models.\n\nThe significance of this approach lies in its ability to more accurately model charge transport in materials that fall between the extremes of high order and high disorder, such as many organic semiconductors. It reveals that even a small degree of delocalisation can substantially enhance mobilities in these materials, which standard kinetic Monte Carlo methods may underestimate."}, "12": {"documentation": {"title": "UV dust attenuation in spiral galaxies: the role of age-dependent\n  extinction and of the IMF", "source": "P.

This work considers the problem of computing the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of large tensors. Prior works mostly leverage data sparsity to handle this problem, which is not suitable for handling dense tensors that often arise in applications such as medical imaging, computer vision, and remote sensing. Stochastic optimization is known for its low memory cost and per-iteration complexity when handling dense data. However, exisiting stochastic CPD algorithms are not flexible enough to incorporate a variety of constraints/regularizations that are of interest in signal and data analytics. Convergence properties of many such algorithms are also unclear. In this work, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for large-scale CPD with constraints/regularizations. The framework works under a doubly randomized fashion, and can be regarded as a judicious combination of randomized block coordinate descent (BCD) and stochastic proximal gradient (SPG). The algorithm enjoys lightweight updates and small memory footprint.

It explicitly mentions that this model allows for the combination of correlation and volatility stress tests. This is directly relevant to assessing and managing risks in large portfolios, such as the one involved in the \"London Whale\" incident.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the model addresses non-perfectly correlated positions, not primarily perfectly correlated ones.

Quantum annealing is a generic solver for optimization problems that uses fictitious quantum fluctuation.

However, the connectivity between the artificial spins is sparse and limited on a special network known as the chimera graph.

Thus, it appears that pair hopping may have an important role in determining which out of a potentially large number of Mott phases (stabilized by details of the charge-diagonal interaction terms) actually survive the totality of quantum fluctuations present."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given text:\n\nQuestion: In a study of strongly interacting hard-core bosons on a square lattice with pair-hopping processes, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the effects of pair hopping on Mott phases?\n\nA) Pair hopping uniformly destabilizes all Mott phases regardless of filling fraction.\n\nB) Pair hopping has no significant effect on Mott phases at any filling fraction.\n\nC) Pair hopping selectively affects Mott phases at different filling fractions, melting them at distinct critical pair-hopping amplitudes.\n\nD) Pair hopping exclusively stabilizes Mott phases, making them more robust against quantum fluctuations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The text explicitly states that \"pair hopping has different effects on Mott phases at different filling fractions, 'melting' them at different critical pair-hopping amplitudes.\" This indicates that the effect of pair hopping is not uniform across all Mott phases, but rather depends on the specific filling fraction. This selective effect suggests that pair hopping plays a crucial role in determining which Mott phases persist in the presence of quantum fluctuations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a uniform effect on all Mott phases, which contradicts the text's description of different effects at different filling fractions. Option B is wrong because the text clearly indicates that pair hopping does have significant effects on Mott phases. Option D is incorrect because the text describes pair hopping as \"melting\" Mott phases rather than exclusively stabilizing them."}, "55": {"documentation": {"title": "Engineering and Manipulating Exciton Wave Packets", "source": "Xiaoning Zang, Simone Montangero, Lincoln D.

We show that properly designed laser pulses can be used to create such excitonic wave packets.

Their coherence also provides a handle for manipulation using active, external controls.

A Section Pursuit Index for Finding Hidden Structure in\n  Multiple Dimensions. Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for problems when data distributions depart from uniform or normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by complex inequality conditions from multiple parameter model.

In this paper we present methods for QL estimation and a control algorithm that adjusts maximum green times in actuated signals at each cycle based on QLs.

The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408 sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam.
