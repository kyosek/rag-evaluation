Fast and accurate unveiling of power line outages is of paramount importance not only for preventing faults that may lead to blackouts, but also for routine monitoring and control tasks of the smart grid, including state estimation and optimal power flow. Existing approaches are either challenged by the \\emph{combinatorial complexity} issues involved, and are thus limited to identifying single- and double-line outages; or, they invoke less pragmatic assumptions such as \\emph{conditionally independent} phasor angle measurements available across the grid. Using only a subset of voltage phasor angle data, the present paper develops a near real-time algorithm for identifying multiple line outages at the affordable complexity of solving a quadratic program via block coordinate descent iterations. The novel approach relies on reformulating the DC linear power flow model as a \\emph{sparse} overcomplete expansion, and leveraging contemporary advances in compressive sampling and variable selection using the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Analysis and simulated tests on the standard IEEE 118-bus system confirm the effectiveness of lassoing line changes in the smart power grid."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the novel approach presented in the paper for identifying multiple line outages in the smart power grid?\n\nA) It uses conditionally independent phasor angle measurements from across the entire grid to solve a linear programming problem.\n\nB) It reformulates the DC linear power flow model as a sparse overcomplete expansion and uses the Lasso technique to solve a quadratic program via block coordinate descent iterations.\n\nC) It employs a combinatorial algorithm capable of identifying only single- and double-line outages with high accuracy.\n\nD) It utilizes a dense matrix representation of the power grid and applies a neural network to predict outages in real-time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

While traditional approaches typically study relationships between two entire time series, many interesting relationships in real-world applications exist in small sub-intervals of time while remaining absent or feeble during other sub-intervals.

The Toeplitz structure representative of stationary models is a particular case for the class of structures we consider.

Existing emissions trading system (ETS) designs inhibit emissions but do not constrain warming to any fxed level, preventing certainty of the global path of warming. Instead, they have the indirect objective of reducing emissions. They provide poor future price information. And they have high transaction costs for implementation, requiring treaties and laws. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel double-sided auction mechanism of emissions permits and sequestration contracts tied to temperature. This mechanism constrains warming for many (e.g., 150) years into the future and every auction would provide price information for this time range. In addition, this paper proposes a set of market rules and a bottom-up implementation path. A coalition of businesses begin implementation with jurisdictions joining as they are ready. The combination of the selected market rules and the proposed implementation path appear to incentivize participation. This design appears to be closer to \"first best\" with a lower cost of mitigation than any in the literature, while increasing the certainty of avoiding catastrophic warming. This design should also have a faster pathway to implementation. A numerical simulation shows surprising results, e.g., that static prices are wrong, prices should evolve over time in a way that contradicts other recent proposals, and \"global warming potential\" as used in existing ETSs are generally erroneous."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key advantages of the proposed double-sided auction mechanism for emissions permits and sequestration contracts, as compared to existing Emissions Trading Systems (ETS)?\n\nA) It provides better future price information and has lower transaction costs for implementation.\n\nB) It constrains warming to a fixed level for a long-term period and offers price information for that entire timeframe.\n\nC) It requires international treaties and laws for implementation and uses accurate global warming potential metrics.\n\nD) It incentivizes emissions reduction through an indirect approach and maintains static prices over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the proposed mechanism constrains warming for many years (e.g., 150 years) into the future and provides price information for this entire time range at every auction. This addresses two key shortcomings of existing ETS designs mentioned in the text: the inability to constrain warming to a fixed level and poor future price information.\n\nAnswer A is partially correct but incomplete. While the proposed system does provide better future price information, the text doesn't explicitly state that it has lower transaction costs. In fact, it mentions a \"bottom-up implementation path\" which might still involve significant costs.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect. The proposed system actually aims to avoid the need for treaties and laws, suggesting a bottom-up implementation path instead. Additionally, the text indicates that \"global warming potential\" metrics used in existing ETSs are generally erroneous.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect on both counts. The proposed system directly constrains warming rather than indirectly incentivizing emissions reduction. Moreover, the numerical simulation shows that static prices are wrong, and prices should evolve over time."}, "52": {"documentation": {"title": "Dense CO in Mrk 71-A: Superwind Suppressed in a Young Super Star Cluster", "source": "M.

We report the detection of CO(J=2-1) coincident with the super star cluster (SSC) Mrk 71-A in the nearby Green Pea analog galaxy, NGC 2366. Our NOEMA observations reveal a compact, ~7 pc, molecular cloud whose mass (10^5 M_sun) is similar to that of the SSC, consistent with a high star-formation efficiency, on the order of 0.5. There are two, spatially distinct components separated by 11 km/s. If expanding, these could be due to momentum-driven, stellar wind feedback. Alternatively, we may be seeing the remnant infalling, colliding clouds responsible for triggering the SSC formation. The kinematics are also consistent with a virialized system. These extreme, high-density, star-forming conditions inhibit energy-driven feedback; the co-spatial existence of a massive, molecular cloud with the SSC supports this scenario, and we quantitatively confirm that any wind-driven feedback in Mrk 71-A is momentum-driven, rather than energy-driven. Since Mrk 71-A is a candidate Lyman continuum emitter, this implies that energy-driven superwinds may not be a necessary condition for the escape of ionizing radiation.

The authors quantitatively confirm that any wind-driven feedback in Mrk 71-A is momentum-driven, rather than energy-driven.
