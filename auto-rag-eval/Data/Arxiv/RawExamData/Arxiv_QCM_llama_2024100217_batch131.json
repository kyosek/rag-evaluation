The NONLOCAL Bonn-B potential predicts 8.0 MeV binding energy for the triton (in a charge-dependent 34-channel Faddeev calculation) which is about 0.4 MeV more than the predictions by LOCAL NN potentials. We pin down origin and size of the nonlocality in the Bonn potential, in analytic and numeric form. The nonlocality is due to the use of the correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of one-boson-exchange avoiding the commonly used on-shell approximations which yield the local potentials. We also illustrate how this off-shell behavior leads to more binding energy. We emphasize that the increased binding energy is not due to on-shell differences (differences in the fit of the NN data or phase shifts). In particular, the Bonn-B potential reproduces accurately the $\\epsilon_1$ mixing parameter up to 350 MeV as determined in the recent Nijmegen multi-energy NN phase-shift analysis. Adding the relativistic effect from the relativistic nucleon propagators in the Faddeev equations, brings the Bonn-B result up to 8.2 MeV triton binding. This leaves a difference of only 0.3 MeV to experiment, which may possibly be explained by refinements in the treatment of relativity and the inclusion of other nonlocalities (e.~g., quark-gluon exchange at short range). Thus, it is conceivable that a realistic NN potential which describes the NN data up to 300 MeV correctly may explain the triton binding energy without recourse to 3-N forces; relativity would play a major role for this result."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nWhat is the primary reason for the increased binding energy predicted by the NONLOCAL Bonn-B potential compared to LOCAL NN potentials, according to the study on Off-Shell NN Potential and Triton Binding Energy?\n\nA) The use of a different set of NN data\nB) The inclusion of 3-N forces in the Faddeev equations\nC) The correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of one-boson-exchange, which avoids on-shell approximations commonly used in local potentials\nD) The treatment of relativistic effects in the Faddeev equations\n\nCorrect Answer: C) The correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of one-boson-exchange, which avoids on-shell approximations commonly used in local potentials\n\nExplanation: The study highlights that the NONLOCAL Bonn-B potential uses the correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of one-boson-exchange, which avoids the commonly used on-shell approximations in local potentials.

Understanding the relationship between symmetry breaking, system properties, and instabilities has been a problem of longstanding scientific interest. Symmetry-breaking instabilities underlie the formation of important patterns in driven systems, but there are many instances in which such instabilities are undesirable. Using parametric resonance as a model process, here we show that a range of states that would be destabilized by symmetry-breaking instabilities can be preserved and stabilized by the introduction of suitable system asymmetry. Because symmetric states are spatially homogeneous and asymmetric systems are spatially heterogeneous, we refer to this effect as heterogeneity-stabilized homogeneity. We illustrate this effect theoretically using driven pendulum array models and demonstrate it experimentally using Faraday wave instabilities. Our results have potential implications for the mitigation of instabilities in engineered systems and the emergence of homogeneous states in natural systems with inherent heterogeneities."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary mechanism by which heterogeneity-stabilized homogeneity is achieved in driven media, and how does it relate to the concept of symmetry-breaking instabilities?\n\nA) Parametric resonance introduces spatial heterogeneity, which stabilizes symmetric states by suppressing symmetry-breaking instabilities.\nB) System asymmetry creates spatial heterogeneity, which preserves symmetric states by mitigating symmetry-breaking instabilities.\nC) Heterogeneity-stabilized homogeneity is achieved through the introduction of external perturbations, which disrupt symmetry-breaking instabilities and preserve symmetric states.\nD) Parametric resonance introduces spatial heterogeneity, which destabilizes symmetric states by amplifying symmetry-breaking instabilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B) System asymmetry creates spatial heterogeneity, which preserves symmetric states by mitigating symmetry-breaking instabilities.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) System asymmetry creates spatial heterogeneity, which preserves symmetric states by mitigating symmetry-breaking instabilities.

Systems with long-range persistence and memory are shown to exhibit different precursory as well as recovery patterns in response to shocks of exogeneous versus endogeneous origins. By endogeneous, we envision either fluctuations resulting from an underlying chaotic dynamics or from a stochastic forcing origin which may be external or be an effective coarse-grained description of the microscopic fluctuations. In this scenario, endogeneous shocks result from a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts survive longer than the large shocks themselves. As a consequence, the recovery after an endogeneous shock is in general slower at early times and can be at long times either slower or faster than after an exogeneous perturbation.

This unification takes place at the scale M= O(1-2 TeV) and gives the correct value of sin^2 theta_W(M_Z^2) without the violation of the upper bound on the K_L -> mu e rate and the limits on FCNC processes.

Inspired by the recent measurements of the CMS collaboration, we report a QCD study of dijet production in proton+lead collisions at the LHC involving large-transverse-momentum jets, $p_T \\gtrsim 100$ GeV. Examining the inherent uncertainties of the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and their sensitivity to the free proton parton distributions (PDFs), we observe a rather small, typically much less than 5% clearance for the shape of the dijet rapidity distribution within approximately 1.5 units around the midrapidity. Even a more stable observable is the ratio between the yields in the positive and negative dijet rapidity, for which the baseline uncertainty can be made negligible by imposing a symmetric jet rapidity acceptance. Both observables prove sensitive to the nuclear modifications of the gluon distributions, the corresponding uncertainties clearly exceeding the estimated baseline uncertainties from the free-proton PDFs and scale dependence.

Our goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV's trajectory in the three-dimensional (3D) space to maximize the average achievable secrecy rate of the secondary system.
