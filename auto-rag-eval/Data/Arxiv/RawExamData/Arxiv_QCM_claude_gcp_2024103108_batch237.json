Solar neutrino detection is known to be a very challenging task, due to the minuscule absorption cross-section and mass of the neutrino. One research showed that relative large solar-flares affected the decay-rates of Mn-54 in December 2006. Since most the radiation emitted during a solar flare are blocked before reaching the earth surface, it should be assumed that such decay-rate changes could be due to neutrino flux increase from the sun, in which only neutrinos can penetrate the radionuclide. This study employs the Rn-222 radioactive source for the task of solar flare detection, based on the prediction that it will provide a stable gamma ray counting rate. In order to ascertain counting stability, three counting systems were constructed to track the count-rate changes. The signal processing approach was applied in the raw data analysis. The Rn-222 count-rate measurements showed several radiation counting dips, indicating that the radioactive nuclide can be affected by order of magnitude neutrino flux change from the sun. We conclude that using the cooled Radon source obtained the clearest responses, and therefore this is the preferable system for detecting neutrino emissions from a controlled source."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the study using Rn-222 as a radioactive source for solar flare detection, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The study conclusively proves that solar flares directly affect the decay rates of Rn-222.\n\nB) The research demonstrates that Rn-222 provides an unstable gamma ray counting rate, making it ideal for solar flare detection.\n\nC) The study suggests that neutrino flux changes from solar flares might influence the decay rates of certain radioactive isotopes, including Rn-222.\n\nD) The cooled Radon source showed no significant response to potential neutrino flux changes, indicating its unsuitability for solar flare detection.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

A lattice model of critical dense polymers is solved exactly for finite strips. The model is the first member of the principal series of the recently introduced logarithmic minimal models.
