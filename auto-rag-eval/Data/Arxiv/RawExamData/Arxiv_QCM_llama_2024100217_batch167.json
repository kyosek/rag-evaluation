The influence of pairing correlations on the neutron root mean square (rms) radius of nuclei is investigated in the framework of self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations. The continuum is treated appropriately by the Green's function techniques. As an example the nucleus $^{124}$Zr is treated for a varying strength of pairing correlations. We find that, as the pairing strength increases, the neutron rms radius first shrinks, reaches a minimum and beyond this point it expands again. The shrinkage is due to the the so-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the asymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing. However, in some cases, increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the nucleus due to a growing occupation of so-called `halo' orbits, i.e. weakly bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-$\\ell $ values. In this case, the neutron radii are extended just by the influence of pairing correlations, since these `halo' orbits cannot be occupied without pairing.

These new data points cover the uncharted redshift range $4\\leq z\\leq 10$ and encompass scales beyond those probed by Cosmic-Microwave-Background and large-scale-structure observations. This work establishes the UV LF as a powerful tool to probe the nature of DM in a different regime than other cosmological and astrophysical data sets."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The authors of the paper \"New Roads to the Small-Scale Universe: Measurements of the Clustering of Matter with the High-Redshift UV Galaxy Luminosity Function\" aim to study the clustering properties of dark matter (DM) at small scales. What is the primary advantage of using high-redshift UV galaxy luminosity-function (UV LF) data to probe the nature of DM, and how does this approach differ from other cosmological and astrophysical data sets?\n\nA) The UV LF data provides a more precise measurement of the matter power spectrum at small scales, allowing for a more detailed understanding of DM clustering.\nB) The UV LF data offers a unique window into the early universe, enabling the study of DM clustering in a regime inaccessible to other observations.\nC) The UV LF data provides a more robust estimate of the matter power spectrum, as it is less affected by astrophysical uncertainties.\nD) The UV LF data allows for a more direct comparison of DM clustering properties with those of other cosmological and astrophysical data sets.\n\n**Correct Answer:** B) The UV LF data offers a unique window into the early universe, enabling the study of DM clustering in a regime inaccessible to other observations.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer highlights the primary advantage of using UV LF data to probe DM clustering at small scales. The authors of the paper note that the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionisation present a promising avenue for understanding the role of DM in the universe, and that the first galaxies that populated these eras resided in DM halos that were much less massive than their counterparts today. By using UV LF data, the authors can study DM clustering in this regime, which is inaccessible to other observations. This approach provides a unique window into the early universe, allowing for a more detailed understanding of DM clustering properties."}}
