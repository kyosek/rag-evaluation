Structural econometric methods are often criticized for being sensitive to functional form assumptions.

Our leading example is Heckman's (1979) two-step (\"Heckit\") control function estimator which, with two-sided non-compliance, can be used to compute estimates of a variety of causal parameters. Equivalence with IV is established for a semi-parametric family of control function estimators and shown to hold at interior solutions for a class of maximum likelihood estimators. Our results suggest differences between structural and IV estimates often stem from disagreements about the target parameter rather than from functional form assumptions per se.

This means that the algebraic equivalence only holds when the control function is estimated at interior values, not at boundary values.

The umbrae are selected using an automated thresholding technique. Measured umbral intensities are first corrected for a confirming observation of umbral limb-darkening. Log-normal fits to the observed size distribution confirm that the size spectrum shape does not vary with time. The intensity-magnetic flux relationship is found to be steady over the solar cycle. The dependence of umbral size on the magnetic flux and minimum intensity are also independent of cycle phase and give linear and quadratic relations, respectively. While the large sample size does show a low amplitude oscillation in the mean minimum intensity and maximum magnetic flux correlated with the solar cycle, this can be explained in terms of variations in the mean umbral size. These size variations, however, are small and do not substantiate a meaningful change in the size spectrum of the umbrae generated by the Sun.

We propose a novel attention mechanism that exploits visual attentions in the past to resolve the current reference in the visual dialog scenario.

It is generally believed that when Cooper pairing occurs between two different species of fermions, their Fermi surfaces become locked together so that the resultant state remains 'neutral', with equal number densities of the two species, even when subjected to a chemical potential that couples to the difference in number densities. This belief is based on mean-field calculations in models with a zero-range interaction, where the anomalous self-energy is independent of energy and momentum. Following up on an early report of a deviation from neutrality in a Dyson-Schwinger calculation of color-flavor-locked quark matter, we investigate the neutrality of a two-species condensate using a Yukawa model which has a finite-range interaction. In a mean field calculation we obtain the full energy-momentum dependence of the self energy and find that the energy dependence leads to a population imbalance in the Cooper-paired phase when it is stressed by a species-dependent chemical potential.

The varying strengths of the interspecies interaction lead to four distinct regimes of collisions, ranging from totally elastic collisions (highly attractive interactions) to mutual destruction (highly repulsive interactions).

Conventional systems for motion context detection rely on batteries to provide the energy required for sampling a motion sensor. Batteries, however, have limited capacity and, once depleted, have to be replaced or recharged. Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH) allows to convert ambient motion and vibration into usable electricity and can enable batteryless, maintenance free operation of motion sensors. The signal from a KEH transducer correlates with the underlying motion and may thus directly be used for context detection, saving space, cost and energy by omitting the accelerometer. Previous work uses the open circuit or the capacitor voltage for sensing without using the harvested energy to power a load. In this paper, we propose to use other sensing points in the KEH circuit that offer information rich sensing signals while the energy from the harvester is used to power a load. We systematically analyse multiple sensing signals available in different KEH architectures and compare their performance in a transport mode detection case study. To this end, we develop four hardware prototypes, conduct an extensive measurement campaign and use the data to train and evaluate different classifiers.

According to the GEMINI event generator, for hot nuclei of intermediate mass, only deuterons and tritons could fill these conditions. This temperature can allow to trace back to the initial temperature by using an appropriate method. This determination may be better than 15 %.

This practice is known--in fact, obvious--and accepted in ML research. However, similar attention is not paid to the normative assumptions that ground this work. I argue such assumptions are equally as important, especially in areas of ML with clear social impact, such as fairness. This is because, similar to how mathematical assumptions constrain applicability, normative assumptions also limit algorithm applicability to certain problem domains.

Computing expected predictions of discriminative models is a fundamental task in machine learning that appears in many interesting applications such as fairness, handling missing values, and data analysis. Unfortunately, computing expectations of a discriminative model with respect to a probability distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such as logistic regression and a naive Bayes distribution. In this paper, we identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations, as well as moments of any order, of the latter with respect to the former in case of regression. Specifically, we consider expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that support tractable probabilistic inference. Moreover, we exploit the tractable computation of high-order moments to derive an algorithm to approximate the expectations for classification scenarios in which exact computations are intractable. Our framework to compute expected predictions allows for handling of missing data during prediction time in a principled and accurate way and enables reasoning about the behavior of discriminative models.
