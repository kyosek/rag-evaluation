Since cadiovascular disease (CVD) posts a heavy threat to people's health, long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is of great value for the improvement of treatment. To realize remote long-term ECG monitoring, a low-power wireless wearable ECG monitoring device is proposed in this paper. The ECG monitoring device, abbreviated as ECGM, is designed based on ferroelectric microprocessor which provides ultra-low power consumption and contains four parts-MCU, BLE, Sensors and Power. The MCU part means circuit of MSP430FR2433, the core of ECGM. The BLE part is the CC2640R2F module applied for wireless transmission of the collected bio-signal data. And the sensors part includes several sensors like BMD101 used for monitoring bio-signals and motion of the wearer, while the Power part consists of battery circuit, charging circuit and 3.3V/1.8V/4.4V power supply circuit. The ECGM first collects ECG signals from the fabric electrodes adhered to wearers' chest, preprocesses the signals to eliminate the injected noise, and then transmit the output data to wearers' hand-held mobile phones through Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The wearers are enabled to acquire ECGs and other physiological parameters on their phones as well as some corresponding suggestions.

This paper presents an evaluation of four methods based on the Dialectics: the Objective Dialectical Classifier and the Dialectical Optimization Method adapted to build a version of k-means with optimal quality indices; each of them is presented in two versions: a canonical version and another version obtained by applying the Principle of Maximum Entropy. These methods were compared to k-means, fuzzy c-means and Kohonen's self-organizing maps. The results showed that the methods based on Dialectics are robust to noise, and quantization can achieve results as good as those obtained with the Kohonen map, considered an optimal quantizer."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the Dialectical Method and unsupervised classification of multispectral images, as presented in the paper?\n\nA) The Dialectical Method is used to replace traditional algorithms like k-means and fuzzy c-means entirely in unsupervised classification tasks.\n\nB) Methods based on the Dialectical approach show superior performance in all aspects compared to traditional algorithms and Kohonen's self-organizing maps.\n\nC) The Dialectical Method-inspired approaches demonstrate robustness to noise and can achieve quantization results comparable to Kohonen's self-organizing maps.\n\nD) The Dialectical Method is primarily used to optimize the fuzzy c-means algorithm for multispectral image classification.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation states that \"the methods based on Dialectics are robust to noise, and quantization can achieve results as good as those obtained with the Kohonen map, considered an optimal quantizer.\" This directly supports the statement in option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the paper does not suggest that Dialectical Methods replace traditional algorithms entirely, but rather that they are used alongside them.\n\nOption B is too strong a claim. While the Dialectical methods show good performance, the paper does not state that they are superior in all aspects to traditional algorithms and Kohonen's maps.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the paper doesn't specifically mention using the Dialectical Method to optimize fuzzy c-means.

The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks. Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the applicability to broad kinds of images since different images favor different features captured by using different explicit regularizations. As such, this paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. At the core of our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization with a neural network, and we call the proposed model \\textit{AIR-Net}. Theoretically, we show that the adaptive regularization of AIR-Net enhances the implicit regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR-Net's effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR-Net is particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are non-uniform.
