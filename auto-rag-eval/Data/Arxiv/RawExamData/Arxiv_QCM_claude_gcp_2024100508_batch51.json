This motivates us to investigate how the speech synthesis network learns the pronunciation from datasets from different languages. In this study, we are interested in analyzing and taking advantage of multilingual speech synthesis network. First, we train the speech synthesis network bilingually in English and Korean and analyze how the network learns the relations of phoneme pronunciation between the languages.

Recurrent neural networks have achieved excellent performance in many applications. However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy.

In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied. We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models.

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery.

Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics.

Feedback dynamic routing is a commonly used control strategy in transportation systems. This class of control strategies relies on real-time information about the traffic state in each link. However, such information may not always be observable due to temporary sensing faults. In this article, we consider dynamic routing over two parallel routes, where the sensing on each link is subject to recurrent and random faults. The faults occur and clear according to a finite-state Markov chain. When the sensing is faulty on a link, the traffic state on that link appears to be zero to the controller. Building on the theories of Markov processes and monotone dynamical systems, we derive lower and upper bounds for the resilience score, i.e. the guaranteed throughput of the network, in the face of sensing faults by establishing stability conditions for the network. We use these results to study how a variety of key parameters affect the resilience score of the network. The main conclusions are: (i) Sensing faults can reduce throughput and destabilize a nominally stable network; (ii) A higher failure rate does not necessarily reduce throughput, and there may exist a worst rate that minimizes throughput; (iii) Higher correlation between the failure probabilities of two links leads to greater throughput; (iv) A large difference in capacity between two links can result in a drop in throughput."}, "answer": "Question: In a dynamic routing system with two parallel routes subject to recurrent and random sensing faults, which of the following statements is NOT a conclusion drawn from the study described in the documentation?\n\nA) Sensing faults can destabilize a network that would otherwise be stable under normal conditions.\n\nB) The relationship between failure rate and throughput is not always linear; there may be a specific failure rate that results in minimum throughput.\n\nC) When the failure probabilities of two links are more correlated, it generally results in lower overall throughput for the network.\n\nD) A significant disparity in capacity between the two parallel routes can lead to a reduction in the network's throughput.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it contradicts the information provided in the documentation.

Liquidation is the process of selling a large number of shares of one stock sequentially within a given time frame, taking into consideration the costs arising from market impact and a trader's risk aversion.

In this paper, we propose to use multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model, which better captures high-level complexities comparing to various machine learning methods, such that agents can learn how to make the best selling decisions. First, we theoretically analyze the Almgren and Chriss model and extend its fundamental mechanism so it can be used as the multi-agent trading environment. Our work builds the foundation for future multi-agent environment trading analysis. Secondly, we analyze the cooperative and competitive behaviours between agents by adjusting the reward functions for each agent, which overcomes the limitation of single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.
