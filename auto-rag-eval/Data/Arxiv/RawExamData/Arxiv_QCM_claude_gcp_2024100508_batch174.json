Aids starts, like most diseases, in a peak of virus expression (2,3), which is practically wiped out by the immune system. However it then remains in the body at a low level of expression until later (some time years later) when there is an outbreak of the disease which terminally cripples the immune system causing death from various common pathogens. In this paper we show, using a microscopic simulation, that the time course of AIDS is determined by the interactions of the virus and the immune cells in the shape space of antigens and that it is the virus's ability to move more rapidly in this space (it's high mutability) that causes the time course and eventual 'victory' of the disease.

Additionally, the technique allows for data acquisition from only -50 to +50 degrees instead of the full -90 to +90 degrees, resulting in a 44% reduction in radiation dosage. This addresses both the resolution limitations and the sample damage problem that has long plagued electron tomography.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it mentions nanometers instead of angstroms, which is a significant difference in scale and resolution.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the technique does not allow for full 360-degree tilt series acquisition.

The design of cooperative adaptive cruise control is critical in mixed traffic flow, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to handle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state deviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model predictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs' trajectories to mitigate the deviation at each time step. However, as the replan process is usually conducted by solving an optimization problem with information through inter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and communicational burdens. To address this limitation, a robust platoon control framework is proposed based on tube MPC in this paper. The prediction uncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted inside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or additional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered to plan a ``tube'' (a sequence of the set), which can bound CAVs' actual trajectories.

Precise gap structure in LiFeAs (Tc = 18 K) given by ARPES studies offers us significant information to understand the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors. The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs gap structure would be that \"the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z point\".

In this paper, we study the gap structure in LiFeAs by taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, motivated by the recent ARPES studies that revealed the significant SOI-induced modification of the Fermi surface topology. For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models with finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES groups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with finite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin fluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main characteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in the presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy) orbitals.

Detecting tiny objects in a high-resolution video is challenging because the visual information is little and unreliable. Specifically, the challenge includes very low resolution of the objects, MPEG artifacts due to compression and a large searching area with many hard negatives. Tracking is equally difficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion estimation. Luckily, we found that by combining this two challenging tasks together, there will be mutual benefits. Following the idea, in this paper, we present a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network, where detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame representation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The framework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning informative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation is shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds and unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent improvements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and existing motion-based detectors.

In this emerging field of nonlinear topological physics, a recent experiment revealed the quantized motion of localized nonlinear excitations (solitons) upon driving a Thouless pump sequence; the reported observations suggest that the quantized displacement of solitons is dictated by the Chern number of the band from which they emanate.
