The cumulative emission of Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) from all past core-collapse supernovae (SNe) would lead to a diffuse flux with energies ${\\mathcal O}(50)$ MeV.

The key innovation of the Targeted Random Projection (TARP) approach is that it combines aspects of both screening algorithms and random projections.

The Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) method has been used to observe and characterize a variety of protein-DNA interactions including DNA looping and transcription.

In these experiments, a change in the extent of the bead's random motion is used as a reporter of the underlying macromolecular dynamics and is often deemed sufficient for TPM analysis.
