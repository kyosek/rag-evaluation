The Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy is a Hamiltonian infinite-dimensional integrable system associated to a semi-simple cohomological field theory or, alternatively, to a semi-simple Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. Under an extra assumption of homogeneity, Dubrovin and Zhang conjectured that there exists a second Poisson bracket that endows their hierarchy with a bi-Hamiltonian structure. More precisely, they gave a construction for the second bracket, but the polynomiality of its coefficients in the dispersion parameter expansion is yet to be proved. In this paper we use the bi-Hamiltonian recursion and a set of relations in the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves derived by Liu and Pandharipande in order to analyze the second Poisson bracket of Dubrovin and Zhang. We give a new proof of a theorem of Dubrovin and Zhang that the coefficients of the dispersion parameter expansion of the second bracket are rational functions with prescribed singularities.

The Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) is a highly nonlinear oscillator with rich dynamical behavior, including chaos. When driven by a time-periodic magnetic flux, the SQUID exhibits extreme multistability at frequencies around the geometric resonance which is manifested by a \"snake-like\" form of the resonance curve. Repeating motifs of SQUIDs form metamaterials, i. e. artificially structured media of weakly coupled discrete elements that exhibit extraordinary properties, e. g. negative diamagnetic permeability. We report on the emergent collective dynamics in two-dimensional lattices of coupled SQUID oscillators, which involves a rich menagerie of spatio-temporal dynamics, including Turing-like patterns and chimera states. Using Fourier analysis we characterize these patterns and identify characteristic spatial and temporal periods. In the low coupling limit, the Turing-like patterns occur near the synchronization-desynchronization transition which can be related to the bifurcation scenarios of the single SQUID. Chimeras emerge due to the multistability near the geometric resonance, and by varying the dc component of the external force we can make them appear and reappear and, also, control their location. A detailed analysis of the parameter space reveals the coexistence of Turing-like patterns and chimera states in our model, as well as the ability to transform between these states by varying the system parameters."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Arxiv documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a 2D SQUID metamaterial, which of the following combinations of phenomena and their underlying causes is most accurate?\n\nA) Turing-like patterns emerge due to multistability near the geometric resonance, while chimera states occur near the synchronization-desynchronization transition.\n\nB) Both Turing-like patterns and chimera states are primarily caused by the extreme multistability at frequencies around the geometric resonance.\n\nC) Turing-like patterns occur near the synchronization-desynchronization transition related to single SQUID bifurcation scenarios, while chimera states emerge due to multistability near the geometric resonance.\n\nD) Chimera states are caused by the \"snake-like\" form of the resonance curve, while Turing-like patterns result from the negative diamagnetic permeability of the metamaterial.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately describes the causes of both Turing-like patterns and chimera states as presented in the documentation. Turing-like patterns occur near the synchronization-desynchronization transition, which can be related to the bifurcation scenarios of a single SQUID. Chimera states, on the other hand, emerge due to the multistability near the geometric resonance.

We propose a high-speed and accurate hybrid dynamic density functional theory for the computer simulations of the phase separation processes of polymer melts and blends.

On the other hand, the GRPA theory has an advantage of much smaller amount of required computational cost than the SCF theory while its applicability is limited to the weak segregation region. To make the accuracy of the SCF theory and the high-performance of the GRPA theory compatible, we adjust the chemical potential of the GRPA theory by using the SCF theory every constant time steps in the dynamic simulations. The performance of the GRPA and the hybrid theories is tested by using several systems composed of an A/B homopolymer, an AB diblock copolymer, or an ABC triblock copolymer.

Multi-agent formation as well as obstacle avoidance is one of the most actively studied topics in the field of multi-agent systems. Although some classic controllers like model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy control achieve a certain measure of success, most of them require precise global information which is not accessible in harsh environments. On the other hand, some reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches adopt the leader-follower structure to organize different agents' behaviors, which sacrifices the collaboration between agents thus suffering from bottlenecks in maneuverability and robustness. In this paper, we propose a distributed formation and obstacle avoidance method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Agents in our system only utilize local and relative information to make decisions and control themselves distributively. Agent in the multi-agent system will reorganize themselves into a new topology quickly in case that any of them is disconnected.
