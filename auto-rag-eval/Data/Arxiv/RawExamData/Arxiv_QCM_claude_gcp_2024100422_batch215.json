            "text": "Reddit's self-organised bull runs: Social contagion and asset prices. This paper develops an empirical and theoretical case for how 'hype' among retail investors can drive large asset fluctuations. We use the dataset of discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), an online investor forum with over nine million followers as of April 2021, to show how excitement about trading opportunities can ripple through an investor community with large market impacts. This paper finds empirical evidence of psychological contagion among retail investors by exploiting differences in stock price fluctuations and discussion intensity. We show that asset discussions on WSB are self-perpetuating: an initial set of investors attracts a larger and larger group of excited followers. Sentiments about future stock performance also spread from one individual to the next, net of any fundamental price movements. Leveraging these findings, we develop a model for how social contagion impacts prices. The proposed model and simulations show that social contagion has a destabilizing effect on markets. Finally, we establish a causal relationship between WSB activity and financial markets using an instrumental variable approach."

The research paper explicitly states that it \"establish[es] a causal relationship between WSB activity and financial markets using an instrumental variable approach.\" This indicates that the study goes beyond mere correlation and demonstrates a causal link between the discussions on the WallStreetBets forum and actual market movements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the research shows that retail investors, through social contagion and coordinated action, can indeed impact asset prices significantly.\n\nAnswer B is partially true in that WSB activity does affect stock prices, but it's too limited in scope. The research doesn't restrict its findings to only small-cap stocks or those with low trading volumes.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the research demonstrates that WSB discussions do more than just reflect market trends; they actively influence stock prices and market behavior through social contagion and self-perpetuating excitement among investors."

Semi-autonomous telerobotic systems allow both humans and robots to exploit their strengths, while enabling personalized execution of a task. However, for new soft robots with degrees of freedom dissimilar to those of human operators, it is unknown how the control of a task should be divided between the human and robot. This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a soft growing robot manipulator, and demonstrates them in both real and simulated scenarios. The robot can grow and retract by eversion and inversion of its tubular body, a property we exploit to implement interaction paradigms. We implemented and tested six different paradigms of human-robot interaction, beginning with full teleoperation and gradually adding automation to various aspects of the task execution. All paradigms were demonstrated by two expert and two naive operators. Results show that humans and the soft robot manipulator can split control along degrees of freedom while acting simultaneously. In the simple pick-and-place task studied in this work, performance improves as the control is gradually given to the robot, because the robot can correct certain human errors. However, human engagement and enjoyment may be maximized when the task is at least partially shared. Finally, when the human operator is assisted by haptic feedback based on soft robot position errors, we observed that the improvement in performance is highly dependent on the expertise of the human operator."

Scientific image tampering is a problem that affects not only authors but also the general perception of the research community. Although previous researchers have developed methods to identify tampering in natural images, these methods may not thrive under the scientific setting as scientific images have different statistics, format, quality, and intentions. Therefore, we propose a scientific-image specific tampering detection method based on noise inconsistencies, which is capable of learning and generalizing to different fields of science. We train and test our method on a new dataset of manipulated western blot and microscopy imagery, which aims at emulating problematic images in science. The test results show that our method can detect various types of image manipulation in different scenarios robustly, and it outperforms existing general-purpose image tampering detection schemes. We discuss applications beyond these two types of images and suggest next steps for making detection of problematic images a systematic step in peer review and science in general."

It is designed to work across different scientific fields and outperforms existing general-purpose tampering detection methods. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the document states that methods for natural images may not work well for scientific images due to their different characteristics.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the method is not limited to western blot images.

We present core radii for 54 Milky Way globular clusters determined by fitting King-Michie models to cumulative projected star count distributions. We find that fitting star counts rather than surface brightness profiles produces results that differ significantly due to the presence of mass segregation. The sample in each cluster is further broken down into various mass groups, each of which is fit independently, allowing us to determine how the concentration of each cluster varies with mass. The majority of the clusters in our sample show general agreement with the standard picture that more massive stars will be more centrally concentrated. We find that core radius vs. stellar mass can be fit with a two parameter power-law. The slope of this power-law is a value that describes the amount of mass segregation present in the cluster, and is measured independently of our distance from the cluster. This value correlates strongly with the core relaxation time and physical size of each cluster. Supplementary figures are also included showing the best fits and likelihood contours of fit parameters for all 54 clusters."

The Arxiv paper states that \"core radius vs. stellar mass can be fit with a two parameter power-law. The slope of this power-law is a value that describes the amount of mass segregation present in the cluster.\" This directly supports option C as the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the relationship is not linear, but follows a power-law.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it mischaracterizes the relationship as logarithmic and incorrectly states that mass segregation occurs only in outer regions, whereas the paper indicates it's a cluster-wide phenomenon.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the paper explicitly mentions that the degree of mass segregation \"correlates strongly with the core relaxation time and physical size of each cluster,\" contradicting the statement that it's independent of relaxation time."

Data cleaning, whether manual or algorithmic, is rarely perfect leaving a dataset with an unknown number of false positives and false negatives after cleaning. In many scenarios, quantifying the number of remaining errors is challenging because our data integrity rules themselves may be incomplete, or the available gold-standard datasets may be too small to extrapolate. As the use of inherently fallible crowds becomes more prevalent in data cleaning problems, it is important to have estimators to quantify the extent of such errors. We propose novel species estimators to estimate the number of distinct remaining errors in a dataset after it has been cleaned by a set of crowd workers -- essentially, quantifying the utility of hiring additional workers to clean the dataset. This problem requires new estimators that are robust to false positives and false negatives, and we empirically show on three real-world datasets that existing species estimators are unstable for this problem, while our proposed techniques quickly converge."

A method to engineer the refractive indices of functional materials (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, SiO2), by nanostructuring in the deep sub-wavelength regime (<20nm), is presented. Block-copolymer templating combined with a wet processing route is used to realize 3D functional nanostructures with continuously adjustable refractive indices from 1.17 to 2.2. Wet processing accessed refractive index engineering can be applied to address a variety of realizability concerns in attaining design specified refractive index values and refractive index gradients in 1D, 2D, and 3D that arise as the results of optical design techniques such as thin film optimization methods, transformation optics and conformal mapping. Refractive index optimized multi-layer anti-reflection coatings on crystalline silicon, which reduce light reflections from 38% down to ~3% with a wide angular span, are demonstrated with the developed wet processing route. A high temperature oxygen free fiber optic hydrogen sensor realized by accessing nano-engineering enabled refractive indices is also presented. The functionality of the sensor is characterized with a fiber Bragg grating, transmission based interrogation, and optical frequency domain reflectometry.

Indirect Inference (I-I) is a popular technique for estimating complex parametric models whose likelihood function is intractable, however, the statistical efficiency of I-I estimation is questionable. While the efficient method of moments, Gallant and Tauchen (1996), promises efficiency, the price to pay for this efficiency is a loss of parsimony and thereby a potential lack of robustness to model misspecification. This stands in contrast to simpler I-I estimation strategies, which are known to display less sensitivity to model misspecification precisely due to their focus on specific elements of the underlying structural model. In this research, we propose a new simulation-based approach that maintains the parsimony of I-I estimation, which is often critical in empirical applications, but can also deliver estimators that are nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood. This new approach is based on using a constrained approximation to the structural model, which ensures identification and can deliver estimators that are nearly efficient. We demonstrate this approach through several examples, and show that this approach can deliver estimators that are nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood, when feasible, but can be employed in many situations where maximum likelihood is infeasible."

In the sequel, we take a different view and we argue that vectors and hosts can have very distinctive intrinsic time-scales, and that such distinctiveness extends to the disease dynamics. Under these hypothesis, we show that two asymptotic regimes naturally appear: the fast host dynamics and the fast vector dynamics. The former regime yields, at leading order, a SIR model for the hosts, but with a rational incidence rate. In this case, the vector disappears from the model, and the dynamics is similar to a directly contagious disease.

            "text": "Intrinsic Energy Localization through Discrete Gap Breathers in\n  One-Dimensional Diatomic Granular Crystals. We present a systematic study of the existence and stability of discrete breathers that are spatially localized in the bulk of a one-dimensional chain of compressed elastic beads that interact via Hertzian contact. The chain is diatomic, consisting of a periodic arrangement of heavy and light spherical particles. We examine two families of discrete gap breathers: (1) an unstable discrete gap breather that is centered on a heavy particle and characterized by a symmetric spatial energy profile and (2) a potentially stable discrete gap breather that is centered on a light particle and is characterized by an asymmetric spatial energy profile. We investigate their existence, structure, and stability throughout the band gap of the linear spectrum and classify them into four regimes: a regime near the lower optical band edge of the linear spectrum, a moderately discrete regime, a strongly discrete regime that lies deep within the band gap of the linearized version of the system, and a regime near the upper acoustic band edge. We contrast discrete breathers in anharmonic FPU-type diatomic chains with those in diatomic granular crystals, which have a tensionless interaction potential between adjacent particles, and highlight in that the asymmetric nature of the latter interaction potential may lead to a form of hybrid bulk-surface localized solutions."

This phenomenon, known as the \\emph{disposition effect} in the field of behavioural finance, is well-known and its prevalence has been shown in a number of existing markets. But what about new atypical markets like cryptocurrencies? Do investors act as irrationally as in traditional markets? One might suspect this and hypothesise that cryptocurrency sells occur more frequently in positive market conditions and less frequently in negative market conditions. However, there is still no empirical evidence to support this. In this paper, we expand on existing research and empirically investigate the prevalence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin by testing this hypothesis. Our results show that investors are indeed subject to the disposition effect, tending to sell their winning positions too soon and holding on to their losing position for too long. This effect is very prominently evident from the boom and bust year 2017 onwards, confirmed via most of the applied technical indicators. In this study, we show that Bitcoin traders act just as irrationally as traders in other, more established markets."

Artificial Intelligence techniques powered by deep neural nets have achieved much success in several application domains, most significantly and notably in the Computer Vision applications and Natural Language Processing tasks. Surpassing human-level performance propelled the research in the applications where different modalities amongst language, vision, sensory, text play an important role in accurate predictions and identification. Several multimodal fusion methods employing deep learning models are proposed in the literature. Despite their outstanding performance, the complex, opaque and black-box nature of the deep neural nets limits their social acceptance and usability. This has given rise to the quest for model interpretability and explainability, more so in the complex tasks involving multimodal AI methods. This paper extensively reviews the present literature to present a comprehensive survey and commentary on the explainability in multimodal deep neural nets, especially for the vision and language tasks. Several topics on multimodal AI and its applications for generic domains have been covered in this paper, including the significance, datasets, fundamental building blocks of the methods and techniques, challenges, applications, and future trends in this domain"

These models provide an accurate description of disinflation in the 1990s and a deflationary period in the 2000s. In Japan, there exists a statistically reliable (R2=0.68) Phillips curve, which is characterized by a negative relation between inflation and unemployment and their synchronous evolution: UE(t) = -0.94p(t) + 0.045. Effectively, growing unemployment has resulted in decreasing inflation since 1982. A linear and lagged generalized relationship between inflation, unemployment and labor force has been also obtained for Japan: p(t) = 2.8*dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.9*UE(t) - 0.0392.

Parameters are estimated under the Bayesian framework, using the {\\texttt{ Stan}} probabilistic programming language.

The reaction zones and the reaction frequencies for various types of reactions are calculated for AGS and SPS energies within the microscopic transport model. The relation of the reaction zones to the kinetic and chemical freeze-out processes is discussed. It is shown that the space-time freeze-out layer is most extended in time in the central region, while, especially for higher collision energies, the layer becomes very narrow at the sides. The parametrization of freeze-out hypersurface in the form of specific hyperbola of constant proper time was confirmed. The specific characteristic time moments of the fireball evolution are introduced. It is found that the time of the division of a reaction zone into two separate parts does not depend on the collision energy.

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health restrictions led to a significant slump in economic activities around the globe. This slump has met by various policy actions to cushion the detrimental socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and eventually bring the economy back on track. We provide an ex-ante evaluation of the effectiveness of a massive increase in research and innovation (R&I) funding in Finland to stimulate post-crisis recovery growth through an increase in R&I activities of Finnish firms. We make use of the fact that novel R&I grants for firms in disruptive circumstances granted in 2020 were allocated through established R&I policy channels. This allows us to estimate the structural link between R&I funding and economic growth for Finnish NUTS-3 regions using pre-COVID-19 data. Estimates are then used to forecast regional recovery growth out of sample and to quantify the growth contribution of R&I funding. Depending on the chosen scenario, our forecasts point to a mean recovery growth rate of GDP between 2-4% in 2021 after a decline of up to -2.5% in 2020. R&I funding constitutes a significant pillar of the recovery process with mean contributions in terms of GDP growth of between 0.4% and 1%."

In this article we suggest a new approach to the systematic, computer-aided construction and to the classification of product-quotient surfaces, introducing a new invariant, the integer gamma, which depends only on the singularities of the quotient model X=(C_1 x C_2)/G. It turns out that gamma is related to the codimension of the subspace of H^{1,1} generated by algebraic curves coming from the construction (i.e., the classes of the two fibers and the Hirzebruch-Jung strings arising from the minimal resolution of singularities of X). Profiting from this new insight we developped and implemented an algorithm which constructs all regular product-quotient surfaces with given values of gamma and geometric genus in the computer algebra program MAGMA. Being far better than the previous algorithms, we are able to construct a substantial number of new regular product-quotient surfaces of geometric genus zero. We prove that only two of these are of general type, raising the number of known families of product-quotient surfaces of general type with genus zero to 75.

Integrated waveguides exhibiting efficient second-order nonlinearities are crucial to obtain compact and low power optical signal processing devices. Silicon nitride (SiN) has shown second harmonic generation (SHG) capabilities in resonant structures and single-pass devices leveraging intermodal phase matching, which is defined by waveguide design. Lithium niobate allows compensating for the phase mismatch using periodically poled waveguides, however the latter are not reconfigurable and remain difficult to integrate with SiN or silicon (Si) circuits. Here we show the all-optical enhancement of SHG in SiN waveguides by more than 30 dB. We demonstrate that a Watt-level laser causes a periodic modification of the waveguide second-order susceptibility. The resulting second order nonlinear grating has a periodicity allowing for quasi phase matching (QPM) between the pump and SH mode. Moreover, changing the pump wavelength or polarization updates the period, relaxing phase matching constraints imposed by the waveguide geometry. We show that the grating is long term inscribed in the waveguides, and we estimate a second order nonlinearity of the order of 0.3 pm/V, while a maximum conversion efficiency (CE) of 1.8x10-6 W-1 cm-2 is reached."

We derive an explicit expression for the lower bound, and show the existence and uniqueness of the optimal Gaussian approximation. The lower bound functional can be viewed as a variant of classical Tikhonov regularization that penalizes also the covariance. Then we develop an efficient alternating direction maximization algorithm for solving the optimization problem, and analyze its convergence. We discuss strategies for reducing the computational complexity via low rank structure of the forward operator and the sparsity of the covariance.

The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which takes much time and suffers from a high rate of misjudgment, is recognized as an extremely challenging task for cardiologists. The major difficulty of the ECG signals classification is caused by the long-term sequence dependencies. Most existing approaches for ECG signal classification use Recurrent Neural Network models, e.g., LSTM and GRU, which are unable to extract accurate features for such long sequences.

Existing universal style transfer methods successfully deliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a photo-realistic way. However, the range of 'arbitrary style' defined by existing works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural limitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization are established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both photo-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired style transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer not only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a given reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that captures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of reference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware skip connection to adaptively transfer the stroke and palette to the input contents guided by the domainness indicator. Our extensive experiments validate that our model produces better qualitative results and outperforms previous methods in terms of proxy metrics on both artistic and photo-realistic stylizations."

This suggests the possibility of reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a continuous transition. We then present a generic framework to investigate the optimal lag time distribution for total population fitness for a given distribution of the antibiotic application duration.

While most existing techniques focus on extracting either the whole set of contrast patterns (CPs) or minimal sets, the problem of efficiently finding a relevant subset of CPs, especially in high dimensional datasets, is an open challenge. In this paper, we focus on extracting the most specific set of CPs to discover significant changes between two datasets. Our approach to this problem uses closed patterns to substantially reduce redundant patterns. Our experimental results on several real and emulated network traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised algorithm is up to 100 times faster than an existing approach for CPM on network traffic data [2].

The paper's main innovation is using closed patterns to reduce redundant patterns in contrast pattern mining, which leads to significant improvements in scalability. This is evident from the statement: \"Our approach to this problem uses closed patterns to substantially reduce redundant patterns.\" The paper also mentions that their method is \"up to 100 times faster than an existing approach for CPM on network traffic data,\" highlighting the scalability improvement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the paper focuses on finding a relevant subset of contrast patterns, not the entire set.

The corresponding critical values of the chemical potential can be related to the 1-, 2- and 3-particle energies of the system, and we check this relation with a direct spectroscopy determination of the $n$-particle energies from $2n$-point functions. We analyze the thresholds as a function of the spatial size of the system and use the known finite volume results for the $n$-particle energies to relate the thresholds to scattering data. For four dimensions we determine the scattering length from the 2-particle threshold, while in two dimensions the full scattering phase shift can be determined. In both cases the scattering data computed from the 2-particle threshold already allow one to determine the 3-particle energy. In both, two and four dimensions we find very good agreement of this ''prediction'' with direct determinations of the 3-particle energy from either the thresholds or the 6-point functions.

Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\\% for GCN and other three models."

The study reveals that a few \"bad-actor\" nodes, termed \"anchor nodes,\" can significantly compromise trained graph neural networks by flipping connections to targeted victims. Importantly, these anchor nodes are effective across multiple GNN models, not just one specific model. The research demonstrates that for the Cora dataset with 2,708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes can achieve an attack success rate higher than 80% for GCN and three other models. This finding highlights the vulnerability of GNNs to a small number of strategically placed adversarial nodes, which is more severe than previously thought attacks that focused on perturbing graph structure or node features individually.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the study found that anchor nodes often belong to the same class, not distributed across multiple classes. Answer B is wrong as the anchor nodes compromise multiple models, not just one. Answer D is inaccurate because the study shows that flipping connections alone, without necessarily perturbing node features, can be highly effective in compromising GNN models."

Without imported cases, if a region is willing to implement measures to prevent spread at one level in number of cases, it must also be willing to prevent the spread with at a lower level, since it will be cheaper to do so and has only positive other effects. With imported cases, if a region is not coordinating with other regions, we show the cheapest policy is continually low but nonzero cases due to decreasing cost of halting imported cases.

Motivated by high-dimensional complex systems typically found in interest rate markets, we investigate correlation in high-dimensional high-frequency data generated by continuous semimartingales. In contrast to the traditional PCA methodology, the directions of large variations are not deterministic, but rather they are bounded variation adapted processes which maximize quadratic variation almost surely. This allows us to reduce dimensionality from high-dimensional semimartingale systems in terms of quadratic covariation rather than the usual covariance concept. The proposed methodology allows us to investigate space-time data driven by multi-dimensional latent semimartingale state processes. The theory is applied to discretely-observed stochastic PDEs which admit finite-dimensional realizations. In particular, we provide consistent estimators for finite-dimensional invariant manifolds for Heath-Jarrow-Morton models. More importantly, components of the invariant manifold associated to volatility and drift dynamics are consistently estimated and identified.

            "text": "The effect of intermittent upwelling events on plankton blooms. In the marine environment biological processes are strongly affected by oceanic currents, particularly by eddies (vortices) formed by the hydrodynamic flow field. Employing a kinematic flow field coupled to a population dynamical model for plankton growth, we study the impact of an intermittent upwelling of nutrients on triggering harmful algal blooms (HABs). Though it is widely believed that additional nutrients boost the formation of HABs or algal blooms in general, we show that the response of the plankton to nutrient plumes depends crucially on the mesoscale hydrodynamic flow structure. In general nutrients can either be quickly washed out from the observation area, or can be captured by the vortices in the flow. The occurrence of either scenario depends on the relation between the time scales of the vortex formation and nutrient upwelling as well as the time instants at which upwelling pulse occurs and how long do they last. We show that these two scenarios result in very different responses in plankton dynamics which makes it very difficult to predict, whether nutrient upwelling will lead to a HAB or not. This explains, why observational data are sometimes inconclusive establishing a correlation between upwelling events and plankton blooms."

The text states that \"the response of the plankton to nutrient plumes depends crucially on the mesoscale hydrodynamic flow structure.\" It also mentions that the outcome depends on the timing and duration of upwelling pulses in relation to vortex formation. This complexity makes it \"very difficult to predict, whether nutrient upwelling will lead to a HAB or not,\" which is why observational data can be inconclusive in establishing a correlation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the study explicitly states that additional nutrients don't always boost HABs. Option B oversimplifies the relationship by focusing only on pulse duration, ignoring other crucial factors. Option C contradicts the study's findings about the difficulty in predicting and establishing clear correlations between upwelling events and HABs."

The ejection of DNA from a bacterial virus (``phage'') into its host cell is a biologically important example of the translocation of a macromolecular chain along its length through a membrane. The simplest mechanism for this motion is diffusion, but in the case of phage ejection a significant driving force derives from the high degree of stress to which the DNA is subjected in the viral capsid. The translocation is further sped up by the ratcheting and entropic forces associated with proteins that bind to the viral DNA in the host cell cytoplasm. We formulate a generalized diffusion equation that includes these various pushing and pulling effects and make estimates of the corresponding speed-ups in the overall translocation process. Stress in the capsid is the dominant factor throughout early ejection, with the pull due to binding particles taking over at later stages. Confinement effects are also investigated, in the case where the phage injects its DNA into a volume comparable to the capsid size. Our results suggest a series of in vitro experiments involving the ejection of DNA into vesicles filled with varying amounts of binding proteins from phage whose state of stress is controlled by ambient salt conditions or by tuning genome length."

We consider a model of urban spatial structure proposed by Harris and Wilson (Environment and Planning A, 1978). The model consists of fast dynamics, which represent spatial interactions between locations by the entropy-maximizing principle, and slow dynamics, which represent the evolution of the spatial distribution of local factors that facilitate such spatial interactions. One known limitation of the Harris and Wilson model is that it can have multiple locally stable equilibria, leading to a dependence of predictions on the initial state. To overcome this, we employ equilibrium refinement by stochastic stability. We build on the fact that the model is a large-population potential game and that stochastically stable states in a potential game correspond to global potential maximizers. Unlike local stability under deterministic dynamics, the stochastic stability approach allows a unique and unambiguous prediction for urban spatial configurations. We show that, in the most likely spatial configuration, the number of retail agglomerations decreases either when shopping costs for consumers decrease or when the strength of agglomerative effects increases."

The documentation states that the Harris and Wilson model can have multiple locally stable equilibria, which leads to predictions dependent on initial conditions. However, by employing stochastic stability, the model can overcome this limitation. Stochastic stability is linked to global potential maximizers in potential games, which allows for a unique and unambiguous prediction of urban spatial configurations.

In this paper, we propose an alternative design to overcome these two disadvantages by means of modelling (instead of measuring) the results. We describe the concept of model-informed result-based agri-environmental payments (MIRBAP), including a hypothetical example of payments for the protection and enhancement of soil functions. We offer a comprehensive discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of MIRBAP, showing that it not only unites most of the advantages of result-based and action-based schemes, but also adds two new advantages: the potential to address trade-offs among multiple policy objectives and management for long-term environmental effects.

            "text": "Estimating the Number of Sources: An Efficient Maximization Approach. Estimating the number of sources received by an antenna array have been well known and investigated since the starting of array signal processing. Accurate estimation of such parameter is critical in many applications that involve prior knowledge of the number of received signals. Information theo- retic approaches such as Akaikes information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL) have been used extensively even though they are complex and show bad performance at some stages. In this paper, a new algorithm for estimating the number of sources is presented. This algorithm exploits the estimated eigenvalues of the auto correlation coefficient matrix rather than the auto covariance matrix, which is conventionally used, to estimate the number of sources. We propose to use either of a two simply estimated decision statistics, which are the moving increment and moving standard deviation as metric to estimate the number of sources. Then process a simple calculation of the increment or standard deviation of eigenvalues to find the number of sources at the location of the maximum value. Results showed that our proposed algorithms have a better performance in comparison to the popular and more computationally expensive AIC and MDL at low SNR values and low number of collected samples."

Fishery surveys that call for the use of single or multiple underwater cameras have been an emerging technology as a non-extractive mean to estimate the abundance of fish stocks. Tracking live fish in an open aquatic environment posts challenges that are different from general pedestrian or vehicle tracking in surveillance applications. In many rough habitats fish are monitored by cameras installed on moving platforms, where tracking is even more challenging due to inapplicability of background models. In this paper, a novel tracking algorithm based on the deformable multiple kernels (DMK) is proposed to address these challenges. Inspired by the deformable part model (DPM) technique, a set of kernels is defined to represent the holistic object and several parts that are arranged in a deformable configuration. Color histogram, texture histogram and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) are extracted and serve as object features. Kernel motion is efficiently estimated by the mean-shift algorithm on color and texture features to realize tracking. Furthermore, the HOG-feature deformation costs are adopted as soft constraints on kernel positions to maintain the part configuration. Experimental results on practical video set from underwater moving cameras show the reliable performance of the proposed method with much less computational cost comparing with state-of-the-art techniques."

We developed an analytic framework for the SIR epidemic model to examine the effect of (i) source of infection and (ii) between-host asymmetry in infection probabilities, on disease risk. We measured risk as outbreak probability and outbreak size in a focal host, represented by one network layer. Numeric simulations were used to validate the analytic formulations. We found that outbreak probability is determined by a complex interaction between source of infection and between-host infection probabilities, whereas outbreak size is mainly affected by the non-focal host to focal host infection probability alone. Hence, inter-specific asymmetry in infection probabilities shapes disease dynamics in multihost networks. These results expand current theory of monolayer networks, where outbreak size and probability are considered equal, highlighting the importance of considering multiple measures of disease risk.

Though the concept of GVC was introduced in the early 2000s, there are examples of global value chains before the 1980s.

Fine-grained classification tasks such as identifying different breeds of dog are quite challenging as visual differences between categories is quite small and can be easily overwhelmed by external factors such as object pose, lighting, etc. This work focuses on the specific case of classifying rowing teams from various associations. Currently, the photos are taken at rowing competitions and are manually classified by a small set of members, in what is a painstaking process. To alleviate this, Deep learning models can be utilised as a faster method to classify the images. Recent studies show that localising the manually defined parts, and modelling based on these parts, improves on vanilla convolution models, so this work also investigates the detection of clothing attributes. The networks were trained and tested on a partially labelled data set mainly consisting of rowers from multiple associations. This paper resulted in the classification of up to ten rowing associations by using deep learning networks the smaller VGG network achieved 90.1\\% accuracy whereas ResNet was limited to 87.20\\%. Adding attention to the ResNet resulted into a drop of performance as only 78.10\\% was achieved."

We report magnetization measurements of As-deficient LaO_0.9F_0.1FeAs_1-delta (delta about 0.06) samples with improved superconducting properties as compared with As-stoichiometric optimally doped La-1111 samples. In this As-deficient system with almost homogeneously distributed As-vacancies (AV), as suggested by the (75)As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements,we observe a strong enhancement of the spin-susceptibility by a factor of 3-7. This observation is attributed to the presence of an electronically localized state around each AV, carrying a magnetic moment of about 3.2 mu_Bohr per AV or 0.8 mu_Bohr/Fe atom. From theoretical considerations we find that the formation of a local moment on neighboring iron sites of an AV sets in when the local Coulomb interaction exceeds a critical value of about 1.0 eV in the dilute limit. Its estimated value amounts to ~ 2.5 eV and implies an upper bound of ~ 2 eV for the Coulomb repulsion at Fe sites beyond the first neighbor-shell of an AV. Electronic correlations are thus moderate/weak in doped La-1111. The strongly enhanced spin susceptibility is responsible for the Pauli limiting behavior of the superconductivity that we observe in As-deficient LaO_0.9F_0.1FeAs_1-delta.

Despite the fact that a system created in relativistic heavy ion collisions is an isolated quantum system, which cannot increase its entropy in the course of unitary quantum evolution, hydrodynamical analysis of experimental data seems to indicate that the matter formed in the collisions is thermalized very quickly. Based on common consideration of hydrodynamics as an effective theory in the domain of slow- and long-length modes, we discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the decoherence and emergence of the hydrodynamic behavior in such collisions, and demonstrate how such physical mechanisms work in the case of the scalar field model. We obtain the evolution equation for the Wigner function of a long-wavelength subsystem that describes its decoherence, isotropization, and approach to thermal equilibrium induced by interaction with short-wavelength modes. Our analysis supports the idea that decoherence, quantum-to-classical transition and thermalization in isolated quantum systems are attributed to the experimental context, and are related to a particular procedure of decomposition of the whole quantum system into relevant and irrelevant from an observational viewpoint subsystems."

The proposed mechanism to resolve this paradox is the entanglement of scales.\n\nThis concept suggests that the interaction between long-wavelength (slow) modes and short-wavelength (fast) modes leads to decoherence and the emergence of hydrodynamic behavior. The long-wavelength modes, which are more readily observable and relevant to hydrodynamic descriptions, become entangled with the short-wavelength modes. This entanglement results in the apparent thermalization and increase in entropy of the observable subsystem, even though the total system's entropy remains constant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because spontaneous symmetry breaking is not mentioned as the primary mechanism for thermalization in this context. Option C is wrong because the process doesn't actually violate the second law of thermodynamics; it only appears to do so from the perspective of the observable subsystem. Option D is incorrect because the system is described as isolated, so external heat sources are not involved.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and their application to relativistic heavy ion collisions, making it suitable for a challenging exam in advanced physics or quantum field theory."

In our studies with cubic crystals, the largest enhancement of conductance from \"abrupt\" to \"mixed\" interfaces seems to be correlated with the emergence of voids in the conserving modes, where $M_c = 0$. Such voids typically arise when the interlayer coupling is weakly dispersive, making the bands shift rigidly with momentum.

While the study mentions checking the stability of results against possible breaks in the injection spectrum of SNRs, this is not presented as the primary explanation for the observed break.\n\nOption D is also not supported as the main explanation. While spallation of hadronic cosmic rays is mentioned as one of the sources in their model, it is not highlighted as the cause of the spectral break.\n\nThe correct answer, C, aligns with the study's main finding that the interplay between SNR and PWN contributions best explains the observed break in the electron spectrum."
