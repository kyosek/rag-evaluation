A Boolean network is a mapping $f :\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^n$, which can be used to model networks of $n$ interacting entities, each having a local Boolean state that evolves over time according to a deterministic function of the current configuration of states.

As such, this network is somewhat homogeneous, though the number of variables may vary from entity to entity, thus yielding a generalised cellular automaton. The aim of this paper is to review some of the main results, derive some additional fundamental results, and highlight some open problems, on the dynamics of disjunctive networks.

This means that an entity's state will be 1 if any of its input variables are 1, and 0 only if all its inputs are 0.\n\nThe key to understanding the maximum number of fixed points is to realize that in a disjunctive network:\n\n1. The all-zero state (0,0,...,0) is always a fixed point, as no entity will change from 0 when all inputs are 0.\n\n2. Any state with at least one 1 will eventually lead to the all-one state (1,1,...,1), because:\n   - Entities with a 1 input will become or stay 1\n   - This 1 will propagate through the network in subsequent time steps\n   - Eventually, all entities will become 1\n\n3. The all-one state (1,1,...,1) is also a fixed point, as all entities will stay 1 when all inputs are 1.\n\nHowever, the all-one state and the all-zero state are actually the same fixed point in this context, because once the network reaches the all-one state, it can never return to any other state.\n\nTherefore, the maximum (and indeed, the only) number of fixed points in a disjunctive Boolean network is 1, regardless of the number of entities n.\n\nThis makes option D (1) the correct answer, while the other options are incorrect regardless of the value of n."}, "36": {"documentation": {"title": "A Novel Model for Distributed Big Data Service Composition using\n  Stratified Functional Graph Matching", "source": "Carlos R.
