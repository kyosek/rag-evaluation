The new statistical toy-model analysis suggests that if the NAO system is approximately bimodal in nature, and the prediction model consistently underestimates the level of regime persistence each season, it can reproduce both the high skill and high RPC value (indicating a low signal-to-noise ratio) observed in the Met Office hindcasts. This underestimation of regime persistence could be due to various sources of model error, such as imperfect regime structure or errors in teleconnection propagation. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the analysis suggests that the NAO is predictable to some extent, contradicting the notion of inherent unpredictability. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the model underestimates, not overestimates, the level of regime persistence.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because a high RPC value for a seasonal mean prediction may be expected even if the model's internal level of noise is realistic, not unrealistically high."}, "31": {"documentation": {"title": "How Do We Move: Modeling Human Movement with System Dynamics", "source": "Hua Wei, Dongkuan Xu, Junjie Liang, Zhenhui Li", "docs_id": "2003.00613", "section": ["cs.AI", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "How Do We Move: Modeling Human Movement with System Dynamics.

In this paper we present a new multi-asset pricing model, which is built upon newly developed families of solvable multi-parameter single-asset diffusions with a nonlinear smile-shaped volatility and an affine drift. Our multi-asset pricing model arises by employing copula methods. In particular, all discounted single-asset price processes are modeled as martingale diffusions under a risk-neutral measure. The price processes are so-called UOU diffusions and they are each generated by combining a variable (Ito) transformation with a measure change performed on an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Gaussian) process. Consequently, we exploit the use of a normal bridge copula for coupling the single-asset dynamics while reducing the distribution of the multi-asset price process to a multivariate normal distribution.
