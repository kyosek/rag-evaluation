Acquiring new robot motor skills is cumbersome, as learning a skill from scratch and without prior knowledge requires the exploration of a large space of motor configurations.

We present a framework which is able of such knowledge transfer from already learned movement skills to a new learning task. The framework combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of their effects for skill representation. New skills are first initialized with parameters inferred from related movement primitives and thereafter adapted to the new task through relative entropy policy search. We compare two different transfer approaches to initialize the search space distribution with data of known skills with a similar effect.

A systematic comparison of these proposals is presented here. The conditions of fixed energy per particle, baryon+anti-baryon density, normalized entropy density as well as percolation model are investigated.

The research presents a novel approach to surface acoustic wave-photonic devices in silicon on insulator (SOI) that does not require piezoelectric actuation, suspension of waveguides, or hybrid material integration.

In this paper we consider the problem of designing a decoder to recover a set of sparse codes from their linear measurements alone, that is without access to encoder matrix. To this end we study the matrix factorisation task of recovering both the encoder and sparse coding matrices from the associated linear measurement matrix. The contribution of this paper is a computationally efficient decoding algorithm, Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation, with strong performance guarantees. In particular, under mild assumptions on the sparse coding matrix and by deploying a novel random encoder matrix, we prove that Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation recovers both the encoder and sparse coding matrix at the optimal measurement rate with high probability and from a near optimal number of measurement vectors.

We show that, when the receiver's action space is finite, truth-leaning equilibrium may fail to exist, and it is not equivalent to equilibrium of the perturbed game.

In this manuscript, we show that a \"series kernel\" that is general enough to represent irregularly-spaced multivariate time series may be built out of well-known \"vector kernels\". We also show that all series kernels constructed using our methodology are psd, and are thus widely applicable.
