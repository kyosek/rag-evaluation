The evolution of the metallicity of the stellar component, contributed by each of these processes, is also investigated.

Although these difficulties are surmountable, but in practice, they complicate finding the unambiguous result. In the present work, an unambiguous expression for the kernel $N$ in terms of real functions is derived. For the one-boson scalar exchange, the explicit formula for $N$ is found. With this equation and kernel, the binding energies, calculated previously, are reproduced.
