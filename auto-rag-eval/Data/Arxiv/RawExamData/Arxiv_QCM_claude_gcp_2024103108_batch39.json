The practical aspects of developing an Automatic Speech Recognition System (ASR) with HTK are reviewed. Steps are explained concerning hardware, software, libraries, applications and computer programs used. The common procedure to rapidly apply speech recognition system is summarized. The procedure is illustrated, to implement a speech based electrical switch in home automation for the Indonesian language. The main key of the procedure is to match the environment for training and testing using the training data recorded from the testing program, HVite. Often the silence detector of HTK is wrongly triggered by noises because the microphone is too sensitive. This problem is mitigated by simply scaling down the volume. In this sub-word phone-based speech recognition, noise is included in the training database and labelled particularly. Illustration of the procedure is applied to a home automation application. Electrical switches are controlled by Indonesian speech recognizer. The results show 100% command completion rate."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In developing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using HTK for Indonesian language in a home automation context, which of the following combinations of techniques and approaches would most likely result in the highest accuracy and robustness?\n\nA) Using word-based recognition, excluding silence from the training data, and increasing microphone sensitivity to capture all sounds\nB) Employing sub-word phone-based recognition, including labeled noise in the training database, and scaling down the microphone volume\nC) Utilizing syllable-based recognition, removing all background noise from training data, and using the default HTK silence detector settings\nD) Implementing sentence-level recognition, using clean speech samples only, and maximizing the microphone's pick-up range\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it aligns with the key points mentioned in the documentation for achieving high accuracy in the ASR system. The text specifically mentions using sub-word phone-based speech recognition, which is more flexible and robust than word-based or sentence-level approaches. It also emphasizes the importance of including noise in the training database and labeling it particularly, which helps the system better handle real-world conditions. Additionally, the document notes that scaling down the microphone volume helps mitigate false triggers of the silence detector due to excessive sensitivity. These combined approaches resulted in a 100% command completion rate in the home automation application described.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests word-based recognition (less flexible than phone-based), excludes silence (which is important for proper segmentation), and increases microphone sensitivity (which can lead to false triggers).\n\nOption C is incorrect as it proposes syllable-based recognition (not mentioned in the text), removes background noise (contrary to the recommendation to include it), and uses default silence detector settings (which may not be optimal).\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests sentence-level recognition (too rigid for practical applications), uses only clean speech samples (less robust in real-world conditions), and maximizes microphone pick-up (which can lead to the sensitivity issues mentioned in the text)."}, "1": {"documentation": {"title": "Dynamic Hurst Exponent in Time Series", "source": "Carlos Arturo Soto Campos, Leopoldo S\\'anchez Cant\\'u and Zeus\n  Hern\\'andez Veleros", "docs_id": "1903.07809", "section": ["q-fin.ST"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Dynamic Hurst Exponent in Time Series. The market efficiency hypothesis has been proposed to explain the behavior of time series of stock markets. The Black-Scholes model (B-S) for example, is based on the assumption that markets are efficient. As a consequence, it is impossible, at least in principle, to \"predict\" how a market behaves, whatever the circumstances. Recently we have found evidence which shows that it is possible to find self-organized behavior in the prices of assets in financial markets during deep falls of those prices. Through a kurtosis analysis we have identified a critical point that separates time series from stock markets in two different regimes: the mesokurtic segment compatible with a random walk regime and the leptokurtic one that allegedly follows a power law behavior. In this paper we provide some evidence, showing that the Hurst exponent is a good estimator of the regime in which the market is operating.

The researchers propose that the Hurst exponent can be considered a critical variable for distinguishing between different market regimes, drawing a parallel to how magnetization is used to differentiate phases in magnetic systems in physics.

Intuitively, one might assume the more the better.

Language models (LM) play an important role in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR).

The mismatch between the single word prediction modeling in trained and the long term sequence prediction in read demands may lead to the performance degradation. In this paper, a novel enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) LM using the future vector is proposed. In addition to the given history, the rest of the sequence will be also embedded by future vectors. This future vector can be incorporated with the LSTM LM, so it has the ability to model much longer term sequence level information.

Community detection is a well established method for studying the meso scale structure of social networks. Applying a community detection algorithm results in a division of a network into communities that is often used to inspect and reason about community membership of specific nodes. This micro level interpretation step of community structure is a crucial step in typical social science research. However, the methodological caveat in this step is that virtually all modern community detection methods are non-deterministic and based on randomization and approximated results. This needs to be explicitly taken into consideration when reasoning about community membership of individual nodes. To do so, we propose a metric of community membership consistency, that provides node-level insights in how reliable the placement of that node into a community really is. In addition, it enables us to distinguish the community core members of a community.

However, the Griffin-Lim method causes unnatural artifacts in synthetic speech. Addressing this problem, we introduce the von-Mises-distribution DNN for phase reconstruction. The DNN is a generative model having the von Mises distribution that can model distributions of a periodic variable such as a phase, and the model parameters of the DNN are estimated on the basis of the maximum likelihood criterion. Furthermore, we propose a group-delay loss for DNN training to make the predicted group delay close to a natural group delay. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the trained DNN can predict group delay accurately more than phases themselves, and 2) our phase reconstruction methods achieve better speech quality than the conventional Griffin-Lim method."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages and key features of the von-Mises-distribution deep neural network (DNN) approach for phase reconstruction, as presented in the paper?\n\nA) It uses the Griffin-Lim method to reduce unnatural artifacts in synthetic speech and models periodic variables like phase.\n\nB) It employs a generative model with a uniform distribution and uses the minimum error criterion for parameter estimation.\n\nC) It introduces a von Mises distribution to model phase, uses maximum likelihood for parameter estimation, and incorporates a group-delay loss for improved natural group delay prediction.\n\nD) It focuses solely on amplitude spectrogram processing without considering phase reconstruction, achieving better speech quality than conventional methods.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures the key features and advantages of the proposed method.

In SIT, a DNN acoustic model and a speaker classifier network are jointly optimized to minimize the senone (tied triphone state) classification loss, and simultaneously mini-maximize the speaker classification loss. A speaker-invariant and senone-discriminative deep feature is learned through this adversarial multi-task learning. With SIT, a canonical DNN acoustic model with significantly reduced variance in its output probabilities is learned with no explicit speaker-independent (SI) transformations or speaker-specific representations used in training or testing. Evaluated on the CHiME-3 dataset, the SIT achieves 4.99% relative word error rate (WER) improvement over the conventional SI acoustic model.
