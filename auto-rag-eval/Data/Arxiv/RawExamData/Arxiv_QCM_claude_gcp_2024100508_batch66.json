Polarization based sensing with tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensors is analysed theoretically by two alternative approaches. The first method is based on tracking the grating transmission for two orthogonal states of linear polarized light that are extracted from the measured Jones matrix or Stokes vectors of the TFBG transmission spectra. The second method is based on the measurements along the system principle axes and polarization dependent loss (PDL) parameter, also calculated from measured data. It is shown that the frequent crossing of the Jones matrix eigenvalues as a function of wavelength leads to a non-physical interchange of the calculated principal axes; a method to remove this unwanted mathematical artefact and to restore the order of the system eigenvalues and the corresponding principal axes is provided. A comparison of the two approaches reveals that the PDL method provides a smaller standard deviation and therefore lower limit of detection in refractometric sensing. Furthermore, the polarization analysis of the measured spectra allows for the identification of the principal states of polarization of the sensor system and consequentially for the calculation of the transmission spectrum for any incident polarization state.

To build an open-domain multi-turn conversation system is one of the most interesting and challenging tasks in Artificial Intelligence.

Besides, it is common for people to talk about highly relevant aspects during a conversation. And the topics are coherent and drift naturally, which demonstrates the necessity of dialogue flow modeling. To this end, we present the multi-turn cue-words driven conversation system with reinforcement learning method (RLCw), which strives to select an adaptive cue word with the greatest future credit, and therefore improve the quality of generated responses.

Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs.

The text argues that the S-matrix should have poles for any quantum numbers, including exotic ones, which is a novel argument for the possible existence of exotic multi-quark baryons.

Option C overstates the certainty of the findings, as the document presents these as possibilities rather than conclusively proven facts.

A possible solution is provided by asymmetric liquidity, which states that the impact of a buy or sell order is inversely related to the probability of its occurrence.

In this setting, we show that density functions may be estimated by an application of the kernel estimation method of Rosenblatt (1956) and Parzen (1962). We suggest an estimate of their asymptotic variances inspired by a combination of (i) Newey's (1994) method of variance estimation for kernel estimators in the \"monadic\" setting and (ii) a variance estimator for the (estimated) density of a simple network first suggested by Holland and Leinhardt (1976). More unusual are the rates of convergence and asymptotic (normal) distributions of our dyadic density estimates. Specifically, we show that they converge at the same rate as the (unconditional) dyadic sample mean: the square root of the number, N, of nodes.

To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module.

In this paper, we propose to design the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame (WFBF) is considered as PRFB.
