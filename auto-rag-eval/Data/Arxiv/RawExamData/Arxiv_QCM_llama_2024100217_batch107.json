In this paper, we present a new approach of creating PTAS to the TSP problems by defining a bounded-curvature surface embedded spaces.

Thus, the algorithm generalizes arXiv:1112.0699 (and therefore [7] and [8] as well, w.r.t PTAS of TSP). But, the algorithm is much broader as uniform metric spaces aren't bounded doubling dimension spaces.

Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep neural networks, are enabling a range of emerging applications. One such example is autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. However, deep learning-based perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images. Nevertheless, the vast majority of such demonstrations focus on perception that is disembodied from end-to-end control. We present novel end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective. We define several objective functions that quantify the success of an attack and develop techniques based on Bayesian Optimization to efficiently traverse the search space of higher dimensional attacks. Additionally, we define a novel class of hijacking attacks, where painted lines on the road cause the driver-less car to follow a target path. Through the use of network deconvolution, we provide insights into the successful attacks, which appear to work by mimicking activations of entirely different scenarios.

Because the signal generation process relies on quantum mechanical principles, the system is considered to contain a quantum-enhanced radar transmitter. This transmitter generates a pair of entangled microwave signals and transmits one of them through free space, where the signal is measured using a simple and rudimentary receiver.

It is important and informative to compare and contrast major economic crises in order to confront novel and unknown cases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2006 Great Recession and then the 2019 pandemic have a lot to share in terms of unemployment rate, consumption expenditures, and interest rates set by Federal Reserve. In addition to quantitative historical data, it is also interesting to compare the contents of Federal Reserve statements for the period of these two crises and find out whether Federal Reserve cares about similar concerns or there are some other issues that demand separate and unique monetary policies. This paper conducts an analysis to explore the Federal Reserve concerns as expressed in their statements for the period of 2005 to 2020. The concern analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and a trend analysis of concern is also presented. We observe that there are some similarities between the Federal Reserve statements issued during the Great Recession with those issued for the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** Analyze the similarities and differences in the concerns expressed by the Federal Reserve in their statements during the Great Recession (2005-2008) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020).

The partial information decomposition (PID) is perhaps the leading proposal for resolving information shared between a set of sources and a target into redundant, synergistic, and unique constituents.

We first develop a broadly applicable method---the dependency decomposition---that delineates how statistical dependencies influence the structure of a joint distribution. The dependency decomposition then allows us to define a measure of the information about a target that can be uniquely attributed to a particular source as the least amount which the source-target statistical dependency can influence the information shared between the sources and the target.

This article discusses the relationship between emergence and reductionism from the perspective of a condensed matter physicist.

I argue that in practice, they compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism.
