The exterior of the mammalian brain - the cerebral cortex - has a conserved layered structure whose thickness varies little across species. However, selection pressures over evolutionary time scales have led to cortices that have a large surface area to volume ratio in some organisms, with the result that the brain is strongly convoluted into sulci and gyri. Here we show that the gyrification can arise as a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical instability driven by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by the white matter. A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel captures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain treated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri similar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a function of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with brain size), and are consistent with observations of a wide range of brains, ranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two simple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to qualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical anomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The gyrification of the cerebral cortex in mammals can be explained by a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical instability driven by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by the white matter.

We present a new framework for optimal and feedback control of PDEs using Koopman operator-based reduced order models (K-ROMs). The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator which describes the dynamics of observables. A numerical approximation of the Koopman operator therefore yields a linear system for the observation of an autonomous dynamical system. In our approach, by introducing a finite number of constant controls, the dynamic control system is transformed into a set of autonomous systems and the corresponding optimal control problem into a switching time optimization problem. This allows us to replace each of these systems by a K-ROM which can be solved orders of magnitude faster.

This tidal stream energy industry has to date been comprised of small demonstrator projects made up of one to a four turbines.

This review investigates different methods of modelling the economic performance of tidal-stream arrays, for use within these optimisation tools. The different cost reduction pathways are discussed from costs falling as the global installed capacity increases, due to greater experience, improved power curves through larger-diameter higher-rated turbines, to economic efficiencies that can be found by moving to large-scale arrays. A literature review is conducted to establish the most appropriate input values for use in economic models. This includes finding a best case, worst case and typical values for costs and other related parameters.

The folding of secondary structures proceeds through a well-defined sequence of events, with the closer the system is to the native state, the faster the establishment of contacts. Increasing the system size deteriorates the folding characteristics, and the folding times are inversely proportional to the viscous friction.\n\nCandidate A is incorrect because the documentation states that the presence of steric constraints improves the folding characteristics of $\\beta$-structures, but does not imply that the absence of steric constraints leads to faster folding rates for all secondary structures.\n\nCandidate B is incorrect because the documentation states that the presence of steric constraints improves the folding characteristics of $\\beta$-structures, but does not imply that the absence of steric constraints has a negligible effect on the folding rates of $\\alpha$-helices.\n\nCandidate D is incorrect because the documentation does not provide information on the relationship between pinning one end of the structure and the folding times, and the relationship between viscous friction and folding times is described as linear, not directly proportional."}, "21": {"documentation": {"title": "Optimal ratcheting of dividends in insurance", "source": "Hansjoerg Albrecher and Pablo Azcue and Nora Muler", "docs_id": "1910.06910", "section": ["q-fin.PM", "math.PR"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Optimal ratcheting of dividends in insurance.

Due to the complexity of the problem, the investigation of the many-body localization transition has remained a big challenge.
