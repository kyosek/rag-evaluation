Exactly solvable models that exhibit quantum signatures of classical chaos are both rare as well as important - more so in view of the fact that the mechanisms for ergodic behavior and thermalization in isolated quantum systems and its connections to non-integrability are under active investigation. In this work, we study quantum systems of few qubits collectively modeled as a kicked top, a textbook example of quantum chaos. In particular, we show that the 3 and 4 qubit cases are exactly solvable and yet, interestingly, can display signatures of ergodicity and thermalization. Deriving analytical expressions for entanglement entropy and concurrence, we see agreement in certain parameter regimes between long-time average values and ensemble averages of random states with permutation symmetry. Comparing with results using the data of a recent transmons based experiment realizing the 3-qubit case, we find agreement for short times, including a peculiar step-like behaviour in correlations of some states.

As the surface Andreev bound state (ABS) forms at the open ($1,1$) edge of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductor, the local density of states (LDOS) increases. Therefore, a strong electron correlation and drastic phenomena may occur. However, a theoretical study on the effects of the ABS on the electron correlation has not been performed yet. To understand these effects, we study large cluster Hubbard model with an open ($1,1$) edge in the presence of a bulk $d$-wave gap. We calculate the site-dependent spin susceptibility by performing random-phase-approximation (RPA) and modified fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation in the real space. We find that near the ($1,1$) edge, drastic ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations occur owing to the ABS. In addition, as the temperature decreases, the system rapidly approaches a magnetic-order phase slightly below the transition temperature of the bulk $d$-wave superconductivity (SC). In this case, the FM fluctuations are expected to induce interesting phenomena such as edge-induced triplet SC and quantum critical phenomena."}, "answer": "Here is the difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the expected outcome of the drastic ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations occurring near the ($1,1$) edge of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductor in the presence of a surface Andreev bound state (ABS)?\n\nA) The system will rapidly approach a paramagnetic phase.\nB) The system will exhibit a strong suppression of superconductivity.\nC) The system will rapidly approach a magnetic-order phase slightly below the transition temperature of the bulk $d$-wave superconductivity (SC).\nD) The system will undergo a phase transition to a topological insulator.\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) The system will rapidly approach a magnetic-order phase slightly below the transition temperature of the bulk $d$-wave superconductivity (SC).\n\n**Explanation:** According to the study, the drastic FM fluctuations near the ($1,1$) edge of the superconductor lead to the system rapidly approaching a magnetic-order phase slightly below the transition temperature of the bulk $d$-wave superconductivity (SC).

Which of your team's possible lineups has the best chances against each of your opponents possible lineups? In order to answer this question we develop LinNet.

The nodes of this network represent the different lineups, while an edge from node j to node i exists if lineup i has outperformed lineup j. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute). We then utilize this structure to learn a set of latent features for each node (i.e., lineup) using the node2vec framework.

Under appropriate hypotheses, our Active Manifolds (AM) method identifies a 1-D curve in the domain (the active manifold) on which nearly all values of the unknown function are attained, and which can be exploited for approximation or analysis, especially when $m$ is large (high-dimensional input space). We provide theorems justifying our AM technique and an algorithm permitting functional approximation and sensitivity analysis. Using accessible, low-dimensional functions as initial examples, we show AM reduces approximation error by an order of magnitude compared to AS, at the expense of more computation. Following this, we revisit the sensitivity analysis by Glaws et al. (2017), who apply AS to analyze a magnetohydrodynamic power generator model, and compare the performance of AM on the same data. Our analysis provides detailed information not captured by AS, exhibiting the influence of each parameter individually along an active manifold. Overall, AM represents a novel technique for analyzing functional models with benefits including: reducing $m$-dimensional analysis to a 1-D analogue, permitting more accurate regression than AS (at more computational expense), enabling more informative sensitivity analysis, and granting accessible visualizations(2-D plots) of parameter sensitivity along the AM."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** What is the primary advantage of the Active Manifolds (AM) method over the Active Subspaces (AS) method, and how does it impact the analysis of high-dimensional functional models?\n\n**A)** AM reduces the dimensionality of analysis to a 1-D analogue, allowing for more accurate regression and sensitivity analysis, but at the expense of increased computational complexity.\n\n**B)** AM provides more detailed information about the influence of each parameter on the function, but reduces the dimensionality of analysis to a 1-D analogue, which can lead to reduced accuracy in regression.\n\n**C)** AM enables more informative sensitivity analysis and grants accessible visualizations of parameter sensitivity along the active manifold, but does not reduce the dimensionality of analysis.\n\n**D)** AM reduces the dimensionality of analysis to a 1-D analogue, but does not provide more accurate regression or sensitivity analysis, and may lead to reduced accuracy in analysis.\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) AM reduces the dimensionality of analysis to a 1-D analogue, allowing for more accurate regression and sensitivity analysis, but at the expense of increased computational complexity.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct answer is A) because the documentation states that the AM method \"reduces $m$-dimensional analysis to a 1-D analogue\", which allows for more accurate regression and sensitivity analysis.

Those ages do not generally agree with the characteristic ages of the (proposed) associated magnetars. We show quantitatively that, by taking into account the energy injected on the supernova remnant by magnetar spin-down, a faster expansion results, improving matches between characteristic ages and supernova remnants ages.

The spin-transfer-torque-driven (STT-driven) dynamics of a domain wall in an easy-axis rare-earth transition-metal ferrimagnet is investigated theoretically and numerically in the vicinity of the angular momentum compensation point $T_A$, where the net spin density vanishes. The particular focus is given on the unusual interaction of the antiferromagnetic dynamics of a ferrimagnetic domain wall and the adiabatic component of STT, which is absent in antiferromagnets but exists in the ferrimagnets due to the dominant coupling of conduction electrons to transition-metal spins. Specifically, we first show that the STT-induced domain-wall velocity changes its sign across $T_A$ due to the sign change of the net spin density, giving rise to a phenomenon unique to ferrimagnets that can be used to characterize $T_A$ electrically. It is also shown that the frequency of the STT-induced domain-wall precession exhibits its maximum at $T_A$ and it can approach the spin-wave gap at sufficiently high currents. Lastly, we report a numerical observation that, as the current density increases, the domain-wall velocity starts to deviate from the linear-response result, calling for a more comprehensive theory for the domain-wall dynamics in ferrimagnets driven by a strong current."}, "answer": "Here is a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\n**Question:** The dynamics of a domain wall in ferrimagnets driven by spin-transfer torque is investigated in the vicinity of the angular momentum compensation point $T_A$.
