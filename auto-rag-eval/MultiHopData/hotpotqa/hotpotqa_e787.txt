The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.  The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship.  The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage.

History
Beginning in 1890, Colorado football has enjoyed much success throughout its more than 135 years of competitive play.
The Buffaloes have appeared in numerous bowl games (28 appearances in bowl games (12–16), 36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990.Folsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season.

Championships
National championships
Colorado won one national championship in football for 1990.: 120 
1990 season
Colorado won the national championship in 1990 under the direction of head coach Bill McCartney, who helmed the team from 1982 to 1994. While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls.  Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster. Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.

Conference championships
Colorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences.

Head coaches
The Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014. In those seasons, 11 coaches have led Colorado to postseason bowl games: Bunny Oakes, Dallas Ward, Marcel M. Mazur, Bud Davis, Eddie Crowder, Bill Mallory, Bill McCartney, Rick Neuheisel, Gary Barnett, Dan Hawkins, Mike MacIntyre and Karl Dorrell. Ten coaches have won conference championships with the Buffaloes: Fred Folsom, Myron Witham, William Saunders, Oakes, Jim Yeager, Sonny Grandelius, Mallory, McCartney and Barnett. The Buffaloes won the national championship in 1990, and have won a total of 28 conference championships.
McCartney is the all-time leader in games coached with 153, total wins with 93, and conference wins with 58. Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15 seasons. Harry Heller and Willis Keinholtz are tied for the highest overall winning percentage. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. Davis, in terms of overall winning percentage, is the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .200 winning percentage. No Colorado coach has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, although McCartney was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996.
Mike MacIntyre had brief success with the program. Hired on Dec. 10, 2012, MacIntyre compiled a 30–44 record over five-plus seasons at Colorado. In 2016, MacIntyre lead Colorado to a 10-2 regular season and a trip to the Pac-12 Championship Game. It was the first winning season for Colorado since 2005, ending a 10-year streak of finishing below .500. 2016 was also the best season for the Buffaloes since 2001. As well, it marked their first time playing in a conference championship game since the 2005 Big 12 Championship Game. The team also went 8–2 in the Pac-12 after having five conference wins in the previous five seasons. Mike MacIntyre was named the Walter Camp 2016 Coach of the Year by the Walter Camp Foundation, the second Colorado football coach to earn the honor (Bill McCartney in 1989). MacIntyre was also awarded the 2016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year, American Football Coaches Association's coach of the year and comeback coach of the year awards, the Associated Press coach of the year, and the Eddie Robinson coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America. In 2018, the Buffaloes started out the season 5–0 with wins against rivals Colorado State, Nebraska, Arizona State, and UCLA - however, MacIntyre was fired as the head coach on November 18, 2018, after a six-game losing streak.Mike Sanford was named interim Head Coach after Karl Dorrell was fired during the 2022 season, Sanford was previously the Buffaloes Offensive Coordinator for the start of the 2022 campaign. On December 3, Colorado announced Deion Sanders as Head Football Coach.

Rivalries
Nebraska
A traditional college football rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers restarted in the 1980s (many historical documents show the importance of this game going back to 1898) when Bill McCartney declared the conference opponent to be their rival. His theory was since Nebraska was such a powerhouse team, if Colorado was able to beat them then they would be a good team. Colorado began to repeatedly threaten Nebraska in the late 1980s, following their win over the Huskers in 1986, and then surpassed the Huskers for the Big 8 crown in 1989.
In 1990, Colorado beat Nebraska 27–12 in Lincoln for the first time since 1967, en route to their first national title. From 1996 to 2000, the series was extremely competitive, with the margin of victory by NU in those five years being only 15 points combined. The rivalry was further buoyed by the introduction of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, which moved Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to the southern division with the four new schools from Texas, formerly in the Southwest Conference. Nebraska had traditionally finished the Big 8 conference schedule with a rivalry game with Oklahoma, but the two were now in different divisions, which meant they met every other year in the regular season. Colorado replaced Oklahoma as Nebraska's final conference game of the regular season, which further intensified the rivalry. In 2001 No. 1 Nebraska came to Folsom Field undefeated and left at the short end of a nationally televised 62–36 blowout. Both teams departed the Big 12 in 2011, as NU headed east to join the Big Ten and the future of the rivalry was in doubt. On February 7, 2013, Colorado and Nebraska agreed to renew the rivalry. Colorado traveled to Lincoln in 2018 and won 33–28 (winning against Nebraska for the first time since 2007 and the first time in Lincoln since 2004). On September 7, 2019, Colorado mounted an improbable comeback after being down 17–0 at half, to win the game in overtime, 34–31. After a 3-year break, Nebraska will go to Boulder in 2023 and then host CU again the next year to finish the series. Nebraska leads the series 49–20–2 through the 2019 season.

Colorado State
Colorado's in-state rival is the Colorado State Rams of the Mountain West Conference, located north of Boulder in Fort Collins. The two schools are separated by 45 miles (72 km) and both consider it important and noteworthy to beat the other for bragging rights for the next year. The two football teams annually compete in the Rocky Mountain Showdown for the Centennial Cup, played in Denver, Fort Collins, and Boulder. The trophy takes its name from the state of Colorado's nickname of "The Centennial State". Colorado leads the series 67–22–2 through the 2019 season.

Utah
The rivalry with Utah ran from 1903 to 1962, in which Utah and Colorado played each other nearly every year; through 1962 they had met 57 times. At the time, it was the second-most played rivalry for both teams (Utah had played Utah State 62 times; Colorado had played Colorado State 61 times). The rivalry was dormant until 2011, when both teams joined the Pac-12, renewing the rivalry on an annual basis. The Colorado–Utah rivalry remains the fifth-most played rivalry in Utah's history, and eighth-most in Colorado's history. Utah leads the series 34-32-3 through the 2022 season.

Bowl games
Colorado has participated in 29 bowl games, with a record of 12–17 (.414).

Passage 6:
Roy Roundtree
Roy Randolph Roundtree (born March 7, 1989) is a former American football wide receiver and current assistant coach for the Grand Valley State Lakers. He was a 2013 preseason member of the Cincinnati Bengals and played college football for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he spent his redshirt senior season with the 2012 team. In 2012, he was an All-Big Ten honorable mention selection. He was a 2011 Fred Biletnikoff Award preseason watchlist honoree. He was a Fred Biletnikoff Award preseason watchlist honoree in 2010, and set Michigan's single-game receiving record with nine catches for 246 yards against Illinois that November. Roundtree was the team's leading receiver in both the 2009 and 2010 seasons. He finished first in the Big Ten Conference in receiving yards in 2010 for Conference games, and was a second team All Conference selection. While in high school, he was named the 2007 Ohio Division II Offensive Player of the Year.

Early life and high school
Roundtree started playing football on the Pee-Wee Dayton Flames in first grade. He played on the team until junior high, joined by his Michigan teammate Michael Shaw, who, because he was eight months older than Roundtree, played in a different level.  Roundtree was a two-year starter at Belmont High School in Dayton, Ohio before he transferred to Trotwood-Madison High School, where the team's head football coach was retired National Football League player Maurice Douglass.As a freshman, he earned Dayton Daily News Athlete of the Week honors, but in 2004–05, Belmont was classified as an "academic emergency" by the state of Ohio because over a 25% of the students were considered to be "students with disabilities", and the school's standardized test scores were over 50 percent lower than the state benchmarks. With the dismal academic situation and a mediocre athletic program, Belmont left Roundtree dissatisfied, and he transferred to Trotwood before his junior year, where coach Douglass had earned a reputation for developing college ready football players, and where former Flames teammate Domonick Britt was playing quarterback.At Trotwood, he was a teammate of Shaw and Brandon Moore who would later join him at Michigan. As a junior in 2006, he posted 48 receptions for 851 yards, and as a senior, he totalled 868 on 52 catches. His four-year totals were 165 receptions for 2,637 yards and 28 touchdowns. As a senior, he was selected to the Division II first-team all-state squad, and named Ohio's offensive player of the year. He was also chosen to play in the Big 33 Football Classic, and ranked as the number 44, 89, and 104 wide receiver in the nation by Rivals.com, Scout.com, and ESPN, respectively. In that same year, Trotwood won their first playoff game since 1981, led by Roundtree's 13 receptions, 203 yards, and game-winning touchdown. Roundtree feels that his best game in high school was a 12-reception, 221-yard, 2-touchdown performance that helped his team overcome a 21–0 deficit.Roundtree had scholarship offers from Eastern Michigan, Illinois, Purdue, Nebraska and Miami. He was considered a Purdue commit until getting a late scholarship offer from Michigan, which was his preferred school. On signing day, his uncle convinced him to go to Michigan because of its winning tradition. The late switch led Purdue head coach Joe Tiller to cast aspersions on Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez, referring to him as a snake oil salesman.

College
Roundtree redshirted for the 2008 season. He made his college debut on September 5, 2009 against the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium as a slot receiver. That year, he roomed with Trotwood teammates Shaw and Moore. He had just two receptions in the first eight games of the season while playing as a backup. He became a starter for the team's final four games, and finished as the leading receiver for the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team in terms of both yards and receptions per game, despite the limited playing time. One of the two early-season receptions occurred on October 3 against Michigan State in the Paul Bunyan Trophy game when he caught the game-tying touchdown with two seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. He made his first start on October 31 against the Illinois Fighting Illini as a slot receiver. On November 7, against Purdue he had ten receptions for 126 yards. He also had nine receptions for 116 yards in the November 21, 2009 game against the rival Ohio State Buckeyes. Following the season, he was named a CollegeFootballNews.com Freshman All-America honorable mention, and a Sporting News Freshman All-Big Ten selection.

Roundtree made the 2010 preseason watchlist for the Biletnikoff Award, which honors the nation's top wide receiver. He led Michigan's 2010 team in both receptions, and receiving yards. In the September 11 game versus the rival Notre Dame Fighting Irish, his 15-yard reception late in the fourth quarter put the ball on the Notre Dame 2-yard-line. On the next play, Denard Robinson ran in for the game-winning touchdown with 27 seconds remaining. He posted back-to-back 100-yard receiving games on September 25, and October 2, 2010, recording nine receptions for 119 yards in a home game against the Bowling Green Falcons, and five receptions for 126 yards and a touchdown versus the Indiana Hoosiers. At the midpoint of Michigan's 12-game regular season schedule, he ranked fifth in the Big Ten in receptions per game, and seventh in receiving yards. In Michigan's 67–65 victory over Illinois on November 6, Roundtree broke Jack Clancy's all-time Michigan single-game receiving yards record when he caught nine passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns, including a 75-yard touchdown reception on the game's first play from scrimmage. The record stood until October 19, 2013, when Jeremy Gallon posted a Big Ten record 369 yards against Indiana. The performance raised him to fourth in the conference in both yards and receptions (tied) per game, and earned him Co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors. He ended the 2010 regular season third in the Conference in receiving yards, and fourth in receptions for all games. After a slow start, which included negative one yards receiving in the team's first game, and a total of less than 100 yards in their first three contests, Roundtree led the Big Ten with 83.9 receiving yards per conference game. After the regular season, he was named to the All Conference second team by the media.  He finished the year, third in the conference in receiving yards per game (71.92) and fourth in receptions per game (5.54) for all games.

Roundtree repeated as a Biletnikoff Award preseason watchlist honoree in 2011. On September 10, against Notre Dame, during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, his only reception was the game-winning 16-yard touchdown with two seconds remaining in the game.

Passage 8:
Hogan Wharton
Robert Glen "Hogan" Wharton (December 13, 1935 – October 8, 2008) was an American football player.  He attended the University of Houston where he played college football at the tackle position for the Houston Cougars football team from 1956 to 1958.  He was named lineman of the year in the Missouri Valley Conference in 1957, and the following year he was selected by the American Football Coaches Association as a first-team tackle on its 1958 College Football All-America Team. Wharton later played professional football in the newly formed American Football League, playing at the guard position for the Houston Oilers during the first four years of the club's existence from 1960 to 1963, including the 1960 Houston Oilers team that won the first AFL championship. He was cut by the Oilers in September 1964.
Passage 9:
Charlie O'Rourke
Charles Christopher "Chuckin' Charlie" O'Rourke (May 10, 1917 – April 14, 2000) was an American football player and coach.  He played college football as a quarterback at Boston College and professionally with Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) and the Los Angeles Dons and Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC).  O'Rourke quarterbacked the Boston College Eagles football team to one of its most famous wins.  His 24-yard run late in the fourth quarter gave the 1940 Eagles a 19–13 victory over Tennessee in the 1941 Sugar Bowl, staking BC's claim to a national championship.  O'Rourke served as the head football coach at University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) from 1952 to 1959, compiling a record of 21–39–4.  In 1972, he came the first Boston College player to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Early life
Born in 1917, O'Rourke grew up in Malden, Massachusetts and played football at Malden High School.

Boston College
Although all of his records have been broken, O'Rourke was one of Boston College's first star quarterbacks. In three seasons, he completed 69 of 150 passes for 1,108 yards and 14 touchdowns.

1940 season
The 1940 team is perhaps the greatest football team in the history of Boston College. After the previous year's team earned the school's first appearance in a bowl game (Boston College lost to Clemson in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic) O'Rourke's running backs included veterans Frank Maznicki, Lou Montgomery (Boston College's first African-American football player), and team captain Henry Toczylowski. They were joined by a talented newcomer named Mike Holovak. The team also had wonderful receivers including Henry Woronicz, Gene Goodreault, Ed Zabilski, and Don Currivan. The team was undefeated outscoring its opponents 320–52 and held six teams scoreless. Boston College impressed the sports community by defeating Tulane 27–7 in the second week of the season and defeating Georgetown 19–18, snapping Georgetown's streak of twenty-two consecutive wins. On January 1, 1941, Boston College defeated Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, 19–13. BC claims it won the national title in a three-way tie with Stanford and Minnesota, however the NCAA does not recognize Boston College as a national champion in that year.

Professional career
O'Rourke was drafted in the fifth round of the 1941 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. O'Rourke's professional career began in 1942 with the Chicago Bears. He saw limited playing time behind incumbent starter Sid Luckman, completing 37 of 88 passes for 951 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. The 11 touchdowns set a new Bears rookie record which still stands. O'Rourke also intercepted three passes on defense, returned two punts, and made 23 punts for 817 yards for the 11–0 Bears. 
After three years in the Navy, O'Rourke returned to football in 1946 with the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In two seasons in Los Angeles he completed 194 of 354 passes for 2,699 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 30 interceptions. In 1948 he joined the AAFC's Baltimore Colts as a punter and back up quarterback behind Y. A. Tittle. In 1949, he played only five games before retiring and becoming an assistant coach for Baltimore until the team folded in 1950.

Coaching career
Aside from his two years as an NFL coach, O'Rourke was head football coach at University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) from 1952 to 1959. In seasons he compiled a 21–39–4 record with only one winning season (1952).

O'Rourke–McFadden Trophy
To honor the famed meeting between O'Rourke and Banks McFadden in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic, the O'Rourke–McFadden Trophy was introduced in 2008 and is awarded to the winner of the annual football game between Boston College and Clemson. The game is in-conference rivalry since Boston College joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2005, and both teams play in the ACC's Atlantic Division.

Passage 10:
Abe Mickal
Ibrahim Khalil "Abe" Mickal (c. 1912/1913  – September 20, 2001) was a Lebanese-American college football player and a doctor. He played as a halfback for the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University, where he was notable for his passing skills and play-making ability, which earned him the nickname "Miracle Mickal". He was also the team's primary punter and placekicker. A three-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection, Mickal led LSU to an undefeated season in 1933 and a conference championship and Sugar Bowl in 1935. In 1936, Mickal played quarterback for a college all-star team that was the first team of college players to defeat a professional team. Although selected in the 1936 NFL Draft, he did not play professionally. Mickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967.
In addition to football, Mickal was a cadet in LSU's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and as a senior was president of the university's student body. While a student, he was offered a seat in the Louisiana State Senate by U.S. Senator and noted LSU supporter Huey Long, which he declined. He earned his medical degree in 1940, and after serving in World War II began a lifelong career in obstetrics and gynecology. He served as head professor of the LSU Medical School OB/GYN department for over twenty years. Actively involved in various university affairs during and after his time as a student, Mickal was honored as LSU's "Alumnus of the Year" in 1980.

Early life and education
Mickal was born in the Levant in an area that is today part of Lebanon. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1920, where they arrived on Ellis Island. He settled in McComb, Mississippi and attended McComb High School, where he played football, baseball, and basketball and ran track. His father Kalil, who ran a local general store, was initially against his son playing sports. "It was an old Lebanese custom," Mickal later explained, "that the eldest son take over the business. My father wasn't aware that I was playing." His father was eventually persuaded by the townspeople to let his son play. During his senior year, he was recruited by LSU and Notre Dame to play football, and ultimately chose the Tigers after the death of Notre Dame head coach Knute Rockne.

College
Mickal was an all-around player; a triple-threat running back who also played on defense. He was regarded as an excellent deep-ball passer; in the words of LSU coach Lawrence "Biff" Jones: "Mickal is a greater passer than Red Cagle—he's the greatest I ever saw." Jones was Cagle's coach while at Army. One sportswriter referred to Mickal as "the Dizzy Dean of the nation's forward passers." He was also known for his play-making ability during crucial moments of games, and LSU compiled a win–loss record of 23–4–5 in the three seasons Mickal played for the team.

1933
Mickal showed his versatility in the first game of the 1933 season against Rice, tossing a 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and booting punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20–0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line dive into the end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7–0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback.

1934
One of Mickal's most notable games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two touchdown passes, the first one a 32-yarder to tie the game at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass down the middle of the field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.

Senatorship offer
During the season, Mickal was acclaimed an honorary Louisiana State Senator by U.S. Senator Huey P. Long, whom he had befriended, at a burlesque campus meeting. Long was a noted LSU supporter and was highly involved in operations of the football program. When it came time for his ceremonial "seating" Mickal refused to appear for the ceremony, despite the urging of Long. After Long reasoned with the senate and spectators that Mickal "had to study," Mickal was granted a five-day leave of absence by senator Harvey Peltier to "do his work at school and go forward with his preparation for his football duties." Mickal remained silent on the matter, however; he did not give a reason for his refusal of the honor. The day he was to be inducted, Mickal said in a telegram to Long that if he accepted the senatorship he would introduce a joint resolution that made it "unlawful" for any Tulane player to cross the LSU goal line in 1934.

1935
Mickal had a slow start to 1935 while he recovered from a broken ankle he suffered over the summer. In week three, he threw two touchdown passes against Manhattan College, and a game-winning touchdown pass against Vanderbilt two weeks later. In the regular season finale, Mickal was responsible for three touchdowns in a 41–0 win over rival Tulane. LSU faced the TCU Horned Frogs at the end of the season in the Sugar Bowl, in a game that was a highly anticipated match-up between Mickal and the Horned Frogs' Sammy Baugh. The offenses were unable to do much, however, as rain throughout the day had muddied the field. TCU won the game, 3–2. LSU finished the season undefeated in conference play for its first SEC championship. Mickal was named to the AP All-SEC second-team as a fullback after the season, and earned second-team All-America honors from Liberty magazine.

1936 All-Stars vs. Bears
In September 1936, Mickal played quarterback for the Centennial College All-Stars, a team composed of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive into the end zone from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. "A lot of things flashed through my mind," explained Mickal. "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought about going to med school. I thought about possible brain damage." He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.

Extracurricular
Mickal was actively involved in the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps. He received the Outstanding Cadet Award as a freshman and was regimental sergeant major as a junior. As a senior, he attained the rank of Cadet Colonel and earned the Kemper Williams Sabre as the school's outstanding cadet. Additionally, he was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and in 1936 was president of the school's Interfraternity Council, college of arts and sciences, and student body. Mickal was a member of the Theta Kappa Nu fraternity.

Medical career
Mickal was the first player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, selected in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in obstetrics and gynecology at New Orleans Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in until his retirement in 1980. He was a founding member of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center.

Honors
Mickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1967, the National Football Foundation named Mickal to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1969 and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. Mickal was named LSU's "Alumnus of the Year" in 1980 and its "Medical Alumnus of the Year" in 1985. "It's been a beautiful marriage—and I've had all the better of it," said Mickal of his involvement with the university. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists gave Mickal its Distinguished Service Award in 1991.
