This is due to the fact that a low power factor indicates that the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the average product of the two. As a result, more current flows in the circuit than would be required to transfer real power alone. This leads to increased energy losses in the distribution system and the need for larger wires and other equipment. Consequently, electrical utilities often charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers with low power factors. What is the primary reason for the increased cost to customers with low power factors?",
