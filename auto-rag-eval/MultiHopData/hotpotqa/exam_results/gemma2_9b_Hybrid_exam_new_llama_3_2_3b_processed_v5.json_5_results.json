    "question": "The British government's decision to support the French in the Maginot Line during World War II was influenced by the lessons learned from David Lloyd George's experience with the Alexandretta project in 1917. However, this approach was later criticized by General Archibald Wavell, who had witnessed the failure of the Maginot Line to prevent the German invasion of France. Wavell's views on defense were shaped by his time as Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force in France, where he witnessed the failure of the Maginot Line to prevent the German invasion. This experience led Wavell to advocate for a more mobile and flexible defense strategy, one that would allow for rapid response to changing circumstances. In contrast, the Italian invasion of Egypt in 1940, led by General Erwin Rommel, highlighted the need for a more adaptable defense strategy. The Italian invasion of Egypt was a result of the failure of the British to provide adequate air support and supplies to the 6th Australian Division, which was tasked with defending the region. The British government's decision to support the French in the Maginot Line was seen as a failure to learn from the lessons of the Alexandretta project and the Italian invasion of Egypt.",

In response to the phone-tapping scandal, Haughey described the affair as \"grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented\". This phrase, coined by Conor Cruise O'Brien, became known as GUBU. Later, a report linked Haughey with the phone tapping of political journalists, but he refused to resign.

Considering the historical context of Afro-Cuban exclusion from economic and political power, and the negative stereotypes surrounding Santer\u00eda, it is clear that the religion has always been a primarily urban phenomenon in Cuba. In the 1990s, Wedel noted that Santer\u00eda was more common in working-class, low-income neighborhoods dominated by Afro-Cubans.
