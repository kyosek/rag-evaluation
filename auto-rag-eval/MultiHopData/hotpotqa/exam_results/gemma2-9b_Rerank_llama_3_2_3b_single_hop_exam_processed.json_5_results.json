According to some, virtue is a means to achieve eudaimonia, while others argue that virtue and eudaimonia are identical. However, Socrates's own views on the matter seem to be more nuanced. In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates implies that \"no one errs willingly\", which suggests that people are motivated by a desire to do good. This view is also supported by Socrates's discussion of the actions of a tyrant in the Gorgias, where he argues that such actions are ultimately self-destructive. Nevertheless, scholars have noted that Socrates's views on akrasia, or acting against one's knowledge or beliefs, seem to be at odds with this perspective.

This contrast is also reflected in their physical appearances, with the White Queen being a more subdued and naturalistic representation, whereas the Red Queen's appearance is based on England's Queen Elizabeth I and features digital manipulation to amplify her features. Furthermore, the Red Queen's behavior towards animals is also noteworthy, as she chooses to use them as servants and furniture, implying a disregard for their well-being. Considering the Red Queen's backstory, which involves the beheading of her late husband, the King, and her tyrannical behavior, it can be inferred that her relationship with her sister is likely strained.
