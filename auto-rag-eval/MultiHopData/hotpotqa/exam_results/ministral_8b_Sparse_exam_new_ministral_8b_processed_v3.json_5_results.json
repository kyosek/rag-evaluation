The project was initially estimated to cost \u00a360 million but eventually ballooned to \u00a3185 million. The bridge was to feature trees and shrubs, with a design that required the felling of mature trees, including 28 plane trees planted in the 1960s. The bridge was also to have a restricted access policy, banning groups of eight or more people and cyclists, and was to be open for 18 hours a day. The project was opposed by critics who argued that it was a vanity project and that the funds could be better used elsewhere. Despite initial support from Boris Johnson, the project was eventually abandoned due to financial concerns and a lack of public support. The project's total public cost was \u00a343 million.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true?",
