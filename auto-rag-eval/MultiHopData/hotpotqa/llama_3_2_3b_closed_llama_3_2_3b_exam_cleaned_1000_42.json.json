This classification is also reflected in the etymology of the word \"ombike\", which is derived from the Greek words \"ana\" meaning \"upward\" and \"cardium\" meaning \"heart\". The use of ombike as a liquor is also linked to the historical trade of Commiphora gileadensis, also known as the Arabian balsam tree, which was renowned for its medicinal properties and expensive perfume. In some parts of Africa, the bark of the balsam tree is still chewed to produce a sweet-smelling resin, which is said to have a flavor similar to pine resin. However, the production of ombike is not limited to the use of balsam tree bark, as it can also be brewed from other ingredients such as jackal berries and buffalo thorns.",

This license was later differentiated from the bachelor's degree (baccalaureus) and master's degree (magister), which became the accepted teaching qualifications. The modern doctorate, as we know it today, was formalized in the 19th century, with the establishment of the University of Berlin's doctoral program in 1810. However, the concept of the doctorate has evolved over time, and its meaning and significance vary across different countries and regions. In some countries, the doctorate is seen as a prerequisite for an academic career, while in others, it is viewed as a professional degree that requires a minimum of six years of university-level study.",

    "question": "The pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides is known for his poem \"On Nature\" which explores the nature of reality. According to Aristotle, Parmenides believed that the universe is governed by a rational law, which is a fundamental idea in Stoic philosophy. However, some scholars argue that Parmenides' views on the nature of reality are more closely aligned with the ideas of Heraclitus, who believed that the universe is in a state of constant flux. Furthermore, the Pythagoreans, who were influenced by Parmenides' ideas, believed that the universe is made up of numbers and that everything can be reduced to mathematical relationships. Finally, the Eleatics, who were also influenced by Parmenides' ideas, believed that the universe is a single, unified whole. What is the central idea that underlies the philosophical views of Parmenides, as expressed in his poem \"On Nature\"?",
