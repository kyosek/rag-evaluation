Passage 2:
Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary
Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (MBTS) is a Private Baptist seminary in Kansas City, Missouri. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary also houses an undergraduate college, Spurgeon College (formerly known as Midwestern College).

History
Midwestern Seminary was officially founded on May 29, 1957, when the Southern Baptist Convention voted to establish the institution and elected a board of trustees. Since that time, the trustees have been regularly and exclusively elected by the Southern Baptist Convention. Under the leadership of the original board of trustees, the seminary was established in 1958 in northern Kansas City, Missouri, with six faculty members and 136 students. Most of the property on which the seminary is housed was donated by the Vivion family; the Vivion farmhouse has been restored and is now the official residence of the seminary's presidential family.Doctrinally, MBTS is guided by the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. Every member of the faculty and administration is required to sign a statement agreeing to the precepts of this document. While students are required to be Christians, they are not required to affirm the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. The purpose statement of Midwestern Seminary was revised in 2008 to read, "Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary serves the church by biblically educating God-called men and women to be and to make disciples of Jesus Christ."
Jason K. Allen was installed as president in 2012 and began revitalization. The seminary almost tripled in size in the next five years, becoming one of the fastest-growing seminaries in North America and one of the largest in the world. Enrollment has nearly tripled in five years, from 1,107 in the 2010–2011 academic year to surpassing 3,000 students in 2017–2018.The seminary was granted an exception to Title IX in 2016 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

Campus
Midwestern Seminary is located in Kansas City, Missouri, at the intersection of Vivion Rd. and N. Oak Trafficway, a few minutes from downtown. A new 1,000 seat auditorium, The Daniel Lee Chapel, was dedicated in April 2014. Other recent improvements to the campus include the O.S. Hawkins Courtyard and the Charles Spurgeon Library.
The campus includes dormitory and apartment buildings for residential students, playground and picnic areas, a modest fishing pond, and over 220 acres of woods. The Sword & Trowel Bookstore is also located on campus.
In 2016, the seminary announced plans to build a new Student Center on the north slope of the campus, using a $7 million lead gift by the Mathena family of Oklahoma City. Construction on this project—which includes a gymnasium, fitness center, faculty offices, cafeteria, coffee shop, bookstore, and expanded study center, and which includes exterior plans for sports fields—concluded in 2018. The 40,000 square foot center opened for the Fall 2018 semester.

The Spurgeon Center and Library
The Spurgeon Library houses the remaining personal collection of Charles Spurgeon, which Midwestern Seminary acquired from William Jewell College in 2006. The dedication of the library took place in October 2015, and the Seminary is now working to digitize the collection and publish new volumes of previously undiscovered sermons. Geoff Chang serves as the curator of the collection, which also includes artifacts from Spurgeon's life and ministry, among them his personal writing desk, travel kit, and the metalwork from his study door. The library interior is appointed in academic "Oxford style" and includes portraits highlighting the life of Spurgeon commissioned by Christian T. George and Midwestern Seminary of the Romanian artist Petru Botezatu.

For The Church
Since Allen's installation as president of Midwestern Seminary, the institution has emphasized "For The Church" as its vision statement for academic and institutional renewal, seeking to re-connect the purpose of theological education to the support and strengthening of local churches. This vision has been manifested in numerous events and resources, including Midwestern's website For The Church and the annual For The Church national conference held in Kansas City, which has featured internationally renowned speakers Matt Chandler, H.B. Charles Jr., Russell Moore, David Platt, and Ray Ortlund Jr.

Academics
MBTS is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The seminary is accredited to offer several master's degrees that are generally classified as Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Master of Arts. Midwestern also offers an MTS (Master of Theological Studies) degree and a Graduate Certificate in Christian Foundations for Lay Ministers.
At the doctoral level, MBTS offers professional doctorates: Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), Doctor of Educational Ministry (D.Ed.Min.), and a research doctorate Doctor of Philosophy in Biblical Studies. The seminary also has a Korean language track for its Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Educational Ministry, Doctor of Education, and Doctor of Ministry degrees and a Spanish language track for its Doctor of Ministry degree.
Spurgeon College offers a variety of undergraduate degrees in ministry, missions, and theology, as well as degrees in leadership, counseling psychology, and philosophy. Through the Accelerate program undergrads may earn both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Divinity degree simultaneously in a rigorous five-year course of study. Associate degrees are also available through the college. Undergrad students interested in pursuing a call to mission work may also participate in Midwestern's Fusion program, a training cohort partially funded by the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention which includes cultural studies, physical training, and stints overseas to better prepare future missionaries for the realities of their work.
Since 2010, Midwestern Seminary offers both graduate and undergraduate degrees entirely online, through the Online You program. Available degrees include the standard M.Div., MTS, and BA, with select concentrations available as well.
Most recently, Midwestern has provided incentives for residential education, including the Timothy Track, which partners M.Div students with local churches to serve in internship programs, and The Residency, a contextual component of the standard doctoral program that facilitates immediate application of academic training.

Passage 3:
Temple Baptist Seminary
Temple Baptist Seminary is the graduate school of Christian theology of Piedmont International University. Originally established as "Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary" in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1948, the name was changed to Temple Baptist Theological Seminary five years later, after the Southern Baptist Convention founded its own Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. The seminary became a part of Piedmont when its parent school, Tennessee Temple University, merged with it in 2015.
Temple Baptist Seminary was accredited in 2000 as part of Tennessee Temple University's Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) accreditation. Prior to that it was accredited by the American Association of Bible Colleges (now known as ABHE). Both ABHE and TRACS are accreditors recognized by the US Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

History
On July 3, 1946, Highland Park Baptist Church, under the leadership of the pastor, Lee Roberson, voted to establish Tennessee Temple College (now University). Then, recognizing the lack of sound Biblical training in the majority of the seminaries, Roberson led the church in establishing Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary on January 26, 1948. Roberson served as president, and Alfred Cierpke as dean. Five years later, the name was changed to Temple Baptist Theological Seminary since the Southern Baptist Convention founded a seminary by the former name. Since 1985, the institution has been known as Temple Baptist Seminary. In 1962, Douglas Cravens assumed the position of dean.
With the assumption of the presidency of the university and seminary by J. Don Jennings in 1985, Roger Martin was named dean.
In June 1993, the university and the seminary were restructured, placing each under the supervision of a separate Board of Trustees and administrative leadership, while maintaining the identity of each as owned by and a ministry of Highland Park Baptist Church. With respect to the seminary, Lee Roberson was reappointed chancellor, David E. Bouler, who had been the senior pastor of Highland Park Baptist Church since August 4, 1991, was named vice-chancellor and Barkev S. Trachian was elected president. The seminary charter was amended in August 1993, to make the name Temple Baptist Seminary official.
April 2005 saw the university and seminary restructured a second time, reuniting the two under the supervision of a single Board of Trustees and the administration of J. Danny Lovett, the seventh president of Tennessee Temple University, with Temple Baptist Seminary re-establishing itself as the premier graduate division as originally envisioned by the founder, Lee Roberson. This restructure was confirmed in late November 2005 by the university's and seminary's accrediting agency. Fixed firmly to its foundations, Temple Baptist Seminary is committed to training qualified candidates for dynamic leadership in Bible-believing churches and related field ministries, to shaping His shepherds, and to developing disciples with the unchanging Word of God on a global scale.
From the outset, the seminary has been committed to upholding the biblical faith historically believed by Baptists. In addition there has been a strong emphasis upon Bible teaching, Christian education, evangelism, and ministry endeavor. With the theme "Preparing for Leadership," TBS continues to expand its efforts to equip both church leaders and laypersons for the work of the ministry. In recent years, a program of winter and summer modular classes has been initiated. This program has become very popular with both resident and out-of-town students. Nearly all Temple Baptist Seminary's courses are available on-line, enabling studies anywhere worldwide!
Temple Baptist Seminary has matriculated students from almost every state and from many foreign countries. Many graduates have distinguished themselves as pastors, military and civilian chaplains, teachers, educators, missionaries, and evangelists.
As of January 2012, Steve Echols assumed the leadership role as president of Tennessee Temple University. He brings a vast array of experience and proven leadership in both academic and ministerial areas. In 2012, TTU realigned its academic programs into three colleges of schools. The Seminary became a part of the School of Theology and Ministry. Also in September 2012, Highland Park Baptist Church announced its visions to relocate to Harrison, TN and change its name to Church of the Highlands. During this transition, changes to the TTU by-laws were unanimously ratified by both the Board of Trustees of TTU and the deacon body of the Church of the Highlands. These by-law changes have ended the formal relationship between the two entities. Yet the heritage of Highland Park Baptist Church will remain an essential part of the lasting legacy of TTU.
At the 2013 Tennessee Baptist Convention Annual Meeting, TTU had a booth for the first time in the history of our school. It was a wonderful success resulting in many important contacts and connections being made with Tennessee Baptists. "Even more importantly", TTU President Steve Echols stated, "I am rejoicing over a historic moment for Tennessee Temple University." During the session, the Tennessee Baptist Convention Messengers unanimously adopted a resolution of support which "affirms the actions of Tennessee Temple University (in Chattanooga) in embracing Southern Baptist doctrine and Tennessee Baptist life."  In 2013, Howard D. Owens became the Interim Dean of the School of Theology and Ministry, under the presidency of Steven F. Echols.
Passage 4:
Russell D. Moore
Russell D. Moore (born 9 October 1971) is an American theologian, ethicist, and preacher. In June 2021, he became the director of the Public Theology Project at Christianity Today, and on August 4, 2022, was announced as the magazine's incoming Editor-in-Chief.Moore previously served as president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, the public-policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), and at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, as dean of the School of Theology, senior vice president for academic administration, and as professor of theology and ethics.

Early life and education
Moore was born and raised in the coastal town of Biloxi, Mississippi, the eldest son of Gary and Renee Moore. His grandfather was a Baptist preacher, and his grandmother was Roman Catholic. He earned a B.S. in political science and history from the University of Southern Mississippi, an M.Div. in biblical studies from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D. in systematic theology from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

Ministry
Moore served as associate pastor of Bay Vista Baptist Church in Biloxi, where he was ordained to gospel ministry.In 2001, Moore was appointed to the faculty of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. As Professor of Christian Theology and Ethics, Moore was responsible for teaching across a spectrum of topics including systematic theology, Christian ethics, church life, pastoral ministry, and cultural engagement. In addition to his role on the faculty, he also served as Executive Director of the Carl F. H. Henry Institute for Evangelical Engagement from 2001 to 2009. In 2004, Moore was named Dean of the School of Theology and Senior Vice President for Academic Administration.  In this role, in addition to his regular teaching and lecturing, Moore served as the chief academic officer of the seminary, responsible for all curriculum and the administration of the seminary. Beyond these roles, Moore served as Executive Editor of The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, and has served as Senior Editor for Touchstone Magazine and as Chairman of the Board for the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.
In 2008, he became pastor at Highview Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky until 2012. More broadly, Moore has served extensively within the Southern Baptist Convention, as chairman and four-time member of the Resolutions committee, as a member of the Ethics and Public Affairs Committee of the Kentucky Baptist Convention, and as a regular correspondent and columnist for Baptist Press.

ERLC Presidency
On June 1, 2013, Moore became President of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, the Southern Baptist Convention's official entity assigned to address social, moral, and ethical concerns. In this role, Moore led the organization, which maintains offices in both Nashville and Washington, D.C. in their advocacy efforts—addressing especially the issues of religious liberty, human dignity, family stability, and civil society.
Moore believes marriage is a union between a man and a woman. He accepted an invitation from Pope Francis to attend a Colloquium on Marriage at the Vatican, where he spoke on 18 November 2014.In 2014, Moore commented on gay conversion therapy, saying, "The utopian idea if you come to Christ and if you go through our program, you're going to be immediately set free from attraction or anything you're struggling with, I don't think that's a Christian idea. Faithfulness to Christ means obedience to Christ. It does not necessarily mean that someone's attractions are going to change." He added, "The Bible doesn't promise us freedom from temptation. The Bible promises us the power of the spirit to walk through temptation." Moore also said at that time that the Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission was working with parents of those who are gay and lesbian, adding, "The response is not shunning, putting them out on the street. The answer is loving your child."Moore's vocal criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election season drew a backlash from fellow Southern Baptists, triggering a crisis in which more than 100 churches threatened to withdraw donations to the denomination's Cooperative Program in protest of Moore's stances and leading to calls for his resignation. After Moore issued statements of apology in December 2016 and March 2017 for "using words… that were at times overly broad or unnecessarily harsh," Southern Baptist leaders affirmed their support for his leadership and he remained in his post.Moore resigned from the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission at the end of his term as president. He left the Southern Baptist Convention as well soon afterward; on June 1, 2021; Immanuel Nashville, an nondenominational church, thus unaffiliated with the SBC, announced Moore had joined its staff as a pastor in residence.

Christianity Today
Following his departure from the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, Moore was hired as a public theologian for the magazine Christianity Today. In 2022, he was named Christianity Today's Editor in Chief.

Personal views
Moore has spoken out against the display of the Confederate flag; in 2015, two days after the Charleston church shooting (in which nine black churchgoers were murdered in a hate crime), Moore wrote: "The cross and the Confederate flag cannot co-exist without one setting the other on fire. White Christians, let's listen to our African-American brothers and sisters. Let's care not just about our own history, but also about our shared history with them." Moore also condemned the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Nationalism and the Syrian refugee crisis
In 2015, during the Syrian refugee crisis, Moore wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post calling upon evangelical Christians to support refugee resettlement.  Moore criticized those who "demagogue the issue" and wrote: "evangelical Christians cannot be the people who turn our back on our mission field. We should be the ones calling the rest of the world to remember the image of God and inalienable human dignity, of persecuted people whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Yazidi, especially those fleeing from genocidal Islamic terrorists." Moore wrote that security and compassion are compatible. In a subsequent interview, Moore sharply criticized leading Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, stating that Trump's proposal to shut down mosques in the U.S. was a threat to religious liberty and that Cruz's proposal to impose a religious test for refugees would "penalize innocent women and children who are fleeing from murderous barbarians simply because they're not Christians."

Theological views
Moore writes from the perspective of a Baptist who affirms the inerrancy of scripture and a complementarian position on gender roles, believes in a literal hell, and is a Calvinist.He works in the area of Christian eschatology, highlighting the kingdom of God as the center of theology and ethics. Moore believes in an "inaugurated eschatology" in which the Kingdom of God is "already" and "not yet." Consistent with this position, he sees Jesus Christ as the full inheritor of God's promises to Israel, and that the church receives the benefits of this as it is "in" Christ. Moore emphasizes the kingdom as a spiritual warfare uprooting the demonic powers, an emphasis that shows up not only in his works on the kingdom and on temptation but also in his writings on, for example, orphan care.Moore has written about issues of ethics and religious liberty. In his early work, he argued for the early Baptist commitment to religious liberty represented by such figures as Isaac Backus, John Leland, and Jeremiah Moore, over against those who would articulate a more secularist understanding of the separation of church and state.In ethics, Moore stands within the Christian Democracy stream of communitarianism, calling for a Christian demonstration of ethical transformation within the church as the initial manifestation of the kingdom. Heavily influenced by the Dutch Neo-Calvinist theologian Abraham Kuyper and the early American Neo-Evangelical theologian Carl F. H. Henry, Moore articulates a conservative evangelical call for justice for the vulnerable, including care for widows, orphans, the unborn, the disabled, the elderly, and the undocumented.He has called on evangelicals, especially Southern Baptists, to embrace racial reconciliation as a witness.

Political background and involvement
In the early 1990s, prior to entering the ministry, Moore was an aide to U.S. Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi, a Democrat who later switched political parties and joined the Republican Party in 2014.In 2016, Moore became a leading critic of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Moore asserted that in the event of a presidential election contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Christians should vote for "a conservative independent or third-party candidate." Moore stated that he could not support the former because he "stirs up racial animosity" and could not support the latter for her support of abortion. Writing in  National Review in January 2016, Moore wrote that a Trump presidency would endanger the goals of the Manhattan Declaration; criticized Trump's involvement in the casino industry and past support for abortion rights; and argued that "Trump's vitriolic — and often racist and sexist — language about immigrants, women, the disabled, and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons, not just the 'winners' of the moment, are created in God's image."

Personal life
On May 27, 1994, Moore married Maria Hanna Moore. Having adopted their first two sons from a Russian orphanage, Moore has written and spoken extensively on the topic of adoption from a Christian perspective, including his book Adopted for Life: The Priority of Adoption for Christian Families and Churches. They also have three biological sons.

Recognition
In 2015, his book, Onward: Engaging the Culture Without Losing the Gospel, received the "Beautiful Orthodoxy Book of the Year" award from Christianity Today.In 2016, he was named alumnus of the year by the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

Passage 5:
Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission
The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) is the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, the second-largest Christian denomination in the United States, with over 16 million members in over 43,000 independent churches. President Russell D. Moore left office on June 1, 2021. Brent Leatherwood was unanimously voted in by the board of trustees to be the next ERLC president on Sept. 13, 2022 . The commission is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, with additional offices in Washington, D.C., and Cyprus.

History
Formerly known as the Christian Life Commission (1953–1997), the entity with organizational predecessors dating back to 1907 received its current name in the course of a broad reorganization of multiple Southern Baptist entities in 1997 (Sutton, p 335).  The Southern Baptist Convention  terminated its participation with the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty in 1992 (Sutton, p. 300) due to conflicts over separation of church and state and whether Baptist organizations should play a role in partisan politics. It was led by Richard Land from 1988 to 2013. Land announced his intention to retire effective October 23, 2013, after the uproar that ensued from his controversial comments about the Trayvon Martin case that resulted in an official reprimand by the ERLC's executive committee. Russell D. Moore filled the post afterwards. Moore is an outspoken critic of then-Republican Presidential candidate, Donald Trump. His criticism of Trump has been controversial with several Southern Baptist leaders.The stated vision of the ERLC is an organization "dedicated to engaging the culture with the gospel of Jesus Christ and speaking to issues in the public square for the protection of religious liberty and human flourishing. Our vision can be summed up in three words: kingdom, culture and mission. Since its inception, the ERLC has been defined around a holistic vision of the kingdom of God, leading the culture to change within the church itself and then as the church addresses the world."At the Convention's 2018 annual meeting, a motion to defund the ERLC was rejected.

Activities
The agency has many ministries to carry out its stated missions, including voter registration, a think tank called the Research Institute, and the Psalm 139 Project, which donates sonogram machines to crisis pregnancy centers.ERLC is involved in legislative advocacy. Its achievements include:

The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA)
The Sudan Peace Act of 2002
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA)
The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004The ERLC campaigned unsuccessfully against the 2022 passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, arguing that its gender-neutral definition of marriage contradicted the Bible, and claiming that it is a threat to religious freedom.

Passage 8:
Frank Stagg (theologian)
Frank Stagg (October 20, 1911 – June 2, 2001) was a Southern Baptist theologian, seminary professor, author, and pastor over a 50-year ministry career. He taught New Testament interpretation and Greek at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary from 1945 until 1964 and at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky from 1964 until 1978. His publications, recognitions and honors earned him distinction as one of the eminent theologians of the past century. Other eminent theologians have honored him as a "Teaching Prophet."
No one...has ever taken the New Testament more seriously than Frank Stagg, who spent his entire life wrestling with it, paying the price in sweat and hours in an unrelenting quest to hear the message expressed in a language no longer spoken and directed toward a cultural context so foreign to the modern reader.

Personal
Dr. Frank Stagg was born October 20, 1911, on his grandfather's rice farm near the small community of Eunice, Louisiana. Although the family name comes from an English ancestor, the Stagg family was of French Catholic descent, commonly called Cajuns. His grandfather and his uncle were the first of the Staggs to become Evangelical Christians. His uncle became a preacher who ministered in the native "Cajun" dialect. Frank was proud of his Louisiana French heritage and of his upbringing in the home of a Baptist deacon and Sunday School teacher.
In his junior year at Louisiana College, Frank met his wife: Evelyn Owen of Ruston, Louisiana, who would become an integral part of his future endeavors. They married in 1935 and  raised three children—Ted, Bob and Ginger.

Beliefs
Counted among the "best-known progressive activists," Stagg addressed a variety of contemporary issues. These included civil rights, gender equity, Vietnam, the First Gulf War, ecumenism and aging. He also argued for the Bible's relevance. "The Bible is relevant," Stagg said. "We don't have to make it relevant." He said that the First Gulf War presented the ideal opportunity for Southern Baptists to "reassess and reject" the just war doctrine and embrace pacifism as the appropriate Christian response to all wars. He opposed Reformed points of doctrine such as predestination and other Calvinist beliefs in Southern Baptist life.

Library collection
Through the years, Dr. Stagg amassed an extensive library and wealth of knowledge and scholarship in the form of correspondence, writings, articles, speeches, commentaries, book reviews, photographs, sermon notes and even private musings. The Papers of Dr. Frank Stagg, 1938–1999 now reside at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. The 36 feet (11 m) represent more than a half century of his life's journey and Christian pilgrimage. His collection shares prominence in the library with the manuscript collection of English theologian and preacher Charles Spurgeon.

Recognition and honors
Frank Stagg is included in various lists of distinguished twentieth century Baptist theologians: E. Y. Mullins, W. T. Connor, W. O. Carver, Frank Stagg, W. W. Stevens, Dale Moody, Dallas Roark, James Wm. McClendon, Morris Ashcraft, E. Frank Tupper, Warren McWilliams, A. J. Conyers, and Curtis Freeman. He also has been called "one of the foremost interpreters of the New Testament among Baptists in the twentieth century."At the Louisville seminary he held the prestigious James Buchanan Harrison Chair of New Testament Theology.
The Stagg-Tolbert Forum for Biblical Studies is an annual event named in his honor. It is designed to make excellence in biblical scholarship accessible to the lay person.

Passage 9:
Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond
Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond (BTSR) was a free-standing seminary in Richmond, Virginia. It was founded in March 1989 by Virginia Baptists related to the Southern Baptist Alliance (now the Alliance of Baptists) and Baptist General Association of Virginia. In the late 1980s, as the situation began to change in Southern Baptist Convention during the conservative resurgence/fundamentalist takeover, others in the region joined them in seeing the need for alternative options for theological education among Baptists. BTSR was also affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, BTSR offered degrees including the Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Theological Studies (MTS), and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.).On November 13, 2018, the BTSR Trustees announced that the school would close, effective June 30, 2019.  The trustees cited financial pressure as the reason for the closure, and said that the school would work with students to transfer their credits to other seminaries.
Passage 10:
Lee Rutland Scarborough
Lee Rutland Scarborough (1870–1945) was an American Southern Baptist pastor, evangelist, denominational leader, and professor at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS). He spent the first 16 years of his life on a ranch and became an adept cowboy. He attended later Baylor University, Yale University and The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.  He accepted the invitation of B. H. Carroll in 1908 to occupy the world's first academic chair of evangelism, "The Chair of Fire," at SWBTS, (also known as the L. R. Scarborough Chair of Evangelism) and chaired the seminary's department of evangelism. In February 1915, following the death of B. H. Carroll, he became president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He remained in both positions until 1942, during which time he also served a term as president of the Baptist General Convention of Texas (1929–32) and a term as president of the Southern Baptist Convention (1938–40).
