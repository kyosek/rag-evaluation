    "question": "The US War Department's decision to withdraw \"The Real Glory\" from circulation in 1942 can be attributed to the film's portrayal of the Moro Rebellion, which was a complex and multifaceted conflict. The film's depiction of the Moros as fanatical and violent, as seen in the scene where Alipang threatens a Muslim prisoner with burial wrapped in a pig skin, was likely a major factor in the decision. However, it is also possible that the film's portrayal of the US military's tactics, such as the use of native Philippine Constabulary and the reliance on a handful of officers to train the natives, was seen as insensitive or even racist. Furthermore, the film's historical context, including the American occupation of the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century, may have contributed to the decision. What was the primary reason for the US War Department's decision to withdraw \"The Real Glory\" from circulation in 1942?",
