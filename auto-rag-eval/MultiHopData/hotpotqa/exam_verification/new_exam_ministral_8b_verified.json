During its mission, Ulysses encountered several comets, including Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9, Comet C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake), and Comet C/1999 T1 (McNaught\u2013Hartley). Ulysses also performed a swing-by maneuver around Jupiter in 1992, which increased its inclination to the ecliptic by 80.2\u00b0. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized and used hydrazine monopropellant for course corrections. It was controlled by eight thrusters in two blocks and had a spin rate of 5 rpm. Ulysses was designed by ESA and built by Dornier Systems. The spacecraft was approximately 3.2 m \u00d7 3.3 m \u00d7 2.1 m in size and had a dish antenna and a GPHS-RTG power source. The spacecraft was deployed into low Earth orbit from the Space Shuttle Discovery and propelled on a trajectory to Jupiter by a combination of solid rocket motors.

The bridge was also to have a restricted access policy, banning groups of eight or more people and cyclists, and was to be open for 18 hours a day. The project was opposed by critics who argued that it was a vanity project and that the funds could be better used elsewhere.

This coach had previously been a two-time national coach of the year and three-time conference coach of the year. The coach was also known for developing the air raid offense, which broke numerous school and NCAA records. The coach's name was Mike Leach. The team played their home games at Jones SBC Stadium in Lubbock, Texas. The Red Raiders compiled a record of 9-5 in the regular season, with a mark of 5-3 in Big 12 play. They finished in a tie for third place in the Southern Division of the Big 12. The team defeated Clemson in the 2002 Tangerine Bowl. The quarterback for the team was Kliff Kingsbury, who totaled 5,017 passing yards and received the Sammy Baugh Trophy. Lawrence Flugence set the NCAA single-season record for most tackles. The team played their home games at Jones SBC Stadium in Lubbock, Texas. The team played against teams such as Ohio State, SMU, Ole Miss, NC State, New Mexico, Texas A&M, Iowa State, Missouri, Colorado, Baylor, Oklahoma State, and Oklahoma. The team also played against Clemson in the Tangerine Bowl. The team was led by tenth-year head coach Mike Leach during the regular season and, following Leach\u2019s dismissal, interim head coach Ruffin McNeill for the bowl game. The Red Raiders compiled an overall record of 9\u20134 with a mark of 5\u20133 in conference play, tying for third place in the Big 12's South Division. Texas Tech was invited to the Alamo Bowl, where they defeated Michigan State, 41\u201331. The Red Raiders played home games at Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock, Texas. On December 28, Leach was suspended by Texas Tech pending investigation of alleged inappropriate treatment of Adam James, a redshirt sophomore wide receiver, and the son of former SMU Mustangs and New England Patriots running back Craig James. The suspension came after allegations that Leach treated James unfairly following a mild concussion. Leach was terminated by the university on December 30. Ruffin McNeill, the team's defensive coordinator, was named interim head coach and led the team during their appearance in the Alamo Bowl. The 2003 team finished the season 8\u20135, 4\u20134 in Big 12 play, finishing in 4th place in the Southern Division. The team was invited to the Houston Bowl, defeating Navy 38\u201314.

The gate is renowned for its intricate design and the use of glazed bricks to create a vivid, jewel-like appearance. The gate's construction involved the use of a specific glazing technique that incorporated plant ash, sandstone conglomerates, and pebbles for silicates, with color-producing minerals like cobalt added in the final glaze formulations. The gate's design features a low-relief pattern of gods and mythical creatures, including lions, dragons, and bulls, which were made from bricks formed by pressing clay into reusable molds. The lions, in particular, were designed with variations in color and pose to enhance the gate's aesthetic appeal. The Processional Way, which ran through the gate, was lined with walls showing these same creatures and flowers, symbolizing the goddess Ishtar. The gate's construction was completed around 605\u2013562 BCE and was dedicated to the goddess Ishtar. The gate's inscription, written in Akkadian cuneiform, was created around the same time as the gate's construction and is a dedication by Nebuchadnezzar to explain the gate's purpose. The inscription is 15 meters tall by 10 meters wide and includes 60 lines of writing.\n\nGiven the above information, which of the following statements is true about the Ishtar Gate?",
