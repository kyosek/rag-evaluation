ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
Our stabilized portfolio of operating properties was comprised of the following properties at December 31, 2019:
Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently committed for construction, under construction or in the tenant improvement phase, undeveloped land, recently completed residential properties not yet stabilized and real estate assets held for sale. We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define properties in the tenant improvement phase as office and retail properties that we are developing or redeveloping where the project has reached cold shell condition and is ready for tenant improvements, which may require additional major base building construction before being placed in service. Projects in the tenant improvement phase are added to our stabilized portfolio once the project reaches the earlier of 95% occupancy or one year from the date of the cessation of major base building construction activities. Costs capitalized to construction in progress for development and redevelopment properties are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and deferred leasing costs on our consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property as the projects are placed in service.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we added one completed development project to our stabilized office portfolio consisting of 394,340 square feet in San Francisco, California. As of December 31, 2019, the following properties were excluded from our stabilized portfolio. We did not have any redevelopment properties or properties held for sale at December 31, 2019.
________________________
(1)
Estimated rentable square feet upon completion.
(2)
Includes 96,000 square feet of retail space.
(3)
In addition to the estimated office and life science rentable square feet noted above, development projects under construction also include 564 residential units.
(4)
Represents recently completed residential units not yet stabilized.
Our stabilized portfolio also excludes our future development pipeline, which as of December 31, 2019, was comprised of five future development sites, representing approximately 61 gross acres of undeveloped land.
As of December 31, 2019, all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of eight office properties, one development project under construction and one recently acquired future development project located in the state of Washington. All of our properties and development projects are 100% owned, excluding four office properties owned by three consolidated property partnerships and two development projects held in Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) which we consolidated for financial reporting purposes that were established to facilitate potential Section 1031 transactions.
We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership. All our properties are held in fee, except for the fourteen office buildings that are held subject to five long-term ground
leases for the land (see Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our ground lease obligations).
In general, the office properties are leased to tenants on a full service gross, modified gross or triple net basis. Under a full service gross lease, we are obligated to pay the tenant’s proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses up to the amount incurred during the tenant’s first year of occupancy (“Base Year”) or a negotiated amount approximating the tenant’s pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses (“Expense Stop”). The tenant pays its pro-rata share of increases in expenses above the Base Year or Expense Stop. A modified gross lease is similar to a full service gross lease, except tenants are obligated to pay their proportionate share of certain operating expenses, usually electricity, directly to the service provider. In addition, some office properties, primarily in the greater Seattle region and certain properties in certain submarkets in San Francisco, are leased to tenants on a triple net basis, pursuant to which the tenants pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, operating costs and utility costs.
We believe that all of our properties are well maintained and do not require significant capital improvements. As of December 31, 2019, we managed all of our office properties through internal property managers.
