Item 2. Properties.
Kansas - Girard Project. The “Girard Project” is located in Crawford County, southeast Kansas and was acquired by the Company on March 31, 2008. The Company acquired thirty-four (34) natural gas wells and a 16-mile-long gas pipeline in the acquisition of the Girard Project. Seven (7) of the wells were tied into the pipeline at the time of the acquisition. In March of 2008, the Company formed a Kansas corporation called “JayHawk Gas Transportation Corporation”. JayHawk Gas Transportation Corporation is a wholly owned and controlled subsidiary of the Company and holds and manages the assets associated with the Girard Project. The Girard Project pipeline is tied into a 2 million cubic foot sales pipeline During July and August of 2008, the Company completed drilling and casing of an additional twenty-one (21) natural gas wells. In June 2008, the Company acquired additional certain oil, gas and mineral rights to 11,462 leased acres in Bourbon and Crawford counties Kansas from Missouri Gas Partners. As of September 30, 2015, the Company controls seventy-one (71) shut-in natural gas wells and the 16-mile gas pipeline and compression station it acquired in 2008. Information related to current natural gas production is more fully discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.
North Dakota - Crosby Project (formerly known as “Candak”). On January 16, 2008, the Company acquired a 65% working interest in five (5) producing oil wells in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The project was renamed to more properly reflect the pool designation of the properties. In addition to the five producing wells, the Company acquired certain oil, gas, and mineral rights in a 15,500-acre land position, of which, all undeveloped leases have subsequently lapsed.
During the year ending September 30, 2010, JayHawk drilled two vertical wells (the “Knudsen” and the “Jenks”) at the Crosby Project. The drilled wells exhibited marginal production potential after various attempts to stimulate flow and were subsequently shut-in. The Company plugged the Knudsen #1 well and substantially completed all reclamation efforts of the well’s adjacent pits during the first seven months of calendar year 2014. In September of 2015 the Company completed final plugging and abandonment of the Jenks #1 and completed a partial reclamation of the well and site.
On July 8, 2015, the Company executed a Contract Operating Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”) with Vast Exploration, LLC (“Vast Exploration”), effective as of January 1, 2015. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, Vast Exploration was appointed as the “operator of record” for all of the Company’s properties and is responsible for the operation of the Company’s oil and gas properties (including handling routine operations, major operations, reporting services and other miscellaneous services). The Operating Agreement requires the Company to pay Vast Exploration a monthly fee for services in the amount of $20,000. The Company remains responsible for all fees, expenses and taxes related to its properties and has agreed to reimburse Vast Exploration for any fees, expenses or taxes advanced on the Company’s behalf. The Company has the right to audit the books, records and invoices maintained by Vast Exploration in its operation of the Company properties. The term of the Operating Agreement is two years from the effective date. The Operating Agreement automatically renews for successive one year terms until the Company or Vast Exploration provide notice of non-renewal. The Operating Agreement includes mutual indemnities and waivers of consequential and punitive damages. The Operating Agreement also includes release and hold harmless provisions for the exclusive benefit of Vast Exploration. Finally, the Operating Agreement consents to and ratifies any operational services Vast Exploration has provided to the Company prior to the date the Operating Agreement was executed. Vast Exploration billed the Company $160,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 which was charged to ‘production expense’ and subsequently billed to working interest partners for their pro-rata share of the expense. The foregoing summary of the Operating Agreement’s terms is qualified in its entirety by the fully executed Operating Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.4.
Vast Exploration, LLC is the controlling shareholder of the Company and is an affiliate of Vast Petroleum Corp. - an entity that entered into a joint development agreement for the Company’s oil and gas operations in Kansas in May 2014. Vast Petroleum Corp. was not a party to the Operating Agreement. Scott Mahoney, interim President, CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board of JayHawk is the individual who possesses voting and dispositive authority on behalf of Vast Exploration, LLC. Acting in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of JayHawk, he recused himself from voting on the approval of the Contract Operating Agreement, which was subsequently approved by the remaining members of the Company’s Board of Directors.
On October 2, 2015 JayHawk entered into an Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance (the “Assignment”) with Vast Holdings, LLC (“Vast Holdings”), with an effective date of September 1, 2015. The Assignment sold and assigned to Vast Holdings, in consideration of ten dollars ($10.00), all of the Company’s right, title, interest and estate, real or personal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, in and to the assets held or owned by the Company in the State of North Dakota, including but not limited to: oil, gas and/or mineral leases, fee mineral interests, leasehold estates, mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, reversionary interests, net profits interests, and other similar rights, estates and interests and other agreements, the oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the assets and all units, wells, equipment, contracts, and records. The Assignment did not convey any liabilities related to the assets. Vast Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast Exploration, LLC (“Vast Exploration”). Vast Exploration is a controlling shareholder of the Company, the contract operator of the Company’s oil and gas properties and an affiliate of Vast Petroleum Corp. - an entity that entered into a joint development agreement for the Company’s oil and gas operations in Kansas in May 2014. Vast Petroleum Corp. was not a party to the Assignment. Scott Mahoney, interim President, CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board of JayHawk is the individual who possesses voting and dispositive authority on behalf of Vast Holdings, LLC. Mr. Mahoney, acting in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of the Company, recused himself from voting on the approval of the Assignment. The Assignment was subsequently approved by the remaining members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The foregoing summary of the Assignment’s terms is qualified in its entirety by the fully executed Assignment attached as Exhibit 10.16.
Disclosure of Reserves.
As of September 30, 2015, the Company has no proved oil reserves in North Dakota. Effective as of September 1, 2015, the Company conveyed all of its North Dakota oil and gas properties to Vast Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Vast Exploration, LLC, the controlling shareholder of the Company, in lieu of the Company’s North Dakota assets being foreclosure upon by Vast Exploration, LLC. Consequently, there is no disclosure of oil reserves as of September 30, 2015.
For purposes of this report, the Company presents its proved oil reserves as of September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013. For the North Dakota properties, the independent petroleum engineering firm of Cedar Technical Services (“Cedar”) of Baldwin City, Kansas, prepared the estimates of the Company's proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2014. The independent petroleum engineering firm of McDaniel & Associates Consultants, Ltd. (“McDaniel”) of Calgary, Alberta Canada, prepared the estimates of the Company's proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2013. The future net cash flows (and related present value) attributable to proved and probable reserves were calculated for each well and the properties in total as of these respective dates. Proved developed reserves are defined as estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which upon analysis of geological and engineering data, appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered from new wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
The reserve data set forth in the reports and in this Form 10-K represents only estimates, and should not be construed as being exact quantities. The reserves may or may not be actually recovered, and if recovered, the actual revenues and costs could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Moreover, estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of future operations.
Cedar’s Report of Third Party for the Evaluation of Oil Reserves attributed to the Company’s interest in the Crosby Project in the State of North Dakota, United States of America and related Consent for Use is filed as an Exhibit with this 10-K. McDaniel’s Report of Third Party for the Evaluation of Oil Reserves attributed to the Company’s interests in the Crosby Project in the State of North Dakota, United States of America and related Consent for Use is filed as an Exhibit with this 10-K. The independent expert engineering, geological, and technical advisory background of both Cedar and McDaniel are disclosed in the associated Exhibits to this 10-K.
Both Cedar and McDaniel’s used all assumptions, data, methods and procedures they considered necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to prepare their estimates. The reserves set forth in their reports for the properties are estimated by performance methods or analogy. In general, reserves attributable to producing wells and reservoirs are estimated by performance methods such as decline curve analysis which utilizes extrapolations of historical production data. Reserves attributable to non-producing and undeveloped reserves included in the reports are estimated by analogy. The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties are based on the reserve definitions set out in Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a).
Both the Cedar and McDaniel’s reports summarize conclusions made by them with respect to the reserve estimates. To estimate economically recoverable crude oil, many factors and assumptions were considered, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under applicable SEC regulations, proved reserves must be demonstrated to be economically producible based on the existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic production from a reservoir is determined as of the effective date of the report. With respect to the property interests the Company owns, production and well tests from examines wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, production taxes, recompletion and development costs and product prices are based on SEC regulations, geological maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil reserves and their estimated values, including many factors beyond the Company’s control. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers, including those used by the Company, may vary. In addition, estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production, result of future developments and exploration activities, prevailing crude oil prices, operating costs and other factors. The revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. The Company’s estimate net proved reserves, included in the Company’s SEC filings, have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency. Reserve estimates, like all estimates, are subject to numerous uncertainties and may be inaccurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil or natural gas reserves and cash flows to be derived therefrom, including many factors beyond the Company's control. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth herein represent estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary from actual results. All such estimates are to some degree speculative, and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of
speculation involved. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues expected therefrom prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. Actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to the Company's reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material.
Estimates of proved or unproved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history and production practices will result in variations in the estimated reserves and such variations could be material.
Federal and state regulations governing protection of the environment may prevent the Company from recovering the estimated reserves disclosed in this section. See Item 1, and the subsection entitled “Governmental Regulations” above.
A summary of the Company’s net proved oil reserves for the North Dakota properties for the years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented below:

The Company has no reserve estimates for synthetic oil, synthetic gas or sales of other non-renewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil and gas.
The Company’s Kansas properties have not been evaluated and no independent estimates of proved reserves have been made with regard to the Kansas properties. Consequently, management has determined the Company’s producing natural gas properties in Kansas should be classified as unproven for purposes of financial statement disclosure. Additional information about the Company’s proved oil reserves are presented under Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Controls over Reserve Estimates.
Compliance as it relates to reporting the Company’s reserves was formerly the responsibility of Lindsay Gorrill, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, who had over 20 years’ experience in resource-based companies. Current Company Chairman Scott Mahoney will be responsible for the Company’s reserves at such time the Company possesses reportable reserves.
With respect to the Company’s properties, the control over reserve estimates included retaining Cedar and McDaniel as our independent and geological engineering firms for the periods indicated in their respective reports. Jayhawk provided both Cedar and McDaniel with information about its oil properties, including production profiles, prices and costs, and both Cedar and McDaniel reviewed the estimates of the reserves attributable to oil properties. Both Cedar and McDaniel are independent expert engineering, geological, technical and advisory company providing services to the oil and gas industry.
All of the information on the North Dakota oil reserves for the years ended September 30, 2013 in this Form 10-K is derived from McDaniel’s report. All of the information on the North Dakota oil reserves for the year ended September 30, 2014 in this Form 10-K is derived from the Cedar. The Company holds no reserves as of September 30, 2015.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves.
As of September 30, 2015, management estimated the Company had proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) of Nil Bbls in North Dakota. The Company divested of its oil wells effective September 1, 2015, therefore the Company’s PUD’s and data are through September 1, 2015.
The following table discloses the Company's PUDs during 2015, 2014 and 2013:

Oil and Gas Production, Production Prices and Production Costs.
The following table set forth certain information regarding the production volumes of oil and natural gas for the periods indicated for the Company. The Company's oil wells were located in North Dakota. The Company divested of its oil wells effective September 1, 2015 and, therefore, production volumes and data are through September 1, 2015. The Company's natural gas wells are located in Kansas:
The oil and gas sales revenue shown in the table below is the Company’s net share of annual revenue in each project for the past three fiscal years:
The table below shows the average sales price per unit and average cost of goods sold per unit the Company received for oil and natural gas for the past three fiscal years:
Drilling and Other Exploratory and Development Activities.
No wells were drilled and completed in the years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company experienced no dry wells in the years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
The following table summarizes the Company's total oil wells by type as of September 30, 2015. A net well represents the Company's percentage ownership of a gross well. The following table does not include wells which were awaiting completion, in the process of completion or awaiting flow-back subsequent to fracture stimulation. All oil wells are located in North Dakota; all natural gas wells are located in Kansas.
Present Activities.
During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized responsibility for up to 71 non-producing well bores in Crawford and Bourbon County, Kansas. Previously, the Company had recognized 25 non-producing well bores. The Company in cooperation with the Kansas Corporate Commission entered into a Consent Agreement whereby the Company declared the wellbores temporarily abandoned and may reapply for additional temporary abandonment status at the close of calendar year 2015. The foregoing summary of the Consent Agreement’s terms is qualified in its entirety by the fully executed Consent Agreement attached as Exhibit10.5.
The Company did not experience any dry holes in fiscal years ending September 30, 2015, 2014 or 2013.
Delivery Commitments.
As of September 30, 2015, the Company does not have any delivery commitments for product obtained from its wells.
Oil and Gas Properties, Wells, Operations, and Acreage.
Management believes the Company has satisfactory title to all of its properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. The properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which management believes does not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. Prior to acquiring undeveloped properties, the Company performs a title investigation that is thorough but less vigorous than that conducted prior to drilling, which is consistent with standard practice in the oil and gas industry. Before the Company commences drilling operations, it conducts a thorough title examination and performs curative work with respect to significant defects before proceeding with operations. The Company has performed a thorough title examination with respect to substantially all of its active properties.
