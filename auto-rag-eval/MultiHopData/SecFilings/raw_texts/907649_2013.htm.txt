ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Proved Reserve Disclosures
Internal Controls over Reserve Estimates
Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserve estimates require such estimates to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with customary petroleum engineering practices. Responsibility for compliance in reserve bookings is delegated to our operations and finance staff. Clay Newton, our principal financial officer, reviews the independence and professional qualifications of the third-party engineering firms we engage. He also supervises the submission of technical and financial data to third-party engineering firms and reviews the prepared reports to verify that such data has been appropriately reflected in the reports. Mr. Newton has more than 25 years’ experience in senior financial positions in the oil and gas industry. He earned a BA in accounting at the University of Utah in 1981 and is a certified public accountant.
Estimates of our proved Polish reserves were calculated by RPS Energy, an independent engineering firm in the United Kingdom. Estimates of our proved domestic reserves were calculated by Hohn Engineering, an independent engineering firm in Billings, Montana. The technical personnel responsible for calculating the reserve estimates at both RPS Energy and Hohn Engineering meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The qualifications of the individuals primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve reports are included in their respective reports, which are included as exhibits to this filing. Both RPS Energy and Hohn Engineering are independent firms of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent-fee basis.
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are estimated quantities of oil and gas calculated using deterministic methods that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward and recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and governmental regulations, prior to the expiration of the contracts providing the right to operate, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to: (i) those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances; and (ii) other undrilled locations if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
We emphasize that the reserve volumes are estimates and by their nature are subject to revision. The estimates are made using geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional performance data. These reserve revisions result primarily from increases or decreases in performance due to a variety of factors such as an addition to or a reduction in recoveries below or above previously established, lowest, known hydrocarbon levels, improvements or deteriorations in drainage from natural drive mechanisms, and increases or decreases to drainage areas. If the estimates of proved reserves were to decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense would increase.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
As of December 31, 2013, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 0.8 Bcf of natural gas. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are located in Poland, and all are associated with wells that have been drilled, tested, and completed for production. These reserves are classified as proved undeveloped because relatively major expenditures are required for the completion of production facilities, which includes the construction of gathering lines to connect the wells to the existing pipeline in order to fully develop the reserves and commence production. We do not have any proved undeveloped reserves attributable to undrilled locations, so the development of such undeveloped reserves is not dependent on additional drilling on undrilled acreage. All development activities will be completed within five years of reserve bookings.
Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves
All reserves classified as proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2012, were converted to proved developed reserves at December 31, 2013, following successful completion of production facilities and recompletions.
Development Costs
Costs incurred relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $8.9 million in 2013, including the construction costs of production facilities at our Lisewo-1 and Komorze-3K wells, along with the cost to drill our Lisewo-2 well.
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves are projected to be approximately $0.9 million in 2014. The estimated development costs represent our share of the cost of the sidetrack project planned for our Zaniemsyl well.

Other Reserve Information
Since January 1, 2013, no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with, or included in any report to, any other federal authority or agency.
Reserve Volumes and Values
The following table sets forth our estimated proved developed and proved undeveloped reserve volumes as of December 31, 2013:
The following table sets forth the estimated SMOG Value of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2013:
Economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are based on the use of unweighted, 12-month, first-day-of-the-month, historical average prices, adjusted for basis and quality differentials, rather than year-end prices. In Poland, average gas prices used in calculating reserve values also take into consideration exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Polish zloty in effect on the first day of each month. The average prices used to calculate year-end reserve values were $6.82 and $6.60 per thousand cubic feet, or Mcf, of gas and $78.18 and $78.14 per Bbl for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Drilling Activities
The following table sets forth the exploratory wells that we drilled:
The productive exploratory wells drilled in 2013 were our Lisewo-2 and Szymanowice-1 wells. The Lisewo-2 well was drilled as a production acceleration well adjacent to the Lisewo-1 well, so no new reserves have been assigned to that well. The Szymanowice-1 well had gross proved reserves of 8.1 Bcf of natural gas at year-end 2013. The exploratory dry hole in 2013 was the Mieczeow-1K well in Poland. The productive exploratory well drilled in 2012 was our Komorze-3K well, which had gross proved reserves of 4.7 Bcf of natural gas at year-end 2012. The exploratory dry holes in 2012 include the Kutno-2 well in Poland and four Alberta Bakken wells drilled in Montana. Of these wells, three were drilled in 2011, but all were determined to be noncommercial during 2012. The productive exploratory well drilled in 2011 was our Lisewo-1 well, which had gross proved reserves of 26.5 Bcf of natural gas at year-end 2012. The exploratory dry hole in Poland drilled in 2011 was our Machnatka-2 well. The foregoing does not include the Tuchola-3K, Gorka-Duchowna-1, and Frankowo-1 wells being evaluated in Poland at 2013 year end. We did not drill any development wells in 2013, 2012, or 2011.

All gross and net undeveloped Polish acreage is rounded to the nearest 1,000 acres.
Polish Properties
Producing Properties
A summary of our average daily production, weighted average interest, and weighted average net revenue interest for our Poland producing properties during 2013 follows:
Production, Transportation and Marketing
The following table sets forth, by well, our net daily oil and gas production and volume weighted average sales prices and production costs associated with our Polish production:
___________
(1)
Production costs include lifting costs (electricity, fuel, water, disposal, repairs, maintenance, transportation, and similar items) and contract operator fees. Production costs do not include such items as general and administrative costs; depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD&A; or Polish income taxes.
(2)
Production costs at other wells include the ongoing costs of maintaining the production facilities at our Wilga well, which is not currently in production.
(3)
Kromolice-2 production costs include the cost of a workover performed in early 2011.
Poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan, commercial, industrial, and gas production areas, including significant portions of our acreage. We are currently selling substantially all of our oil and gas production in Poland to PGNiG or one of its affiliates. We are dependent on PGNiG for the sale of gas in Poland, since there are few other competitive purchasers. Gas is sold pursuant to long-term sales contracts, typically for the life of each well, which obligate PGNiG to purchase all gas produced. Should we choose to export any gas or oil we produce, we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval.
Poland has a well-developed infrastructure of hard-surfaced roads and railways over which oil produced can be transported for sale. There are refineries in Gdansk and Plock in Poland and one in Germany near the western Polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in Poland.
United States Properties
Producing Properties
In the United States, we currently produce oil in Montana and Nevada. All of our producing properties, except for the Rattlers Butte field (an exploratory discovery during 1997), were purchased during 1994. A summary of our average daily production, and average working and net revenue interests, based on the number of producing wells, for our United States producing properties during 2013 follows:
In Montana, we operate the Southwest Cut Bank Sand Unit and Bears Den fields and have an interest in the Rattlers Butte field, which is operated by an industry partner. Production in the Southwest Cut Bank Sand Unit, producing since the 1940s from an average depth of approximately 2,900 feet, is from a waterflood program with 122 producing oil wells, 21 active injection wells, and one active water supply well. The Bears Den field, under waterflood since 1990, is producing oil from six wells at a depth of approximately 2,430 feet, with one active water injection well. In the Rattlers Butte field, we own a 0.683% interest in one oil well producing at a depth of approximately 5,800 feet and one active water injection well.
In Nevada, we operate the Trap Springs and Munson Ranch fields and have an interest in the Bacon Flat field, which is operated by an industry partner. In the Trap Springs field, discovered in 1976, we produce oil from a depth of approximately 3,700 feet from one well. In the Munson Ranch field, discovered in 1988, we produce oil at an average depth of 3,800 feet from five wells. In the Bacon Flat field, discovered in 1981, we produce oil from one well at a depth of approximately 5,000 feet.
Production, Transportation, and Marketing
The following table sets forth our average net daily oil production, average sales prices, and production costs associated with our United States oil production:
_______________
(1)
Production costs include lifting costs (electricity, fuel, water, disposal, repairs, maintenance, pumper, transportation, and similar items) and production taxes. Production costs do not include such items as general and administrative costs; depreciation, depletion and amortization; state income taxes, or federal income taxes. Costs in 2011 include approximately $321,000 associated with the cleanup of a minor oil leak. Excluding the cleanup costs, lifting costs per barrel in 2011 would have equaled approximately $44.73 per barrel.
We sell oil at posted field prices to one of several purchasers in each of our production areas. We sell all of our Montana production, which represents 94% of our total oil sales, to Cenex, a regional refiner and marketer. Posted prices are generally competitive among crude oil purchasers. Our crude oil sales contracts may be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ notice.
Oilfield Services - Drilling Rig and Well-Servicing Equipment
In Montana, we perform, through our drilling subsidiary, FX Drilling Company, Inc., a variety of third-party contract oilfield services, including drilling, workovers, location work, cementing, and acidizing. We currently have a drilling rig capable of drilling to a vertical depth of 6,000 feet, a workover rig, two service rigs, cementing equipment, acidizing equipment, and other associated oilfield-servicing equipment.
The Republic of Poland
The Republic of Poland is located in north-central Europe, has a population of approximately 38.5 million people, and covers an area comparable to New Mexico. During 1989, Poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy. Since 1989, Poland has enacted comprehensive economic reforms and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free-market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west, with most of its current international trade with the countries of the European Union and the United States. The economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post-communist era. The Polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable, free-market economy.
Since its transition to a free-market economy and a parliamentary democracy, Poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change. Poland has developed and is refining legal, tax, and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards. The Polish government has taken steps to harmonize Polish legislation with that of the European Union, which it joined in May of 2004. These measures continue.
Poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies. In July 1995, Poland’s Council of Ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the Polish petroleum sector. So far under this plan, a refinery located in Plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the London and Warsaw stock exchanges. In September of 2005, PGNiG sold 15% of its stock in an initial public offering on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, raising a total of 2.7 billion Polish zlotys (approximately US$900 million).
Prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during 1989, the exploration and development of Poland’s oil and gas resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence, a centrally controlled economy, limited financial resources, and a lack of modern exploration technology. As a result of these and other factors, Poland is currently a net energy importer. Oil is imported primarily from countries of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, and gas is imported primarily from Russia.
Poland continues to enjoy the strongest economy in the European Union and was the only country in Europe to record positive GDP growth every year from 2008 through 2013. While the economy is expected to slow somewhat, economists are still predicting positive growth during 2014. Poland’s economy remains one of the more attractive and safer debt markets in Europe.
Legal Framework
General Usufruct and Concession Terms
All of our rights in Poland have been awarded to us or to PGNiG pursuant to the Geological and Mining Law, or the former Geological and Mining Law of February 4, 1994 (as amended), which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights. Under the Geological and Mining Law, the concession authority enters into mining usufruct (lease) agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in a designated area or to exploit the designated oil and/or gas field for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions. The holder of the mining usufruct covering exploration must also acquire an exploration concession by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities. The usufruct agreements include provisions that give the usufruct holder a claim for an extension of the usufruct (and the underlying concession), subject to having fulfilled all obligations under the usufruct and/or concession agreements. We can request changes to usufruct agreements and concessions that either modify the obligations or extend the terms of those agreements or concessions.
Under current law, the concession authority requires that concessions be owned by a single entity, without recognizing any minority record ownership such as would reflect our interest in those areas in which we previously have been granted a minority ownership. As such, our ownership is subject to continued compliance with applicable law, the usufruct and concession terms, and respecting the Fences area, the continuity of PGNiG as the record owner.
The concession authority has granted oil and gas exploration rights on the Fences project area to PGNiG and has granted oil and gas exploration rights on all other project areas in which we have an interest to us. The agreements divide these areas into blocks, each containing up to 300,000 acres.
If commercially viable gas or oil is discovered, the concession owner may be able to produce such gas or oil for test purposes for two years based on the exploration concession. During such two-year period, the concession owner typically applies for an exploitation concession, which generally will have a term of 25 to 30 years or as long as commercial production continues. Upon the grant of the exploitation concession, the concession owner will be obligated to pay a fee, to be negotiated. The concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production, the amount of which is set by the Geological and Mining Law and is updated annually for inflation. The royalty rate for low-methane gas such as we produce is currently set for 2014 at approximately $0.04 per Mcf. Local governments will receive 60% of any royalties paid on production. The holder of the exploitation concession must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner and could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession.
We believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date.
Currently gas produced by us and others in Poland is sold to PGNiG at tariff prices established by the Polish government. As part of its continuing effort to satisfy European Union requirements to move toward free-market energy prices, in September 2013, Poland adopted legislation requiring companies engaged in gas trading (i.e., excluding producers such as us) to sell a specified percentage, increasing from 30% in 2013 to 55% in 2015 and thereafter, of gas sold domestically on a commodity exchange. The only existing gas exchange was established by the Polish Power Exchange during 2013, but only small volumes have been traded by a fraction of the licensed trading companies.
In view of the slow market adoption of the gas exchange trading requirements, the viability of the exchange is uncertain. In turn, it is unclear whether a free-market trading price for gas will be established with sufficient industry acceptance and credibility to replace government-determined tariffs. Further, we cannot predict how free-market prices, if developed, will compare with established tariffs or whether our gas sales contracts with PGNiG will adopt free-market prices.
Existing Project Areas
Fences Project Area
The Fences project area consists of four oil and gas exploration concessions controlled by PGNiG. Three producing fields (Radlin, Kleka, and Kaleje) lie within the concession boundaries, but are excluded from the Fences area in which we participate. The Fences concessions (853,000 gross and 407,000 net acres) have expiration dates ranging from July 2014 to Sept 2017. The extension procedure for the concession expiring in 2014 is in progress at the date of this report. The total joint remaining work commitment, which must be satisfied by us and PGNiG according to our respective interests, includes: acquiring 50 kilometers of 2-D seismic data, acquiring 210 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data, and drilling two wells.
Warsaw South/Wilga Project Area
The Warsaw South/Wilga project area (395,000 gross and 201,000 net acres) consists of a single oil and gas exploration and production concession covering Block 255 held by us. As required by the current law, it is being converted to an exploration concession. The procedure should be completed in first half of 2014. Adjacent to Block 255, we hold one exploration concession expiring in July 2018 covering part of Block 254. The obligatory work commitment includes acquiring 125 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data and drilling two wells.
Block 287 Project Area
The Block 287 project area (12,000 gross and net acres) consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us. The concession expires in December 2015. Our work commitment includes reentering and producing the Grabowka gas field; recompletion of one out of three wells was completed and production began in 2009. The second well was recompleted in late 2012 and production began in the first quarter of 2013. The third well was recompleted in late 2013 and production began in early 2014.
Edge Project Area
The Edge project area (726,000 gross and net acres) consists of four oil and gas exploration concessions granted in 2008. In September 2013 two of them were extended for five years and the remaining two for three years. The total obligatory work commitment includes acquisition of 500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data and drilling eight wells.
Block 246 Project Area
The Block 246 project area (241,000 gross and net acres) is adjacent to the Fences project area in the southwest and consists of a single concession granted for six years (2008-2014). All obligatory work has been completed, and we plan to apply for an extension prior to concession expiration in December 2014.
Block 229 Project Area
The Block 229 project area (233,000 gross and net acres) is adjacent to the Fences project area in the east and consists of two exploration concessions granted for six years (2008-2014). The total work commitment is outlined in three phases: Phase I - one year: reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing data; Phase II - two years: acquiring 300 kilometers of 2-D seismic data; Phase III - three years: drilling two wells. Currently, besides reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing data, the acquisition of 50 kilometers of 2-D seismic data has been completed.
As of December 31, 2013, all required usufruct/concession payments had been made for each of the above existing project areas.
Government Regulation
Poland
Our activities in Poland are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties, including the adoption of new laws, regulations, or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights; political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies; export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes; foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations; repatriation limitations; inflation; environmental regulations; and other matters. These operations in Poland are subject to the Geological and Mining Law dated as of June 9, 2011 (as amended), and the Environment Protection Law dated as of April 27, 2001 (as amended), which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection. Agreements with the government of Poland respecting our exploration and production areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection. Participants in oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities generally are required to: (1) adhere to good international petroleum industry practices, including practices relating to the protection of the environment; and (2) prepare and submit geological work plans, with specific attention to environmental matters, to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition, exploratory drilling; and (3) prepare and submit field development plans prior to engaging in field-wide development. Poland’s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection generally follows directives and regulations of the European Union. We intend to conduct our operations in Poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and, as they continue to develop, Polish requirements.
There appears to be some political and administrative interest in Poland in reviewing and potentially altering the current natural resources regulatory scheme that has been in place for some years. Such interest appears to focus on governmental policies respecting granting hydrocarbon exploration and production rights, determining hydrocarbon sales prices, taxing production, and reviewing other matters. New policies, if adopted, may result in a more openly competitive process for obtaining exploration concessions and retaining rights to discovered hydrocarbons, increased production taxes, requirements for governmental concessions for transporting and marketing gas, mandated governmental equity participation in hydrocarbon firms, more market-based hydrocarbon pricing, and the release of exploration data and similar matters, all or any one of which could increase our costs and reduce our expansion opportunities.
Proposed Changes to the Polish Hydrocarbon Industry Tax Regime
As a result of the political and administrative interest discussed above, in late 2012, the Polish government approved guidelines for new hydrocarbon legislation, including, among other things, higher royalties on hydrocarbons produced, a new cash flow tax based on the positive cumulate cash flow of exploration and development projects, as well as changes to how usufruct fees are determined and how concessions are awarded. The Minister of Environment was directed to prepare a draft law, which was published in early 2013.
The published draft of the new law addresses the concession system and environmental regulation. Principal proposals for consideration include the replacement of the current three types of concessions with one concession for exploration and production; new requirements for prequalification for applicants for concessions; and increases of revenues to local authorities from oil and gas production. Administrative changes would be aimed at improving concession administration.
A revised draft, which reflects some of the industry comments, is expected to be approved by the government March 2014, before it is sent to the Parliament. It is impossible to predict whether any new proposals will be adopted or the substance of any changes that might be effected.
The new legislation is meant to increase governmental revenue from the oil and gas industry, with the stated intention for the total royalty and tax burden of an energy company to approach 40% of taxable income, which is approximately double that of the current fiscal regime. The new law, once approved by Parliament, would become effective January 1, 2015, at the earliest, respecting the royalty regime, and January 1, 2020, respecting new taxes. The new royalty and tax structure would be applicable to all production, without regard to when the well was drilled or the relevant concession granted.
As the new law has not yet been published and is expected to be significantly modified as compared to the version last published in October 2013, we are unable to estimate the impact of the law on our financial results or operations. However, any increase in royalties or income taxes to which we may be subject would have an adverse impact.
While these draft proposals are being reviewed and considered, we may encounter delays or policy changes respecting the approval by the Minister of Environment of changes to provisions of our concessions, such as our requests for extensions of work commitments or other modifications.
United States
State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production
Our U.S. exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state, and local regulation. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells, restricting the method of drilling and casing wells, regulating hydraulic fracturing, controlling water injections, setting forth the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.
Our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations. States in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas, including provisions regarding deliverability. Such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir. Certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences; mandate the use of specific procedures and facilities in handling specific substances and restrict the types, quantities, and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. These laws and regulations increase the costs of drilling and operating wells.
Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
Environmental regulatory programs typically regulate the permitting, construction, and operations of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Once operational, enforcement measures can include significant civil penalties for regulatory violations regardless of intent. Under appropriate circumstances, an administrative agency can issue a cease-and-desist order to terminate operations. New programs and changes in existing programs are routinely proposed, considered, and in some cases adopted, which both complicate compliance and potentially make it more expensive. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed, or arranged for the disposal, of the hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources, and the costs of certain health studies. In addition, companies that incur liability frequently confront additional claims because it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation, storage, transfer, and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA, however, excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, gas, or geothermal energy.” Because of this exclusion, many of our operations are exempt from RCRA regulation. However, these wastes may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies as nonhazardous wastes as long as these wastes are not commingled with regulated hazardous wastes. Moreover, in the ordinary course of our operations, wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or hazardous substances under CERCLA.
Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. The Clean Water Act regulates discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In June 2011, an oil leak occurred at our Southwest Cut Bank Sand Unit in Montana. We spent approximately $321,000 in 2011 in completing cleanup, mitigation, and restoration pursuant to an approved plan in cooperation with the Blackfeet Tribe and the EPA. Although we believe that we have satisfactorily completed the cleanup according to the specifications provided by the Blackfeet Tribe and the EPA, we cannot assure that the leak will not result in additional costs, sanctions, or penalties arising from civil or criminal actions and attendant negative publicity.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program promulgated under the SWDA, and state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others administration is delegated to the state. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking saltwater to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate air emissions of various pollutants through permitting programs and other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, in certain circumstances and locations, may be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants. In addition, in December 2012, the EPA released its study on the environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing and reported the methodologies and focus of this ongoing study, with a draft initial report to be released in late 2014.
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current and proposed exploration and production activities on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act, and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where the taking of, harm, or damage to a species, wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occurs or may occur, governmental entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages, and in some cases criminal penalties, for harm to a species, wetlands, habitat, or natural resources resulting from drilling, construction, or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances, or other regulated materials.
We are subject to federal and state hazard communications and community right-to-know statutes and regulations. These regulations govern recordkeeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances, including the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
Stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future, such as proposals made in Congress and at the state level from time to time, that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal, and cleanup requirements. The impact of any such changes, however, would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production.
We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws, rules, and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry.
Federal and Indian Leases
A substantial part of our producing properties in Montana consist of oil and gas leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management or the Blackfeet Tribe under the supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Our activities on these properties must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry, including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing Indian nation. Our operations on Indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including, in some instances, the employment of tribal members and the use of tribal contractors. We believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations.
Safety and Health Regulations
In all of our field activities, particularly our oilfield services segment, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, commonly referred to as OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public. Currently, we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations. However, since such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations.
Resource Extraction Reporting
Under 2012 regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we would have been required to begin reporting annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission the payments we make to governmental entities to further commercial development of oil and gas in 2014. During 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the SEC resource extraction disclosure rules.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a process in the completion or reworking of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure and rates sufficient to crack rock in the target formation to extend the cracks and leave behind a propping agent sufficient to keep the cracks open after pressurization ceases. The purpose of this treatment is to provide a pathway that allows the hydrocarbons to migrate from the rock to the well bore, thus stimulating natural gas and oil production.
During 2013, we hydraulically fractured three separate intervals encountering approximately 480 meters of relatively tight Rotliegend sandstone in the Plawce-2 well in Poland, without economic success. We are currently evaluating the possibility of hydraulically fracturing the Gorka-Duchowna-1 well in Poland during 2014. We have no current plans for future hydraulic fracturing in the United States.
We expect that PGNiG or we, as the operator of the particular project, will use industry-standard, long-established third-party service providers with specialized experience and equipment in hydraulic fracturing. In many instances, such service providers will be PGNiG subsidiaries. Prior to initiating a horizontal lateral to an existing well or drilling a new well that might result in a horizontal extension, we will include in the planning and budgetary process all costs associated with the fracture treatment. The costs of a well vary based on the depth to which it will be drilled, its horizontal length, and the completion technique to be used, which will include the added expenditure for the fracture treatment, as well as anticipated environmental and safety considerations.
Because we contract with industry-standard, long-established third-party service providers for all drilling, casing, and cementing services, we depend upon their industry expertise, safety processes, and best practices for conducting those operations. Our joint venture partners, advisers, and third-party service providers have significant, long-term experience with the engineering required to determine where and how a well should be drilled and whether the well should be hydraulically fractured as part of the completion process. Accordingly, we believe that we will be able to determine whether our third-party service providers are using proper drilling and completion techniques. Nevertheless, we will rely on them, in the case of fracturing services, to:
●
instantaneously monitor in real-time the rate and pressure of the fracturing treatment for any abrupt change in rate or pressure;
●
evaluate the environmental impact of additives to the hydraulic fracturing fluid;
●
minimize the use of water during the fracturing process; and
●
dispose of any produced water in a manner that avoids any impact on other resources and is in full compliance with all federal, state, and local governmental regulations.
We and PGNiG will rely fully on our third-party service providers to establish and carry out procedures to cope with any negative environmental impact that could occur in the event of a spill or leak in connection with their hydraulic fracturing services. The third-party service providers are typically responsible for costs arising out of any surface spillage, mishandling of fluids, or leakage from their equipment, including chemical additives. We may engage third-party contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services pursuant to service orders on a job-by-job basis. Some such service orders limit the liability of these contractors. Hydraulic fracturing operations can result in surface spillage or, in rare cases, the underground migration of fracturing fluids. Any such spillage or migration could result in litigation, government fines and penalties, or remediation or restoration obligations. Our current insurance policies provide some coverage for losses arising out of our hydraulic fracturing operations. However, these policies may not cover fines, penalties, or costs and expenses related to government-mandated cleanup activities, and total losses related to a spill or migration could exceed our per-occurrence or aggregate policy limits. Any losses due to hydraulic fracturing that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The specific chemical composition of the fluids used by the third-party service providers in hydraulic fracturing operations is expected to vary by project and by provider; however, we expect that the chemical composition of such fluids will meet industry standards and will be used in a manner that conforms to all relevant rules and regulations.
In order to prevent the underground migration of fracture fluids, we, and we expect PGNiG and third-party service providers to, follow industry-standard practices respecting casing, cementing, and testing to ensure good physical isolation of the fractured interval from other sections of the well. We will attempt to ensure that well construction processes and procedures conform to all relevant rules and regulations. We believe that the large thickness of rock formations between the fractured interval and any potable water sources will minimize the risk of underground migration of fracture fluids. In addition, we expect that surface casing will be set below the deepest known depth of all subsurface potable water, which is the depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones as determined by regulatory agencies, and the well casing will be cemented to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. We believe these aspects of well design will practicably eliminate a pathway for underground migration of the fracturing fluid to contact any fresh or potable water aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. We expect that third-party fracturing contractor employees will be trained in the safe handling of all fracturing fluids, chemical additives, and materials and will be required to wear appropriate protective clothing and eye and foot protection. Other protective measures may include safety briefings prior to conducting fracturing operations, the testing of pumping equipment and surface lines to pressures exceeding expected maximum fracture treating pressures prior to conducting fracturing operations, detailed fracture treating process checklists used by our fracturing contractors, and guidelines for the disposal of excess fracturing fluids.
Applicable laws typically impose responsibility on owners and operators for any costs resulting from underground migration of fracture fluids, and we are not fully insured against this risk. The occurrence of a significant event resulting from the underground migration of fracture fluids or surface spillage, mishandling, or leakage of fracture fluids could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. To date, there have been no such incidents, and the members of our management team have not encountered such an incident in their long-term experience in this industry.
In Poland, regulatory authorities have announced that if an exploration concession does not specifically cover horizontal drilling and fracturing, the operator must obtain a concession amendment before proceeding with fracturing operations. Such an amendment must be preceded by an environmental impact assessment, the scope of which is largely dependent upon the discretion of the relevant environmental authority, typically at the municipality level, with participation of regional environmental authorities. This process would likely require disclosure of the pressure and volumes of treatment fluids as well as the chemicals and other treatment components used.

Title to Properties
We rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the Polish government in connection with our activities in Poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination. We regularly consult with our Polish legal counsel when doing business in Poland.
Nearly all of our United States interests are held under leases from third parties. We typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations. We have obtained such title opinions or other third-party review on all of our producing properties, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Our United States properties are subject to typical burdens, including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes, but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with our activities on such properties. Further, we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our carrying cost of such properties and reserve estimates. Title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling, as is standard practice in the industry.
