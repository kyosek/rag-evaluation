ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The following describes the properties in Nevada on which we have signed agreements or letters of intent:
1. Antelope Ridge Silver/Gold Project - Eureka County, Nevada
The Company entered into a 10 year Mining Lease with Option to Purchase dated April 26, 2005 on 50 claims in the Fish Creek Mining District, Eureka County, Nevada. The Company made lease and option payments totaling $68,500 and incurred $189,746 in exploration costs with respect to this Project. In June, 2008 the Company terminated this agreement and recorded an impairment loss of $68,500.
2. Dome - HiHo Gold Project - Lander County, Nevada
Effective in April 2005, the Company entered into a five year Exploration and Option to Enter into a Joint Venture Agreement on 44 claims in Lander County, Nevada. The Company made lease and option payments totaling $137,000 and incurred $350,510 in exploration costs with respect to the Project. In June 2008 the Company terminated this agreement and recorded an impairment loss of $137,000.
3. Trinity Silver Project - Pershing County, Nevada
The Trinity Silver Project (“Trinity Silver”) is located 16 miles northwest of the town of Lovelock in Pershing County, Nevada. The property is accessed on the west side from a well-maintained dirt road off of state Highway 399. Heavy trucks can directly access the site by this route.
Trinity Silver consists of unpatented mining claims and about 5,000 acres of fee land, or about 5,800 acres in total, located in Pershing County, Nevada. AuEx, Inc. (“AuEx”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AuEx Ventures, Inc., leased this property package from Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) in late July 2005.
Silver mineralization was discovered at the Trinity property by US Borax in 1981. The age of this mineralization appears to be around 25 million years old. Following exploration by US Borax and Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp. from 1982 to 1986, US Borax operated an open pit mine on the property from 1987 to 1989, producing about 5 million ounces of silver from 1.1 million tons of oxidized ore before the property was then completely reclaimed. Santa Fe explored the district from 1990 to 1992, but since that time no further work has been done on the property, until our current drill program commenced the end of April 2006. A large volume of raw data and reports that were developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s were recently made available to us and we are still studying and compiling them into a drilling database.
We have now completed two drilling programs on this property. The results confirm the continuation of silver mineralization beneath the old Trinity Silver pit and along trend. Several holes showed grades in excess of 2 ounces per ton. In addition, these silver intercepts also contain lead and zinc values ranging from about 0.20% to about 2.0% on a combined basis. These and previous drill results are being studied and a silver resource computation has been made. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had made lease payments totaling $10,000 and had incurred $619,408 in exploration and property maintenance costs on this property.
We entered into a five (5) year Exploration and Development Agreement with AuEx on September 16, 2005. Upon executing the agreement, we made a cash payment to AuEx in the amount of $10,000. We must expend at least $75,000 on exploration during the first year of the agreement. In the second year, we must expend a further $125,000 on exploration. We have now completed both the first and second year’s work commitment, and a total of more than $610,000 has been expended on exploration on the Trinity Silver Property by the Company to date. A total of $1,000,000 must be expended on exploration and development within the first three (3) years to earn a 25% interest in the property and the project. We may then elect to expend an additional $1,000,000 prior to the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement to earn a 51% interest. At that point, we may elect to enter into a joint venture with AuEx or expend a further $2,000,000 on exploration and development to earn a 60% interest in the project and then enter into a joint venture with AuEx. Prior to the third anniversary, we may purchase the entire property from Newmont for $500,000, or for $1,000,000 after that date (such payment by us would be creditable against its earn-in requirements), subject to certain clawback provisions by Newmont and a sliding scale royalty that increases to five percent (5%) at silver prices above $10 per ounce. This royalty may be reduced by one percentage point under certain conditions. We may terminate our agreement with AuEx on 30 days notice.
We do not know whether we will succeed in locating an economic mineral deposit on this property. The Company has made lease payments totaling $10,000 and has incurred $619,408 in exploration and property maintenance costs with respect to the Trinity Silver Project as of December 31, 2008.
4. Bullion Mountain Gold Project - Lander County, Nevada
The Bullion Mountain Gold Project (“Bullion Mountain”) is located approximately 21 miles southeast of the town of Battle Mountain and approximately 8 miles west-southwest of Crescent Valley in Lander County, Nevada. The property is accessed on the west side from Battle Mountain via the Hilltop Road with four wheel drive trucks or on the east side from a well-maintained dirt road from Crescent Valley.
Bullion Mountain consists of the 17 unpatented ‘Bully’ claims, plus an additional 4 claims staked in late 2006, on Bullion Mountain in the northern Shoshone Range and in the Battle Mountain - Cortez trend. This property is located approximately 30 miles southeast of our Dome-HiHo property. The Shoshone Range is underlain by siliceous and volcanic rocks of Ordovician and Devonian age, in a complex array of fault slices in the upper plate of the Roberts Mountain Thrust. These sequences were subsequently intruded by an approximately 38 million year old (Eocene) granodiorite and overlain by Miocene basalts and andesites.
Exploration and small-scale mining around these claims date back to about the early 1900s. The only known modern exploration on this property was conducted in 1989 by ASARCO (formerly American Smelting and Refining Company) with the drilling of eight (8) vertical holes on the property obtaining intersections of 20 feet of 0.023 ounces of gold per ton; ten (10) feet of 0.204 ounces of gold per ton and several other ten (10) foot intersections grading more than 0.01 ounces of gold per ton. We have not confirmed these results. Assays of brecciated and limonitic surface samples on this property have returned assays of up to several tenths of an ounce of gold per ton. Detailed geologic mapping and soil sampling has been completed.
We entered into a ten-year Lease Agreement with Option to Purchase with Nevada Eagle Resources (“NER”) on March 1, 2006, effective November 11, 2005. Upon executing the agreement, we made a cash payment to NER in the amount of $5,000 and also reimbursed NER for $2,274 of claims holding fees. The same amount is due to NER on the first anniversary of the agreement, $10,000 in cash on the second anniversary, and $15,000 in cash at the beginning of each successive lease year after that. Work commitment expenditures are $20,000 during the first lease year and $50,000 in the second lease year, and in addition we are required to pay all property maintenance costs while the agreement is in effect. The first year’s work commitment has been completed. During the term of the agreement, we may purchase the property for $500,000, subject to a three percent (3%) Net Smelter Returns royalty on production from the property. Two (2) of the three (3) royalty points may be purchased for $1,000,000 each. All lease and claims and property maintenance payments and all work expenditure requirements and all other expenditures made for the benefit of the property by us would be deducted from this purchase price. We have the right to terminate this agreement at any time upon 60 days notice.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company had made lease payments totaling $27,000 and has incurred $27,305 in exploration costs.
On September 12, 2007, a ‘First Amendment to Mining Lease’ was signed extending the time for completing the required work obligation indefinitely to accommodate the Company’s efforts to consolidate its property position with those of adjacent property owners. Costs would be funded by the sale of common stock and warrants.
We do not know whether we will succeed in locating an economic mineral deposit on this property. The property holder has agreed to permit the Company to make a $7,000 payment in lieu of the $15,000.
5. Pasco Canyon Gold Project - Nye County, Nevada
The Pasco Canyon Gold Project (“Pasco Canyon”) is located approximately 55 miles north of the town of Tonopah, Nevada. This property is located in Nye County, Nevada, and consists of 24 contiguous unpatented mining claims. The property is accessed from state Highway 82 on the east side from a well-maintained dirt road. Heavy trucks can access the site by way of state Highway 82, which connects to U. S. Highway 50.
Pasco Canyon is an epithermal gold target within an alteration zone that was initially defined from satellite imagery. Outcroppings of hydrothermally altered volcanic breccia exhibit strong silicification and hypogene clay alteration with abundant limonite. Coarsely bladed quartz pseudomorphs after calcite in veins and in the breccia matrix are suggestive of a boiling zone, typically associated with low sulfide epithermal gold mineralization. The surface exposures are anomalous in arsenic, mercury, barium and manganese, common pathfinder elements in gold exploration, but the surface outcroppings are only weakly anomalous in gold. Gold values can vary significantly with depth in such deposits, and these surface exposures may represent the upper part of a mineralized system.
This property is located at the junction of two calderas, within the Toquima Caldera Complex. No claims had ever been filed on this property prior to its staking by AuEx in 2003. Two (2) holes were drilled by NDT Ventures, Ltd. in 2004, but they tested only the most accessible east fringe of the property to a depth of only about 600 feet. We have completed detailed geologic mapping and have submitted to the United States Forest Service a plan for road building and drilling. We currently awaiting the receipt of a drill permit. We are then planning to drill two reverse circulation holes to approximately 1,200 feet or more following receipt of the drilling permit.
We entered into a five (5) year Option Agreement with AuEx on February 14, 2006. Upon executing the agreement, we made a cash payment to AuEx in the amount of $10,000. We must pay all the claims maintenance fees and expend at least $50,000 in exploration expenditures during the first year; $100,000 during the second year; $200,000 during the third year; $200,000 during the fourth year and $450,000 during the fifth year of the Option Agreement to earn a 60% interest in the property and the project, subject to a one percent (1%) Net Smelter Returns royalty which would be payable to the two (2) principals of AuEx. We may terminate this agreement at any time after the first year upon 30 days notice. Upon achieving an undivided 60% interest, we will then form a joint venture and we would be the operator of the joint venture. On September 17, 2007 the Company was granted an ‘Agreement for Extension’ until July 14, 2008 to complete the work obligation.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company has made lease payments totaling $10,000 and has incurred $47,315 in exploration costs with respect to the Pasco Canyon Project. As of December 31, 2008 the Company has not completed all of the prescribed exploration expenditures because a drilling permit has not yet been granted by the U.S. Forest Service. However, on September 17, 2007, the Company was granted an indefinite ‘Agreement for Extension’ to complete the work obligation. The Company has now been given preliminary approval to receive a drill permit but has not yet completed the remaining requirements for the final issuance of the drill permit with the U.S. Forest Service.
We do not know whether we will succeed in locating an economic mineral deposit on this property.
6. Dutch Flat Gold Project - Humboldt County, Nevada
The Dutch Flat gold project is located 19 miles northeast of the town of Winnemucca and 15 miles north of Golconda in Humboldt County, Nevada (“Dutch Flat”). The property is accessed on the west side from Dutch Flat Road, a well maintained paved/dirt road. Heavy trucks can access the site by Dutch Flat Road, which connects to state Highway 95 and to U.S. Interstate Highway I-80 at Winnemucca.
Dutch Flat consists of 114 unpatented mining claims that are located at the northern end of the Battle Mountain - Eureka Trend and, at the southwest end of the Hot Springs Range. The host rocks are shales and feldspathic sandstones of the Cambrian Harmony Formation, which have been intruded by a younger, possibly Cretaceous age, granodiorite stock. The sedimentary rocks have been metamorphosed to hornfels with quartz veinlets at the contact with the intrusive.
Gold production of $211,276 is recorded from this district prior to 1950. Mercury production from 1936 to 1957 is recorded at 1,098 flasks. AGI explored this district from 1982 to 1988. They drilled 49 rotary holes totaling 14,381 feet with Brican Resources Ltd. between 1985 and 1988 and discovered a low-grade gold resource in the property.
Cordex Exploration Co. (“Cordex”) and Columbus Gold (U.S.) Corporation (“Columbus”) have consolidated and extended this claim position in recent years. They have also completed geologic mapping and sampling of the property and assembled the data and reports from previous exploration. A ground magnetic survey of the property has been completed and a shallow reverse circulation drilling program of about 2,550 feet was conducted on the property last fall. Based on the results of this shallow drilling program, a second drilling program consisting of 24 angled reverse circulation drill holes totaling 10,280 feet was conducted in October 2007. These holes were drilled to depths of from 245 to 820 feet. All but 4 of these holes encountered at least 10 feet of low grade gold. The two best intercepts were 145 feet averaging 0.021 ounces of gold per ton and 160 feet averaging 0.011 ounces of gold per ton. The mineralization is still open to the north and to the south. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had made the initial payment of $35,000 and incurred $508,516 in exploration costs with respect to this property.
We entered into a five (5) year Exploration Agreement With Option To Form Joint Venture with Columbus on July 2, 2006. Upon executing the agreement, we made a cash payment of $35,000. In accordance with the agreement we must expend at least $200,000 in exploration expenditures during the first year; $300,000 during the second year; and $500,000 during each of the third, fourth and fifth years of the agreement. Except for the initial $35,000 cash payment, all payments made by us for the benefit of the project shall be credited towards the work expenditure requirements, including payment of the annual claims maintenance fees. More than $445,000 has been expended by the Company on exploration at Dutch Flat to date. We shall have the right to appoint the operator of the exploration work program at the commencement of each agreement year and we have appointed Columbus, which will utilize the services and expertise of Cordex, to operate the exploration work program for the first year of the agreement. Upon completion of the $2,000,000 in exploration expenditures over the five (5) year period, we shall have earned a 51% interest in the property. We can then elect to (i) earn an additional 19% interest by funding a positive feasibility study for the project, or (ii) form a 51% joint venture with Columbus. We would be the operator of the joint venture. We may terminate this agreement at any time after the first year upon 30 days notice.
Six (6) of the claims are subject to a one and one half percent (1.5%) Net Smelter Returns royalty. An Area of Interest extending two (2) miles from the exterior boundaries of the property has been established by the parties. Also, one (1) of our current directors has an interest in a company that holds a one percent (1%) Net Smelter Returns royalty on 16 of the claims as well as additional claims located within a portion of the Area of Interest.
We do not know whether we will succeed in locating an economic mineral deposit on this property. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has made the initial payment of $35,000 and has incurred $508,516 in exploration costs with respect to the Dutch Flat Gold Project.
7. PPM Gold Project - Humboldt County, Nevada
In April, 2007, the Company signed an “Exploration Agreement with Option to Form Joint Venture” (the “Exploration Agreement”) with Miranda US, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Miranda Gold Corp. (“Miranda”), a Canadian corporation listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
The PPM Gold Project is located at the north end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend on the west flank of the Hot Springs mountains and about 30 miles north of the town of Winnemucca. It is about 12 miles northwest of the Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge and Pinson gold deposits where past production and current resources now exceed 23 million ounces of gold. This property now consists of 81 unpatented claims. The property overlies a northeast striking fault system that intersects biogeochemical gold-in sagebrush anomalies near the margin of an inferred buried intrusive and adjacent to a sediment hosted mercury district. Such mercury occurrences are frequently closely associated with sediment hosted gold systems in Nevada. Further gold and mercury in sagebrush survey were conducted in late 2007 and have further refined drill targets. It is currently planned to conduct the first drill program this spring.
Under the terms of the Exploration Agreement, the Company has an option to earn a 55% interest in 44 mining claims, located in Humboldt County, Nevada by incurring $1,750,000 in exploration work during a five year period as follows:
(i)
paying $25,000 within 30 days of the effective date of the Exploration Agreement (paid);
(ii)
incurring at least $175,000 in exploration work during the first year of the Exploration Agreement;
(iii)
incurring an additional $200,000 in exploration work during the second year;
(iv)
incurring an additional $300,000 in exploration work during the third year;
(v)
incurring an additional $425,000 in exploration work during the fourth year; and
(vi)
incurring an additional $650,000 in exploration work during the fifth year.
Upon completing the total $1,750,000 work expenditure requirement, the Company will have earned a 55% interest in the property and the project. At that point, the Company will enter into a joint venture with Miranda, with the Company being the operator. After the first year of the agreement, the Company may terminate the agreement at any time on 30 days written notice. The Company must pay all claims maintenance fees, which will be creditable against the work commitment expenditure requirement.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company has expended $142,440, which includes an initial payment of $25,000 on signing and a reclamation bond of $11,566 on this property. The Company is in discussions with the Optionor to amend the terms of the option and allow additional time to complete exploration expenditures requirement. The option is currently still in good standing.
8. Willow Creek Gold Project - Elko County, Nevada
On June 16, 2008, the Company entered into an Exploration Agreement with Option to Form a Joint Venture with Carlin Gold Corporation (“Carlin”). A Letter of Intent was signed with Carlin Gold Corporation on the Willow Creek property, Elko County, Nevada. An initial payment of $10,000 was made in November, 2007 and $300,000 was advanced to Carlin on signing the agreement, to cover the first year’s work commitment. In addition, 100,000 common shares valued at $15,000 were issued to Carlin on July 8, 2008 to acquire the option interest which was capitalized as a mineral property acquisition cost.
This Agreement grants to the Company the exclusive right to earn a 51% interest in the property by completing expenditures of $3,500,000 over a five year period as follows:
The Company can terminate this Agreement at any time after completion of the first year’s work requirement. The Company will be required to make all property maintenance payments and pay $10,000 to Carlin Gold on each anniversary date of the agreement. Upon earning 51% interest, the parties would enter into a joint venture agreement.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company has incurred $284,404 in exploration costs, including a reclamation bond of $17,773, under the first year’s work commitment. A balance of $28,180 is recorded in prepaid expenses, which is related to the remaining work commitment monies advanced.
We do not know whether we will succeed in locating an economic mineral deposit on this property.
9. Morgan Pass Project - Elko County, Nevada
On May 20, 2008, the Company signed a Letter of Intent with Nevada Eagle Resources LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gryphon Gold Corporation on the Morgan Pass property in Elko County, Nevada. The Letter of Intent is effective for five years, during which time the parties will negotiate an “Exploration Agreement with Option to Form Joint Venture” at such time as the property is released into “multiple use” from a “wilderness study area”. During this time the Company must:
-
Pay for staking and registration of initial claims.
-
Commencing with the 2008-2009 assessment year, pay all maintenance requirements.
-
Pay $20,000 upon release of the properties into “multiple use” classification.
-
Upon release of the properties into “multiple use”, a five year option and earn in agreement would be signed and a work program totaling $750,000 over a five year period would commence beginning from the date of the signing of the formal agreement.
As of December 31, 2008, the Company has incurred $14,351 in exploration costs.
