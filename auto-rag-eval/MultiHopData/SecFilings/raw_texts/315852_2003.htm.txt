ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
On December 31, 2003, the Company held working interests in 11,941 gross (6,080 net) productive wells and royalty interests in an additional 227 wells. Including its 50% share of Great Lakes’ reserves, its properties contained, net to its interest, estimated proved reserves of 486 Bcf of gas and 22 million barrels of oil and 11 million barrels of NGLs or a total of 685 Bcfe.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves at the end of each of the past five years:
(a)
Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at a rate of 6 mcf per barrel.
At December 31, 2003, 72.1% of the Company’s proved reserves by volume were classified as developed and 27.9% were classified as undeveloped. The undeveloped reserves were located 58% in Appalachia, 28% in Southwest and 14% in the Gulf Coast regions.
At year-end 2003, the following independent petroleum consultants reviewed the Company’s reserves: DeGolyer and MacNaughton (Southwest and Gulf Coast), H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. (Southwest), and Wright and Company, Inc. (Appalachia). These engineers were selected for their geographic expertise and their history in engineering certain properties. At December 31, 2003, these consultants collectively reviewed approximately 87% of the proved reserves. All estimates of oil and gas reserves are subject to uncertainty.
The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues, excluding open hedging contracts, from proved reserves, the present value of those revenues and the expected realized prices used in projecting them over the past five years (in millions except prices):
Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including production taxes and operating expenses). Such calculations, prepared in accordance with SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities,” are based on costs and prices in effect at December 31, 2003. Weighted average product prices at December 31, 2003 were $29.48 per barrel of oil, $19.93 per barrel for natural gas liquids, and $6.03 per mcf of gas using benchmark NYMEX prices of $32.52 per barrel and $6.19 per Mmbtu. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated and prices and costs will not remain constant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. No estimates of reserves have been filed with or included in reports to another federal authority or agency since year-end.
Significant Properties
The Company’s operations are divided into three geographical divisions known as Southwest, Gulf Coast and Appalachia. The Appalachia division represents the Company’s 50% ownership in Great Lakes. At year-end, the Company’s properties included working interests in 11,714 (6,080 net) productive oil and gas wells, royalty interests in an additional 227 wells, and 834,000 (376,000 net) undeveloped acres. Of amounts included in the oil and NGL category, 68% is oil. The following tables sets forth summary information by division with respect to estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2003:
(a)
Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at a rate of 6 mcf per barrel.
Southwest division
The Southwest division conducts production and field operations in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the East Texas Basin as well as in the Texas Panhandle and the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. This region represents 48% of the Company’s total reserves by value and 50% by volume. Proved reserves in the Southwest division totaled 344 Bcfe, of which 54% was gas. Reserves increased 104.6 Bcfe, a 44% increase over 2002 due to purchases, additions, favorable revisions based
upon well performance and higher commodity prices. The region’s daily production totaled 78.2 Mmcfe per day, representing 49% of total production. On an annual basis, production increased 9% over 2002. At year-end, the Southwest division had an inventory of 166 proven recompletions and 169 proven drilling locations. Acreage owned in the region at that date included 256,000 (194,000 net) developed acres and 154,000 (112,000 net) undeveloped acres. During 2003, 99 (86.4 net) development wells were drilled in the region, of which 85 (76.1 net) were productive and 5 (4.3 net) exploratory wells were drilled, of which 1 (1.0 net) was productive. During the year, the region achieved an 85% drilling success rate.
In West Texas, in the Conger Field of Sterling County, the Company added approximately 86 Bcfe in reserves in 2003. Drilling added 5.9 Bcfe as 12 (11.2 net) wells were drilled, of which 10 (9.2 net) were successful. Another 80 Bcfe in reserves were added in December 2003, when the Company completed an $87.1 million producing property acquisition adjacent to its current operations. The acquisition, which established Range as the largest operator in the field, added 500 operated wells to Range’s existing 300 wells. Production from the acquired properties is expected to exceed 22 Mmcfe per day, while total field production is expected to reach 35 Mmcfe per day in 2004. The properties encompass 38,000 (32,000 net) acres and include a 400-mile gathering system. To date, the Company has identified 64 drilling locations and has plans to drill a number of them in 2004. At the Fuhrman-Mascho field in Andrews County, where a waterflood redevelopment project was undertaken in 2002, a total of 27 (26.0 net) producers and 11 (11.0 net) injectors have been successfully drilled. At year-end, the combined daily production rate from the field was approximately 8.5 Mmcfe per day. In total, 2003 drilling added 13 Bcfe in reserves to the field. A response to the waterflood is expected by the end of 2004. Even if the waterflood fails to yield a positive response, primary production has proved to be economic. If the waterflood does yield a positive response, a multi-phase expansion project is planned. At Powell Ranch in Glasscock County, 3 (2.2 net) wells were drilled, of which 1(0.2 net) was successful. At year-end, production from that field totaled 6.9 net Mmcfe per day. In the Val Verde Basin, a recompletion program in 2003 added 1.8 Mmcfe per day to production. In addition, 8 (7.0 net) wells were drilled, of which 6 (5.5 net) were successful. By year-end, production from Range’s 202 wells in the Val Verde Basin totaled 14.5 (10.1 net) Mmcfe per day.
In East Texas, the second and third phases of a high-volume lift program were completed in 2003 in the Laura LaVelle field in Houston County. A fourth phase is currently underway. The project is designed to expand the field’s water disposal system and facilitate increased pumping capacity. With 13 (12.8 net) shallow wells drilled in the field at average depths of 2,000 feet last year, production increased 18% to 4.4 (4.0 net) Mmcfe per day at year-end. In 2004, there are 3 (3.0 net) exploratory wells planned to test several medium-depth formations including the Wilcox, Woodbine and Buda formations in Houston County, at depths ranging between 6,000 and 11,000 feet. In Tyler County, Range has identified 4 (1.75 net) deeper Woodbine prospects on existing properties. These Woodbine wells target formations at depths in excess of 14,000 feet. In the James Lime trend of East Texas, 3 (2.0 net) wells drilled in 2003, of which 2 (1.5 net) proved successful.
In the Texas Panhandle, the Morrow play in the Texas Panhandle continued to yield significant production and reserve growth for Range in 2003. Drilling success in the area resulted in a net 62% increase in production for the area compared to the previous year-end. Equally important, strategic leasehold purchases during 2003 increased Range’s acreage position in the play to 69,000 (52,000 net) acres, adding in excess of 20 potential drilling locations. In addition, the Company has acquired 912 miles of 2-D seismic data covering the field that is currently being processed and interpreted. Range continues to pursue the acquisition of additional acreage in the area. The division drilled 21 (17.7 net) Morrow wells in the Texas Panhandle in 2003, achieving an 84% success rate. The 17 (14.8 net) successful wells are currently producing at a net of 8.6 Mmcfe per day. In 2004, a total of 21 (14.5 net) wells are planned in the area to test various formations including Morrow, Hunton, Woodford and Brown Dolomite.
In the Anadarko Basin, Range drilled a total of 10 (5.6 net) wells in the Watonga-Chickasha trend of the Anadarko Basin, achieving a 98% success rate. The most notable successes were 6 (4.0 net) wells drilled on undeveloped leasehold acquired by Range in late 2002. The net production rate for the six wells at December 2003 was 2.7 Mmcfe per day. A total of 9 (4.3 net) wells are planned in this trend in 2004. The division also has plans in 2004 to test several deeper and higher potential prospects in western Oklahoma.
Gulf Coast division
The Gulf Coast division represents 17% of total Company reserves by value and 11% by volume. Proved reserves totaled 78.7 Bcfe, a decrease of 8% compared to 2002. During the year, the region’s production totaled 45.2 Mmcfe per day. Gulf Coast reserves are 90% natural gas. Properties are located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The division’s wells are characterized by high initial rates and relatively short reserve lives. Production by the Gulf Coast division represented 28% of the Company’s total. Major onshore fields produce from Hartburg formations at depths of 10,000 to 11,000 feet in the Upper Texas Gulf Coast to the Upper Oligocene in South Louisiana at depths of 10,000 to 12,000 feet to the Sligo and Hosston formations at depths of 15,000 to 16,500 feet in the Oakvale field in Mississippi. Range operates a majority of its onshore properties while third parties operate its offshore properties. Offshore properties include interests in 37 platforms in water depths ranging from 11 to 240 feet. The Gulf Coast’s development inventory includes 34 recompletions and 13 drilling locations on 129,000 (43,000 net) developed acres and 54,000 (14,000 net) undeveloped acres.
In 2003, the region spent $20.1 million to drill 4 (1.7 net) wells, recomplete 12 (3.6 net) others and to upgrade facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2003, net production averaged 647 barrels of oil and 42.4 Mmcf of gas per day or 46.2 Mmcfe per day in total. Production during the year increased 1% to 45.2 Mmcfe per day, reversing a 22% decrease in production from the previous year. With minimal drilling in 2003 and no acquisitions, the division replaced only 58% of production. During 2003, 1 development well (0.5 net) was drilled, which was productive. Three exploratory wells (1.2 net) were drilled with 2 (1.1 net) proving productive.
No new offshore wells were drilled in 2003, but work progressed to set up several significant wells for 2004 drilling. The joint venture formed between Range and two other companies continued to explore the central shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Since forming the joint venture in 2001, $3.1 million has been spent on seismic data. The joint venture increased its total 3-D seismic data coverage from 6,100 square miles to 6,250 square miles in 2003 and the joint technical team continues to work the data, with a total number of 43 identified prospects. The joint venture continues to pursue leases and farm-ins to capture these leads and successfully secured leases in the March 2003 government sale that will allow for 2004 drilling of 2 (0.3 net) exploration wells. Range owns a 14% working interest in both prospects, which are on trend with other producers. The joint venture also secured a farm-in that will drill in the first half of 2004. Range owns a 10.5% working interest in this prospect.
Outside of the joint venture, Range is participating in 3 (0.8 net) offshore wells in the first quarter of 2004. The Chandeleur 17 S/L 17619#1 and the High Island 111 A-10 Sidetrack both reached total depth and set production casing in January, with production expected in March. The West Cameron 56 #17, an initial offset to the Company’s 2002 West Cameron discovery, began drilling in January. If successful, this fault-separated offset could prove up two additional locations. In addition, the Falcon Prospect, located on East Cameron Block 33, is scheduled to spud later in 2004. This high risk/high reward project exposes Range to significant reserves at a potential net dry hole cost of $2.6 million. The Company retains a 25% working interest to casing point and a 37% working interest after casing point. Finally, Range has partnered with ExxonMobil licensing a portion of their 3-D seismic shoot of the old West Delta #30 field. Range has identified several leads. The first development location, a sidetrack, is scheduled to drill in the first quarter of 2004. Range retains a 49% interest in the field.
Onshore, Range had a successful year, increasing onshore production by 16%. Using state-of-the-art seismic technology to reprocess 3-D data and through skillful interpretation of subtle reflectors, the technical team successfully identified and drilled several high-rate producers. The team will attempt to replicate their success utilizing 500 square miles of reprocessed 3-D seismic covering onshore south Louisiana to search for additional opportunities overlooked with predecessor technologies.
Following up on a Marg howei discovery well drilled in south Louisiana in late 2002, 2 (0.9 net) additional wells were successfully drilled in 2003. All three wells have been prolific producers, with cumulative total production through year-end of 6.6 (2.1 net) Bcfe. Another South Louisiana well, the Hubbard #1, a 14,000 foot Nonion Struma test, spud in November and is currently drilling. Range has a 21% working interest in the prospect. In addition, 1 (0.6 net) well is planned in the South Louisiana area in the first quarter of 2004. In the Gulf Coast area, Range had exploration success with another seismically defined prospect. Range drilled a 14,500 foot well in late 2003, encountering 55 net feet of pay. Range owns 68% working interest in the well, which recently tested at 7.4 (3.7 net) Mmcfe per day with reservoir pressure of 9,300 pounds. Finally, one Vicksburg exploration well, in which Range owned a 10% working interest, was drilled in Orange County and proved unproductive. The Gulf Coast 2004 drilling program includes the drilling of 13 (3.7 net) offshore wells and 5 (2.4 net) onshore wells.
Appalachian division
Through its 50% interest in Great Lakes, the Appalachia division represents 262 Bcfe of proved reserves, or 39% by volume and 35% by value of total proved reserves. The region has a working interest in 9,175 gross (4,096 net) wells and approximately 5,000 miles of gas gathering lines. At December 31, 2003, Great Lakes had an inventory 1,701 proven drilling locations and of 52 proven recompletions.
Acreage owned in the Appalachian region at December 31, 2003 included 869,000 (415,000 net) developed acres and 627,000 (249,000 net) undeveloped acres. During 2003, 238 (105.1 net) development wells were drilled, of which 236 (104.1 net) were productive. Twelve (2.8 net) exploratory wells were drilled, of which 8 (1.8 net) were productive. At December 31, 2003, Great Lakes operated 99% of its wells. The reserves are 87% gas and produce principally from the Upper Devonian, Medina, Clinton, Knox and Oriskany formations at depths ranging from 2,500 to 7,000 feet. For the year, net daily production averaged 30.6 Mmcfe of gas and 852 barrels of oil, or a total of 35.7 Mmcfe per day. The division’s properties, with 1,753 proven projects at year-end, are located in the Appalachian and, to a minor extent, the Michigan Basins of the northeastern United States. After initial flush production, these properties are characterized by gradual decline rates, producing on average for 10 to 35 years.
In 2003, $20.9 million in capital funded the drilling of 238 (105.1 net) shallow development wells, 9 (2.2 net) medium depth exploration wells and 3 (0.6 net) deep exploration wells. In addition, capital was expended on one (0.5 net) recompletion as well as the purchase of 219 miles of seismic data and 258,000 (86,000 net) acres of leasehold. Of the 238 development wells drilled, 236 were successful. Eight of the 12 exploration wells were also successful, indicating an overall 98% success rate. Year-end proved reserves increased approximately 4% to 262 Bcfe as a result of acquisitions, additions and higher commodity prices.
The majority of the division’s drilling expenditures are directed toward two large shallow-development plays which include the Clinton-Medina and Upper Devonian sandstone trends. In 2003, Great Lakes drilled 156 (68.3 net) wells in the Clinton-Medina and 70 (31.0 net) wells in the Upper Devonian shallow plays with an overall success rate of 99%. Approximately 89% of the division’s capital budget will target shallow drilling in 2004, funding the drilling of 157 (68.2 net) Clinton-Medina wells and 88 (44.0 net) Upper Devonian wells.
In 2003, the division focused on expanding its shallow play development areas. A total of 18 (9.0 net) wells were drilled to test five new shallow development areas. Fifteen (8.0 net) of the test wells were successful, resulting in the extension of two existing fields and establishing at least three new development areas. To date, as many as 40 potential drill sites have been identified in the new development plays. Continued testing of the new areas, as well as leasing activity is planned in 2004.
Approximately 11% of the division’s 2003 capital budget targeted both developmental and exploratory drilling to medium and deep plays. In 2003, a total of 12 (2.8 net) exploratory wells were drilled to medium/deep targets, of which 8 (1.8 net) were successful. Highlights include a Trenton-Black River discovery in New York that establishes a new field in an area where the Company owns 50,000 (25,000 net) acres. The well is currently shut-in awaiting pipeline connection. In addition, 2 (0.6 net) Oriskany sandstone discoveries were made in southwestern and north central Pennsylvania. These wells are currently shut-in awaiting pipeline connection or are producing under restricted pipeline conditions. In 2004, the Company plans to drill 14 (4.7 net) exploratory wells, including 5 (1.1 net) to the Trenton-Black River trend, 3 (0.8 net) of which have anticipated well depths above 4,500 feet.
