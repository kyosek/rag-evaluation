(1) The designation of a well as an oil well or gas well is made by the General Partner based on the relative amount of oil and gas reserves for the well. Regardless of a well's oil or gas designation, it may produce oil, gas, or both oil and gas. (2) As used in this Annual Report, "gross well" refers to a well in which a working interest is owned; accordingly, the number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. (3) As used in this Annual Report, "net well" refers to the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
For example, a 15% working interest in a well represents one gross well, but 0.15 net well.

Oil and Gas Production, Revenue, and Price History
The following tables set forth certain historical information concerning the oil (including condensates) and gas production, net of all royalties, overriding royalties, and other third party interests, of the Partnerships, revenues attributable to such production, and certain price and cost information. As used in the tables, direct operating expenses include lease operating expenses and production taxes. In addition, gas production is converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf per barrel, representing the estimated relative energy content of gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. The respective prices of oil and gas are affected by market and other factors in addition to relative energy content.

Proved Reserves and Net Present Value
The following table sets forth each Partnership's estimated proved oil and gas reserves and net present value therefrom as of December 31, 2004. The schedule of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves was prepared by the General Partner in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain reserve information was reviewed by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), an independent petroleum engineering firm. As used throughout this Annual Report, "proved reserves" refers to those estimated quantities of crude oil, gas, and gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Net present value represents estimated future gross cash flow from the production and sale of proved reserves, net of estimated oil and gas production costs (including production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and operating expenses) and estimated future development costs, discounted at 10% per annum. Net present value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves was calculated on the basis of current costs and prices at December 31, 2004. Such prices were not escalated except in certain circumstances where escalations were fixed and readily determinable in accordance with applicable contract provisions. Oil and gas prices at December 31, 2004 ($43.36 per barrel and $6.02 per Mcf, respectively) were higher than the prices in effect on December 31, 2003 ($29.25 per barrel and $5.77 per Mcf, respectively). This increase in oil and gas prices has caused the estimates of remaining economically recoverable reserves, as well as the values placed on said reserves, at December 31, 2004 to be higher than the previous estimates and values at December 31, 2003. The prices used in calculating the net present value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and gas production subsequent to December 31, 2004. There can be no assurance that the prices used in calculating the net present value of the Partnerships' proved reserves at December 31, 2004 will actually be realized for such production.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history, and viability of production under varying economic conditions; consequently, it is reasonably possible that material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the near future. Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that these reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessment possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these
estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.

(1) Includes certain gas balancing adjustments which cause the gas volumes and net present values to differ from the reserve reports prepared by the General Partner and reviewed by Ryder Scott.
No estimates of the proved reserves of the Partnerships comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. Additional information relating to the Partnerships' proved reserves is contained in Note 4 to the Partnerships' financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Significant Properties
The following table sets forth the number and percent of each Partnership's total wells which are operated by affiliates of the Partnerships as of December 31, 2004:
Operated Wells ------------------------------------------- Partnership Number Percent ----------- ------ ------- II-A 69 6% II-B 42 18% II-C 60 17% II-D 38 14% II-E 40 2% II-F 56 2% II-G 56 2% II-H 56 2%
The following tables set forth certain well and reserve information as of December 31, 2004 for the basins in which the
Partnerships own a significant amount of properties. The tables contain the following information for each significant basin: (i) the number of gross wells and net wells, (ii) the number of wells in which only a non-working interest is owned, (iii) the Partnership's total number of wells, (iv) the number and percentage of wells operated by the Partnership's affiliates, (v) estimated proved oil reserves, (vi) estimated proved gas reserves, and (vii) the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future net cash flow.
The Anadarko Basin is located in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, while the Southern Oklahoma Folded Belt Basin is located in southern Oklahoma. The Gulf Coast Basin is located in southern Louisiana and southeast Texas, while the Permian Basin straddles west Texas and southeast New Mexico. The Sacramento Basin is located in central California, and the Uinta Basin is located in northeast Utah.
Title to Oil and Gas Properties
Management believes that the Partnerships have satisfactory title to their oil and gas properties. Record title to all of the Partnerships' properties is held by either the Partnerships or Geodyne Nominee Corporation, an affiliate of the General Partner.
Title to the Partnerships' properties is subject to customary royalty, overriding royalty, carried, working, and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, and to other encumbrances. Management believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the Partnerships' interest therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the Partnerships' business.
