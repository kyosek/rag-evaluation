ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2018, we had 237 properties in North America containing approximately 26.3 million RSF of operating properties and development and redevelopment of new Class A properties (under construction or pre-construction), including 11 properties that are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and six properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. See our definitions of annual rental revenue and operating statistics in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” section under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of the basis used to compute the aforementioned measures. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 97.3% as of December 31, 2018. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science and technology tenants. These improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:
•
Reinforced concrete floors;
•
Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•
Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•
Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•
Enhanced environmental control technology;
•
Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•
Laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2018, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of 29 properties in North America that accounted for approximately 12% of our total number of properties. Of these 29 properties, we held 16 properties in the Greater Boston market, six properties in the San Francisco market, two properties in the New York City market, two properties in the Seattle market, one property in the Maryland market, and two properties in the Research Triangle Park market pursuant to ground leasehold interests. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our ground lease rental expense aggregated 1.5% as a percentage of net operating income. Refer to further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 708 leases with a total of 537 tenants, and 116, or 49%, of our 237 properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of four to 11 years, while leases in our single-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2018:
•
Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented 52% of our total annual rental revenue;
•
Approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;
•
Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and
•
Approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.

Our lease to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company at 1208 Eastlake Avenue East in our Lake Union submarket expired on December 31, 2018, and we have re-leased 78% of the expired 97,366 RSF to a life science pharmaceutical company. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company also currently leases 106,003 RSF at 1201 Eastlake Avenue East in our Lake Union submarket that expires during the first half of 2019 and we have re-leased 100% of this RSF to an investment-grade institutional research center. Subsequent to the close of the transaction, our future remaining annual rental revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is expected to be approximately 4.7%.

Leasing activity
•
Executed a total of 207 leases, with a weighted-average lease term of 9.1 years, for 4.7 million RSF, including 1.7 million RSF related to our development and redevelopment projects during the year ended December 31, 2018; leasing activity of 4.7 million RSF represents the second highest annual leasing activity in Alexandria’s history; and
•
Solid rental rate increases of 24.1% and 14.1% (cash basis). Rental rate increase of 14.1% (cash basis) represents the highest increase during the past 10 years.
Approximately 58% of the 207 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, did not include concessions for free rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we granted tenant concessions/free rent averaging 2.2 months with respect to the 4.7 million RSF leased.
The following chart presents renewed/re-leased space and development/redevelopment/previously vacant space leased for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:
Lease structure
Our Same Properties total revenue growth of 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Same Properties net operating income and Same Properties net operating income (cash basis) increases for the year ended December 31, 2018, of 3.7% and 9.2%, respectively, benefited significantly from strong market fundamentals. The limited supply of Class A space in AAA locations and strong demand from innovative tenants drove rental rate increases of 24.1% and 14.1% (cash basis) on 2.1 million renewed/re-leased RSF, while a favorable triple net lease structure with contractual annual rent escalations resulted in both a consistent Same Properties operating margin of 71% and occupancy of 96.6% across our 185 Same Properties aggregating 17.2 million RSF. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained contractual annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Investments in real estate
A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new Class A properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset values. Our pre-construction activities are undertaken in order to get the property ready for its intended use and include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements.
