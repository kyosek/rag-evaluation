ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
MALLS
Each of the Malls is an enclosed regional shopping complex. Each Mall generally has at least three Anchors which own or lease their stores and numerous Mall Stores, most of which are national or regional retailers, located along enclosed malls connecting the Anchors. At most of the Malls, additional freestanding restaurants and retail stores are located on the periphery of the Mall complex. These freestanding stores are, in most cases, owned by their occupants. Seven of the Mall complexes include one or more Associated Centers.
The total GLA of the 18 Malls is approximately 12.5 million square feet or an average GLA of approximately 693,000 square feet per Mall. The Company classifies its regional malls into two categories - Stabilized Malls which have completed their initial lease-up and New Malls which are in the initial lease-up phase. Currently, Oak Hollow Mall in High Point, North Carolina, Turtle Creek Mall in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Westgate Mall in Spartanburg, South Carolina are characterized as New Malls. The Stabilized Mall occupancy was 89.0% at December 31, 1996 (94% including leased Anchor GLA). The Company wholly owns all but five of its Malls and manages all but one of them.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, Mall revenues represented approximately 72.0%, 72.5% and 72.8%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
Stabilized Mall Store occupancy decreased from 89.8% at December 31, 1995, to 89.0% at December 31, 1996. St. Clair Square and Foothills Mall, which were acquired during 1996, were included in the Stabilized Mall category at December 31, 1996. If such malls had not been included, occupancy would have been 89.7% in the Stabilized Mall category.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, average Stabilized Mall Store sales per square foot were approximately $226, $237 and $240, respectively (computed using a monthly weighted average). Average Stabilized Mall Store sales per square foot increased by 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1995.
Average base rent per square foot at the Mall Stores increased from $18.72 at December 31, 1995 to $19.64 at December 31, 1996.
Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for tenants in the Stabilized Malls (excluding St. Clair Square and Foothills Mall which the Company did not own for the entire 1996 year) were 12.2%, 12.3% and 11.7% for the years 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively.
The Malls are generally located in middle-markets. Management believes that the Malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only or largest enclosed malls within their respective trade areas. Trade areas have been identified by management based upon a number of sources of information, including the location of other malls, publicly available population information, customer surveys, surveys of customer automobile license plates as well as ZIP codes and third-party market studies.
The two largest revenue-producing Malls are Hamilton Place and CoolSprings Galleria. Hamilton Place is located on a 187-acre site in Chattanooga, Tennessee and represented, as of December 31, 1996, 5.67% of the Properties' total GLA, 6.38% of total Mall Store GLA and 9.8% of total revenues from the Company's Properties. CoolSprings Galleria is located on a 148-acre site in metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee and represented, as of December 31, 1996, 5.6% of the Properties' total GLA, 6.51% of total Mall Store GLA and 8.92% of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
Fourteen of the eighteen Malls have undergone an expansion or remodeling since their opening, and all of the Malls have either been built or renovated in the last 10 years or are in the process of being renovated with the exception of Hamilton Place which is scheduled for renovation in 1998. Four of the Malls have available Anchor pads providing expansion potential totaling approximately 358,000 buildable square feet at December 31, 1996. The Company constructed a Dillard's on two of the available anchor pads at Twin Peaks Mall and Frontier Mall which opened in March, 1997 leaving approximately 205,700 buildable square feet. Eighteen existing Anchors at ten Malls have aggregate expansion potential at their existing stores of approximately 473,000 buildable square feet.
With the exception of Westgate Mall and St. Clair Square which were acquired by the Company in March 1995 and November, 1996 respectively, each of the Malls was developed by the Company. The land underlying the Malls is owned in fee in all cases, except for Walnut Square, Westgate Mall, and St. Clair Square, which are each subject to long-term ground leases for all or a portion of the land underlying these malls.
The table on the following page sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as of December 31, 1996.

ANCHORS. Anchors are a critical factor in a Mall's success because of the public's identification with a property typically focuses on its Anchors. Mall Anchors generally are department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the Malls derive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchor stores than from Mall Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in generating customer traffic and making the Malls desirable locations for Mall Store tenants.
Anchors either own their stores together with the land under them and sometimes with adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores at rental rates that are significantly lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores. Anchors which lease their stores account for approximately 12.0% of the total revenues from the Company's Properties. Each Anchor which owns its own store has entered into a reciprocal easement agreement with the Company covering, among other things, operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansions.
The Malls have a total of 84 Anchors. No Anchor Stores at any of the Malls were vacant as of December 31, 1996. The Fashion Bar lease at Cheyenne, Wyoming, expired January 31, 1997 and is currently vacant . The following table indicates all Mall Anchors and sets forth the aggregate number of square feet owned or leased by Anchors in the Malls as of December 31, 1996.

MALL STORES. The Malls have approximately 1,492 Mall Stores. National or regional chains (excluding individually franchised stores) lease approximately 81.52% of the occupied Mall Store GLA. Although Mall Stores occupy only 34.1% of total Mall GLA, for the year ended December 31, 1996, the Malls derived approximately 88.0% of their revenue from Mall Stores.
Among the companies with the largest representation among Mall Stores are: The Limited Stores, Inc./Intimate Brands (The Limited, Limited Too, Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, Structure, Victoria Secret, and Bath and Body Works) and Woolworth Corporation (Footlocker, Lady Footlocker, Kinney Shoes, Champs Sports Stores, Afterthoughts Boutique and San Francisco Music Box). As of December 31, 1996, The Limited Stores, Inc.'s/Intimate Brands 65 stores accounted for 10.9% of total leased GLA and 8.37% of total revenues from the Company's Properties. No single Mall Store retailer accounted for more than 11.0% of total leased GLA and no single Mall Store retailer accounted for more than 8.37% of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

COST OF OCCUPANCY. Management believes that in order to maximize the Company's Funds from Operations, tenants in Mall Stores must be able to operate profitably. A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is the tenant's cost of occupancy.
The following table summarizes for Stabilized Mall Store tenants the occupancy costs under their leases as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the last three years.
(1) Excludes Malls not open for full reporting period. (2) Consistent with industry practice, sales are based on reports by retailers (excluding theaters) leasing Mall Store GLA and occupying space for the reporting period.

(3) Represents real estate tax and common area maintenance charges.
At December 31, 1996 the Company had investments in three malls in joint ventures with third parties, all of which are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's investment in Brownwood Associates (Heartland Mall in Brownwood, Texas) was transferred to the lender in April, 1995. The effect of this transfer on the financial statements was not material. Condensed combined results of operations for the unconsolidated affiliates are presented in the following table.
ASSOCIATED CENTERS
The eight Associated Centers are each part of a Mall complex and generally have one or two Anchor tenants and various smaller tenants. Anchor tenants in these centers include such retailers as Service Merchandise, Target, Toys "R" Us, and TJ Maxx, which are category dominant retailers that benefit from the regional draw of the Malls. The Associated Centers also increase the draw to the total Mall complex.
Total leasable GLA of the eight Associated Centers is approximately 0.5 million square feet, including Anchors, or an average of approximately 62,000 square feet per center. As of December 31, 1996, 99.6% of total leasable GLA at the Associated Centers was occupied.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996, revenues from the Associated Centers represented approximately 3.9%, 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, average tenant sales per square foot at the Associated Centers were approximately $214, $215 and $207, respectively.
Average base rent per square foot at the Associated Centers increased from $8.37 at December 31, 1995 to $8.59 at December 31, 1996.

(6) Eckerd has closed its store but is continuing to meet its financial obligations under its lease. (7) Center was renovated during 1995.
COMMUNITY CENTERS
In addition to Mall development, the Company's development activities focus on Community Center projects. Community Centers pose fewer development risks than Malls because they have shorter development timetables and lower up-front costs. Community Centers also afford the Company the opportunity to meet the needs of retailers for whom a "convenience" type of location is more appropriate and the needs of customers whose trade areas cannot support a regional mall.
The Company's Community Center developments in the 1980's were generally anchored by supermarkets, and, in certain cases, by drug stores. Management's current focus has expanded to include the development of larger centers, anchored by mass merchandisers and department stores, while continuing the development of smaller centers anchored by supermarkets and drug stores. Recently completed Community Centers include centers in Adrian, Michigan; Cary, North Carolina; LaGrange, New York; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Chester, Virginia. Anchors at these new centers include, Lowe's Home Improvement, Hannaford Brothers, A&P, and HomePlace. The Community Centers in Adrian, Michigan and Chester, Virginia were sold by the Company in 1996. See "Summary Information Concerning Dispositions for the Year ended December 31, 1996".
Community Centers range in size from 25,000 square feet to in excess of 286,000 square feet. Anchors in Community Centers generally lease their store space and occupy 60-85% of a center's GLA. The number of stores in a Community Center ranges up to sixteen with an average of seven stores per center.
Total GLA of the 75 Community Centers is approximately 6.2 million square feet, or an average of approximately 84,000 square feet per center. As of December 31, 1996, 97.2% of total leasable GLA at the Community Centers was leased.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, revenues from the Community Centers represented approximately 21.0%, 21.2% and 21.4%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
Occupancy at the Community Centers increased from 96.8% at December 31, 1995 to 97.2% at December 31, 1996.
Average base rent per square foot at the Community Centers increased from $6.66 at December 31, 1995, to $6.94 at December 31, 1996.
As of December 31, 1996, Food Lion, a major regional supermarket operator with headquarters in North Carolina served as an anchor tenant in 37 of the Company's Community Centers and in one Associated Center. For the year ended December 31, 1996, Food Lion accounted for approximately 5.01% of the revenues generated by the Company's Properties.
With the exception of Suburban Plaza and Sutton Plaza, which were acquired by the Company in March, 1995 and January, 1997 respectively, each of the Community Centers was developed by the Company.

The Company also holds fee mortgages on six community centers, which mortgages had, as of December 31, 1996, an aggregate outstanding principal of $12.3 million. Such mortgages entitle the Company to receive substantially all of such properties' current cash flow in the form of periodic debt service payments. The encumbered properties all opened between 1981 and 1984 and have no Anchor vacancies.
In the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996, revenues from the Mortgages represented approximately 2.4%, 2.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, of total revenues from the Company's Properties.
