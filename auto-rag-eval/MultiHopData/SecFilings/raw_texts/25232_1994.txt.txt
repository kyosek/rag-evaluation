To date leases have been signed for approximately 5 additional acres, with the lease commencements for these 5 acres beginning in the second quarter of 1995. Leases on the 18 leased acres will generate FFO of approximately $700,000 per year. The remaining acres are currently being marketed to prospective tenants. LAND HELD FOR INVESTMENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
(1)Based upon management's estimates. (2)For the portion of the Wildwood Office Park land and Midtown Atlanta land owned by joint ventures, the cost shown is what the cost would be if the venture's land cost were adjusted downward to the Company's lower basis in the land it contributed to the venture.

The option may be exercised in whole or in part over the option period. Temco Associates has engaged in certain sales of land as to which it simultaneously exercised its purchase option. During 1993 and 1994, approximately 1,100 and 72 acres, respectively of the option related to the fee simple interest was exercised and simultaneously sold for gross profits of $305,000 and $243,000, respectively.
MAJOR PROPERTIES GENERAL This section describes the major operating properties in which the Company has an interest either directly or indirectly through joint venture arrangements. A "negative investment" in a joint venture results from distributions of capital to the Company, if any, exceeding the sum of (i) the Company's contributions of capital and (ii) reported earnings (losses) of the joint venture allocated to the Company. "Investment" in a joint venture means the book value of the Company's investment in the joint venture. WILDWOOD OFFICE PARK Wildwood Office Park is a 289 acre Class A commercial development in suburban Atlanta master planned by I.M. Pei, including 5 office buildings containing 1,922,000 rentable square feet. The property is zoned for office, institutional, and commercial use, with over 7 million additional gross square feet of office and commercial space planned for the park. Approximately 104 acres in the park are owned by, or committed to be contributed to, Wildwood Associates (see below), including approximately 52 acres of land held for future development. The Company owns 100% of the 151 acre balance of the land available for future development. Located in Atlanta's northwest commercial district, just north of the Interstate 285/Interstate 75 intersection, Wildwood features convenient access to all of Atlanta's major office, commercial and residential districts. The Wildwood complex overlooks the Chattahoochee River and borders 1,200 acres of national forest, thus providing an urban office facility in a forest setting. Wildwood Associates. Wildwood Associates is a joint venture between the Company and IBM formed in 1985. The Company and IBM each have a 50% interest in Wildwood Associates. At December 31, 1994, the Company's investment in Wildwood Associates and a related partnership (see "Summit Green") was approximately $3.3 million, which included the cost of the land the Company is committed to contribute to Wildwood Associates. In addition, the Company has severally guaranteed one-half of a $50,000,000 bank line of credit to Wildwood Associates related to the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building, under which $9.0 million was drawn at December 31, 1994. Wildwood Associates owns the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building (681,000 rentable square feet), the 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (634,000 rentable square feet) and the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (313,000 rentable square feet). At March 15, 1995, these three buildings were 95%, 94% and 89% leased, respectively. Wildwood Associates also owns 14 acres leased to two banking facilities and five restaurants (one under development); an additional one acre retail site currently being marketed to prospective users, and a child care facility. The 3200 Windy Hill Road Building was financed primarily with equity, and at December 31, 1994 had $9 million outstanding debt related to it. The 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building and the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building were financed primarily with debt and, at December 31, 1994, had $81.8 million and $31.1 million of outstanding debt related to them, respectively. Other Buildings in Wildwood Office Park. Wildwood Office Park also contains the 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building, a 106,000 rentable square foot office building located on approximately 10 acres which is wholly owned by the Company. Commencing January 1994, a single tenant, TSW International, Inc., leased the building for a term of ten years. The lease was initially for 60% of the building with options permitting the tenant to expand its occupancy to the remainder of the building over the next several years; the first such option for an additional 10% of the space was exercised in the fourth quarter of 1994. In addition, the 3100 Windy Hill Road Building, a 188,000 rentable square foot corporate training facility occupies a 13-acre parcel of land which is wholly owned by the Company. The training facility improvements were sold in 1983 to a limited partnership of private investors, at which time the Company received a leasehold mortgage note. The training facility land was simultaneously leased to the partnership for thirty years, along with certain equipment for varying periods. The training facility was 100% leased by the partnership to IBM through November 1993. In January 1993, the IBM lease was extended through November 30, 1998. Concurrently with the IBM extension, the mortgage note and related leases were also modified (see Note 3). NORTH POINT North Point is a mixed-use commercial development located in north central suburban Atlanta, Georgia off of Georgia Highway 400, a six lane state highway that runs from downtown Atlanta to the northern Atlanta suburbs. The Company owns either directly or indirectly, approximately 169 and 230 acres located on the east and west sides of Georgia Highway 400, respectively. Currently, only the land which is located east of Georgia Highway 400 is being developed. The Company previously sold 100 acres of its holdings located on the east side of Georgia Highway 400 in 1988 to a joint venture of Homart Development Co. and JMB/Federated Realty Associates, Ltd. This joint venture constructed North Point Mall, a 1.1 million square foot regional mall which opened in October 1993 and will be expanded to 1.3 million square feet with the addition of a sixth anchor store (Dillard's). The following describes the various components of North Point. North Point Market Associates, L.P. ("NPMA"). NPMA is a limited partnership between Cousins (82.3%) and an affiliate of Coca-Cola (17.7%). The venture was formed in September 1993 when the Georgia Highway 400 land owned through Spring/Haynes Associates (see Note 5) was distributed to its partners, with each partner concurrently recontributing certain acres of the land to NPMA. Additionally, Cousins contributed certain acres of its wholly owned Georgia Highway 400 land to the new venture. NPMA developed North Point Market-Phase I, a 313,000 square foot retail power center located adjacent to North Point Mall, which became operational for financial reporting purposes in May 1994. The center also includes six outparcels available for ground lease to freestanding users, of which four are currently leased. Construction commenced on North Point Market-Phase II (173,000 square feet, 57,000 square feet owned) in August 1994. In connection with the commencement of construction, NPMA sold 10.8 acres of land in Phase II to Dayton Hudson Corporation, which is developing a Target store on the site. This sale was treated as a tax-free exchange, and in February 1995 the proceeds were swapped into the purchase of land adjacent to the Company's other North Point properties. The Company plans to use this land for Mansell Crossing-Phase II, an approximately 100,000 square foot expansion of an existing retail power center previously developed by the Company for a third party. North Point Market-Phase I was financed partially with equity contributions from both partners, with the remainder financed by a note payable to Cousins which bears interest at the Prime rate plus 1%. The balance of this note payable is $17.7 million at December 31, 1994. The extent to which Cousins receives interest income from the note (which is eliminated in consolidation) creates a preferential return from the Partnership to Cousins. The improvements at North Point Market-Phase II are being financed 100% through this note payable to Cousins. The construction costs of Mansell Crossing-Phase II, however, will be financed 100% through equity contributions from Cousins, thus creating an additional preferential return to Cousins. Wholly Owned North Point Property. In December 1994, the Company commenced construction on North Point Center, a 125,000 square foot office building, located on half of a 14 acre site of the North Point land adjacent to North Point Mall. North Point Center is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1996 at a total cost of approximately $16 million. Approximately 30 acres of the North Point land are being ground leased in 1 to 2 acre sites to freestanding users. The carrying value of this land was transferred to Operating Properties in September 1993. Approximately 18 acres are leased as of March 15, 1995. The remaining approximately 300 developable acres at North Point are 100% owned by the Company. Approximately 70 acres of this land are located on the east side of Georgia Highway 400 and are zoned for mixed-use development including retail and office space. Approximately 230 acres of the land are located on the west side of Georgia Highway 400 and are zoned for office, institutional and light industrial use. OTHER OFFICE PROPERTIES NationsBank Plaza. NationsBank Plaza is a Class A, 55-story, 1.3 million rentable square foot office tower designed by Kevin Roche and is located on approximately 4 acres of land between the midtown and downtown districts of Atlanta, Georgia. The building, which was completed in 1992, was approximately 91% leased at March 15, 1995. An affiliate of NationsBank, the fourth largest bank in the United States, leases 46% of the rentable square feet. NationsBank Plaza was developed by CSC Associates, L.P. ("CSC"), a joint venture formed by the Company and C&S Premises, Inc., an affiliate of NationsBank. The Company and C&S Premises, Inc. each have a 50% interest in CSC. In October 1993, the partnership fully repaid all of its debt with equity contributions of $86.7 million made by each partner. At December 31, 1994, the Company's investment in CSC was approximately $105,239,000. The Company has guaranteed one-half of a $5,000,000 bank line of credit under which there was no outstanding balance at December 31, 1994. CSC's net income or loss and cash distributions are allocated to the partners based on their percentage interests (50% each), subject to a preference to Cousins. The Cousins preference is $2.5 million (giving Cousins an additional $1.25 million over what it would otherwise receive), and accrues to Cousins, with interest at 9% to the extent unpaid, over the period February 1, 1992 through January 31, 1995. Following repayment of the partnership's debt in October 1993, Cousins began recognizing its accrued preference currently in income, which resulted in Cousins recognizing $874,000 and $451,000 in income over what it would have otherwise recognized in the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1994, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1994, Cousins received distributions of the preference and accrued interest of approximately $2.65 million. The remaining preference amount of $71,000 was distributed in January 1995. Amounts above the preference amount are allocated based on the partners' percentage interests. First Union Tower. First Union Tower is a Class A office building containing approximately 317,000 rentable square feet. The property is located on approximately one acre of land in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. First Union Tower opened in the first quarter of 1990 and at March 15, 1995 was approximately 86% leased. First Union Tower is owned by North Greene Associates Limited Partnership ("NGA"), which was formed in 1987 as a joint venture of Cousins and Weaver Downtown Limited Partnership. Cousins has an 85% ownership interest in NGA, and accounts for it as a consolidated entity. Cousins is recognizing 100% of the income or losses from NGA until cumulative retained earnings exceed zero or partnership distributions commence, at which time Cousins will recognize 85% of the income or losses, subject to the preference discussed below. Cousins has made a $36 million secured line of credit available to NGA which matures December 31, 1996. At December 31, 1994, the line had a balance of $29.8 million and an interest rate equal to the Federal funds rate plus 1%. Under terms of the line, partnership distributions are prohibited and 100% of the project's operating cash flows have been paid to Cousins. The extent to which Cousins receives interest income from the partnership effectively creates a preferential return to Cousins. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower is a 50- story, Class A office tower located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia that was completed in December 1990. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, which contains 1.2 million rentable square feet, was designed by John Burgee Architects, with Phillip Johnson as design consultant. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower was developed on approximately 2 acres of land, of which approximately 1.5 acres is owned and approximately one-half acre under the parking facility is leased for a 99-year term expiring in 2088 with a 99-year renewal option. One Ninety One Peachtree Tower was approximately 94% leased at March 15, 1995. C-H Associates, Ltd. ("C-H Associates"), a partnership formed in 1988 between CREC (49%), Hines Peachtree Associates Limited Partnership (49%) and Peachtree Palace Hotel, Ltd. (2%), owns a 20% interest in the partnership that owns One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. C-H Associates' 20% ownership of One Ninety One Peachtree Tower results in an effective 9.8% ownership interest by CREC in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. The balance of the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project is owned by DIHC Peachtree Associates, an affiliate of DIHC. Through C-H Associates, CREC received 50% of the development fees from the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. In addition, CREC owns a 50% interest in two general partnerships which receive fees from leasing and managing the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. The One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was funded substantially by debt until March 1993, at which time DIHC Peachtree Associates contributed equity in the amount of $145,000,000. Subsequent to the equity contribution, C-H Associates is entitled to a priority distribution of $250,000 per year (of which the Company is entitled to receive $112,500) for seven years beginning in 1993. The equity contributed by DIHC Peachtree Associates is entitled to a preferred return at a rate increasing over the first 14 years from 5.5% to 11.5% (payable after the Company's priority return); at December 31, 1994, the cumulative undistributed preferred return was $3,006,562. Thereafter, the partners will share in any distributions in accordance with their percentage interests. At December 31, 1994, the Company had a negative investment of $90,000 in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. Ten Peachtree Place. Ten Peachtree Place is a 20-story, 259,000 rentable square foot Class A office building located in midtown Atlanta, Georgia. Completed in 1991, this structure was designed by Michael Graves and is currently 100% leased to Coca-Cola. Approximately four acres of adjacent land, currently used for surface parking, are available for future development. Ten Peachtree Place is owned by Ten Peachtree Place Associates, a general partnership between the Company (50%) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola (50%). The partnership acquired the property in 1991 for a nominal cash invest ment, subject to a ten-year purchase money note. This 8% purchase money note had an outstanding balance of $21.7 million at December 31, 1994. If the purchase money note is paid in accordance with its terms, it will amortize to approximately $15.3 million ($59 per rentable square foot) over the ten-year term of the Coca-Cola lease, at which time Coca-Cola is entitled to receive the preferred return described below and the property may be sold, released, or returned to the lender under the purchase money note for $1.00 without penalty or any further liability to the Company for the indebtedness. At December 31, 1994, the Company had a negative investment in Ten Peachtree Place Associates of $75,000. The Company anticipates that Ten Peachtree Place Associates will generate approximately $400,000 per year of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization during the ten-year lease. The partnership agreement generally provides that each of the partners is entitled to receive 50% of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization (excluding any sale proceeds) for ten years, after which time the Company is entitled to 15% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds) and its partner is entitled to receive 85% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds), until the two partners have received a combined distribution of $15.3 million, after which time each partner is entitled to receive 50% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds). Summit Green. Summit Green, a 21-acre office park located in Greensboro, North Carolina, is owned by Wildwood Associates (the partnership with IBM) and a related partnership. The park contains a 135,000 rentable square foot mid-rise office building which was 100% leased at March 15, 1995. The Summit Green land is leased from an unrelated third party for a 99-year term expiring in 2084. Space exists for two additional office buildings, but the Company has no plans to commence additional development without prior leasing commitments. CC-JM II Associates. This joint venture was formed in 1994 between the Company and an affiliate of Carr Realty Corporation, each as 50% general partners, to develop and own a 224,000 square foot office building in suburban Washington, D.C. The building will be 100% leased for 15 years to Booz-Allen & Hamilton, an international consulting firm, as a part of its corporate headquarters campus, and is scheduled to be completed in 1996 at a total cost of approximately $32 million. Each partner contributed $2.7 million to the venture during 1994. OTHER RETAIL PROPERTIES Haywood Mall. Haywood Mall is an enclosed regional shopping center located 5 miles southeast of downtown Greenville, South Carolina, which was developed and opened in 1980. Haywood Mall Associates, a joint venture arrangement formed in 1979 by the Company and Bellwether Properties of South Carolina, L.P., an affiliate of Corporate Properties Investors, owns the mall which is currently being expanded from 956,000 gross leasable square feet ("GLA") (of which the venture's ownership is approximately 272,000 GLA) to 1,256,000 GLA (of which the venture's ownership will be approximately 329,000). The balance of the mall is owned by the mall's major department stores (four prior to the expansion and five afterwards). The portion of Haywood Mall owned by Haywood Mall Associates was developed on approximately 19 acres of land, of which approximately 16 acres is owned and approximately 3 acres (of parking area) is leased under a ground lease expiring in 2067. The portion of Haywood Mall owned by the joint venture was approximately 93% leased as of March 15, 1995 and has been at least 90% leased since 1986. The Company has a 50% interest in Haywood Mall Associates. The Company originally had only a nominal cash investment, but funded an aggregate of $2.8 million in 1988 through 1990 as its 50% share of capital improvements made to the mall, including a new food court area. Additionally, the Company contributed $16.1 million during 1994 to fund its share of the expansion and the prepayment of an existing 9.37% first mortgage in May 1994. The venture intends to continue funding the expansion with additional equity contributions of approximately $6 million from each partner. At December 31, 1994, the Company's investment was $15,985,000. Perimeter Expo Associates, L.P. In June 1993, Perimeter Expo Associates, L.P.

The Company intends to convert its land holdings to income- producing usage or to sell portions of land holdings as opportunities present themselves over time. Spring/Haynes Associates. This general partnership was formed in 1985 between the Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola, each as 50% general partners, to jointly own and develop real estate. The Company contributed 40 acres of undeveloped land at Georgia Highway 400 and Haynes Bridge Road in north central suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Coca-Cola contributed 11 acres of property in midtown Atlanta. In September 1993, the undeveloped land at Georgia Highway 400 was distributed to the partners who concurrently recontributed certain areas of the land into North Point Market Associates, L.P., a consolidated partnership formed between the partners (see above). The Company's remaining investment in Spring/Haynes Associates is $1,603,000 at December 31, 1994. Temco Associates. Temco Associates was formed in March 1991 as a partnership between CREC (50%) and a subsidiary of Temple-Inland Inc. (50%). Temco Associates has an option through March 2006, with no carrying costs, to acquire approximately 35,000 acres in Paulding County, Georgia (northwest of Atlanta, Georgia), of which approximately 13,000 acres would be a fee simple interest and approximately 22,000 acres would be a timber rights interest only. The option may be exercised in whole or in part over the option period and the option price of this fee simple land was $655 per acre at December 31, 1994, escalating at 6% per year during the term of the option. The Temco Associates property has the potential for future residential, industrial and commercial development. Temco Associates has to date sold parcels of land as to which it simultaneously exercised its purchase option. During 1993 and 1994, approximately 1,100 and 72 acres, respectively of the option related to the fee simple interest was exercised and simultaneously sold for gross profits of $305,000 and $243,000, respectively. OTHER REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS Omni Norfolk Hotel. Norfolk Hotel Associates ("NHA") is a general partnership formed in 1978 between the Company and an affiliate of Odyssey Partners, L.P. (an investment partnership), each as 50% partners, which held a mortgage note on and owned the land under the 442-room Omni International Hotel in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. In January 1992, NHA terminated the land lease and became the owner of the hotel and a long-term parking agreement with an adjacent building owner. In April 1993, the partnership sold the hotel, but retained its interest in the parking agreement. The Company's share of the gain on this transaction was approximately $.5 million and is included in Income From Joint Ventures in the 1993 Consolidated Statement of Income.
