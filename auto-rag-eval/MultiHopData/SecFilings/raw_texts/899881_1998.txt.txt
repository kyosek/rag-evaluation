Item 2. Properties
Product Classification
ProLogis' objective is to focus its acquisition and development activities primarily on generic distribution facilities with an average office finish level of less than 10%. Due to typically increased costs of retrofitting customer spaces, service center product will be acquired only on a very limited basis as part of portfolio acquisitions in which the majority of product being acquired is bulk distribution. The industrial real estate on which ProLogis focuses is typically used for storage, packaging, assembly, distribution and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products.
.Distribution. ProLogis' distribution space is adaptable for both distribution and light manufacturing or assembly uses. Based upon square footage, ProLogis' operating portfolio was 99% distribution and light manufacturing facilities as of December 31, 1998. The following characteristics generally define the distribution facilities which ProLogis owns and intends to acquire or develop in the future:
.Service Center. Under ProLogis' definition, service centers are multi- customer buildings that have a higher percentage of office space than distribution facilities and only have grade-level loading as opposed to truck dock loading. Service center product constituted approximately 1% of the square feet in ProLogis operating portfolio as of December 31, 1998.
Geographic Distribution
ProLogis has direct ownership of industrial distribution facilities in the United States, Mexico and Europe. In the United States and Mexico, ProLogis has organized its operations into geographic regions to more effectively manage its portfolio. These operating regions are: Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Central (including Mexico) and Pacific. Within these four regions, ProLogis' facilities are located in 21 states and the District of Columbia and 40 cities (including four cities in Mexico). In Europe, ProLogis' facilities are located in four countries and six cities. The table below demonstrates the geographic distribution of ProLogis' portfolio (operating facilities and facilities under development). The table excludes land held for future development which represents less than 5% of ProLogis' total investment, based on cost as of December 31, 1998 and 1997. The table does not include facilities that are owned by ProLogis' unconsolidated subsidiaries which are discussed under " -- Unconsolidated Subsidiaries". The concentration of ProLogis' facilities is expected to increase in the Dallas (to 7.5%), Los Angeles (to 10.3%) and Columbus (to 3.8%) markets after the merger with Meridian is completed.

Partnerships
To facilitate certain strategic acquisitions, ProLogis formed four partnerships. As of December 31, 1998, ProLogis owned directly or indirectly 68.7%, 97.8%, 86.9% and 97.7% of ProLogis Limited Partnership-I, ProLogis Limited Partnership-II, ProLogis Limited Partnership-III and ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV, respectively (collectively, the "Partnerships"). The facilities owned through ProLogis Limited Partnership-I cannot be sold, prior to the occurrence of certain events, without the consent of the limited partners thereto, other than in tax-deferred exchanges, which restriction could adversely affect ProLogis' ability to strategically reconfigure the portion of its investment assets represented by this Partnership. There are no restrictions on the sale of facilities held by ProLogis Limited Partnership- II, ProLogis Limited Partnership-III or ProLogis Limited
Partnership-IV. ProLogis views all assets acquired as long-term investments but will only agree to partnership resale restrictions where the assets acquired are of such strategic quality that ProLogis anticipates that there will be no change in investment strategy with respect to such assets through the duration of the restriction. ProLogis may acquire additional facilities through partnerships in the future.
The Partnerships have been organized as Delaware limited partnerships. Generally, pursuant to the Partnership agreements, ProLogis, as the sole controlling general partner in each of the Partnerships other than ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV, in which a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis is the sole controlling general partner, has full responsibility for the management and control of the Partnerships, and the limited partners have no authority to transact business for, or, except as described below, participate in the management decisions of, the Partnerships. However, any decision to amend certain provisions of the applicable partnership agreement, to dissolve a Partnership prior to the term set forth in the applicable partnership agreement or to enter into certain extraordinary transactions where the limited partners would not receive the same consideration as shareholders of ProLogis, would require the consent of all limited partners. Pursuant to the partnership agreements, ProLogis or its wholly owned subsidiary, as the case may be, may not voluntarily withdraw from the applicable Partnership or transfer or assign its interests in the Partnership without the consent of all of the limited partners thereto. The limited partners may freely transfer their Partnership units to affiliates, provided that such transfer does not cause a termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and does not cause ProLogis to cease to comply with requirements under the Code, for qualification as a REIT. Each of the Partnership agreements grants to limited partners the right to exchange their Partnership units for Common Shares, subject to certain conditions. The Partnerships are as follows:
. ProLogis Limited Partnership-I, which owned approximately $208.2 million of industrial distribution facilities located primarily in the San Francisco Bay area as of December 31, 1998, was formed in December 1993. ProLogis had a 68.7% controlling general partnership interest and there were 4,520,532 limited partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 1998.
. ProLogis Limited Partnership-II, which owned approximately $58.7 million of industrial distribution facilities located primarily in Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, El Paso and the San Francisco Bay area as of December 31, 1998, was formed in May 1994. ProLogis' initial 81.2% controlling general partnership interest has subsequently been increased to 97.8% (the ownership interest as of December 31, 1998) due to the conversion of limited partnership units into Common Shares. There were 90,213 limited partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 1998.
. ProLogis Limited Partnership-III, which owned approximately $55.3 million of industrial distribution facilities located primarily in Tampa, Florida as of December 31, 1998, was formed in October 1994. ProLogis had a 50.4% controlling general partnership interest at formation, which has subsequently been increased to 86.9% (the ownership interest as of December 31, 1998) as the result of additional contributions by ProLogis and the conversion of limited partnership units into Common Shares. There were 389,900 limited partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 1998.
. ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV, which owned approximately $86.0 million of industrial distribution facilities located primarily in Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas as of December 31, 1998, was formed in October 1994 through a cash contribution from a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis, ProLogis IV, Inc., and the contribution of industrial distribution facilities from the limited partner. ProLogis' initial 96.4% controlling general partnership interest has been increased to 97.7% (the ownership interest as of December 31, 1998) as the result of additional contributions by ProLogis. There were 68,612 limited partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 1998.
ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV and ProLogis IV, Inc. are legal entities separate and distinct from ProLogis, its affiliates and each other, and each has separate assets, liabilities, business functions and operations. The sole assets of ProLogis IV, Inc. are its general partner advances to and its interest in ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV. As of December 31, 1998, ProLogis Limited Partnership-IV had outstanding borrowings from ProLogis IV, Inc. of $1.4 million and ProLogis IV, Inc. had outstanding borrowings from ProLogis and its affiliates of $1.4 million.
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of each of the Partnerships are included in ProLogis' consolidated financial statements, and the interests of the limited partners are reflected as minority interest.
ProLogis Development Services
ProLogis Development Services Incorporated ("ProLogis Development Services") develops corporate distribution facilities to meet customer requirements, which are subsequently sold to the customer or third parties, or contracts on a fee basis to develop distribution facilities for third parties or customers. ProLogis owns 100% of the preferred stock of ProLogis Development Services and realizes substantially all economic benefits of its activities. Because ProLogis advances mortgage loans to ProLogis Development Services to fund its acquisition, development and construction activities, ProLogis Development Services is consolidated with ProLogis. Accordingly, these loans ($247.5 million as of December 31, 1998) are reflected as real estate investments in ProLogis' consolidated financial statements. ProLogis Development Services' real estate assets represented 6.1% of ProLogis' total assets (at cost) as of December 31, 1998. ProLogis Development Services is not a qualified REIT subsidiary of ProLogis. Accordingly, ProLogis Development Services pays federal and state income taxes at the applicable corporate rate.
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
In order to comply with the requirements of the Code to qualify as a REIT, ProLogis has invested in the nonvoting preferred stock of certain companies that have ownership interests in real estate companies that produce income that is not REIT "qualifying" income (i.e., rental income and mortgage interest income) under the Code. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, ProLogis can collectively invest in these companies in amounts up to 25% of the fair market value of ProLogis' total assets, with a maximum per company investment of 5% of the fair market value of ProLogis' total assets. These investments are accounted for under the equity method.
ProLogis Logistics
ProLogis owns 100% of the preferred stock of ProLogis Logistics Services Incorporated ("ProLogis Logistics"). ProLogis Logistics owns 100% of the membership interests of a refrigerated distribution company operating in the United States and Canada, CS Integrated LLC ("CSI"). Prior to June 12, 1998, ProLogis Logistics owned, at various points in time, between 60.0% and 77.1% of CSI.

As of December 31, 1998, ProLogis had a $111.7 million note receivable from Kingspark S.A. and a $34.4 million note receivable from ProLogis Kingspark.

Garonor Holdings
On December 29, 1998, ProLogis invested in 100% of the preferred stock of Garonor Holdings S.A. ("Garonor Holdings"), a Luxembourg company, that acquired on that date in excess of 99% of the voting stock of Garonor S.A. As of December 31, 1998, ProLogis had invested $5.6 million in the preferred stock of Garonor Holdings. Garonor S.A. owns and leases approximately 5.25 million square feet of industrial distribution facilities located in France. Garonor Holdings is in the process of acquiring the remaining voting stock of Garonor S.A.
The common stock of Garonor Holdings is owned by Security Capital. Security Capital can require ProLogis to purchase the Garonor Holdings common stock held by Security Capital beginning January 1, 2000. ProLogis recognizes substantially all of the economic benefits of Garonor Holdings and its subsidiaries.
Should Garonor Holdings acquire 100% of the voting stock of Garonor S.A., it is anticipated that the ownership of Garonor Holdings will be restructured such that ProLogis would become the sole owner and Garonor Holdings, as a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis, would be consolidated with the accounts of ProLogis.
As of December 31, 1998, ProLogis had a $129.4 million note receivable from Garonor Holdings. The note is unsecured, bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on demand. Interest payments on the note are due annually.
In connection with the acquisition of Garonor S.A., Garonor Holdings obtained two credit facilities from a French bank. One facility is in the amount of 200.0 million French francs ($35.6 million as of December 31, 1998) and is guaranteed by ProLogis. ProLogis has guaranteed an additional 10.0 million French francs ($1.8 million as of December 31, 1998), which approximates the annual interest to be charged on the facility. The second facility, in the amount of 870.0 million French francs (of which 770.0 million French francs was outstanding as of December 31, 1998), is secured by the real estate owned by Garonor S.A. ProLogis has guaranteed 50.0 million French francs of the amount outstanding as of December 31, 1998 ($8.9 million as of December 31, 1998). Garonor has the ability to borrow an additional 100.0 million French francs under this facility of which ProLogis will guarantee 50.0 million French francs. The total guaranty of 100.0 million French francs can be reduced as Garonor S.A. meets certain operating covenants.
