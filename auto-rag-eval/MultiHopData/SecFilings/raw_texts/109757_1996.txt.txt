Item 2. Properties
Corporate Headquarters
The Company leased approximately 3,100 square feet of office space for its corporate headquarters on the second floor of the building known as the General Building located at 6001 North 91st Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at a rental charge of $2,145 on a month-to-month basis. As of December 1, 1995, the Company increased the space it rents to 4,032 square feet with a monthly rental charge of $2,789. The lessor is General Lumber & Supply Co., Inc. ("General Lumber"), a Wisconsin Corporation. The Company's President, Edward L. Machulak owns 55% of the common stock of General Lumber. Edward L. Machulak disclaims any interest in the balance of General Lumber common stock which is owned by two of Mr. Machulak's brothers, his wife, and a trust for the benefit of his children. In addition, the Company shares proportionately any increase in real property taxes and any increase in general fire and extended coverage insurance on the property. In lieu of cash payment, the Lessor has agreed to apply the monthly rental payments owed to the open-ended, secured, on-demand promissory note(s) due to it.
Real Estate Holdings
A description of the Company's real estate holdings are set forth in "Item 1. Land Acquisition and Development." Real estate assets have served as a source of collateral for funds loaned to the Company and its wholly and partially-owned subsidiaries.
San Sebastian Gold Mine ("SSGM")
Tailings from the SSGM are being transported to the SCMP site to produce gold. SCMP is gradually increasing its tonnage process to its full capacity of 400 tons per day. It plans to mine virgin gold ore from its open pit and to extract the stope fill from underground to produce gold on its own site. The property consists of 1,470 acres. SSGM is located approximately 2 1/2 miles northwest of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union, Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
SSGM Current Status
The Joint Venture has commenced producing gold at the SCMP site. It processed approximately 100,000 tons of the 360,000 tons of tailings during the last fiscal year. Plans are to gradually increase its daily tonnage until it is up to the full capacity of the SCMP.
The Company, through its Joint Venture is conducting the following activities: It is in the development and pre-production mining stage which consists of completing its survey, mapping, site preparation, infrastructure, construction, planning, and in the performance of the auxiliary work needed to begin gold production at the SSGM site. The Joint Venture's geologists have determined that SSGM has minable gold ore reserves via an open pit of approximately 13.4 million tons of gold ore which should contain approximately 1.166 million ounces of gold. In addition, it has approximately 960,000 tons of dump material, and about one million tons of stope fill. Presently, the Company is seeking funding to purchase equipment, to purchase inventory, and to use for working capital for its on-site proposed open-pit, heap-leaching operation. In addition, the Company is actively engaged in the exploration and development of the peripheral area (including diamond drilling) surrounding the main body of gold ore in order to increase its gold ore reserves.
The Company's main objective and plan, through the Joint Venture, is to operate a moderate tonnage, low-grade, open-pit, heap-leaching operation to produce gold on its SSGM site. Dependent on the grade of ore and the tonnage processed, it anticipates producing more than 40,000 ounces of gold from its open-pit, heap-leaching operations during the first twelve full operating months and more thereafter.
SSGM Geology
The ore deposit consists of contact-fissure veins carrying gold-bearing pyrite. The veins occur at the contact between quartz-monzonite porphyry dike and surrounding eruptives which are basalt capped by trachyte. All the rocks are of recent age, probably late tertiary. The SSGM lies within a silicified and hydrothermally altered zone of acid to basic volcanoes roughly within a two-square kilometer area.
The occurrence is typical of the late stage deposition associated with instrusives in Island Arc plate tectonics dating millions of years (four to 65 million) ago. These are typically polymetallic precious metal-base deposits with high grade veining in large haloes of low grade resembling in part the Kuroko deposits in Japan. The dike is shaped like a flattened "s" and consists of a 2,800 foot long essentially vertical east-west segment, a northwest striking western section "dragged" sharply north for 800 feet and dipping 70 degrees northeast and a vertical south-east striking east.
Its geologists state that it is similar in size and physical characteristics to the large low-grade, open-pit Pueblo Viejo Mine located in the Dominican Republic.
SSGM Ore Reserves
As of March 31, 1996, the SSGM has approximately 13.4 million tons of virgin proven gold ore reserves, grading 0.087 ounces of gold per ton and containing about 1.2 million ounces of gold. Overall the stripping ratio is low, ranging from zero in the Coseguina Hill area which is highly mineralized and consists of a series of high angle vertical veins to a possible stripping ratio of 1:3 to 1:8. It is planned to use these reserves; they will be screened, crushed and, if required, they will be agglomerated and placed on a proposed leach pad on the SSGM site. In addition, there are approximately 250,000 tons of tailings with a grade of 0.08 ounces of gold per ton and about one million tons of stope fill with a grade of 0.34 ounces per ton. (For additional information, reference is made to "Item 1. Proposed Mining, Mill, Heap-Leaching and Exploration Operations.")
Since July, 1987 through March 31, 1996, the following exploration has been performed on the SSGM site: surface channel trenching, 33,386 meters (110,173 feet/20.9 miles); test pit hole excavations, 655 vertical meters (2,162 feet/.41 miles); underground workings and adit openings, 962 meters (3,175 feet/.60 miles). Also, 42,234 assay samples were completed at the Joint Venture's laboratory located near the SSGM site. The surface samples averaged 0.026 ounces of gold per ton over an area approximately 1,000 feet in width and approximately 5,000 feet in length.
SSGM Diamond Drilling Program
The Joint Venture has completed eight diamond drill holes at the SSGM site. Five were on the San Juan Hill which ranged in depth from 106 feet to 172 feet and the grade varied (dependent on the rock encountered) from 0.01 to 0.15 ounces of gold per ton. Three drill holes were drilled in the Coseguina area from 62 feet to 255 feet. The grade of gold varied from 0.01 to 0.54 ounces of gold per ton. In some areas former adits were encountered which prevented the drilling to go to a deeper depth. It presently is working two shifts and ten to 15 persons are employed.
SSGM Proposed Mining Open-Pit, Heap-Leaching Operations at the SSGM Site
The open-pit ore will be loaded into trucks by wheel loaders and hauled to the recovery plant area. The ore will then be placed into a vibrating screen hopper which will remove gold ore larger than 3/4 inches in size. Lime, cement and cyanide solution will be added if needed to this crushed ore. If needed, it will then be placed into an agglomerator to convert the fine material into small stable pellets saturated with cyanide solution. The material will be conveyed to the leach pad and stacked using conveyors.
The first step will be to load the first sections of the pad with the crushed ore. Belt conveyors will be used to transfer ore to a stacking conveyor to build a heap. After loading is completed, the ore cures and the top surface of the heap will be manually levelled. Leaching of the heap proceeds by distributing barren sodium cyanide leach solution to the heap with sprinklers or by drip irrigation.
The gold will be recovered via a carbon column system where the porous carbon recovers the solvent gold by adsorption. The carbon will be stripped and the solution will flow through an electrowinning cell where gold will be recovered from the strip solution by electroplating onto stainless steel wool cathodes.
Gold laden steel wool cathodes will be periodically removed from the electrowinning cells and transferred to the replating cell. In the replating cell the gold will be electrolytically stripped from the steel wool and plated onto stainless steel cathode sheets.
The gold will be recovered from the cathodes, mixed with fluxes, placed in a crucible, and heated in a furnace until melted. The gold will then be poured into molds to form dore bars.
SSGM Ownership of the Property
The San Sebastian Gold Mine real estate consisting of approximately 1,470 acres, is owned by Misanse, a Salvadoran Corporation. The Company owns 52% of Misanse common shares that are issued and outstanding.
History and Development-SSGM
The San Sebastian Gold Mine has a long history of gold production. Unquestionably, the SSGM deposit was the jewel of the El Salvador mining industry and one of the most prolific gold mines in Central America.
Prior to 1880, the SSGM was probably known to the natives of the area and Spaniards, and may have produced gold during colonial days; however, no records of production exist. Numerous artifacts in the Santa Rosa River below the present day SSGM provide mute evidence of primitive early day mining operations.
In 1883, an American company hired Mr. Charles Butters to conduct experimental metallurgical tests on ore from the SSGM in his laboratory in New York. He determined that amalgamation and gravity concentration could not be effectively employed, but that the gold was amenable to recovery by chlorination.
From 1885-1888, the first effective exploration work at the SSGM was done by the above-mentioned American company. Mr. Butters was contracted to build a 30-ton-per-day chlorination plant at the SSGM site. This small scale operation proved unsuccessful, and the SSGM ceased production.
In 1898, the property was purchased by General Lisandro Letona.
In 1904, Mr. Butters, believing that the SSGM was a valuable property which had been grossly mismanaged, acquired the property in association with Mr. David J. Pullinger of Johannesburg, South Africa, for $100,000. Within a year of acquisition, Mr. Butters had established ore reserves of 42,560 tons with an average content of 2.75 ounces per ton. Their operations mined approximately $1,000,000 worth of gold from ore bearing gold at two and three quarter ounces or more per ton.
From 1904 to 1908, three investigations were made at the SSGM site by Mr. Butters and his staff regarding the type of beneficiation process best suited to the SSGM ores. It was determined that roasting, followed by cyanidation, and the recovery of the gold by means of combined electrolytic and zinc precipitation, was the most effective method. In later years, roasting of the ores was discontinued.
(During the period 1890-1898, Mr. Butters had been active in the development of cyanidation of gold ores at the Rand Mine in South Africa, and recognized the process as a revolutionary metallurgical practice.)
Continuous operations at the SSGM by Butters Salvador Mines were performed from 1908 to 1917, at which time operations ceased due to exhaustion of what they believed to be all of the high grade (two ounces or more of gold per ton) ore body. Butters Salvador Mines was voluntarily liquidated in October, 1917.
Initially, mill capacity was 20 tons per day; it later increased to 40 tons, then to 100 tons, and finally, 120 tons per day. For a period of several years, mill heads averaged no less than two ounces of gold per ton. The SSGM was considered among the richest gold mines in the world. During the peak years of operation (1908-1917), more than 1,500 people were employed at the SSGM. During this interval of time, the SSGM is reported to have produced 950,000 ounces of gold.
From 1917 to 1921, small operations at the SSGM, under the direction of Mr. Butters, yielded approximately 150,000 ounces of gold.
In 1924, Mr. G. Swanquist, a former member of Mr. Butters' staff, obtained the rights to develop the SSGM, but did no work worthy of mention.
From 1933 to 1953, owing to the increase in the world price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35.00 per ounce, operations were renewed under the name of Butters Salvador Mines, Ltd. Initially, only the richest ore shoots were mined; later, level and shaft pillars were exploited. In 1933, the rate of milling was approximately 40 tons per day. Diminishing grade and labor problems forced closure in 1953. During the period 1933 to 1945, approximately 150,000 ounces of gold were produced, and from 1945 to 1953, 30,000 ounces of gold were produced.
In 1953, when Butters Salvador Mines, Ltd. ceased operations, members of the labor union acquired the property in lieu of a severance pay settlement. The members of the union organized Misanse, an El Salvador Corporation, and managed monthly shipments of approximately 70 tons of surface oxide ore and old fill to the nearby Mina Lola mill.
In 1964, a ten-ton-per-day flotation and cyanide plant operated intermittently on an unprofitable basis.
From 1967 to 1968, there were unprofitable small-scale high-grading operations on an intermittent basis by various local miners working under a contract system with Misanse.
The Company's investment in Sanseb dates back to 1969. Sanseb acquired its lease to mine gold from Misanse in 1968. During March of 1973, the Company acquired control of Sanseb, and since then, owns 2,002,037 (82 1/2%) of Sanseb's issued and outstanding common shares.
From 1969 to 1972, work advanced in reopening collapsed SSGM tunnels and workings, with limited mining-milling operations. A straight cyanidation plant was installed using zinc box (shavings) precipitation and operating on an intermittent basis with limited daily production.
From February of 1973 to 1978, reorganization of Sanseb under the control of the Company, with continuous and increased production from the SSGM, was commenced along with extensive plant modifications, including conversion to Merrill Crowe type (zinc dust) precipitation. The existing mill was upgraded to 100 tons per day when this plant was installed. The underground tunnels and workings were rehabilitated. While the SSGM produced significant revenue, heavy exploration and development costs strained the cash flow of the operation.
On February 6, 1978, Sanseb ordered operations at the SSGM suspended due to the unavailability of investment capital and the lack of continuity in management, both exacerbated by labor and primarily due to the political unrest, particularly in the Eastern Zone of El Salvador where the SSGM is located. On May 6, 1978, as a result of the decision to suspend operations, former employees of Sanseb claimed that Sanseb was obligated under El Salvador law for the payment of severance pay to its former employees. Sanseb's legal position was that it temporarily suspended operations due to the political instability and since it did not terminate all activities, it was not liable at that time for the severance pay. In January of 1979, a lower El Salvador Court awarded possession of the mining rights (not the real estate) to the former employees. It is believed that the Court had no right to award a concession as only the Government of El Salvador has this right and authority.
During 1979, when the embargo was in effect, Mr. Robert Villatoro contracted to operate the SSGM. From the reports provided by his employees, it is believed that he extracted more than 10,000 ounces of gold. Mr. Villatoro ceased operations during 1981 or 1982 when the guerrillas were extremely active in the eastern part of El Salvador which includes the SSGM area.
During this time a dramatic increase in the world market price of gold (a peak of over $800/oz. in 1980) as well as developments in the technology of gold extraction presented new opportunities for the Company and Sanseb at the SSGM.
In February, 1985, the Company made an on-site inspection of the mill and SSGM site, which disclosed that the buildings, offices, machine shop, laboratory, mill and equipment were completely destroyed. Also, the SSGM tunnels and workings consisting of approximately 37 miles were demolished and collapsed. The Company consulted with geologists and engineers to develop a new plan of extracting gold from the reserves developed in the Company's exploration and development program and to process gold via an open-pit, heap-leaching operation.
In June, 1985, the Company and Sanseb settled the claims of Sanseb's former employees by agreeing to compensate them for the severance pay with proceeds attained from future gold production. The El Salvador Court, on June 6, 1985, had decreed, in a non-appealable order, to the nullification of all previous acts of the previous Court's orders, and removed the embargo previously decreed. In addition, the El Salvador Court ordered the return of all of the assets, rights and everything else whatsoever previously owed to the Company, Misanse and Sanseb.
The Company had no significant activity at the SSGM site from February, 1978 through January 1987. The present status is that, since January, 1987, the Company, through the Joint Venture, has completed certain of the required mining pre-production preliminary stages in the minable proven gold ore reserve area, and it is active in attempting to obtain financing for the project. It is also engaged in the exploration and the expansion program to develop additional gold ore reserves in the area surrounding the minable gold ore reserves.
On July 27, 1987, El Salvador President Jose Napoleon Duarte, at an official ceremony in the City of Santa Rosa de Lima, personally presented the mining concession to Misanse, which simultaneously was assigned to Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc.
During October, 1989, the Joint Venture set up in the City of San Miguel, its own laboratory equipment and began performance of assays from its SSGM ore sample. It trained its personnel to use this modern laboratory which was equipped with modern technical equipment.
Since 1990 to present date, extensive channel trenching, adit openings and test pit excavations developed thousands of fire assay samples. They were assayed at the Joint Venture laboratory. This laboratory was relocated to a Company-owned site near the SSGM. Extensive dirt roads and a bridge were constructed. Electric lines to the laboratory were restored. A diamond drilling program has been initiated to determine if there are additional gold ore reserves on this site.
During this twelve-month period ended March 31, 1996, the Company has advanced funds, performed services, and allocated its general and administrative costs to the Joint Venture.
San Cristobal Mill and Plant ("SCMP") Recovery and Processing System
SCMP Location
SCMP is located near the City of El Divisadero, (off of the Pan American Highway), and is approximately 13 miles east of the City of San Miguel, the second largest City in the Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
SCMP Lease Agreement
On November 12, 1993, the Joint Venture entered into an agreement with Corporacion Salvadorena de Inversiones ("Corsain"), a governmental agency of El Salvador, to lease for a period of ten years, approximately 166 acres of land and buildings on which its gold processing mill, plant and related equipment are located, and which is approximately 15 miles east of the SSGM site. The annual lease payment is U.S. $11,500 (payable in El Salvador colones at the then current rate of exchange), payable annually in advance, and subject to an annual increase based on the annual United States' inflation rate. As agreed, a security deposit of U.S. $11,500 was paid on the same date which also will be increased annually to correspond with the annual U.S. inflation rate.
SCMP Mill and Plant Process Description
On February 23, 1993, at an auction held by an El Salvador Court, the Company, on behalf of the Joint Venture, was the successful bidder in acquiring SCMP, a precious metals' cyanide leaching mill and plant rated with a capacity of processing 200 tons of virgin ore per day consisting of the following unit operations: crushing, grinding, thickening, agitated leaching, counter current decantation of leach solution, recovery of precious metals by zinc precipitation (Merrill-Crowe), and direct smelting of precipitates to produce precious metals as dore and tailings' disposal.
Instead of utilizing the existing recovery system, the Joint Venture's engineers have designed a carbon-in-leach (CIL) process which is described in detail under Project Operating Plan.
The advantage of beginning the processing of gold ore with the tailings is that the tailings do not have to be mined, ground or pulverized. The cost of processing this material is substantially low, and it is expected to recover 70% of the gold from the SSGM tailings (70% from the Potosi tailings) during a twelve-hour cycling period.
The Joint Venture completed the retrofitting, rehabilitation, repairing and restoring of the SCMP's plant and presently is producing gold on a limited production basis by processing the tailings from its SSGM.
SCMP Gold Ore Sources
The Joint Venture has several sources of gold ore to process at the SCMP: the approximately 250,000 tons of SSGM tailings (the residue of the higher grade ore processed in the past) which have an average grade of at least 0.08 ounces of gold per ton; the 185,000 tons of Potosi tailings which have an average grade of 0.06 ounces of gold per ton; the SSGM open-pit virgin ore; the dump material; and the ore and stope fill from the underground workings.
The other sources of gold ore to be used at the SCMP operations are the higher grade gold ore (0.13 ounces or higher) which could be processed with a 92% recovery grade, but at a lower volume of 200 tons per day. The income from the higher recovery of gold ore will be substantially more than the greater cost involved in this process. There is a sufficient amount of dump material, stope fill and higher grade virgin gold ore that could be used via the SCMP crushing and grinding process to recover 92% or more of the gold which recovery is substantially more than the 60% recovery of gold through the heap-leaching process. The Joint Venture's geologists estimate that there are more than one million tons of higher grade ore from the stope fill (underground) to be processed via the SCMP. It is intended to expand the SCMP to a larger production capacity.
Current Status
The start-up, testing and adjustment stage of processing the remaining 250,000 tons of SSGM tailings via trucking this ore to the SCMP has commenced and the Joint Venture is in this preliminary stage of producing gold. The SCMP is designed to process 400 tons per day by utilizing 12-hour cycles that should recover approximately 70% of the gold from the tailings. The average grade is now about 0.08 ounces of gold per ton.
During this fiscal year the Joint Venture did process at the SCMP approximately 74,000 dry tons (approximately 100,000 wet tons) of tailings which yielded 5,993 ounces of dore and accounted for 3160.64 ounces of gold and 1488.86 ounces of silver. The gross receipts amounted to $1,238,612. The average selling price of gold was $391.00/oz. and silver was sold at $4.91/oz. The proceeds from the sale of gold and silver were used to reduce the amount of Company advances to the Joint Venture.
San Felipe-El Potosi Mine ("Potosi") and its extension the El Capulin Mine ("El Capulin")
Potosi Location
The Joint Venture has commenced an exploration program on the Potosi property which is located approximately 18 miles northwest of the City of San Miguel, the second largest city in the Republic of El Salvador, on a paved road 15 miles to the City of Chapalteque and then west three miles on a gravel road to the City of Potosi. The historical records indicate that the potential of developing a gold mine is above average.
Potosi Historical Information
Historical records evidence that exploration and production of gold took place in 1899 and that Potosi was worked intermittently from 1906 through 1952. The main production period in six levels was from 1938 through 1952 at a rate of 35 to 50 tons per day. Production data avouch that 30,000 ounces of gold were produced from 1945 through 1952 after which the mine became dormant. During this time a limited underground exploration program confirmed that the gold ore reserves were of commercial value. The gold assays from some of the former drill hole samples on the southern extension of the north-south portion of this property showed a grade of 0.10 to 0.35 ounces of gold per ton of ore.
Potosi Geology
The Potosi vein type occurrences are very strong, persistent, poor quartz-calcite fissure fillings from two to ten feet wide and up to 3,400 feet in length. On a regional scale, the veins are fairly straight-forward type structures but in detail they can be complicated. Dips in the north-south veins are steeper than in the lattice systems such as the 50 degrees to 90 degrees in the Potosi type. The proportion of gold-to-silver increases in north-south striking veins or in veins of any orientation whose dips more closely approach the vertical.
Two relatively narrow north-south veins, 450 feet apart, have been worked in the past by vertical and an inclined shaft for up to 2,100 feet along the strike and to depths of between 180 and 440 feet below surface on four to six levels. The veins are contained in coarse-grained augite andesites. The larger of the veins is up to ten feet in width, dipping 55 degrees to 75 degrees west. The second vein is weaker in structure and about three feet in width. Gold values seem to be indiscriminately associated with quartz and do not seem to diminish at depth. Assay plans and ore reserve sections completed in 1952 show 30 blocks with an average grade of 0.6563 ounces of gold per ton. Holes drilled from the projected extension of the north-south portion of one of the veins returned various five-foot sludge samples grading 0.10 to 0.35 ounces of gold per ton with a one foot of core length grading at 0.39 ounces of gold per ton. It appears that the deposition took place at higher temperatures than attributed to silver, thus the vertical zoning of gold deposition is deeper or has a larger vertical dimension than silver; therefore the possibility of considerable ore below levels is a realistic one. The age mineralization is past laramide with the host rock being rhyolite. The previous gold-silver ratio was 0.3:1.
Potosi Tailings' Reserve
Since October 25, 1993, Comseb has had a full-time crew, ranging from 25 to 30 employees, conducting an exploration program consisting of surveys, channel trenching, adit openings, test pit holes, excavation and drilling of the tailings to determine its gold content.
Twenty-four test pit hole excavations have been plotted and drilled on this four-acre site of tailings. The depth to the bottom of the tailings' pile varied from 7.00 to 10.2 meters (23 to 34 vertical feet) and a total of 137.6 meters (454 feet) of test pit hole excavations were completed. The 573 fire assay samples (tailings) indicated an average grade of gold per ounce to be 0.06 (0.06 times 185,000 tons should contain 11,100 ounces of gold times a 70% recovery should yield about 7,770 ounces of gold).
Potosi and El Capulin Exploration Undertakings
A total of 1,354 meters (4,467 feet) of channel trenching were achieved. A total of 548 meters (1,808 feet) of adits have been restored for entry into the old workings. A tabulation of the work completed by the Joint Venture is as follows:
1. Surface
a. Twenty surface channel trenches were completed and the 1,180 samples that were fire assayed reflected a grade of gold of 0.02 ounces per ton. Two surface veins were intercepted, reflecting a grade of gold of 0.05 ounces per ton.
2. Potosi Underground Workings
a. Guayabito Adit: No veins were discovered; the 399 samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.01 ounces per ton.
b. Guarumo Adit: The three samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.05 ounces per ton.
c. San Isidro Adit: The 243 samples that were fire assayed reflected a grade of gold of 0.02 ounces per ton and four samples that were fire assayed from an intercepted vein show a grade of gold of 0.04 ounces per ton.
d. Cacho de Oro: The 59 samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.07 ounces per ton. This vein appears to correspond with the Guarumo vein system.
e. Canon 821: The 34 samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.05 ounces per ton.
3. The El Capulin Mine
Surface: The 109 samples that were fire assayed reflected an average grade of gold of 0.09 ounces per ton. The 228 samples that were fire assayed from an area 1,000 to 1,300 feet away from the above-surface ore reflected a grade of gold of 0.03 ounces per ton
4. Tailings
The 573 samples that were fire assayed reflected a grade of gold of 0.06 ounces per ton.
Exploration on this property will continue with channel trenching, re-opening of former adits, and to include diamond core drilling, mapping and sampling of the known mineralized areas to determine if there is any other gold mineralization on this property. Diamond drilling may be utilized to outline the more promising shoots and to check for continuity at depth.
Potosi Exploration Concession
The exploration concession application was filed on September 6, 1993, with the Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons, a division of the El Salvador's Minister of Economy's office, by the owners of the real estate, the Cooperative San Felipe-El Potosi. The concession consists of approximately 6,100 acres.
While the concession application is pending, it precludes any others from performing exploration on this site. Upon assessing that the property has potential mining prospects, the Joint Venture has the right to apply for the mining concession.
Potosi Lease Agreement
The Joint Venture entered into a lease agreement with the San Felipe Potosi Cooperative ("Cooperative") of the City of Potosi, El Salvador on July 6, 1993, to lease the real estate for a period of 30 years and with an option to renew the lease for an additional 25 years, for the purpose of mining and extracting minerals and under the following basic terms and conditions:
1. The term of the lease will be for a period of 30 years plus an option to automatically extend the lease for an additional 25 years.
2. The lease payment will be 5% of the gross receipts derived from the production of precious metals from this site and will be payable monthly.
3. The Joint Venture will advance to the Cooperative the funds required to obtain the mining concession from the El Salvador Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons and all related costs will be reimbursed or will become a deduction from future rental payments.
4. The Joint Venture will, when it is in production, employ all of the 45 qualified members of the Cooperative, providing that there is a need for their particular skill or service.
5. The Joint Venture will furnish medicine and first aid medical assistance to all of its employees to the extent that such benefits are not provided by the El Salvador Social Security System.
6. An employee life insurance program is to be seriously considered by the Joint Venture when production commences, providing that the cost of such insurance is not excessive.
Modesto Mine
Modesto Mine Location
The Modesto Mine is located due north of the town of El Paisnal, approximately 19 miles north of the Capital City, San Salvador. The Joint Venture considers this property as a good gold mining prospect and since August, 1993, it has proceeded with an exploration program.
Modesto Mine Geology
From its geologist and from the records available to the Joint Venture, the following information was obtained:
Two persistent veins "Paderon" and "Chicharron" outcrop along the crests of two parallel hogback ridges 1,900 meters apart, and are composed of thick flat-lying andesite flows capped by discontinuous patches of rhyolite. These were examined in 1948-1950 by M. Buell along strike (45 degrees) for 2,240 meters and 2,760 meters respectively and down dip (60 degrees to 80 degrees southeast) a maximum of 25 meters. The Paderon vein was barren but the north-eastern 1,320 meters of the Chicharron returned the following values:
1. "D" winze, five meters deep, northeast end: 0.46 ounces of silver, 0.82 ounces of gold over 61 meters horizontally; 0.71 ounces of silver, 0.61 ounces of gold over 3.1 meters vertically from quartz of undetermined orientation in rhyolite; 0.30 ounces of silver, 1.20 ounces of gold from a 15-ton dump and a value of $14.653 per ton from a ten-ton dump. (The market price of gold was pegged at $35 an ounce.)
2. "S" winze, 420 meters southwest of "D" winze: no values.
3. "5" winze, 882 meters southwest of "D" winze: 1.85 ounces of silver, 0.65 ounces of gold over an average of 1.0 meter to a depth of 11 meters below outcrop. A 30-ton dump ran 2.28 ounces of silver and 0.82 ounces of gold.
4. "14" winze, 1,320 meters southwest of "D": 0.78 ounces of silver, 0.22 ounces of gold to 19 meters below outcrop. A 60-ton dump ran 0.15 ounces of silver, 1.14 ounces of gold; average of six dump samples was 0.68 ounces of silver, 0.31 ounces of gold. A surface sample representing a ten-meter width of vein structure gave 0.06 ounces of silver, 0.09 ounces of gold, including 1.5 meters of 0.40 ounces of silver and 0.50 ounces of gold on the footwall.
A 155 meter crosscut, driven to intersect the vein 62 meters vertically below surface and 80 meters northeast of "14" winze encountered only weak quartz mineralization. Of 20 samples taken in 45 meters of drift, one returned 10.25 ounces of silver and 0.35 ounces of gold over 1.20 meters and the remaining 19 averaged less than 0.40 ounces of silver and 0.05 ounces of gold.
On 30 meters of drifting up to seven meters below surface at "5" winze, 1,095.6 tons grading 1.66 ounces of silver and 0.505 ounces of gold were indicated.
The mineralization is the Potosi type, very finely banded, milky, aphanitic, sulfide-free quartz, with a gold-silver ratio similar to El Dorado's. No calcite was seen on the dumps. Wall rock alteration is not noticeable on surface, however fine grained silicification and pyritization of the andesite appears on the "5" winze dumps.
Modesto Mine Ore Reserves and Exploration Results
The exploration through March 31, 1996, has accomplished the following: Four bodies of gold ore have been blocked which contain approximately 18,800 ounces of gold in 80,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.235 ounces of gold per ton.
The Modesto Mine appears to be a very good gold prospect. Since October 1993 through August 1995, three veins were discovered which extend over a length of one and one-half miles and a width of about one mile. The width of this area has a series of perpendicular and oblique tiny veins well dispersed which is a desirable ore for an open-pit operation.
There are three vein systems:
(1) In the Chicharron Vein, 59 surface channel trenches were hand excavated in a one and one-half mile length and over 1,895 assay samples were taken. The vein width averages about 17 feet and the surface grade averaged 0.04 ounces of gold per ton. In the land that the Company has purchased, the average surface grade is 0.20 ounces of gold per ton, over a length of 1,250 feet. A preliminary ore reserve calculation of this small area using a depth of 100 feet reflects a potential of another 21,000 ounces of gold.
(2) The Intermidy Vein is located 1,170 feet south of the Chicharron Vein. Ten channel trenches were hand excavated for a distance of 1,065 feet. The vein widths ranged from four feet to seven feet. Over 265 fire assay samples reflected an average of 0.02 ounces of gold per ton. The gold in this area is well distributed.
(3) The Paredon Vein is located about one mile from the Chicaharron Vein. The eight trenches over a length of 1,881 feet and 68 assay samples reflected a grade of 0.02 ounces of gold per ton.
There are three underground workings:
(1) Adit No. 10 - the highest adit in 165 feet of workings is 4.29 feet in width. 310 assay samples showed an average of 0.03 ounces of gold per ton.
(2) Winze No. 5 is located 660 feet north of the Taladron Adit and is about 44 feet in depth. About 28 feet from the surface, the first crosscut was found and followed. The dump material assayed from 327 samples averaged 0.35 ounces of gold per ton.
(3) Taladron Adit (597 feet area) was cleared with an average width of about seven feet. A total of 60 assay samples were taken mainly from the basalt area. Some of the stope fill material proved a grade of gold ranging from 0.02 to 0.45 ounces of gold per ton. At a depth of 150 vertical feet, the Chicharron Vein was intercepted.
The Joint Venture employs from 22 to 28 employees to work at this mine exploration program.
Modesto Mine Present and Proposed Exploration Program
After completing the necessary surveying, mapping and planning, the Joint Venture proceeded to clean and trench the vein exposure. Since August, 1993, 2,104 metric feet of surface channel trenching (6,943 feet) and 345 meters (1,139 feet) of adit cleaning were completed. In addition, four inclines have been completed. A total of 3,400 fire assay samples were performed. The Joint Venture will continue the channel trenching and the reopening of the former adits as well as to formalize its own drilling program.
Modesto Mine Concession/Ownership
On or about September 2, 1993, the Joint Venture through one of its employees, filed an application with the El Salvador Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons to explore the 4,000 hectares (9,800 acres) of property known as the Modesto Mine. The application, together with the consent to explore this area from the property owners owning more than 25% of total area, has been acknowledged as being received by the Director of the El Salvador Agency. The Joint Venture had submitted its original plan to the El Salvador Director of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons on January 24, 1994, outlining its exploration program.
Hormiguero Mine ("Hormiguero")
Hormiguero Location
The Hormiguero is located approximately five miles southeast from SCMP off of the Pan American Highway in the Departments of San Miguel and Morazan, Comacaran Jurisdiction, in the Republic of El Salvador. The Joint Venture plans to survey, map, plat, plan and develop an exploration program.
Hormiguero Current Status
The Joint Venture continues to develop an exploration program on the 5,000 acre site. An application for exploration has been filed on September 6, 1993 with the Department of Energy, Mines and Hydrocarbons, a division of the El Salvador Minister of Economy's office.
The Hormiguero property continues to be in the stages of being mapped geologically and topographically on a referenced grid in order to provide a base to plan a drilling program with the objective to prove that a commercial body of ore may extend below the bottom of the former workings. This drilling activity would also determine if the faulted north end of the Gallardo vein continues. Further drilling would evidence the mineralization of four explored veins: La Gloria, Victoria, Tecolote and El Dorado.
Hormiguero Geology and Historical Information
The following information was obtained from a report entitled, "Mining in El Salvador-United Nations Development Programs 1968-1971,":
". . . From 1913 to 1918 the Comacaran Gold Mining Co. produced 607,062 ounces of silver and 72,142 ounces of gold from 208,096 tons. (Swanquist), and when this company liquidated in 1919 the El Salvador Silver Mining Co., formed by some of the Butters Co. personnel, continued operations on a small scale until 1921. In 1930 the mine was reopened by the original property owners, the Gonzalez family, and functioned periodically until 1948, producing during the last 3 years about 21,000 ounces of silver and 3700 ounces of gold. "Straight arithmetic averaging from the production figures gives an overall recovered grade of 0.351 oz. gold and 2.92 oz. silver for the period 1913-1918, or assuming a 10% mill less, a mill head of 0.386 oz. gold and 3.21 oz. silver. Mill records for 1917, the only surviving technical data, give a bullion production of 139,369.36 ounces of silver and 17,193.84 ounces of gold from 61,890 tons. A mill head calculated from this, again at 10% mill loss, was probably 0.30 ounces gold and 2.47 ounces silver."
"Although known locally . . . as `Hormiguero' the deposit is actually a composite of three separate sections, the Gallardo, Guadalupe and Hormiguero, all in coarse-grained andesite, grouped about and formerly connected by aerial tramway to a central mill situated immediately southwest of the Canton Hormiguero. The Gallardo and Guadalupe veins are strong, persistent structures striking 045 [degrees] and 020 [degrees] respectively and forming thin ridges 500 feet east and 1,750 feet west of the central mill. Both are composite and slightly braided structures composed of two main parallel branches 70 feet apart, and several interconnecting sub-branches, all dipping greater than 60 [degrees] west. Vein material is banded and crustiform quartz-calcite, secondary manganese oxides and probaly [sic] rhodochrosite, weakly mineralized with pyrite, spalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Strong proplylitization accompanied by considerable pyrite has attacked the andesites outward for about ten feet from the walls resulting in the formation of yellowish red, clayey oxidation products on surface.
"The Gallardo has been worked on six levels for 2050 feet along strike and 400 feet vertically. Access was through the Benjamin adit at the extreme southwest end and an inclined (61 [degrees]) shaft 350 feet from the northeast end. Two vertically plunging ore shoots 300 and 600 long and 500 feet apart were stoped to the 5th level where the larger bottomed, according to notations on a long section made by the El Salvador Silver Mining Co. in 1920. Limited stoping above the Benjamin adit suggests a third shoot in that area and a possible unexplored prolongation of the vein towards the southwest. An abrupt cut-off of the north (larger) ore shoot coincident with the north end of the mine may be due to lateral fault displacement; an undeveloped segment of the vein might therefore be anticipated further north.
"Horizontal development of the Guadalupe vein opened a 1600 foot strike length on both a hanging wall and footwall branch, but the dip, exposed on five levels to 350 feet has been examined in an unsystematic manner more suitable for exploration than exploitation. Little ore has in fact been taken from underground; most of the production appears to have come from open cuts. The only regular mining has been confined to a 400 foot lens on the footwall branch, 150 feet south of the main three-compartment production shaft, which was from surface 200 feet vertically to the third level, and from a small irregular shoot directly opposite it in the footwall branch. Outside of these, the underground layout leaves the general impression that the distribution of ore grade mineralization is highly erratic and randomly dispersed.
"1100 feet, and north of the Gallardo and Guadalupe mines, five steeply north (?) dipping, parallel, curving veins (Emilio, Oriente Emilio, Hormiguero, San Francisco and 4 de Julio) evenly spaced over a width of 200 feet, constitute the separate Hormiguero mine. They lie between the hypothetical northward prolongation of the Gallardo and Guadalupe structures and have been worked over an aggregate strike length of 1200 feet starting from a point 700 feet west of the Guadalupe projection first 500 feet east-west then through a 700 foot arc curving to the southwest into alignment width, and 900 feet north of the north end of the Gallardo vein. At least 7 levels were developed to a depth of over 400 feet from a vertical 2 compartment shaft. The amount of stoping is unknown; the available data show that irregular 100 to 200 foot long shoots were worked to depths of 300 and 400 feet on the east-west striking portions of the San Francisco and 4 Julio veins.
"Four other virtually unexplored veins known as La Gloria or Esperanza, Victoria or Tilden, Tecolote and El Dorado, occur 500 to 900 feet west of the Gallardo and Hormiguero mines. The Gloria and Tecolote strike east-west; the remaing [sic} two are roughly parallel to the Gallardo. In a letter dated 1919, a geologist named Mr. Swanquist states that initial exploration and very limited mining obtained `encouraging results' from the Tecolote and `fair ore' from the El Dorado.
"The same letter mentions two additional prospects, the Consuelo of unknown location but `700 feet from the plant and just being opened up' and the La Posa, on the Las Garzas river, north of Canton Hormiguero from which ore grading $10.92 per ton ($20.00 gold and $1.11? [.385] silver), with values mainly in silver, was mined over 4 to 5 foot widths, in a 35 foot winze."
In 1921, i.e. during El Salvador Silver Mine's final year of operation, the following ore reserves were blocked out:
Proven: (U.S. dollar values based on a $20.00 per ounce gold price and a $0.385 per ounce silver price.) Dollar Value Tons Grade Per Ton ------ ----- ------- (a) Guadalupe Hanging Wall Vein 11,208 0.353 $7.06 Guadalupe Footwall Vein 7,528 0.319 $6.37 (b) Hormiguero and Gallardo 10,000 0.400 $8.00 ------ Total 28,736
Probable:
(a) Guadalupe Hanging Wall Vein 21,900 0.295 $5.89 Guadalupe Footwall Vein 23,556 0.340 $6.80 ------ Total 45,456
(Proven and probable gold and silver ore reserves total 74,192 tons.)
Exploration should center on the undeveloped veins, on the possibility of extending the Hormiguero veins farther to the east and west, and on the unexplored ground between the north end of the Gallardo vein and the Hormiguero.
Hormiguero Ownership
The surface is owned by various individuals and families.
Montemayor Mine ("Montemayor")
Montemayor Location/Ownership
The Joint Venture has obtained permission from a number of property owners which permits the Joint Venture to enter their property for the purpose of exploring, exploiting and developing the property and then, if feasible, to mine and extract minerals from this property. The term of this permission is for an infinite period. Montemayor is located about 14 miles northeast of the SCMP, six miles northwest of the SSGM and about two miles east of the City of San Francisco Gotera in the Department of Morazan, Republic of El Salvador. Historical records evidence that the potential for the Montemayor to become an exploration and development gold-producing prospect is good.
Montemayor Geology and Historical Information
The following information was obtained from a report entitled, "Mining in El Salvador-United Nations Development Program 1968-1971":
"Montemayor-Lola Area
"The eastern and northeastern limits of the Three Corners area are defined by a scattering of three small mines and numerous prospects distributed along the course of the south-flowing Rio Montemayor in a system of parallel normal faults collectively known as the `Montemayor lineament'. Consistent with the origin proposed under `General Geology' these have been probably induced by subsidence along the northern margin of the central graben, resulting in a progressive tensional failure that has sliced the pyroclastic rocks of the area into a series of tabular blocks stepped successively upward to the northeast end culminating in the steep serrated ridges of the Copetillos escarpment. This has resulted in the creation of a 13,000 foot-wide regional `sheeted' zone composed of closely spaced, northwest striking, west dipping parallel faults, stretching for five miles northeast along the river and has imported to the river gorge an assymetric cross section whose higher, northeast slope is underlain by deeply dissected acid to basic tuffs and lower southwest slope by the low rolling andesitic, Three Corners terrain.
"Extensive veining in the fragmentals has produced a lengthy mineralized zone roughly coincident with the `sheating,' which includes the Montemayor deposit near the headwaters of the river and, arranged in en-echelon alignment downstream, the Tebanco, Lola, and Tepeyac occurrences and the minor Salamanca, Jimerito, Mina Grande, Copetilla and La Joya showings.
"The veins, which dip almost universally 50 degrees to 80 degrees southwest, are normal quartz-calcite, sulfide-poor fracture fillings, distinguished by their remarkable lateral persistence and unfortunate paucity of workable ore shoots. Sporadically distributed in lenses three to eight feet wide and up to 200 feet long and separated by longer stretches of barren ground, these have so far yielded enough tonnage to sustain mining operations only at the marginal Mina Lola. On the whole, however, the area is little explored.
"Montemayor
"The Montemayor property embraces a group of small mine openings and prospects aligned along a series of parallel southeast striking veins following the course of the Montemayor river for 16,000 feet, from its headwaters to the beginning of the pronounced `S' bend enclosing the old Tabanco mine. Some confusion over the names and locations of these various workings has always existed; for the purpose of this report, the following nomenclature, adapted from early maps of the district, will be employed. Proceeding upstreams [sic], the workings are:
"(a) Montemayor-comprises the Montemayor, Montanita and Santa Gertrudis sections, extending for 2700 feet upstream from the Caserio Montemayor.
"(b) Tempisque-4800 feet north of the Caserio Montemayor and 1200 feet up the east bank of the river.
"(c) Banadero-Carao-Carago-4500 to 8000 feet upstream from Tempisque.
"Mining was confined to Montemayor; appreciable underground exploration to Montemayor and Tempisque. No motor road reaches the properties; access is either by five kms. of the mule trail along the southwest bank of the river from the end of the Santa Rosa de Lima-Caserio El Tabanco road or cross-country about the same distance by mule trail from a north branch of the Gigante road. Trails also lead into the headwater area from the town of Sociedad.
"Historical information is sketchy. The area was almost certainly worked in conjunction with the Tabanco mine, first by the English company until about 1855, then the Cia. Francesa de Minas de El Salvador who operated it some time between 1856 and 1882 (Guzman). Until 1914 (?) no information is forthcoming; then the mine was comprehensively sampled by the Butters Co. and its successors between 1915 and 1921 and by the R.W. Habard Co. and Central American Mines around 1936. Apparently the only production from 1856 to 1936 was obtained by the English and French companies but the figures are unknown.
"Roberts and Irving report that the mine was again functioning at 60 tons per day in 1945 under Sr. Benjamin Gonzalez, yielded a value of $233,818 over a three year period. Grebe (1955) does not confirm this and the data may refer to the Hormiguero mine which Sr. Gonzalez had in production at that time. Finally in 1963 the principal showings were taken up by a local enterprise, Minas Montemayor, S.A. and received a little more attention up until 1967.
"The vein system is apparently controlled by a simple set of poorly exposed, northwest striking faults paralleling the river and outcropping occasionally in the river bed and rarely on the steep east slope of the river gorge. Dips are to the southwest between 50 degrees and 60 degrees. Vein mineralization is quartz-calcite with weak disseminated pyrite and a small quantity of chalcopyrite, spalerite and galena. The host rocks are a succession of coarse andesitic tuffs and agglomerates, fine acid tuffs and flows propylitized along the veins, and locally silicified towards the north end of the zone of mineralization.
"Formal mining was confined to three parallel veins spaced over a 500 foot interval up the east bank from the creek, at Montemayor. The footwall Montanita vein was opened for 200 and 250 feet respectively on two levels about 70 feet apart, served by a winze and two crosscuts, and stoped over 100(?) feet on the upper level and 200(?) feet on the lower. Two levels opened at 115 and 215 feet off a 2 compartment shaft traced the middle (Montemayor) vein for 640 feet and disclosed a 200 foot long ore shoot, centered on the shaft and partially stoped before 1917, that might have graded around 12 ounces silver and 0.29 ounces gold. On this same structure, 1250 feet north of the shaft in the separate Santa Gertrudis section, perhaps 9000 tons grading $31.00 at gold and silver $0.507 were extracted from a 90 by 220 foot area, averaging 7 feet wide, developed on four levels through a second vertical shaft.
"The hanging wall `sulfide' vein located 40 feet west of the Montemayor is apparently more heavily mineralized but contained no ore over 75 feet of drifting driven from the lower Montemayor level.
"On the Tempisque showing, two levels, 30 feet apart vertically and served by two adits, have revealed 520 feet of the Tempisque vein running 5.49 oz. silver and 0.14 oz gold over a 2.7 foot width, according to sampling by the R.W. Hebard Co. in 1936. Check sampling by the present owners in 1966 returned an indicated grade of 3.68 oz. silver and 0.115 oz. gold over four feet, on the lower level.
"Work on the Carago section has been purely exploratory; the only surviving records (map MM-8) show an average width of 2.3 feet of 9.95 ounces silver and 0.16 ounces gold in a 60 foot shaft and a 160 foot long drift, spaced 280 feet apart."
Montemayor Current Status
From July 19, 1995 to March 31, 1996, the following exploration was achieved: surface channel trenching was performed in an area of over 270 meters (891 feet); and ten channel trenches were performed in an area of over 97 meters (320 feet). From this trenching, 100 fire assay samples were shipped to the Joint Venture's laboratory.
A total of 48 samples of fire assays were completed. They varied from 0.01 to 0.14 ounces of gold per ton with an over-all average of 0.035. The Joint Venture has 11 underground adits and workings in the process of being cleaned. They are:
Polvorera Adit No. 1 56 meters (185 feet) Polvorera Adit No. 2 100 meters (330 feet) Lechuza Adit 60 meters (198 feet) Cablote Adit 7 meters (23 feet) Montanita Adit 75 meters (248 feet) Guascanal Adit 19 meters (63 feet) Sirena Adit 7 meters (23 feet) El Indio Adit 29 meters (96 feet) Tempisque Sub Level No. 2 9 meters (30 feet) El Indio Winze 10 meters (33 feet) Guaruma Winze 12 meters (40 feet)
Total 384 meters (1,269 feet)
A total of 309 samples of fire assays were taken. Only 48 samples of fire assays were completed. Between 20 to 30 employees are employed at this site.
Comseb Laboratories (Lab)
The Joint Venture has two laboratories: one located at the SCMP facilities and the other on real estate owned by the Company near the SSGM site. At the SSGM Lab, the Joint Venture employs five employees for each eight-hour shift and it recently has been working three shifts per day. A total of 51,165 samples of fire assays have been completed through March 31, 1996. Approximately six employees are working at the SCMP laboratory.
