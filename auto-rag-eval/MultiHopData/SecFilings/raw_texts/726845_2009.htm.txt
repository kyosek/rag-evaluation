At the El Chanate Project we are mining on two concessions, San Jose and Las Dos Virgens. We are utilizing four other concessions for processing mined ores. In the future, we plan to explore some or all of these concessions to determine whether or not further activity is warranted.
During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2008 and 2009, we completed 39 core and reverse circulation drill holes to delineate additional reservesat the El Chanate open pit mine. These holes totaled approximately 7,800 meters, and were targeted to fill in gaps in the ore body and test the outer limits of the currently known ore zones. Inclusive of this drilling, the total number of drill holes at the El Chanate mine is currently 367. This combination of reverse circulation and core drilling totals 54,320 meters. The knowledge obtained about the geology of the deposit during mining, combined with the assays from the samples from this exploration drilling, was used to expand the information in our mine database. We have used this data to re-estimate El Chanate’s mineral reserves. The new mineral reserves are based on an updated block model and an updated mine plan and production schedule developed by IMC (“2009 Report”). The updated pit design for the revised plan is based on a plant recovery of gold that varies by rock types, but is expected to average 64.2% over the mine life. A gold price of $750 per ounce (SEC three year average as of March 20, 2009) was used to estimate the reserves compared to a gold price of $550 per ounce used in the prior estimate. The stated proven and probable mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions.. A technical report supporting this estimate was finalized that complies with Canada’s National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. These reserves are equivalent to proven and probable reserves as defined by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Industry Guide 7.
According to the 2009 Report, our proven and probable reserves have increased to 43.1 million metric tonnes with a gold grade of 0.66 grams per tonne (47.6 million U.S. short tons at 0.019 ounces per ton) net of depletion of 5,662,000 tonnes (through the end of December 2008). The open pit stripping ratio is 1.24:1 (1.24 tonnes of waste to one tonne of ore). The following Summary is extracted from the 2009 Report. Please note that the reserves as stated are an estimate of what can be economically and legally recovered from the mine and, as such, incorporate losses for dilution and mining recovery. The 913,400 ounces of contained gold represents ounces of gold contained in ore in the ground, and therefore does not reflect losses in the recovery process. Total gold produced is estimated to be 586,000 ounces, or approximately 64.2% of the contained gold. Individual portions of the ore body may experience varying recovery rates ranging from about 73% to 48%. Oxidized and sandstone ore types may have recoveries of about 73%; fault zone ore type recoveries may be about 64%; siltstone ore types recoveries may be about 48% and latite intrusive ore type recoveries may be about 50%.

The reserve estimates are based on a gold cutoff grade of 0.20 grams per metric tonne.
The 2009 reserve modeling has been modified from previous methodology to closely reconcile with the production results through December 2008. The 2009 model uses indicator kriging to define mineralized zones followed by block grade estimation utilizing inverse distance estimation.
In the mineral resource block model developed, with blocks 6m (meters) x 6m x 6m high, Measured and Indicated resources (corresponding to Proven and Probable reserves respectively when within the pit design) were classified in accordance with the following scheme:
·
Blocks with 2 or more drill holes within a search radius of 80m x 70m x 15m and with a relative kriging standard deviation less than or equal to 0.45 were classified as Measured (corresponding to Proven);
·
Blocks with 1 hole within the search radius of 80m x 70m x 15m and with a relative kriging standard deviation of 0.60 or less, blocks with 2 holes and a kriging standard deviation of 0.70 or less, blocks with 3 holes and a kriging standard deviation of 0.80 or less, blocks with 4 holes and a relative kriging standard deviation of 0.90 or less and all blocks with 5 or more holes within the search radius were classified as Indicated (corresponding to Probable), unless they met the above criterion for Proven;
·
Blocks with a grade estimate that did not meet the above criteria were classified as Inferred (and which was classed as waste material in the mining reserves estimate); and
·
Blocks outside the above search radii or outside suitable geological zones were not assigned a gold grade or a resource classification.
The mine plan used as the basis for the reserve is based on operating gold cutoff grades of 0.25 to 0.30 grams/tonne, depending on the operating year. The variation is due to balancing the mine and plant production capacities on a year by year basis for the plan. The internal (in-pit) and break even cutoff grade calculations are as follows:

The following table represents a summary of cumulative activity in connection with our proven and probable mineral reserves:
During 2009 and subsequent to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, we conducted exploration activities in the El Chanate pit area including, core drilling at depth to determine the potential of increasing its reserves further. The data obtained from geological mapping of the deposit’s mine pit areas, combined with assays from samples of the exploration drilling therein, were used to expand information in our mine database. SRK Consulting, Inc. U.S. (SRK) of Lakewood, Colorado, an independent consulting firm, used this data to re-estimate El Chanate’s Mineral Reserves. The table below shows the updated Proven and Probable reserves at El Chanate as of October 2009:
The new mineral reserves are based on an updated resource block model and an updated mine plan and mine production schedule both developed by SRK. The updated pit design for the revised plan is based on a plant recovery of gold that varies by rock type, but has a weighted average recovery of 58.25%. A gold price of US$800 per ounce (SEC three year average as of September 2009) was used to estimate the reserves. The stated proven and probable mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definitions. A technical report supporting this estimate is being finalized that complies with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and will be filed on SEDAR shortly. These reserves are equivalent to proven and probable reserves as defined by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Industry Guide 7.
El Chanate is an open pit heap leach mining and processing operation. Ore is hauled by truck from the pits to the processing plant. The recovery of gold from certain gold ores is achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, ore is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a cyanide bearing solution, which dissolves gold and silver contained within the ore. The resulting “pregnant” solution is further processed in a plant where the gold is recovered. The mining and other mobile equipment is refurbished as is the smaller of the two ADR processing plants. All other equipment and infrastructure at the El Chanate mine are new. Management continuously analyzes production results and considers improvements and modernizations as deemed necessary.
Equipment and infrastructure include: A three stage crushing plant, a fleet of haul trucks, loaders and mining support equipment, a leach pad and solution holding ponds, two ADR processing plants, and a refinery. In addition, there are numerous ancillary support facilities including warehouses, maintenance shops, roadways, administrative offices, power and water supply systems, and a fully equipped assay and metallurgical laboratory.
During fiscal 2008 and 2009, we identified certain restrictions related to our ADR plant capacity which limited the amount of solution that can be processed. We addressed these issues by increasing the installed pumping capacity to increase solution flow to the leach pad. We also purchased and installed an additional set of carbon columns and a strip vessel to process an additional two tonnes of carbon per strip. The installation and commissioning of this newADR plant was completed at the end of October 2008. In May 2009, we completed the procurement and installation of an additional secondary crusher and tunnel conveyor that allowed us to increase production from 7,500 tonnes per day to 13,000 tonnes per day of crushed ore. In August 2009, we initiated the construction of an additional leach pad . Permitting and site clearing has been completed and the construction contractor has begun with the site preparation and other earthworks. Golder Engineering of Tucson, Arizona will oversee construction activities and quality control and quality assurance for the project. The construction schedule anticipates that stacking ore on the new pad will commence in January 2010. The total cost cost of the completed leach pad will be approximately $3,300. In October 2009, we committed to the purchase of an additional tertiary crusher and screen module for the El Chanate mine. The total cost for the module is approximately $1,000 with one-third due upon execution of the sales order, one-third due in 30 days and one-third upon shipment. Once this equipment is installed and functioning, we expect production to increase to approximately 70,000 ounces of gold per annum.
We commenced gold production at the El Chanate mine on July 31, 2007. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, we sold 48,418 and 39,102 ounces of gold, respectively. Management has been and anticipates that it will continue to fund expansion costs with its cash flow from operations.
Surface Property Ownership
Anglo Gold purchased surface property ownership, consisting of 466 hectares in Altar, Sonora, on January 27, 1998. The ownership was conveyed to our subsidiary, Oro de Altar S.A. de C.V., in 2002. MSR, one of our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries, has a lease on the property for the purpose of mining the Chanate gold deposit. The purchase transaction was recorded as public deed 19,591 granted by Mr. Jose Maria Morera Gonzalez, Notary Public 102 of the Federal District, registered at the Public Registry of Property of Caborca, Sonora, under number 36026, book one, volume 169 of the real estate registry section on May 7, 1998.
We purchased surface property ownership, consisting of 220 hectares in Altar, Sonora, in March 2009, adjacent to the El Chanate mine in order to accommodate future leach pad expansion requirements. The purchase transaction was recorded as public deed number 18,174, dated March 26, 2009, issued by Mr. José Antonio Dávila Payán, Notary Public number 3 in Caborca, Sonora.
General Information and Location
The El Chanate Project is located in the State of Sonora, Mexico, 37 kilometers northeast of the town of Caborca and nine kilometers from a paved road. It is accessible by an all weather dirt road. Driving time from Caborca is approximately 30 minutes. Access from Caborca to the village of 16 de September (“Ejido”) is over well maintained National highways. We acquired rights for service road access from the Ejido, and constructed this road.
The project is situated on the Sonora desert in a hot and windy climate, generally devoid of vegetation with the exception of cactus. The terrain is generally flat with immense, shallow basins, scattered rock outcropping and low rocky hills and ridges. The desert floor is covered by shallow, fine sediment, gravel and caliche. The delineated ore zone and current mine plan covers an area of approximately 5,576 feet long by 2,558 feet wide. There is evidence of potential additional mineralization within the El Chanate concessions that warrant further exporation.
In 2005, we acquired 15 year rights of way to access the El Chanate Project from the Ejido and local ranchers. We subsequently purchased an extension of our rights-of-way from 15 to 30 years. We acquired a water allocation and water well that draws from a large regional aquifer. The 2005 feasibility study indicated our average life of mine water requirements, at that time, for ore processing only, will be about 94.6 million gallons per year (11.4 liters per second). The amount of water we were permitted to pump from the well was approximately 71.3 million gallons per year (8.6 liters per second). During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2008 and 2009, on two occasions we acquired additional water right permits that allow us to pump up to 149.5 million gallons per year. Based on current water consumption, we have sufficient water to meet our current requirements.
In December 2005, MSR entered into a Mining Contract with Sinergia. The Mining Contract, as amended, became effective November 1, 2006 and work commenced on March 25, 2007 (the “Commencement Date”). Pursuant to an amendment to the Mining Contract, the mining rates set forth in that contract are subject to adjustment for the rate of inflation between September 23, 2005 and the Commencement Date. Pursuant to the Mining Contract, Sinergia, using its mining fleet, is obligated to perform all of the mining, blasting and mine maintenance work at the El Chanate Project for the life of the mine at a predetermined mining rate and fleet size. Sinergia’s mining rates are subject to escalation on an annual basis. This escalation is tied to the percentage escalation in Sinergia’s costs for equipment parts, interest rates and labor. One of the principals of Sinergia (“FG’s Successor”) is one of the former principals of Grupo Minero FG S.A. de C.V. (“FG”). FG was our former joint venture partner.
Historical workings suggest that the area has been mined for gold since the early 19th century. A number of old underground workings exist characterized by narrow shafts, to a depth of several tens of feet and connecting drifts and cross cuts. The current open pit mine has been developed below the existence of historical small scale mining.
Geology
The project area is underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous Bisbee Group, and the Late Cretaceous Chanate Group, which locally are overlain by andesites of the Cretaceous El Charro volcanic complex. The sedimentary strata are locally intruded by andesitic sills and dikes, a microporphyritic latite and by a diorite stock. The sedimentary strata are comprised of mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, shale and limestone. Within the drilled resource area, a predecessor exploration company differentiated two units on the basis of their position relative to the Chanate fault. The upper member is an undifferentiated sequence of sandstone, conglomerate and lesser mudstone that lies above the Chanate fault and it is assigned to the Escalante Formation of the Middle Cretaceous Chanate Group. The lower member is comprised of mudstone with mixed in sandstone lenses and thin limestone interbeds; it lies below the Chanate fault and is assigned to the Arroyo Sasabe Formation of the Lower Cretaceous Bisbee Group. The Arroyo Sasabe formation overlies the Morita Formation of the Bisbee Group. Both the Escalante and Arroyo Sasabe formations are significantly mineralized proximal to the Chanate fault, while the Morita Formation is barren.
The main structural feature of the project area is the Chanate fault, a 7 km long (minimum) northwest-striking, variably southwest-dipping structure that has been interpreted to be a thrust fault. The Chanate fault is overturned (north-dipping) at surface, and is marked by brittle deformation and shearing which has created a pronounced fracture foliation and fissility in the host rocks. In drill holes the fault is often marked the presence of an andesite dike. Reports prepared by a predecessor exploration company describe the fault as consisting of a series of thrust ramps and flats; however, geologic cross sections which we have reviewed but did not prepare may negate this interpretation.
Alteration/Mineralization
A predecessor exploration company defined a 600 meter long, 300 meter wide, 120 meter thick zone of alteration that is centered about the Chanate fault. The strata within this zone are silicified and pyritized to varying degrees. In surface outcrop the mineralized zone is distinguished by its bleached appearance relative to unmineralized rock. The mineralized zone contains only single digit ppm (parts per million) levels of gold. Dense swarms of veinlets form thick, mineralized lenses, within a larger area of sub-economic but anomalous gold concentrations. Drill hole data indicates the mineralized lenses are sub-horizontal to gently southwest-dipping and are generally parallel to the Chanate fault. The fault zone itself is generally weakly mineralized, while strata in the adjacent hanging and footwalls are well mineralized.
Our Acquisition and Ownership of the El Chanate Project
In June 2001, we purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Minera Chanate, S.A. de C.V. from AngloGold North America Inc. and AngloGold (Jerritt Canyon) Corp. Minera Chanate’s assets at the time of the closing of the purchase consisted of 106 exploitation and exploration concessions in the States of Sonora, Chihuahua and Guerrero, Mexico. By June 2002, after property reviews and to minimize tax payments, the 106 concessions had been reduced to 12 concessions. To cover certain non-critical gaps between concessions, four new concessions were acquired, and the number of concessions is now 16. These concessions are contiguous, totaling approximately 3,543 hectares (8,756 acres or 13.7 square miles). Although there are 16 concessions, we are only mining two of these concessions at the present time. We also own outright 466 hectares (1,151 acres or 1.8 square miles) of surface rights at El Chanate and no third party ownership or leases exist on this fee land or the El Chanate concessions. In the future, assuming adequate funding is available, we plan on conducting exploration activities on some of the other concessions.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with AngloGold, in December 2001, we made a $50 payment to AngloGold. AngloGold will be entitled to receive the remainder of the purchase price by way of an ongoing percentage of net smelter returns of between 2% and 4% plus a 10% net profits interest (until the total net profits interest payment received by AngloGold equals $1,000). AngloGold's right to a payment of a percentage of net smelter returns and the net profits interest will terminate when they aggregate $18,018. In accordance with the agreement, the foregoing payments are not to be construed as royalty payments. Should the Mexican government or other jurisdiction determine that such payments are royalties, we could be subjected to and would be responsible for any withholding taxes assessed on such payments. During the first part of calendar 2008, Royal Gold, Inc. acquired from Anglo Gold the right to receive both the net smelter returns of between 2% and 4% plus and the 10% net profits interest which terminates at such point as they aggregate $18,018. As of July 31, 2009, we have incurred approximately $3,082 with regard to the net smelter return. In addition, in March 2009, we paid the total $1,000 net profit interest to Royal Gold. As of July 31, 2009, we have approximately $13,936 remaining to be incurred on the net smelter return.
Under the terms of the agreement, we had granted AngloGold the right to designate one of its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries to receive a one-time option to purchase 51% of Minera Chanate (or such entity that owns the El Chanate concessions at the time of option exercise). That option was exercisable over a 180 day period commencing at such time as we notified AngloGold that we had made a good faith determination that we had gold-bearing ore deposits on any one of the identified groups of El Chanate concessions, when aggregated with any ore that we have mined, produced and sold from such concessions, in excess of 2,000,000 troy ounces of contained gold. The exercise price would equal twice our project costs on the properties during the period commencing on December 15, 2000 and ending on the date of such notice. In January 2008, we made a good faith determination and notified AngloGold that the drill indicated resources at the El Chanate gold mine exceeded two million ounces of contained gold. The term "drill indicated resources" is defined in the agreement. A drill indicated resource number does not rise to the level of, and should not be considered proven and probable reserves as those terms are defined under guidelines of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). On July 1, 2008, AngloGold notified us that it would not be exercising its option.
El Oso Project - Saric Properties - Sonora, Mexico
In April 2008, we leased 12 mining concessions totaling 1,790 hectares located northwest of Saric, Sonora. In addition, we own a claim for approximately 2,304 additional hectares adjacent to this property. The approximate 4,000 hectare area is accessible by paved roads and has cellular phone service from hilltops. These concessions and this claim are about 60 miles northeast of the El Chanate project. Mineralization is evident throughout the concession group and is hosted by shear zones and stockwork quartz veins in volcanic and intrusive rocks. We have completed exploration work consisting of geological mapping, systematic geochemical sampling of rock and soils, geophysical surveys, trenching and 32 reverse circulation drill holes totaling 2,560 meters. The results of this work has justified an expanded drill campaign which is currently underway and consists of 23 reverse circulation drill holes totaling 2,100 meters. All of these holes will be focused on the northern part of the concession group near the Sombreretillo Ranch. These holes will vary in depth from 100 to 150 meters. SRK of Lakewood, Colorado has made a site visit and will monitor the quality assurance and quality control during the drilling campaign. All of the drill hole samples have been and will be assayed by ALS Chemex. The ALS Chemex facility in Hermosillo does the sample preparation, and the assays are performed at the ALS Chemex’s Vancouver laboratory. ALS Chemex laboratories provide the highest level of quality and have ISO 9001:2000 certification at all locations.
The lease agreement, which allows us to explore the property, required an initial payment of $45 upon execution of the lease. In addition, we are required to make ten payments of $25 every four months initiating six months after execution of the lease agreement. The agreement also contains an option to acquire the mining concessions for a cash payment of $1,500 at the end of the term (December 2010). If we elect not to exercise this option, we would have the ability to mine the concessions by paying a 1% net smelter return to the owners of the leased concessions capped at $3,000. Prior payments made under this lease agreement would be deductible from the $3,000 cap.
We continue to investigate other exploration projects in northern Mexico and other locations.
Other Properties
We currently lease our headquarters located in New York, New York consisting of a suite of offices of approximately 3,800 square feet. We also lease a administrative office in Caborca, Sonora, Mexico located near our El Chanate mine.
