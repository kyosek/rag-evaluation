ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company maintains its principal executive office in an office building located on an outparcel at Shops at Skylake in North Miami Beach, Florida. The Company also maintains its principal management office in the Equity One Office Building, in Miami Beach, Florida.
At December 31, 1999, the Company's Existing Properties, consisting primarily of Supermarket Centers, contained an aggregate of 2.8 million square feet of GLA. All of the Company's Supermarket Centers and drugstore anchored centers were developed after 1982. Management believes that the location and quality of its Existing Properties have enabled the Company to develop and retain an attractive and diverse tenant base. As of December 31, 1999, the Existing Properties were 94.9% leased to 1,012 tenants.
The following table provides a brief description of each of the Company's Existing Properties:
REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
SHOPS AT SKYLAKE. In August 1997 the Company acquired an existing community shopping center located in North Miami Beach, Florida, for $11.8 million. The Company has demolished the former property and is developing a new Supermarket Center containing 280,000 square feet of GLA to be built in three phases. The 95,000 square foot phase one was completed in July 1999, and includes a 51,420 square foot Publix supermarket. The 53,000 square foot phase two, consisting of office and retail space, will open in the second quarter of 2000. Construction of phase three, comprising up to 132,000 square feet of retail space, is expected to commence by year-end 2000. Construction costs for phase one, including the Blockbuster and Radio Shack out parcel, totaled approximately $7.6 million; construction costs through December 31, 1999 for phase two totaled approximately $1.9 million with an estimated $2.2 million to complete; and phase three construction costs are projected to total approximately $7.8 million.
LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT. The Company owns 18.75 acres of vacant land adjacent to certain of the Existing Properties, substantially all of which the Company intends to develop as retail space. The Company has commenced construction of 15,000 square feet of retail space on a portion of 5.0 acres adjacent to Lake Mary Shopping Center, and 10,000 square feet of retail space on 1.0 acre adjacent to Point Royale Shopping Center at estimated construction costs of $1.2 million and $750,000, respectively. Both of these development projects should be completed in the second quarter 2000.
In January 1999, the Company acquired approximately 28 acres of undeveloped commercially zoned land in Tallahassee, Florida on which it is developing the Forest Village Shopping Center. The Company will complete the 72,480 square foot phase one, which includes a 37,866 square foot Publix supermarket on 13.0 acres of land in April 2000 at an estimated construction cost of approximately $6.1 million. Phase two is projected to be completed by June 2002 at an estimated construction cost of approximately $6.0 million.
OPTION PROPERTY
CORAL WAY. The Company has an Option, exercisable until May 2003, to acquire 10.0 acres of vacant land at Coral Way for $2.0 million. Coral Way is commercially zoned and has received county site plan approval for the development of up to a 100,000 square foot Supermarket Center. Coral Way is located in a newly rezoned high growth area of Southwest Miami-Dade County, Florida. The Company anticipates that it will exercise this Option and develop
this property as a Supermarket Center to be completed by March 2002, although there can be no assurance that it will do so. The acquisition and development costs of Coral Way are anticipated to be approximately $12.0 million.
LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT. The Company also has an Option, exercisable until May 2003, to purchase 6.20 acres of vacant residentially zoned land adjacent to Bird Ludlum Shopping Center, for a purchase price of $1.1 million.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, LEASING AND RELATED SERVICE BUSINESS
The Company's property management and substantially all of its leasing activities and operating and administrative functions (including leasing, construction, data processing, finance and accounting) are administered or coordinated by Company personnel. On-site functions such as maintenance, landscaping, sweeping, plumbing and electrical are subcontracted at each location, with the cost of these functions passed on to the tenants to the extent permitted by the underlying leases. Personnel from the Company's corporate headquarters conduct regular inspections of each property and maintain frequent contact with major tenants.
The Company maintains an active leasing and maintenance program that, combined with the quality and locations of the properties, has made the Existing Properties attractive to tenants. The Company intends to continue to hold the properties for long-term investment and, accordingly, places a strong emphasis on quality construction and an on-going program of regular maintenance. The Existing Properties have been designed to require minimal ongoing capital expenditures.
The Company's management information systems provide operating data necessary to make informed business decisions on a timely basis. These systems allow instant access to vacancies, lease data, tenants' sales history, cash flow budgets and forecasts to enable the Company to maximize cash flow from operations and closely monitor corporate expenses.
In addition to managing the Existing Properties, the Company provides management and leasing services to certain third party owned properties. Services are provided to third-party owners pursuant to contracts that are of varying lengths of time and which generally provide for management fees of up to 4.0% of monthly base rent property receipts. The management contracts are typically cancelable upon 30 days' notice or upon certain events, including the sale of the property. Leasing fees typically range from $2 to $3 per square foot. During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Company earned management fees of $247,782, $144,196 and $263,205, respectively, in connection with its management of third party owned properties. At present, the Company has no plans to expand these activities.
COMPETITION
There are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, including REITs such as Regency Realty Corporation and IRT Property Company, and other owners of real estate in the areas in which the Company's properties are located that compete with the Company in seeking land for development, properties for acquisition, financing and tenants. Many of such competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company. All of the Company's Existing Properties are located in developed areas that include other Supermarket Centers. The number of retail properties in a particular area could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to lease vacant space and maintain the rents charged at the Supermarket Centers or at any newly acquired property or properties.
REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE
REGULATIONS. Retail properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations. The Company believes that each of the Existing Properties maintains all required material operating permits and approvals.
INSURANCE. Under their leases, the Company's tenants are generally responsible for providing adequate insurance on the property they lease. The Company believes that its properties are covered by adequate fire, flood and property insurance provided by reputable companies. However, certain of the Company's properties are not covered by disaster insurance with respect to certain hazards (such as hurricanes) for which coverage is not available or available only at rates which, in the opinion of the Company, are not economically justifiable.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, Chapter 403 of the Florida Statutes, the Florida Dry Cleaning Contamination Clean-Up Act and the Miami-Dade County (Florida) Pollution Protection Ordinance, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. Many such laws, including CERCLA, typically impose such liability without regard for whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. The owner of a contaminated site also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such site. In connection with the (direct or indirect) ownership, operation, management and development of real properties, the Company is generally considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property.
Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances also govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos-containing materials ("ACMs") when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for release of ACMs and may permit third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of such properties for personal injury associated with ACMs. Some of the environmental site assessments conducted at the Existing Properties to date indicate that a number of the Existing Properties contain ACMs. The Company is not aware, however, of any ACMs at the properties that are friable or in otherwise poor condition.
The Company believes that the environmental studies conducted to date have not revealed any significant environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and funds from operations (the "FFO"); however, no assurance can be given that environmental studies obtained by the Company reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of land or a property owned or acquired by the Company did not create any material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist (or may not exist in the future). Tenants at the Company's properties include plant-on-premises dry cleaners, gasoline service stations and tire centers, photo development firms and other retailers which use hazardous substances in their businesses. Although leases with such tenants contain provisions intended to minimize environmental risks and to shift the financial risks to the tenants, there is no assurance that the Company will not incur liability in this regard.
A limited monitoring program with respect to groundwater testing has been implemented at Plaza Del Rey based on questions raised by environmental studies conducted at the time of purchase. Groundwater impacts have also been detected at Atlantic Village, which is located in an area where a former municipal landfill was operated. Buried refuse consistent with known landfill parameters has been identified by the Company's consultants on the Atlantic Village site. While these sites are not regarded by management as significant environmental risks, if a material environmental condition does in fact exist (or exists in the future) at these or other properties, it could have a significant adverse impact upon the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and FFO. No assurance can be given that the environmental studies that were performed at the properties would disclose all environmental liabilities thereon, that any prior owner thereof did not create a material environmental condition not known to the Company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of the properties.
As noted, tenants at the shopping centers include plant-on-premises dry cleaners. As a result of environmental site assessments conducted in the past few months, low levels of perchloroethylene have been detected in soils at the Company's Commonwealth, Fort Caroline and Eustis Square properties. The Company understands that the owners of these cleaners are applying to participate in the state-funded dry cleaner's program. In connection with the Company's acquisition of Skylake, a Phase two Environmental Site Assessment dated July 15, 1997 has revealed the existence of perchloroethylene at levels above regulatory limits caused by a dry cleaning business operated on the premises. The Company has learned that the site is included in the Florida Dry Cleaners State Program, and as a condition to the Company's purchase of the property, the seller agreed to pay all remediation costs, which environmental consultants have estimated to be approximately $250,000. The seller placed $500,000 into an escrow account at closing to pay for the remediation costs. Based on the remediation cost estimates, guarantees by the seller to pay for the clean-up and the establishment of the escrow account, the Company has concluded that the property does not pose a material environmental liability.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 1999, the Company had 38 full-time employees. The Company's employees are not represented by a collective bargaining group, and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
ITEM 3.
