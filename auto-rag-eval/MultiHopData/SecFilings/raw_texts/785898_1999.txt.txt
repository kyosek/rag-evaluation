Item 2. Properties.
Monterey Park Building (formerly American Color Building and GE Medical Systems Office Building)
On July 10, 1986, Registrant acquired the Monterey Park Building, located in Monterey Park, California, for approximately $4,182,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Monterey Park Building and its 90,000 square feet of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan (See Item 1. - "Business-Fleet Bank Loan"). The property was built in 1985 and contains 20,250 net rentable square feet, of which approximately 71% is office space and the remainder is warehouse space. The building contains an unusually high percentage of office space for a mixed use property, but Registrant prefers to avoid reconfiguring the space, both to avoid the construction cost and to obtain the higher rates for office space. As of March 24, 2000, the property is approximately 44.9% leased, with 9,085 square feet leased to the General Services Administration (as discussed below).
In March 1999, Registrant executed a lease with the General Services Administration (for the U.S. Census Bureau) for 9,085 square feet (approximately 75% of which is office space). The lease provides for a 17 month term commencing July 1, 1999 and ending November 30, 2000, at a gross rent of
$21.15 per square foot (approximately $192,167 in annual gross rent). Registrant expended approximately $79,900 in 1999 in tenant improvements in connection with this lease.
In July 1999, American Color Graphics, Inc. ("American Color") terminated its lease for 9,650 square feet in the building, upon payment of a lease cancellation fee of $140,000. This fee represented approximately 50% of American Color's lease obligations for the then remaining lease term of two years. American Color had paid a net rent of $9.00 per square foot, plus reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating expenses.
The sole tenant, the General Services Administration, will vacate the building upon expiration of the lease term at the end of November 2000. Registrant prefers to find a single tenant for the entire building and is marketing the space accordingly.
Market conditions in the Monterey Park area have improved in recent years. The vacancy rate for commercial properties in such area approximates 4.1% for office buildings and 12.8% for mixed (office and industrial) space. The Monterey Park Building is situated next to a 200,000 square foot Public Storage facility which, like the Monterey Park Building, consists of a front office with warehouse space in the rear. Such facility is currently approximately 91% occupied; rents approximate $6.36 per square foot. Gross rents approximate $21.00 per square foot for office space and $13.00 per square foot for mixed office/warehouse space in this area.
The Directory Building (formerly, the IBM Building)
On October 27, 1986, Registrant acquired the Directory Building, located in Las Colinas, Texas, for a purchase price of approximately $24,580,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Directory Building and its 6.67 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The Directory Building was built in 1982 and contains approximately 152,100 net rentable square feet (reduced from 154,300 square feet during IBM's tenancy).
The building is 100% leased to GTE pursuant to a lease dated as of April 20, 1994, as subsequently amended by amendments dated as of July 29, 1994 and as of February 22, 1995. The initial term of the lease expires on September 30, 2000, subject to a five-year renewal option at a rate equal to 95% of the then market rate. Registrant and GTE have engaged in negotiations concerning an extension of the lease for a three year term, but a definitive agreement has yet to be reached. There is no assurance that the GTE lease will be extended or the terms of any such extension.
The amended lease requires approximate monthly rent of $173,800 through September 30, 2000. GTE must also pay additional rent equal to excess electric charges and operating expenses over base levels.
Registrant incurred approximately $63,350 in capital expenditures at the building during 1999, in connection with replacement of the fire alarm and panel. In connection with the GTE lease, Registrant has expended approximately $2,628,000 for tenant improvements, none of which was in 1999. In the event GTE's lease is extended, Registrant expects to incur capital expenditures, maintenance expenses and leasing commissions aggregating approximately $850,000 in 2000. Improvements would include ADA renovations to the common areas and certain bathrooms, fire alarm and panel replacement, bathroom lighting and other upgrades, and sidewalk and gutter repairs.
The Las Colinas office market includes approximately 20,018,000 leasable square feet (approximately 10,988,000 square feet of Class "A" office space), of which approximately 84.1% (83.1%
for Class "A" office space) was leased as of December 31, 1999. Weighted average rental rates for new leases at such properties range from approximately $24.65 to $25.53 per square foot.
Tumi Building (formerly Austin Place Building)
On December 30, 1986, Registrant acquired the Tumi Building, a two-wing office building located in South Plainfield, New Jersey, for a purchase price of approximately $16,473,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Tumi Building and its underlying five acres of land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property was built in 1986 and contains approximately 106,600 net rentable square feet for use as a multi-tenant facility (reduced from 108,000 square feet as a single tenant facility).
As of March 24, 2000, the property is approximately 60.0% leased, with 45,700 square feet leased to Tumi, Inc. (as discussed below) and the remainder at an average current rent of approximately $14.46 per square foot. Such other leases expire in October 2005 (approximately 10,000 square feet) and March 2014 (approximately 9,600 square feet).
On March 9, 1999, Gdynia America Line, Inc., a tenant occupying approximately 21,650 square feet (20.3%) in the Tumi Building filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Polish Ocean Lines, a Polish corporation owned by the Polish Government, is jointly and severally obligated under this lease. On or about April 30, 1999, the lease, with a term expiring in May 2007 and annual rental payments of approximately $446,000, was rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding. During 1999, Registrant wrote off approximately $718,000 of deferred rent and other receivables attributable to this lease. Registrant has commenced an action in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey against Polish Ocean Lines, seeking $4 million in damages. Registrant has succeeded in serving Polish Ocean Lines in this action.
Tumi's lease is for 45,700 square feet and expires on January 19, 2009. It requires rent payments equal to $15.00 per square foot until January 2002, $16.00 per square foot from February 2002 to January 2006, and $17.00 per square foot from February 2006 to January 2009. The lease includes two 5-year renewal terms, the first at a base rent of $20.00 per square foot and the second at a then fair market rental. Tumi is also obligated to pay for its electric current consumption and its proportionate share (42.3%) of increases in operating expenses, taxes, and insurance over base year 1999 levels. In 1999, Tumi's lease was amended to increase Registrant's obligation for tenant improvements to $1,045,000 (from $350,000) in return for increasing rent payments to $15 per square foot (from $9.00) until January 2002 and to $16 per square foot (from $15) from February 2002 to January 2006.
South Plainfield is included in the Route 287 submarket (approximately 6,850,000 square feet of which 11% is vacant) of Middlesex County (approximately 16,400,000 square feet, of which 11.2% is vacant). Average rents for office space in such area approximate $21.00 per square foot. Registrant has expended approximately $3,000,000 for tenant improvements, of which approximately $1,163,100 was incurred in 1999. Registrant expended approximately $118,000 in tenant improvements in 1999 for tenants other than Tumi.
Flatiron Building (formerly, the Cadnetix Building)
On January 5, 1988, Registrant acquired the Flatiron Building, located in Flatiron Industrial Park, Boulder, Colorado, for approximately $9,003,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Flatiron Building and its 5 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The
property contains approximately 96,000 net rentable square feet for use as a multi-tenant facility (reduced from 102,000 square feet as a single tenant facility).
As of March 24, 2000, Registrant has rented 100% of the space in the building to various tenants pursuant to leases providing for an average current rent of approximately $15.98 per square foot (exclusive of expenses). Such leases expire in 2000 (approximately 31,822 square feet), in 2001 (approximately 20,421 square feet), in 2002 (approximately 16,237 square feet) and in 2003 (approximately 27,264 square feet).
The Flatiron Building is zoned IG (Industrial General), which permits office use by manufacturers and industrial users (including software developers), but does not permit general office use by service providers such as attorneys and accountants. Registrant does not believe that such classification adversely affects its ability to fully lease this building at market rates, and such classification does not affect any existing tenants.
Market conditions in the Boulder area remain favorable for owners of commercial buildings. The market for the Boulder area contains approximately 9.3 million square feet of commercial space of which approximately 9.1% is vacant. Average rents for office space in such area approximate $16.49 per square foot, exclusive of expenses. Registrant has expended approximately $717,600, of which approximately $262,200 was spent in 1999, for tenant improvements for the Flatiron Building.
Marathon Oil Building (formerly, the Tenneco Building)
On March 21, 1988, Registrant acquired the Marathon Oil Building (formerly the Tenneco Building), an office building located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for approximately $10,736,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Marathon Oil Building with its 6.1 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property contains 90,925 net rentable square feet on two floors, plus a 10,016 square foot basement.
Marathon and its former affiliate, Koch Midstream Services Company ("Koch"), lease approximately 65,000 square feet (including approximately 4,300 in the basement) and 22,300 square feet (including approximately 550 in the basement), respectively, in the building. Marathon's lease expires in 2001, subject to two five-year renewal options; Koch's lease also expires in 2001, but without any renewal option.
Annual rent under such leases is approximately $750,600 ($8.75 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space). Marathon and Koch must also pay additional rent equal to their proportionate share of any increases in operating costs of the building after 1996. Registrant has funded tenant improvements of approximately $350,000 for Marathon and Delhi, none of which was expended in 1999.
Registrant has leased approximately an additional 5,800 square feet in the building for a five-year term ending in December 2001 at an annual rent of approximately $65,000 ($11.00 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space). Registrant has funded tenant improvements of approximately $74,000 in connection with this lease, none of which was expended in 1999. The remaining space (approximately 3.2% of the office space, plus approximately 41% of the basement) is vacant and Registrant is seeking a tenant for such space; however, the space is difficult to rent and would require significant tenant improvements. As an alternative, Registrant may demolish and reconfigure this space to improve its marketability. Registrant expended approximately $53,800 on replacing and upgrading lighting fixtures in the building in 1999.
Market conditions in the northwest section of Oklahoma City have continued recent improvements from the declines experienced after Registrant acquired the building. Such market contains approximately 4.9 million square feet of commercial space of which approximately 11.0% is vacant. Average rents for commercial space range from $8.50 to $18.75 per square foot, with a weighted average rate of $14.21 per square foot. Although the vacancy rate increased slightly during 1999, rental rates continued the increases of recent years.
475 Fifth Avenue
On December 6, 1996, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as 475 Fifth Avenue, and situated in New York, New York, for approximately $27,440,000 including capitalized costs and related costs. The property contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 238,000 square feet and is located on the southeast corner of 41st Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City; the Subsidiary Partnership owns fee title to 475 Fifth Avenue, subject to the lien of the 475 Loan.
475 Fifth Avenue is a 23-story office building with approximately 20,000 square feet of retail space on the first floor and basement, 213,000 square feet of office space, and 5,100 square feet of basement storage space. As of March 24, 2000, approximately 94.4% of the rentable square footage in the building was leased (including approximately 96.2% of the office space, 83.7% of the retail space, and 60.0% of the basement space), at an average current rent (base rent plus electric charges and prior year adjustments) of approximately $32.58 per square foot (approximately $31.07 per square foot of office space and $56.02 per square foot of retail space). Following is a schedule of the expirations of such leases.
========================================================================== Approximate Avg. Current Expiration Year Square Feet % of Total Rent/Sq. Ft. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2000 13,430 5.7% $31.05 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2001 19,733 8.3% $36.53 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2002 7,191 3.0% $33.18 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 7,558 3.2% $31.67 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2004 19,783 8.3% $43.53 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005 34,410 14.5% $37.06 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006 22,630 9.5% $26.90 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2007 6,794 2.9% $27.16 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2008 47,399 20.0% $26.76 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2009 37,625 15.8% $32.27 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2010 7,513 3.2% $36.23 ==========================================================================
Registrant's leases generally provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of operating expense and real estate tax escalation factors. In 1997, Registrant
commenced a capital improvement program, designed to increase rental rates and the value of the building. In connection with obtaining the 475 Loan, a capital reserve schedule was prepared for 475 Fifth Avenue, detailing improvements aggregating approximately $1,840,000 over a 12-year period. These and other improvements that Registrant intends to make include the following: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, including upgrading objective service and closets (approximately $360,000), consolidating DC service and relocating additional AC service (approximately $90,000), purchasing electrical equipment (approximately $300,000), continue installation of hot water heating system (approximately $315,000), and installation of new riser and drain lines (approximately $350,000); structural repairs, including roofing, facade, and parapet repairs (approximately $415,000) and installation of new windows (approximately $140,000); elevator repairs and refurbishment, including replacement of controls (approximately $345,000); and improvements to comply with building codes and Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, including renovation of restrooms (approximately $240,000) and stair handrail and extensions (approximately $48,000). In 1999, Registrant funded capital improvements aggregating approximately $158,400 and tenant improvements aggregating approximately $1,200,300 at 475 Fifth Avenue. Certain capital improvements can only be made as tenancies expire. Capital improvements and tenant improvements have been, and are expected in the future to be, funded from working capital and loan drawdowns and from anticipated increases in rental income.
475 Fifth Avenue is situated in the Grand Central district of the New York City midtown market. Such district includes approximately 50,385,000 aggregate rentable square feet (vacancy rate of approximately 5.2%), of which approximately 44,485,000 are Class A buildings (5.2% vacancy rate) and 5,900,000 are Class B buildings (5.4% vacancy rate). Asking rents in this district average approximately $49.32 per square foot ($50.23 for Class A buildings and $42.45 for Class B buildings). The entire midtown market includes approximately 236,805,000 aggregate rentable square feet (187,345,000 in Class A buildings and 49,460,000 in Class B buildings), an approximate 3.6% vacancy rate (3.4% for Class A buildings and 4.5% for Class B buildings), and average asking rents of approximately $50.50 per square foot ($53.92 for Class A buildings and $37.55 for Class B buildings).
Alamo Towers
On March 17, 1997, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as the Alamo Towers, and situated in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $12,002,000, including capitalized closing and related costs. The Alamo Towers contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 196,000 square feet. Registrant owns fee title to the Alamo Towers, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan.
The Alamo Towers is an office building consisting of two stand-alone 8-story towers with approximately 186,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 square feet of basement space. As of March 24, 2000, approximately 75.8% of the rentable square footage of office space in the Alamo Towers was leased, at an average current rent (base rent plus escalation adjustments) of approximately $14.40 per square foot. Following is a schedule of expiration of such leases.
============================================================================= Approximate Avg. Current Expiration Year Square Feet % of Total Rent/Sq.Ft. - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2000 29,110 17.0% $14.99 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2001 46,202 26.9% $13.59 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2002 27,784 16.2% $14.22 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 6,838 4.0% $14.80 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2004 18,403 10.7% $15.61 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005 1,822 1.1% $15.00 =============================================================================
The Alamo Towers has yet to achieve sustainable increases in occupancy rates, primarily because of the absence of a covered parking garage. Registrant's planned significant capital improvements for this building were delayed in large part because of the capital improvements made at 475 Fifth Avenue. Registrant now intends to fully implement its program at Alamo Towers. In 1999, it completed renovation of the lobby in the East Tower at an approximate cost of $314,800. Renovation of the West Tower lobby is expected to cost approximately $400,000. Registrant also plans to relocate the building's mechanical plant, including replacement of all heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, and upgrade the electrical capacity and distribution, at an approximate cost of $2,250,000. Relocation of this plant will enable Registrant to construct a covered parking garage at an estimated cost of $6,000,000. Construction of the garage is tentatively scheduled for 2001 and is expected to take six to eight months to complete. Registrant also may separate the heating and air conditioning systems to better regulate temperature through the building (estimated to cost $40,000) and recaulk glass walls and windows (approximately $200,000). Registrant may install sprinklers on all floors of the towers, at an estimated cost of $250,000, but any such installation is unlikely to occur in the near future. Registrant intends to finance these capital improvements from the proceeds of loan drawdowns and/or from proceeds from any sales of properties. In 1999, Registrant expended approximately $55,500 in tenant improvements and $532,100 in capital improvements to the Alamo Towers.
The San Antonio office market includes approximately 21,190,000 aggregate rentable square feet, of which approximately 13.7% is currently vacant. Asking rents in this market now average $17.14 per square foot. The north-central San Antonio market includes approximately 7,578,000 aggregate rentable square feet, of which approximately 12.9% is vacant and for which asking rents average approximately $17.98 per square foot. Class B buildings, including the Alamo Towers, feature an approximate 11.1% vacancy rate and an average asking rental rate of $16.71 per square foot.
Item 3.
