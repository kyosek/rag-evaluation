ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
INTRODUCTION
The Registrant owns or operates subject to operating leases ten separate facilities, all of which were acquired from unaffiliated sellers. Two of the facilities (the improvements and a ground lease interest in Covina Villa and fee title to Montego Heights Lodge) were purchased in separate transactions, and eight facilities were acquired in one transaction from Retirement Inns of America, a subsidiary of Avon Products, Inc. The Registrant owns fee title to three of the former Avon facilities and operates the remaining five facilities pursuant to long-term operating leases. (See descriptions below).
The following materials describe each facility, its location, and highlight the terms of any lease or financing to which a facility is subject. For a comprehensive understanding of the Registrant's marketing efforts, the discussion concludes with a review of the competition faced by the Registrant in each of the five broad market areas in which its ten facilities operate. For all ten facilities the rental agreements with tenants are on a month to month basis.

COMPETITION/MARKETING DATA
According to its 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 10.6% of the California population is over 65 years of age, and projects an 8% annual increase in the population over 85 years of age. The Registrant considers this group over the age of 85 to constitute the assisted living population. Census projections for 1995 indicate a population of approximately 3,567,000 people in California over 65, and an assisted living population in California of at least 13% of those over 65 or approximately 463,700.
There are five distinct geographic market areas ("Market Areas") into which the Registrant's 10 facilities fall. A review of these Market Areas follows.
1. SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA
Two of the Registrant's facilities are located in Market Area 1: Retirement Inn of Daly City and Retirement Inn of Burlingame. These facilities are approximately 12 miles apart. The cities of Daly City, Pacifica and the southern portion of the City of San Francisco are the immediate market for the Daly City facility. Burlingame, Hillsborough and San Mateo and parts of Foster City, San Carlos and Millbrae are the immediate market for the Burlingame site. This combined primary market area, defined as an approximate 10 mile radius from each facility, contains approximately 1,750,000 people. The demographics in each market reveal a general population base, household income figures and percentage of senior citizens that meet the standards used by the General Partners in determining feasibility for other facilities which they have developed and now manage.
Assuming 10.6% of the population is over 65 and that a minimum of 13% of this group over age 65 constitutes the primary assisted living market, there are currently 24,100 potential residents in the target market areas. In Market Area 1 there are seven assisted living facilities now offering similar services and features. These seven have a combined total of 710 units potentially housing 1,000 residents. The Retirement Inn of Daly City and the Retirement Inn of Burlingame bring the total present capacity in Market Area 1 to 1,650 seniors that can be housed in this fashion, or about 7% saturation of the target market.
2. GREATER SAN JOSE
Three of the Registrant's facilities are located in Market Area 2: the Retirement Inn of Sunnyvale, the Retirement Inn of Campbell, and the Inn at Willow Glen. The cities of Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Los Altos, Mountain View, Cupertino and Santa Clara comprise the primary market area for the Sunnyvale facility. The Campbell and Willow Glen facilities, five miles from each other, add the cities of Los Gatos, Campbell and Saratoga to their target market, but are not contemplated to draw substantially from the communities of Mountain View, Palo Alto and Los Altos. Each facility's primary market area is defined as an approximate 10-mile radius from the site. Market Area 2 contains approximately 2,100,000 people and shows favorable demographics relating to the rental of units. The percentage of senior citizens, household income figures and the population base meet the standards used by the General Partners in determining feasibility for other facilities which they have developed and now manage.
Assuming 10.6% of the population is over 65, and that a minimum of 13% of this group over age 65 constitutes the primary assisted living, Market Area 2 contains approximately 28,900 potential residents. In Market Area 2 there are currently 14 facilities now offering services and features similar to the subject facilities. These facilities have a combined total of 2,400 units potentially housing approximately 3,600 residents, or about 12% saturation of the target market.
3. EAST BAY AREA
Three facilities are in Market Area 3: the Retirement Inn of Fremont, Montego Heights and Valley View Lodge of Rossmoor in Walnut Creek. The cities of Fremont, Hayward, Newark, Milpitas, Union City and San Lorenzo comprise the Fremont site's primary market. Both Valley View Lodge and Montego Heights locations are served most extensively by the cities of Walnut Creek, Berkeley, Piedmont, Orinda, Lafayette, Moraga, Alamo, Danville, Pleasant Hill, Concord and Rossmoor's Leisure World development which in itself houses approximately 8,500 seniors over the age of 65.
The immediate market area is defined as a 12-mile radius due to urban growth patterns, topography and accessibility by major thoroughfares. Market Area 3 contains approximately 870,000 people and demonstrates household income, percentage of senior citizens and general population base figures that meet the standards used by the General Partners in determining feasibility for other facilities which they have developed and manage.
Assuming 10.6 percent of the population is over 65, and that a minimum of 13% of this group over age 65 constitutes the primary assisted living market, Market Area 3 provides approximately 12,000 potential residents. Five facilities, two of which are within one mile of the Retirement Inn of Fremont, offer services and features similar to the Retirement Inn of Fremont with a combined total of 604 units potentially housing 725 residents. Adding the subject property results in a capacity of 805 seniors that may be accommodated in this fashion, or about 7% saturation of the market. The total number of units available in the Walnut Creek/Concord area, including Montego Heights Lodge and Valley View Lodge, is approximately 2,300, or about 19% market saturation.
4. FULLERTON - NORTH ORANGE COUNTY/SOUTHWEST L.A. COUNTY
One facility is in Market Area 4: The Retirement Inn of Fullerton.
The primary market is defined as a 10-mile radius from the facility. On this basis, Market Area 4 is comprised of the following cities: Anaheim, Brea, Buena Park, Cerritos, Cypress, Diamond Bar, Fullerton, Garden Grove, La Habra, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, La Palma, Norwalk, Orange, Placentia, Santa Ana, Stanton, Westminster, Whittier, and Yorba Linda. The total population of this primary market is 1,760,449, of which 136,264 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications; California. 1996) are age 65 and over. Drawing on information provided by the U. S. Census Bureau, 13% of the population over age 65 constitutes the primary assisted living market, equaling 17,714 seniors in Market Area 4.
In Market Area 4, there are currently 14 facilities offering services and features similar to the Retirement in of Fullerton. These facilities, including the Retirement Inn of Fullerton, have a combined total of 2,695 units, potentially housing approximately 3,234 seniors, or about 19% saturation of the target market. Data compiled from surveying residents and their families reveals that the market may be expanded by up to 33% due to units rented by residents coming from outside the primary area.
5. COVINA
One facility is in Market Area 5: Covina Villa
The primary market is defined as a 10-mile radius from the facility. On this basis, Market Area 5 is comprised of the following cities: Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, City of Industry, Claremont, Covina, Diamond Bar, Duarte, El Monte, Glendora, Irwindale, La Puente, La Verne, Monrovia, Pomona, San Dimas,Temple City, Walnut, and West Covina. The total population of this primary market is 972,181 of which 76,319 (taken from California Cities, Towns & Counties; Information Publications; California. 1996) are age 65 and over. Drawing on information provided by the U. S. Census Bureau, 13% of the population over the age of 65 constitutes the primary assisted living market, equaling 9,921 seniors in Market Area 5.
In Market Area 5, there are currently 5 facilities offering services and features similar to the Covina Villa. These facilities, including Covina Villa, have a combined total of 709 units, potentially housing approximately 886 seniors, or about 9% saturation of the target market. Data compiled from surveying residents and their families reveals that the market may be expanded by up to 33% due to units rented by residents coming from outside the primary area.
