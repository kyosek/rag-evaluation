Reserve Rule Changes
During 2009, the SEC issued its final rule on the modernization of oil and gas reporting (the "Reserve Ruling") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03 ("ASU 2010-03") "Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas," which aligns the estimation and disclosure requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932 with the Reserve Ruling. The Reserve Ruling and ASU 2010-03 became effective for annual reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The key provisions of the Reserve Ruling and ASU 2010-03 are as follows:
·
Expanding the definition of oil- and gas-producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid or gaseous state, from oil sands, coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction;
·
Amending the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require the use of an average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices during the 12-month period ending on the balance sheet date rather than the period-end commodity prices;
·
Adding to and amending other definitions used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, such as "reliable technology" and "reasonable certainty";
·
Broadening the types of technology that an issuer may use to establish reserves estimates and categories; and
·
Changing disclosure requirements and providing formats for tabular reserve disclosures.
Reserve Estimation Procedures and Audits
The information included in this Report about the Partnership's proved reserves as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 represents evaluations prepared by Pioneer's reservoir engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") audited all of the Partnership's proved reserves as of December 31, 2010 and 2009; and audited the Partnership's proved reserves as of December 31, 2008 before the Partnership completed the 2009 Acquisition. The Partnership has no oil and gas reserves from non-traditional sources.
Reserve estimation procedures. Pioneer has established internal controls over reserve estimation processes and procedures to support the accurate and timely preparation and disclosure of reserve estimations in accordance with SEC and GAAP requirements. These controls include oversight of the reserves estimation reporting processes by Pioneer's Worldwide Reserves Group ("WWR"), and annual external audits of all of the Partnership's proved reserves by NSAI.
The management of Pioneer's oil and gas assets is decentralized geographically by individual asset teams responsible for the oil and gas activities in each of Pioneer's operating areas. Pioneer's Permian asset team (the "Asset Team") is staffed with reservoir engineers and geoscientists who prepare reserve estimates for the Permian assets at the end of each calendar quarter using reservoir engineering information technology. There is shared oversight of the Asset Team's reservoir engineers by the Asset Team's managers and the Director of the WWR, each of whom is in turn subject to direct or indirect oversight by Pioneer's President and Chief Operating Officer ("COO") and management committee ("MC"). Pioneer's MC is comprised of its Chief Executive Officer, COO, Chief Financial Officer and other Executive Vice Presidents. The Asset Team's reserve estimates are reviewed by the Asset Team reservoir engineers before being submitted to the Director of the WWR and are summarized in reserve reconciliations that quantify reserve changes represented by revisions of previous estimates, purchases of minerals-in-place, extensions and discoveries, production and sales of minerals-in-place. All reserve estimates, material assumptions and inputs used in reserve estimates and significant changes in reserve estimates are reviewed for engineering and financial appropriateness and compliance with SEC and GAAP standards by the WWR. Annually, the MC reviews the consolidated reserves estimates and any differences with NSAI before the estimates are approved. The engineers and geoscientists who participate in the reserves estimation and disclosure process periodically attend training on the Reserve Ruling by external consultants and/or through internal Pioneer programs. Additionally, the WWR has prepared and maintains an internal document for the Asset Team to reference on reserve estimation and preparation to promote objectivity in the preparation of the Partnership's reserve estimates and SEC and GAAP compliance in the reserve estimation and reporting process.
NSAI follows the general principles set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserve information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE"). A reserve audit as defined by the SPE is not the same as a financial audit. The SPE's definition of a reserve audit includes the following concepts:
·
A reserve audit is an examination of reserve information that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such reserve information, in the aggregate, is reasonable and has been presented in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information as promulgated by the SPE.
·
The estimation of reserves is an imprecise science due to the many unknown geologic and reservoir factors that cannot be estimated through sampling techniques. Since reserves are only estimates, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness. Instead, reserve information is audited for the purpose of reviewing in sufficient detail the policies, procedures and methods used by a company in estimating its reserves so that the reserve auditors may express an opinion as to whether, in the aggregate, the reserve information furnished by a company is reasonable.
·
The methods and procedures used by a company, and the reserve information furnished by a company, must be reviewed in sufficient detail to permit the reserve auditor, in its professional judgment, to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the reserve information. The auditing procedures require the reserve auditor to prepare their own estimates of reserve information for the audited properties.
In conjunction with the audit of the Partnership's proved reserves and associated pre-tax present value discounted at ten percent, Pioneer provided to NSAI its external and internal engineering and geoscience technical data and analyses. Following NSAI's review of that data, it had the option of accepting Pioneer's interpretation, or making its own interpretation. No data was withheld from NSAI. NSAI accepted without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the historical information and data furnished by Pioneer with respect to ownership interest; oil and gas production; well test data; commodity prices; operating and development costs; and any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of its evaluation something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data.
In the course of its evaluations, NSAI prepared, for all of the audited properties, its own estimates of the Partnership's proved reserves and the pre-tax present value of such reserves discounted at ten percent. NSAI reviewed its audit differences with Pioneer, and, in a number of cases, held joint meetings with Pioneer to review additional reserves work performed by the technical teams and any updated performance data related to the reserve differences. Such data was incorporated, as appropriate, by both parties into the reserve estimates. NSAI's estimates, including any adjustments resulting from additional data, of those proved reserves and the pre-tax present value of such reserves discounted at ten percent did not differ from Pioneer's estimates by more than ten percent in the aggregate. However, when compared on a lease-by-lease basis, some of Pioneer's estimates were greater than those of NSAI and some were less than the estimates of NSAI. When such differences do not exceed ten percent in the aggregate and NSAI is satisfied that the proved reserves and pre-tax present value of such reserves discounted at ten percent are reasonable and that its audit objectives have been met, NSAI will issue an unqualified audit opinion. Remaining differences are not resolved due to the limited cost benefit of continuing such analyses by Pioneer and NSAI. At the conclusion of the audit process, it was NSAI's opinion, as set forth in its audit letter, which is included as an exhibit to this Report, that Pioneer's estimates of the Partnership's proved oil and gas reserves and associated pre-tax future net revenues discounted at ten percent are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering standards promulgated by the SPE.
Also, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors," "Critical Accounting Estimates" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations" and "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional discussions regarding proved reserves and their related cash flows.
Qualifications of reserves preparers and auditors. The WWR is staffed by petroleum engineers with extensive industry experience and is managed by Pioneer's Director of WWR. Pioneer's petroleum engineers meet the professional qualifications of reserves estimators and reserves auditors as defined by the "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information," approved by the board of directors of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 2001 and revised in 2007. The WWR Director's qualifications include 33 years of experience as a petroleum engineer, with 26 years focused on reserves reporting for independent oil and gas companies, including Pioneer. His educational background includes an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration in Finance. He is also a Chartered Financial Analyst ("CFA") and a member of the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE.
NSAI provides worldwide petroleum property analysis services for energy clients, financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No.. The technical person primarily responsible for auditing the Partnership's reserves estimates has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at NSAI since 1983 and has over 31 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, including 30 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of proved reserves. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering in 1978 and meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information" promulgated by the board of directors of the SPE.
Technologies used in reserves estimates. Pioneer uses reliable technologies to establish additions to reserve estimates on behalf of the Partnership, including seismic data and interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data. Reserve additions associated with reliable technologies were less than two percent of the Partnership's total proved reserves during the year ended December 31, 2010.
Proved reserves. The Partnership's proved reserves totaled 51,975 MBOE, 44,365 MBOE and 40,805 MBOE at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing $563.8 million, $262.3 million and $187.2 million, respectively, of Standardized Measure. Changes in the Partnership's proved reserve volumes during the year ended December 31, 2010 included production of 2,375 MBOE and positive revisions of previous estimates of 9,985 MBOE. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 4,388 MBOE of positive price revisions and 5,597 MBOE of positive performance-related revisions. The Partnership's proved reserves at December 31, 2010 were determined using an average of the NYMEX spot prices for sales of oil and gas on the first calendar day of each month during 2010. On this basis, the price of oil and gas for proved reserve reporting purposes at December 31, 2010 was $79.28 per barrel of oil and $4.37 per Mcf of gas, compared to comparable average NYMEX prices of $61.14 per barrel of oil and $3.87 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2009.
Tabular proved reserves disclosures. On a BOE basis, 77 percent of the Partnership's total proved reserves at December 31, 2010 were proved developed reserves. The following table provides information regarding the Partnership's proved reserves and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2010:
Proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2010, the Partnership had 127 proved undeveloped well locations (all of which are expected to be developed within the five year period ending December 31, 2015), representing a decrease of 43 proved undeveloped well locations (25 percent) since December 31, 2009. The Partnership's proved undeveloped reserves totaled 11,822 MBOE and 12,152 MBOE at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, 28 proved undeveloped well locations were drilled and completed as developed wells and an additional 18 proved undeveloped well locations were in various stages of drilling and completion at December 31, 2010. As a result, the Partnership converted 2,913 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2010. The Partnership's development costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $52.5 million and were comprised of $46.7 million of development drilling expenditures associated with new wells and a $5.8 million increase in asset retirement obligations. The Partnership's proved undeveloped well locations as of December 31, 2010 included 48 proved undeveloped well locations that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Prior to the 2009 Acquisition, all of the Partnership's proved undeveloped well locations were part of the Partnership Predecessor and, as such, they were part of Pioneer's inventory of undeveloped well locations in the Spraberry field. In November 2009, the Partnership commenced a two-rig drilling program to develop its proved undeveloped properties. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital commitments" for more information about the Partnership's two-rig drilling program. The following table represents the estimated timing and cash flows of developing the Partnership's proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):
______
(a)
Beginning in 2011 and thereafter, the production and cash flows represent the drilling results from the respective year plus the incremental effects of proved undeveloped drilling.
Description of Properties
Currently, the Partnership's oil and gas properties consist only of non-operated working interests in oil and gas properties in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area of West Texas, all of which are operated by Pioneer. The Partnership's interests include 1,116 producing wells, of which 1,021 wells are limited to only those rights that are necessary to produce hydrocarbons from that particular wellbore, and do not include the right to drill additional wells (other than replacement wells or downspaced wells, such as 20-acre infill wells) within the area covered by the mineral or leasehold interest to which that wellbore relates.
All of the Partnership's proved reserves at December 31, 2010 were located in the Spraberry field. According to latest information available from the Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry field is the second largest oil field in the United States. The field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from four formations, the upper and lower Spraberry, the Dean and the Wolfcamp, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 11,300 feet.
The Partnership added 28 new wells to production during 2010 and had 18 wells awaiting completion at December 31, 2010. The Partnership added one new well to production during 2009 and had seven wells awaiting completion at December 31, 2009. The performance to date of these drilled and completed wells has exceeded the expectations of the Partnership's management, in part due to the completion of these wells in the deeper Wolfcamp formation and organic rich shale/silt intervals.
Selected Oil and Gas Information
The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information for the Partnership's properties as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Because of normal production declines and drilling activities, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.
Production, price and cost data. The following tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to the Partnership's properties for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. These amounts represent the Partnership's historical results without making pro forma adjustments for any drilling activity that occurred during the respective years.
______
(a)
The Partnership discontinued hedge accounting effective February 1, 2009. Hedge results beginning February 1, 2009 represent the transfer to oil and gas revenues of net deferred hedge gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the de-designation date.
(b)
Historical lease operating expense associated with those properties acquired in August 2009 and the Partnership's properties that were acquired in conjunction with the initial public offering in May 2008 include the direct internal costs of Pioneer to operate the properties. The lease operating expense of the properties after they were acquired by the Partnership includes COPAS Fees. Assuming the COPAS Fees had been charged in the Partnership Predecessor's historical results, the Partnership's lease operating expense would have been higher on a BOE basis by approximately $0.15 and $1.03 for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Productive wells. The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and gas wells attributable to the Partnership's properties as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
PRODUCTIVE WELLS (a)
______
(a)
All of the Partnership's wells are operated by Pioneer. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells. The Partnership had no multiple completion wells as of December 31, 2010.
Leasehold acreage. The following table sets forth information about the Partnership's developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2010:
The following table sets forth the expiration dates of the leases on the Partnership's gross and net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2010:
______
(a)
The Partnership's undeveloped acreage represents proved undeveloped acreage held by productive wells except for 1,506 acres (1,485 net acres) that are subject to a continuous drilling commitment. The continuous drilling commitment obligates Pioneer and the Partnership to spud a well by April 22, 2011, and then spud another well thereafter within 120 days of completing the previous well. These acres will not expire if the continuous drilling commitment is fulfilled.
Drilling activities. The following table sets forth the number of gross and net productive and dry hole wells that were drilled by the Partnership during 2010, 2009 and 2008. This information should not be considered indicative of future performance.
DRILLING ACTIVITIES
______
(a)
As of December 31, 2010, drilling on 18 gross wells (18 net wells) was in progress. The Partnership had seven gross wells (seven net wells) upon which drilling was in progress as of December 31, 2009 and no wells upon which drilling was in progress as of December 31, 2008.
