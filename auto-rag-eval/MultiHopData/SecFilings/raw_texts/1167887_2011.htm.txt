Mineral Properties
Our wholly-owned subsidiary company, SCRN Properties Ltd., owns interests in four mineral properties located in the Rio Negro and Santa Cruz provinces of Argentina, and we own three contiguous mineral tenures located in south central British Columbia, Canada, known as the Clapperton Property. The Clapperton Property covers an aggregate of approximately 825 hectares of land located in south central British Columbia, Canada, approximately 25 kilometers northeast of the town of Merritt, British Columbia. These mineral tenures will expire on June 7, 2011 unless we maintain ownership by spending at least $3,301 in annual exploration expenses on these properties or paying an equivalent amount in lieu. We plan to conduct reconnaissance exploration and a property examination in order to assess the mineral potential of these claims on a going forward basis and we do not plan to let them expire on June 7, 2011.

To date, we have concentrated the bulk of our exploration efforts and expenditures on the Pinguino property, which is located in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina. During the next 12 months, we intend to continue to focus our efforts primarily on this property and two of our other properties that are also located in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina - the Contreras property and the Condor property.
There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, including the Pinguino property, or that we will be able to identify any mineral resource on any of these properties that can be developed profitably. Even if we do discover commercially exploitable levels of mineral resources on any of our properties, which is unlikely, there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into commercial production of these mineral resources.
The following is a brief description of each of our mineral properties:
Pinguino Property
Acquisition
We purchased the Pinguino property pursuant to a mineral property option agreement dated February 24, 2004 between our company and Christopher Dyakowski, who became our President, Secretary, Treasurer and a member of our board of directors immediately after the agreement was signed. The purchase price for the property was approximately $393,390 (CAD$450,000) and was paid in five installments as follows:
approximately $43,710 (CAD$50,000), paid on July 1, 2004;
approximately $65,565 (CAD$75,000), paid on September 9, 2005;
approximately $87,420 (CAD$100,000), paid on July 1, 2006;
approximately $87,420 (CAD$100,000), paid on June 26, 2007; and
approximately $109,275 (CAD$125,000) paid on June 5, 2008.
Now that we have finished paying for the Pinguino property, we own it subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty in favor of Mr. Dyakowski. We have the right to purchase one half of Mr. Dyakowski’s net smelter returns royalty from the Pinguino property for the sum of approximately $1,000,000 (CAD$1,000,000) and all of it for the sum of approximately $2,000,000 (CAD$2,000,000). Title to all of the claims comprising the Pinguino property is registered in the name of our subsidiary, SCRN Properties Ltd.
On December 17, 2010, we purchased the surface rights to a significant portion of our Pinguino mineral property located in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina for a purchase price of $815,000.
Location
The Pinguino property is located in southern Argentina in the north-central part of the Province of Santa Cruz, centered at longitude 68o 34’ West and latitude 48o 00’ South. The location is shown on the map below:

Description of Mineral Claims
When title to the Pinguino property was originally transferred to our company’s wholly-owned subsidiary SCRN Properties Ltd., the property consisted of one Cateo covering approximately 10,000 hectares. Included within this Cateo was one Manifestacion de Descubrimiento covering approximately 1,500 hectares and 30 Pertinencias covering an aggregate of approximately 180 hectares. Because a Cateo is subject to reduction in area (and expiration) after the passage of time, we have since applied for additional Manifestacions de Descubrimiento in order to preserve our interests at the Pinguino project. The Pinguino property now consists of four “Manifestacions de Descubrimiento” and 30 Pertinencias, extending 36 kilometers east-west and 19 kilometers north-south. These are described as follows:
- 17 -
Note
(1)
These Pertinencias are located entirely within the boundaries of, and are overlapped by, the Cormoran Manifestacion de Descubrimento.
Maintenance fees to be paid on a Manifestacion de Descubrimiento and a Pertinencia are known as “canons”. The canons are to be paid twice a year (first of which is due before or in the beginning of the first half of each year and the second of which is due before or in the beginning of the second half of each year). We are current in the payment of our canons and maintenance fees on our Pinguino property.
Before we can commence any mining work on these Manifestacions de Descubrimento (other than exploration work), we will be required to file with the mining authority an environmental impact report, a description of our proposed work program and a description of each claim by reference to latitude and longitude.
Prior Work
The only historical exploration at the Pinguino property was done by Minera Mincorp between 1994 and 1996 in essentially the same area called the Cerro Léon Project. We are advised that their work included a reconnaissance geochemical lag samples, 196 square kilometers of geological mapping, excavation and sampling of 155 trenches totalling 1,543 meters along the silicified veins. In addition, 18 HQ diamond drill holes (1,032 m total) drilled along the principal vein on the property (known as the “Marta vein”) and other veins returned values somewhat lower than the surface results and with higher silver values locally. Minera Mincorp ceased work on the project in 1996. The data and core are at the Cerro Vanguardia mine site, which we do not own or have any right to, and have not been made available to our company.
Christopher Dyakowski acquired the Pinguino property in 1998 and, in 2000, optioned it to High American Gold Inc., a junior exploration company operating in Argentina. High American Gold conducted a short property exam and approached Minera Mincorp to negotiate a joint venture and in return acquired copies of the work carried out on the Pinguino Property by Minera Mincorp. High American subsequently defaulted on its option payments to Mr. Dyakowski and returned the Pinguino property to him, together with copies of all their data.
Our Work on the Pinguino Property to Date
During 2004 we engaged in preliminary exploration activities at our Pinguino property. These preliminary exploration activities consisted primarily of prospecting, soil sampling, trenching and trench sampling and IP geophysics. In early 2005, we initiated our first drill program on the best known vein system on the property, known as the Marta vein. This drill program consisted of 45 short drill holes for a total of 3,010 meters, testing the near-surface targets that were largely determined by previous trenching results.
We focused our drilling efforts on selected areas along the Marta vein based upon anomalous results from surface trenching. Analytical results returned a number of intervals of anomalous silver-gold mineralization contained in epithermal veins hosted by sedimentary rocks of the Roca Blanca formation. With an average length of approximately 75 meters, many of these holes tested the oxidized portion of the vein systems. The estimated depth of oxidation appears to be approximately 35-40 meters below surface.
In March 2006, we undertook a second drill program on the Pinguino property. We continued to focus on the Marta vein system, much of which remained untested from the previous drilling. The method of drill target definition in this drilling was different than previous drilling in that geophysical anomalies along the Marta trend were tested. Again, a number of mineralized silver-gold intervals were discovered in the northern part of the Marta vein but, in the southern portion, two drill holes intersected into a substructure of the main Marta vein that revealed high lead, zinc, silver, gold and indium values. Other drill holes in the adjacent Yvonne vein also showed a high sulphide content and anomalous base, precious and indium values over significant widths.
- 18 -
A follow-up drill program consisting of 30 holes for a total of 3,000 meters was completed in mid-January 2007. We focused on the central part of the Marta vein system, which included a number of new sulphide targets discovered by detailed mapping, prospecting and geophysics. The results of this program proved the existence of multiple sulphide veins in the central part of the Marta vein system. This sulphide vein system discovered to date occurred within an area of approximately 4 square kilometres (2.4 square miles). We announced the analytical results for this 30 hole drilling program on April 16 and April 23, 2007.
In late 2007, we initiated a large drill program on the Pinguino property, targeting existing mineralized zones along strike and to depth as well as new targets with little or no existing testing. The first zone tested was Marta Centro and results released in early April 2008 confirmed the continuation of known base metal mineralization to depths further than previously tested. As part of the overall drill program, we conducted drill testing on Marta Este, Marta Norte, Marta Noroeste and other zones.
During the 2007-2008 exploration program, we completed approximately 20,782.9 meters (68,185 feet) of HQ diamond drilling at Pinguino using two independent drill contractors. A total of 15 base-metal and precious-metal veins were tested in 151 new HQ diamond drill holes. In total, more than 10,000 core samples were collected and sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories for analysis.
The last hole in the 2007-2008 program, hole P269, was located in Marta Centro and was the deepest hole ever drilled at Pinguino. It returned an intersection of 8.85 meters (29 feet) returned 92 g/t silver and 6.55% combined lead-zinc at a depth of approximately 400 meters (1,312 feet) below the top of the mineralized zone. Our management believes this may be the deepest and thickest mineralized intercept yet discovered in the entire Deseado Massif of Santa Cruz province.
Our use of IP geophysics and specific chargeability anomalies has proved to be a much better targeting method than we previously thought when the initial geological impression was of a low-sulphidation epithermal model. The high concentrations of sulphides in a central core zone surrounded by disseminated and veinlet mineralization provides an excellent target for this type of geophysical method.
Mapping has indicated approximately 60 kilometers of epithermal veins and vein-breccias on the property. Very few of these have been sufficiently tested and sampled with work completed to date. The geophysical coverage completed on the Marta vein in 2004 is currently being supplemented by additional grid coverage on new veins.
In December 2009, we commenced the diamond drilling for the 2009-2010 exploration program at Pinguino. The program was designed to drill test new precious metal targets and expand known discoveries. Drilling was focused on Marta Norte, Marta Noroeste, Luna and the Tranquilo structure. A total of 89 shallow drill holes totalling 6,224 meters (20,414 feet) were completed by the end of the program in June 2010. Two new major discoveries included significant mineralized intersections at Luna and Tranquilo which fall within the 11 kilometer long Tranquilo Trend structure.
The Pinguino property has been the focus of pre-drilling advanced exploration and target definition exploration work in the last quarter of 2010. We completed approximately 275 linear km of ground magnetometer surveys with 1200 meters of trenching and channel sampling in key precious metal mineralized areas. In addition, we initiated a deep gradient Induced Polarization geophysical test on the core sulphide-rich vein area of the Pinguino property to evaluate the proposed geological model of sulphide-enriched (and potentially mineralized) intrusives at depth, forming the source for the polymetallic veins exposed on surface.
We signed a drill contract with Major Perforaciones S.A. on January 3, 2011 for drilling on the Pinguino property in 2011 for a minimum of 10,000 meters of reverse circulation drilling in the shallow oxidized portion of the silver-enriched high grade zones discovered previously. Our objective is to expand those centers of significant mineralization along strike and at depth. We have recently signed a second contract with the same drilling contractor to provide a diamond drill rig for a minimum of 2,000 meters of diamond core drilling on the Pinguino property. The objective of the core rig is to test extensions of known mineralization to significant depth as determined by results of the deep Induced Polarization test and for new target testing.
- 19 -
On March 28, 2011 we announced the first drilling results of our 2011 exploration program at Pinguino. Marta Noroeste was the first target tested in the 2011 exploration program. The focus of the current drilling campaign is shallow testing of 2010 reconnaissance discoveries to expand these zones along strike and at depth with the goal of expanding the near surface silver resource at Pinguino. This drilling has returned the highest silver grades ever returned on Marta Noroeste with an intersection of 4 meters of 965 g/t Ag and 3.23 g/t Au.
There can be no assurance that future exploration will reveal any significant amounts of gold or other minerals in quantities sufficient to justify the development of a mine or the conduct of mining operations.
Geology
The Pinguino project is located in the Deseado Massif, Santa Cruz province, southern Argentinian Patagonia. The Deseado Massif is a geological and metallogenic region characterized by extended middle to late Jurassic bimodal volcanic rocks (Bahía Laura Group and Bajo Pobre Formation) with associated low sulphidation (LS) epithermal mineralization.
Mineralization in the Pinguino area was discovered by a prior owner in 1994. This prior owner made the decision to divest itself of the property in 1998. We acquired the property in early 2004, at which time we initiated a comprehensive work program. Our initial exploration program was focused on an Ag epithermal deposit, but in 2006 we redefined our program in light of our discovery of a polymetallic epithermal deposit type.
The geological and structural settings at the Pinguino project are atypical for the Deseado Massif. It is a dome structure produced by a deep intrusion (>5Km) with shallower mafic apophasis. This magmatic activity (La Leona/ Cerro León Formations) is lower Jurassic and is intruding Triassic to lower Jurassic volcanogenic continental sediments of El Tranquilo Group and Roca Blanca Formation.
Pinguino veins are hosted in these older rocks and related to a strike-slip zone, which has a major northwest-trending fault (El Tranquilo), and several associated faults and lineaments. This regional fault zone can be seen to extend southeast to Cerro Vanguardia gold-silver quartz veins field.
A total of 14 additional line kilometers (8.7 additional line miles) of veins were discovered in 12 new structures. Mapped veins at the property now cover a combined strike length of 74 kilometers (45 miles). Mineralization has been tested and found at depth to more than 410 meters below surface and in drilling in 15 of 47 mapped veins. Two types of veins can be recognized.
Quartz-rich veins are represented by four NW-striking orientations. There are silver-gold rich hydrothermal breccias; with several silver-rich ore shoots along the structure. The sulphide-rich veins are represented by both northwest and two east-northeast vein orientations. The majority of these veins are located in a 6 square kilometer area that is just above an east-northeast dioritic shallow intrusion. This type of vein has silver, zinc, gold, indium, copper, lead, with minor tin, tungsten and bismuth anomalous contents.
The two systems (quartz-rich and sulphide-rich) are interpreted to be different in time and genesis. The sulphide-rich type is earlier, higher temperature and related to the shallow intrusions. The quartz-rich system is lower temperature and related to the middle to late Jurassic major epithermal activity.
The Pinguino project appears to be the first polymetallic epithermal deposit found in the Deseado Massif.

Physiography
The property is located in the Sub-Andean Patagonia geographical region, which lies south of Rio Colorado, east of the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and north of the Straits of Magellan in southern Argentina. Patagonia includes the provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro, Chubut, and Santa Cruz.
The topography is flat to undulating plateaus cut by small, frequently dry streams and dotted with closed basins holding temporary lakes and springs. The average elevation of the property is approximately 400 meters above mean sea level.
Vegetation is typically stunted with hardy shrubs, low trees, and hardy grasses suited for the semi-desert climate. Animals include herds of guanco (an American camel), flocks of ñandu (an American ostrich), mountain lion, rabbit or hare, red fox, several flightless birds, and a variety of migrant birds.
Accessibility
National Route 3 is the major paved provincial highway in southeastern Argentina. It parallels the Atlantic coast and connects the major regional centers Comodoro Rivadavia and Rio Gallegos. Both centers are served by daily flights from Buenos Aires. The nearest city to the property, Puerto San Julian, is located on the Atlantic coast 160 kilometers southeast of the property. It is 250 kilometers south of Comodoro Rivadavia and 400 kilometers north of Rio Gallegos along National Route 3.
Vehicle access to the property is via National Route 3 to the village of Tres Cerros, which is about 140 kilometers north of Puerto San Julian. The graveled (ripio) Provincial Route 87 goes west from Tres Cerros for 40 kilometers where it meets Provincial Route 75 that heads northwest for 21 kilometers. The local road turns north for 16 kilometers to the estancia El Piche. A single lane gravel road continues another 12 kilometers west to give access to the project area. Within the property, gravel and dirt roads provide good access to most areas of the property. In winter or during infrequent rainstorms, four-wheel drive is necessary.
The property covers several estancias (sheep ranches), some abandoned, located in the central part of Santa Cruz Province, particularly El Piche.
Infrastructure
There are no nearby power lines or telecommunication lines. A natural gas transmission line is located within 65 kilometers east of the property, passing just west of Puerto San Julian. The main economic activity is sheep farming. The Cerro Vanguardia gold and silver mine and mill site, operated by a subsidiary of Anglo Gold, is located approximately 48 kilometers southeast from the center of the Pinguino property. The technical college at Puerto San Julian has introduced technical training for the mining industry to increase the capacity of the local workforce.
- 33 -
Budget
We intend to spend approximately $10 million on our Pinguino property over the 12 month period ending March 31, 2012. During this period, we plan to test the majority of our 75 line-km Pinguino vein system at strike and at depth, to complete metallurgical testing and update our preliminary economic assessment of a portion of the Pinguino property.
There are no known reserves on the Pinguino property and any proposed program by us is exploratory in nature. We have not conducted a significant amount of drilling in targeted areas on the Pinguino property, testing our proposed geological model of mineral deposition. We have not conducted any economic assessment or development or mining work on the Pinguino property. We plan to review these mineral claims after each work program and, if warranted, undertake further exploration activities. We are presently in the exploration stage and we can give no assurance that we will discover a commercially viable mineral deposit (a reserve) on the Pinguino property.
Santa Cruz Properties
Acquisition
We own interests in 25 additional mineral claims in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina that form two groups, or properties. We refer to one of these groups of mineral claims, consisting of 19 claims, as the “Santa Cruz” properties. We refer to the remaining six mineral claims as the “El Condor” property. These claims collectively cover approximately 78,459 hectares.
The Santa Cruz Properties are described as follows:
- 34 -
The Diamante 2, CV Norte, CV 1, CV 3, La Leona, Cerro Contreras, and Nuevo Oro 1 and Nuevo Oro 2 were acquired by us pursuant to the terms of a mineral property acquisition agreement dated February 24, 2004 between us and Christopher Dyakowski, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and a former director. We refer to this group of claims as the “Dyakowski property”.
As consideration for the Dyakowski property, we issued to Mr. Dyakowski, subject to escrow and return to treasury conditions, a total of 833,333 shares of our common stock. As the result of a March 15, 2004 share dividend, these 833,333 shares were increased to 2,499,999 shares. Under the agreement, these shares were to be returned to treasury if we did not commence work on the Dyakowski property, the Pinguino property and a third property (see discussion of the SCRN property, below) on or before April 30, 2004. As we commenced our work program prior to April 30, 2004, these 2,499,999 shares were not returned to treasury at that time. Under the agreement, these shares were to continue to be held in escrow and released to Mr. Dyakowski, if at all, in installments over a period of time and upon the occurrence of certain events. These escrow provisions were subsequently deleted, and the number of shares to be released to Mr. Dyakowski was reduced, pursuant to the terms of a Restated Amendment to Mineral Property Acquisition Agreements dated as of August 8, 2005.
We acquired the Diamante 1 and CV2 Manifestacions de Descubrimiento pursuant to a mineral property acquisition agreement dated February 20, 2004 with Storm Cat Energy Corp., whereby we also acquired three additional manifestations of discovery located in the Rio Negro Province of Argentina and discussed below under the heading “Rio Negro Properties”. We paid to Storm Cat Energy Corp. the sum of approximately $7,528 for all of these manifestations of discovery. At the time of this acquisition in February, 2004, Storm Cat Energy Corp. was an affiliate of Christopher Dyakowski, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director.
Our El Condor property is described as follows:

(2)
Contained within the area of the El Condor cateo.
We acquired the El Condor property pursuant to a mineral property acquisition agreement dated February 20, 2004 between our company and San Telmo Energy Ltd. As consideration for the Condor property we paid to San Telmo Energy Ltd. the sum of approximately $7,528 (CDN$10,000). The Condor property is subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty in favor of San Telmo Energy Ltd. We have the right to repurchase one half of this royalty for approximately $1,000,000 (CAD$1,000,000) and all of this royalty for approximately $2,000,000 (CAD$2,000,000). At the time of this acquisition in February, 2004, San Telmo Energy Ltd. was an affiliate of Christopher Dyakowski, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director.
There are no maintenance fees to be paid on a cateo or on a manifestation of discovery, but there are semi-annual fees charged to maintain a pertinencia. We are current in the payment of all maintenance fees on that portion of our El Condor property comprised of pertinencias.
There are no known commercially viable mineral resources (known as a ‘reserve’) on our Santa Cruz property or our El Condor property. Any proposed program by us is exploratory in nature and we have not conducted any significant exploration activities on these properties. We plan to review these mineral claims and, if warranted, undertake further exploration activities but we cannot give any assurance that either of these properties will warrant further exploration activities.

Access
To access our Santa Cruz and El Condor properties from Rio Gallegos, the capitol of Santa Cruz province, one would head north by road for approximately six hours to the community of Tres Cerro. From there, a moderate amount of off-road travel is required to access the properties. Relatively gentle terrain allows easy off-road travel. The map reproduced below shows the location of our Santa Cruz and El Condor properties.

In May, 2004 we conducted reconnaissance prospecting and limited soil sampling and geophysics on the El Condor property. Historical results showed indications of visible gold within a small area and the exploration program was directed to expand the area of potential mineralization through geochemical and geophysical means. The anomalous geochemistry was spotty and did not show a coherent pattern. Geophysics showed an extension of the resistive material to depth. We have not conducted any further work on El Condor.
On the Santa Cruz property, we have focused on reconnaissance prospecting, which we have conducted simultaneously with the drill program on our Pinguino property. Truck-based prospecting covered a number of areas on the property and we collected rock samples from a number of prospective sites. A number of these samples have returned anomalous gold values but further work is warranted. No significant field work has been conducted on most of these Manifestacions de Descubrimiento.
Cerro Contreras is a property located in the Deseado Massif silver-gold epithermal region, in the center of Santa Cruz province, Argentina. The geology of the area is characterized by an intermediate to acid Jurassic lava complex, with some pyroclastic components, overlaid by Cretaceous, Tertiary and modern sediments. The volcanic rocks were separated into three lithological units: intermediate to basic (IB), intermediate to acid (IA) and acid (A). There are some evidences of a volcanic center in the area, with a magmatic evolution from basic (basaltic andesite) to acid (rhyolite) compositions. This fossil volcano is located in the intersection of regional NW and ENE structures. Mineralization in the area is represented by several occurrences of low sulphidation epithermal veins, breccias and veinlets, associated with the volcanic rocks. Two main areas were recognized: NW Dome and Main Vein, both associated with the more acidic rock faces. Expedite recognizance of these areas shows anomalous precious metals values in both and some base metals in the NW Dome Area. Nevertheless, the areas are different; the NW Dome has potential for fracture disseminated sulphide-rich mineralization, and the Main Vein Area has potential for deeper high grade precious metals ore-shoots.
History
A cateo covering the Condor property was originally registered by Mr. Dyakowski as bare trustee for San Telmo Energy Ltd. in November 1998. In early 1999 San Telmo Energy Ltd. conducted a minor work program on the property consisting of general prospecting and grab sampling. In 2000 San Telmo Energy Ltd. filed the Condor manifestacion de descubrimiento and, in 2003, it surveyed and filed the Condor Pertinencias 1, 2 and 3 and re-filed the El Condor cateo.
Regional Geology
Our Santa Cruz properties are located in the Patagonia region of southern Argentina in a physiographic province referred to as the Deseado Massif. This area is in part underlain by continental Jurassic felsic ignimbrites, megabreccias, pyroclastic flows, tuffs and volcanic flows. Local stratigraphy is comprised of Roca Blanca (Lower Jurassic), Bajo Pobre (Mid-Jurassic) and Chon Aike (Mid-Upper Jurassic).
Our Work on the Santa Cruz Properties to Date
The Cerro Contreras project is an advancing low sulphidation epithermal gold project in the northern part of the Deseado Massif where previous sampling by us has identified a number of key areas with anomalous gold mineralization for follow-up. New work conducted on the property has included detailed mapping in two areas; Main Vein (2.5 km by 2 km) and NW Dome (1.2 km by 0.5 km). A comprehensive program of soil sampling (544), lag sampling (636) and rock channel sampling (126) was carried out for geochemical analysis. In addition, approximately 60 km of gradient IP geophysics was completed on the Main Vein target and detailed ground magnetometer surveys totaling 500 linear km were completed on both targets. Analytical data is being compiled and interpreted together with geophysics.
Follow-up exploration on the Condor property focused on investigation of a new geological model based on evidence derived from previous work. The model is low grade large tonnage gold mineralization composed of chalcedony and sulphide-rich hydrothermal breccias within rhyolitic domes. Therefore, we conducted detailed mapping of approximately 16 km2 and collected 35 rock chip samples from the area. In addition, we collected approximately 1600 soil and lag samples for geochemical analysis. Preliminary results of the mapping and sampling were successful with the discovery of several breccias, several of them with anomalies over 0.1 g/t gold, two over 0.5 g/t gold and one with 14 g/t gold. Work is continuing at the present time and additional results will be released as they are received.

Budget
We intend to spend approximately $5 million on our Santa Cruz properties (excluding Pinguino but including Cerro Contreras and El Condor) over the 12 month period ending March 31, 2012. During this period, we plan to have extensive geological and geophysical work completed and drill test targets by drilling approximately 40,000 meters.
There are no known reserves on our Santa Cruz properties and any program proposed by us for these properties is exploratory in nature. We have not conducted any significant amount of exploration activities on our Santa Cruz properties, nor have we conducted any economic assessment or development or mining work on these properties. We plan to review these mineral claims after the completion of each work program and, if warranted, undertake further exploration activities. We are presently in the exploration stage and we can give no assurance that we will discover a commercially viable mineral deposit (a reserve) on any of the Santa Cruz properties.
Rio Negro Properties
Acquisition and Location
We own interests in two cateos and 10 manifestacions de descubrimiento located in the Los Menucos epithermal gold district of Rio Negro province. These Rio Negro properties cover 46,028 hectares and are described as follows:
The Pilquin 4 through 11 Manifestacion de Descubrimiento and the Mochas Cateos, which we have sometimes referred to collectively as the “SCRN property”, belong to SCRN Properties Ltd. We acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of SCRN Properties Ltd., pursuant to the terms of a share purchase agreement dated February 24, 2004 with Christopher Dyakowski, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director. Under this share purchase agreement, Mr. Dyakowski sold to our company all of the issued and outstanding shares of SCRN Properties Ltd. in exchange for a total of 833,333 shares of our common stock, which we issued to Mr. Dyakowski subject to escrow and return-to-treasury conditions. As the result of a March 15, 2004 share dividend, these 833,333 shares were increased to 2,499,999 shares. Under the agreement, these shares were to be returned to treasury if we did not commence work on the Dyakowski property, the Pinguino property or the SCRN property on or before April 30, 2004. As we commenced our work program prior to April 30, 2004, these 2,499,999 shares were not returned to treasury at that time. Under the agreement, these shares were to continue to be held in escrow and released to Mr. Dyakowski, if at all, in installments over a period of time and upon the occurrence of certain events. These escrow provisions were subsequently deleted, and the number of shares to be released to Mr. Dyakowski was reduced, pursuant to the terms of a Restated Amendment to Mineral Property Acquisition Agreements dated as of August 8, 2005.

On June 30, 2005, we entered into an amending agreement with Christopher Dyakowski whereby we amended the mineral property acquisition agreement dated as of February 24, 2004 pertaining to the Dyakowski properties, the share purchase agreement dated as of February 24, 2004 pertaining to the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of SCRN Properties Ltd., and an Escrow Agreement dated as of March 4, 2004. This amending agreement was restated August 8, 2005. In the restated amending agreement we agreed to release the 4,999,998 common shares of our company that were being held in escrow pursuant to the SCRN share purchase agreement and the Dyakowski mineral property acquisition agreement (each as to 2,499,999 common shares). Under the terms of the release, 4,749,998 of these shares were released to our company for cancellation, and the balance of 250,000 shares were released to Mr. Dyakowski as payment in full for the transfer of the Dyakowski property mineral claims and the shares of SCRN Properties Ltd. Under the amending agreement, Mr. Dyakowski continued to be responsible to complete the registration of legal title to all of the mineral properties in the name of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SCRN Properties Ltd.
The Pilquin 12 and 13 manifestations of discovery were acquired pursuant to our mineral property acquisition agreement dated February 20, 2004 with Storm Cat Energy Corp., discussed above in which we also acquired two additional manifestations of discovery located in Santa Cruz province.
The cateos and manifestations of discovery comprising our Rio Negro properties are registered in the name of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SCRN Properties Ltd. There are no maintenance fees to be paid on a cateo or on a manifestation of discovery.
There are no known reserves on our Rio Negro properties and any proposed program by us is exploratory in nature. The collective group Rio Negro properties may decrease or increase in size due to our refocusing exploration emphasis and focus based upon many factors, including market conditions.
Access
Our Rio Negro properties can be accessed from Viedma, the capitol of the Rio Negro province, which is approximately 450 kilometers to the east or from Neuquen, approximately 300 kilometers to the north. Well-maintained provincial highways access the community of Los Menucos, which is located in the heart of our Rio Negro properties. The location of our Rio Negro properties is as shown on the map below:

Our Work on the Rio Negro Properties to Date
During regional prospecting of our SCRN property, we discovered two new epithermal style veins located on the claim described as Pilquin 9, with each vein being over 1,640 feet (500 meters) in length. Broken exposures of quartz vein breccias, crustiform quartz layers and chalcedonic quartz were evident along their estimated strike length. One vein had a strike length of approximately 1,500 meters and seven selected samples were taken over that distance to test the vein. The second vein has a strike length of approximately 870 meters with six selected samples collected along that strike length. The analytical results of the 13 rock samples collected are displayed in the following table:

Current Exploration Plans for other Santa Cruz Properties and Rio Negro Properties:
The primary focus of our exploration activities in Argentina has been our Pinguino property, though we have recently expanded our focus to include our Cerro Contreras and Condor properties. All three of these properties are located in Santa Cruz province. These and our other Santa Cruz properties are located within a physiographic region known as the Deseado Massif, which was the locus of Jurassic extensional tectonic activity. The resulting graben and half graben structures, northwest trending regional structural grain and rhyolitic pyroclastic and flow volcanism produced a favorable environment for brittle vein formation. The Deseado Massif is the host region for the large majority of precious metal vein occurrences, deposits and operating mines in the province of Santa Cruz.
The geology underlying the Santa Cruz properties is prospective for exploration because of the rock type and the structural history of the region.
Within the province of Rio Negro, a similar physiographic region, the Somuncura Massif, is the host for a large number of mineral occurrences but there is only a short history of exploration in this area and there are currently no operating metal mines in the region. Each of the properties is still in the very early stage of exploration with little comprehensive work completed to date. Therefore, more preliminary assessment (prospecting and geological mapping) is required before more definitive work is conducted.
As with the Santa Cruz properties, the geology underlying the Rio Negro properties is prospective for exploration because of the rock type and the structural history of the region.
Regional Geology
The Los Menucos district has significant concentrations of advanced argillic-altered Choiyoy-age ignimbrites and rhyolites. The most favourable rocks for mineralization in the Somuncura Massif region of Rio Negro appear to be the PermoTriassic Choiyoy Formation and equivalents, which are intruded by younger plutons that are Tertiary and likely Miocene in age. In addition to the epithermal targets, the Choiyoy volcanic rocks have the potential to host porphyry copper-gold mineralization.
Numerous kaolin deposits in the Los Menucos area which are being exploited for ceramic quality “china” clay, are believed to be related to a strong northeast trend seen on remote sensing images. Much of this alteration may be related to the intrusion of Permian rhyolite domes or other intrusive bodies below the altered areas.
Budget
We intend to spend approximately $100,000 over the 12 month period ending March 31, 2012 to define regional structures and property definition of our Rio Negro properties .
There are no known reserves on our Rio Negro property and any proposed program by us is exploratory in nature. We have not conducted any significant exploration activities on our Rio Negro property. We plan to review these mineral claims after market conditions improve and, if warranted, undertake exploration activities. We are presently in the exploration stage and we can give no assurance that we will discover a commercially viable mineral deposit (a reserve) on our Rio Negro property.

British Columbia Properties
On June 7, 2010, we acquired a group of three contiguous mineral tenures known as the Clapperton Property, covering an aggregate of approximately 825 hectares of land located in south central British Columbia, Canada, approximately 25 kilometers northeast of the town of Merritt, British Columbia. These mineral tenures will expire on June 7, 2011 unless we maintain ownership by spending at least $3,301 in annual exploration expenses on these properties or paying an equivalent amount in lieu. We plan to conduct reconnaisance exploration and property examination work to assess the mineral potential of the claims going forward and we do not intend to let these claims expire on June 7, 2011.
The map reproduced below shows the location of the Clapperton Property:
There are no known mineral resources or reserves on the Clapperton Property, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to identify any mineral resource or reserve there.
