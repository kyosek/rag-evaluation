ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
the Company's real estate and further summary information with respect to the Company's properties held for investment, properties held for sale and investments in real estate entities.
At December 31, 1994, none of the Company's properties, mortgage notes receivable or investments in real estate entities exceeded 10% or more of the Company's total assets. At December 31, 1994, 86% of the Company's assets consisted of properties held for investment, 3% consisted of properties held for sale, 5% consisted of mortgage notes and interest receivable and 3% consisted of investments in real estate entities. The remaining 3% of the Company's assets at December 31, 1994 were invested in cash, cash equivalents and other assets. It should be noted, however, that the percentage of the Company's assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of the Company's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
The Company's real estate is geographically diverse. At December 31, 1994, the Company held investments in apartments and commercial properties in each of the geographic regions of the continental United States, although its apartments and commercial properties are concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below. At December 31, 1994, the Company held mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in each of the geographic regions, other than the Mountain and Pacific regions, of the continental United States, with a concentration in the Southeast, as shown more specifically in the table under "Mortgage Loans" below.
To continue to qualify for federal taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company is required, among other things, to hold at least 75% of the value of its total assets in real estate assets, government securities, cash and cash equivalents at the close of each quarter of each taxable year.

The Company's real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in real estate entities and properties held for sale (which were primarily obtained through foreclosure of the collateral securing mortgage notes receivable).
Types of Real Estate Investments. The Company's real estate consists of commercial properties (office buildings, industrial facilities and shopping centers) and apartments or similar properties having established income-producing capabilities.

expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Company may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although the Company has typically invested in developed real estate, and has no current intentions to do otherwise, the Company may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors). To the extent that the Company invests in construction and development projects, the Company would be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had no properties on which significant capital improvements were in process.
In the opinion of the Company's management, the properties owned by the Company are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region of the Company's real estate (other than a hotel in the Pacific region and land included in "Properties Held for Sale") at December 31, 1994.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units and amount of commercial square footage owned by the Company and does not reflect the value of the Company's investment in each region. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for a more detailed description of the Company's real estate portfolio.

The Company owns Institute Place Lofts, a 142,215 square foot office building in Chicago, Illinois.

For the six months ended June 30, 1994, the property's cash flow of $358,176 was remitted to the lender all of which was applied to unpaid real estate taxes. In July 1994, the property was placed in bankruptcy. In January 1995, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan of reorganization which provides for a reduction in the mortgage's principal balance to $4.1 million, reduces the pay rate to 6% per annum in the first year, increasing to 10.25% per annum in the fourth year, with interest accruing at 10.25% per annum.

Partnership Properties. Set forth below are the properties owned by partnerships which the Company accounts for using the equity method and the monthly rental rate for apartments and the average annual rental rate for commercial properties and occupancy thereof at December 31, 1994 and 1993:
The Company owns a combined 63.7% limited and general partner interest and IORT owns a 36.3% general partner interest in Tri-City Limited Partnership ("Tri-City") which owns five properties in Texas: Chelsea Square, a shopping center in Houston, Texas; Summit at Bridgewood, a shopping center in Fort Worth, Texas; MacArthur Mills, an office building in Carrollton, Texas; and two apartment complexes, Oaks of Inwood and Inwood Green, both in Houston, Texas. None of the five properties are subject to mortgage debt. In 1994, the Company received distributions of $446,000 from the partnership. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS - Related Party Transactions."
The Company owned a 55% limited partner interest in One Penn Square Associates Limited Partnership ("One Penn Square"), which was accounted for using the equity method as control of the partnership was maintained

by the general partner. In January 1992, the partnership stopped making payments on the first mortgage secured by the One East Penn Square Office Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An affiliate of the lender owned the remaining 45% limited partner interest. In May 1993, the lender filed a foreclosure action against One Penn Square. On October 6, 1993, the court appointed a receiver for the property. The lender also filed an action against the partnership and the Company to set aside, as a fraudulent conveyance, payments from the partnership to the Company in 1992 and in 1993 of $1.8 million made to repay the Company's mortgage note secured by a second lien on the One East Penn Square Office Building. In April 1994, the Company and the lender reached an agreement which provided that the Company pay $575,000 to the lender and convey the Company's interest in the partnership to the lender. In August 1994, the Company made the required $575,000 payment, conveyed its partnership interest to the lender and the parties executed mutual releases and all litigation between the parties was dismissed. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million as the carrying value of its investment in the partnership was less than the debt secured by the One Penn Square Office Building due to previously recognized equity losses.
In March 1994, the Company sold its 50% general partner interests in Pilgrim Village Associates and Pilgrim Village Associates II to the co-general partner for $2.6 million in cash. The partnerships owned the Pilgrim Village Apartments I and II, respectively, in Canton Township, Michigan. The Company recognized a gain of $2.5 million on the sale.
Effective January 1, 1995, the other 50% general partners in both Twinbrook Village Associates, which owns Twinbrook Village Apartments in Rockville, Maryland, and Gate Laurel Associates, which owns the Westgate of Laurel Apartments in Laurel, Maryland, conveyed their interests in the partnerships to the Company in exchange for a release from their general partner liability.
In January 1995, the Company refinanced the mortgage debt secured by the Shadow Run Apartments, an apartment complex located in Pinellas Park, Florida. The new first mortgage of $7.2 million bears interest at 10.21% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $64,305 and matures February 1, 2002. The Company used the refinancing proceeds and $300,000 of its cash reserves to pay the existing mortgage of $7.0 million, accrued but unpaid interest, financing fees and real estate taxes. The Company paid a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $72,000 to BCM based on the $7.2 million refinancing. The Company has agreed to purchase the remaining general partner interest in Shadow Run Associates, which owns the Shadow Run Apartments, for $50,000 in cash. The purchase is expected to close in April 1995.

Properties Held for Sale. Set forth below are the Company's properties held for sale, primarily obtained through foreclosure.
In February 1994, the Company sold 1,406 acres of land in sixteen residential and commercial subdivisions in Maumelle, Arkansas, for $8.4 million, retaining 114 residential lots. The Company received $1.7 million in cash and provided purchase money financing of $6.7 million, as discussed in "Mortgage Loans," below. The Company has recorded this transaction as a cost recovery method sale and accordingly has deferred recognizing a gain on the sale pending collection of the note receivable. The Company paid a real estate brokerage commission of $215,000 to Carmel Realty based on $7.2 million, the sales price of $8.4 million less allowable early payment discounts of $1.2 million.

The Company incurred no loss on the sale beyond the amounts which had been previously provided. See "Mortgage Loans" below.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to investments in real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally secured by income-producing real estate. The Company expects that the percentage of its assets invested in mortgage notes will decrease, as it has determined that it will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans, other than those which it may originate in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of a property sale. The Company does intend, however, to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in its portfolio. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In the past the Company has originated its own mortgage loans, as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. The Company is not considering new mortgage lending, except in connection with purchase money financing offered to facilitate the sale

of Company owned properties. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes. The Company's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS - Business Plan and Investment Policy."
Types of Properties Securing Mortgage Notes. The properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1994, consisted of office buildings, apartments, a single-family residence, a hotel, 1,386 acres of land in sixteen developed residential and commercial subdivisions and three parcels of unimproved land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgage loans in which the Company invests without a vote of stockholders. The Company's Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
At December 31, 1994, the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio included eight mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $10.4 million secured by income-producing real estate located throughout the United States, and 30 loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $8.5 million which are secured by collateral other than income- producing real estate. At December 31, 1994, 5% of the Company's assets were invested in mortgage notes and interest receivable (3% in first mortgage notes, 2% in wraparound mortgage notes and less than 1% in junior and other mortgage notes).
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance) by property type and geographic region, of the properties (other than a hotel, a residence and unimproved land) that serve as collateral for the Company's outstanding mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1994. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)

A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1994 is as follows:
During 1994, the Company provided $6.8 million of purchase money financing in conjunction with property sales. Also during the year, mortgage notes of $249,000 were collected in full and $1.5 million in mortgage principal payments were received.
At December 31, 1994, less than 1% of the Company's assets were invested in mortgage notes secured by non-income-producing real estate, comprised of a note participation secured by 4.8 acres of unimproved land in Naperville, Illinois, a first mortgage note secured by 34,847 square feet of unimproved land in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sixteen first mortgage notes secured by developed residential lots in Greensboro, North Carolina, a first mortgage note secured by a residence in Phoenix, Arizona, and a first mortgage note secured by 1,386 acres of land in sixteen developed residential and commercial subdivisions in Maumelle, Arkansas.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company has invested in first mortgage notes, with short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the Company's general policy was to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.
The following discussion briefly describes the first mortgage loans that the Company originated as well as events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans, during 1994.
In January 1994, the Company instituted foreclosure proceedings on a mortgage note receivable secured by an office building in Madison, Wisconsin. In June 1994, the Company wrote off the debt as uncollectible, the building having been foreclosed upon by the local taxing authority. The Company incurred no loss in excess of the reserve previously established.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, in February 1994, the Company provided $6.7 million of purchase money financing in conjunction with the sale of 1,406 acres of land in sixteen developed residential and commercial subdivisions located in Maumelle, Arkansas. The note receivable bears interest at 8.0% per annum, requires annual payments of principal of $850,000 plus accrued interest through maturity in February 1998, is secured by a first lien on the properties sold and provides discounts of up to $1.2 million for early payments. The note is guaranteed by companies affiliated with the purchaser. In December 1994, a residential tract, comprising 20 acres, was sold. The Company received $203,000, the release price for such tract. The borrower did not make the scheduled February 1995 principal and interest payments. The Company has commenced negotiations with the borrower in an effort to correct the default. As negotiations are in a preliminary stage, it is too early to predict their outcome. However, if the Company were to foreclose the collateral securing the note it would not incur a loss as the fair value of the property exceeds the carrying value of the note.
In June 1994, a mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $2.7 million and secured by the Lincoln Court Apartments, a 53 unit apartment complex in Dallas, Texas, was paid down and modified. The Company received $1.3 million in cash and the remaining note balance of $1.4 million was split into two new notes and subordinated to a new first mortgage secured by the property. The apartment complex is owned by Jor-Trans Investors Limited Partnership ("Jor- Trans"), in which the Company has a 45% general partner interest and a 10% limited partner interest. The Company accounts for its investment in Jor-Trans using the equity method. One new note, in the amount of $600,000, is secured by a second lien mortgage on the property, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1%, requires monthly payments of interest only and matures in June 2004. The second new note in the amount of $769,000, is unsecured, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1%, requires payments of net cash flow from property operations and has no stated maturity date.
Also in June 1994, as discussed in "Real Estate" above, the Company sold the RCA Building located in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, providing purchase money financing for the entire sales price of $100,000. The note bears interest at 10% per annum and all principal and interest is due at maturity on January 15, 1996. The Company also received an equity participation in any subsequent appreciation of the building.
In July and August 1994, the Company received $120,000 and $105,000, respectively, from the payoff of two notes receivable at their respective maturities.
In June 1991, in an effort to develop a potential source for future financing, the Company entered into an asset sales agreement whereby the Company sold a participation in one of its mortgage notes in the amount of $1.1 million in exchange for the assignment of a first mortgage note for the same amount from an insurance company. In December 1991, the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
participation in the Company's mortgage note was increased by $181,000. In return, the Company received a participation for a like amount in another first mortgage note (the "loan participation"). In conjunction with these transactions, the Company entered into a put and guaranty agreement whereby, at any time, either party could demand that the seller reacquire any participation or mortgage sold pursuant to the terms of the asset sales agreement for the consideration originally received. Both the mortgage note and the loan participation received by the Company were in default at December 31, 1991. In April 1992, the property securing the first mortgage note in the amount of $1.1 million was deeded to the Company in lieu of foreclosure. In the first quarter of 1992, the Company recorded a provision for losses of $366,000 to reduce the carrying value of the mortgage note to the estimated fair value of the collateral property at the date of foreclosure. In September 1993, the Company sold the collateral property for $850,000, receiving $125,000 in cash and providing purchase money financing of $725,000. The mortgage bears interest at 7.5% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $5,069, annual principal reduction payments of $25,000 and matures August 1, 1996. The Company recognized no loss on the note beyond the amount previously provided. In the third quarter of 1992, the Company recorded a provision for losses of $184,000 to fully reserve for the carrying value of the loan participation. In 1993, the Company received payment in full for the mortgage note receivable participation sold, but has not remitted such amount to the insurance company.
In March 1992, the insurance company was placed in receivership and in June 1992, the Company provided notice to the insurance company, under the terms of the put and guaranty agreement, of its desire to divest itself of all assets received. The Receiver refused to allow the enforcement of the terms of the put and guaranty agreement.
The Company has reached a settlement with the Receiver which was approved by the court on February 15, 1995. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company will retain the assets transferred to it by the insurance company as well as receive from the insurance company the loan participation that the insurance company had received from the Company. In exchange, the Company will pay the insurance company $1.0 million in cash. The asset transfer and the Company's cash payment are anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 1995. The Company will incur no loss on the settlement. The settlement requires the Company to pay interest on the cash portion of the settlement from March 17, 1995 until the asset transfer is completed. Interest is payable monthly.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. A wraparound mortgage loan, sometimes called an all-inclusive loan, is a mortgage loan having an original principal balance equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan(s) plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy was to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make first mortgage loans.

Mortgage Loans (Continued)
The Company did not originate or acquire any wraparound mortgage loans in 1994.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company has invested in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Company's Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Company's assets. At December 31, 1994, less than 1% of the Company's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
The Company did not originate or acquire any junior mortgage loans in 1994.
Loans Secured by Collateral Other than Real Estate. In June 1992, the Company received ten notes receivable secured by collateral other than real estate in satisfaction of a $622,000 obligation to the Company. At December 31, 1994, eight of the notes with a combined principal balance of $460,000 remained outstanding. The Company's investment policy precludes the origination of loans secured by collateral other than real estate. The following discussion briefly describes events that affected those loans during 1994.
In February 1994, a note receivable with a principal balance of $48,000 and secured by the operations of a fast food restaurant in Wisconsin was modified. The modified note bears interest at 8.0% per annum in the first year, increasing by 0.5% per annum each year thereafter, requires monthly payments of interest only and annual principal payments of $5,000 and matures February 1, 1999. The borrower was unable to pay the principal installment due in December 1994. The Company is evaluating its options regarding this note, but does not anticipate incurring a loss in excess of the reserve previously established.
In September 1994, the Company received $30,000 in settlement of a note receivable with a principal balance of $72,000. The Company recorded no loss on the settlement in excess of the reserve previously established. In October 1994, the Company received payment in full of a third note receivable with a principal balance of $74,000.
