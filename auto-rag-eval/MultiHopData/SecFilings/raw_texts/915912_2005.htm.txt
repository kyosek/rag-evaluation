ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights as defined below. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. For the year 2005, the Established Communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of January 1, 2004, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For communities that we wholly-own, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community’s acquisition cost. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
In addition, we own approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Alexandria, Virginia, for our corporate office, with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2005, our communities were classified as follows:
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. In January 2006, we disposed of two communities containing an aggregate of 473 apartment homes. The Current Communities, as of January 31, 2006, include 106 garden-style (of which 14 are mixed communities and include townhomes), 20 high-rise and 15 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:
Other features at various communities may include:
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team, focused on the specific
needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed construction of 1,971 apartment homes in seven communities, acquired 604 apartment homes in four communities and sold 1,305 apartment homes in seven communities. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 13.8 years. When adjusted to accommodate for redevelopment activity, the average age of our Current Communities is 8.6 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2006, we own:
•
a fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 111 operating communities, four of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in July 2029, January 2062, April 2095 and March 2142;
•
a fee simple ownership interest in an operating community which recently completed construction and will be transferred to a joint venture upon satisfaction of certain conditions;
•
a general partnership interest in three partnerships that each own a fee simple interest in an operating community;
•
a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in the Fund, which owns a fee simple interest in eight operating communities;
•
a general partnership interest in five partnerships structured as “DownREITs,” as described more fully below, that own an aggregate of 14 communities; and
•
a membership interest in four limited liability companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community, two of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in December 2026 and November 2089.
We also hold a fee simple ownership interest in 14 of the Development Communities, one of which will be subject to a joint venture ownership structure upon construction completion, in addition to a membership interest in one limited liability company that owns a Development Community, which is subject to a land lease expiring in December 2103.
In each of our five partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. Each DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2006, there were 235,665 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities
As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 4,062 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $1,025,200,000. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
This community is currently owned by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be financed, in part or in whole, by a construction loan, and is subject to a joint venture agreement that allows for a 70% joint venture partner to be admitted upon construction completion.
(5)
This community is being financed under a joint venture structure in which we hold a 25% equity interest. Approximately 80% of the total capitalized cost will be financed through a construction loan. This community is located on land subject to a ground lease which expires in December 2103.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2005, we had two communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to complete these communities, including the cost of acquisition, capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment, to be approximately $58,800,000, of which approximately $10,000,000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and $48,800,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment. Statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the Redevelopment Communities are forward-looking statements. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Redevelopment Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.
(2)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
(3)
This community was acquired in 2004 by the Fund, which we wholly-owned until the admission of outside investors in 2005, reducing our ownership in this community and the Fund to 15.2%.
Development Rights
As of December 31, 2005, we are evaluating the future development of 47 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option. We generally hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 17 of the Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 12,495 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own. At December 31, 2005, there were cumulative capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $31,467,000 relating to Development Rights that we consider probable for future development. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $188,414,000 are reflected as land held for development as of December 31, 2005 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense.
You should carefully review Section 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The table on the following page presents a summary of the 47 Development Rights we are currently pursuing.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
We own the land parcel, but construction has not yet begun.
(3)
Represents improved land encumbered with debt. The improved land consists of occupied office buildings and industrial space. NOI from incidental operations from the current improvements will be recorded as a reduction in cost basis as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
(4)
This community will be subject to a joint venture ownership structure.
Recent Developments
Sales of Existing Communities. We seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:
•
apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;
•
reduce operating expenses; and
•
leverage management talent.
To achieve this increased concentration, we (i) sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable, like-kind exchange transaction. We sold nine communities, containing an aggregate of 1,778 apartment homes, during the period from January 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006. Net proceeds from the sale of these assets were $464,546,000.
Land Acquisitions. We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2005, we acquired 15 land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $119,719,000. The land parcels purchased, which are currently held for future development, are as follows:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
Future construction start dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Excludes portion of land acquired that is not held for future development.
(4)
Represents improved land encumbered with debt. The improved land consists of industrial space.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. A large concentration of our communities lie near, and thus are susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including
the San Andreas fault and the Hayward fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. We have in place with respect to communities located in California, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence. Earthquake coverage outside of California is subject to a $200,000,000 limit, except with respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence. In addition, up to a policy aggregate of $3,000,000, the next $400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional deductible.
Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on August 1, 2005 and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year. Including the costs we estimate that we may incur as a result of deductibles, we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from August 1, 2005 to July 31, 2006 to decrease 5% to 7% as compared to the prior period.
In an effort to capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to extend the first $15,000,000 layer of the property insurance policy by five months, thereby changing the renewal date for this layer to May 1, 2006. The remaining layers renewed on December 1, 2005. We are currently in negotiations with all carriers to align the renewal dates. The costs associated with the excess property insurance layers including the cost we estimate we may incur as a result of deductibles increased by approximately 12%.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In December 2005, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act (“TRIEA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIEA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides TRIEA coverage (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities. TRIEA is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. It is uncertain if Congress will extend this act and continue to provide federal support for terrorism insurance. If Congress does not extend TRIEA, the cost and availability of terrorism insurance may be in question.
Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture. We have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present. However, we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. We cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuit, Equal Rights Center v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc., was filed on September 23, 2005 in the federal district court in Maryland. The plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief (such as
modification of existing assets), an award of attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs of suit. The Company has filed a motion to
dismiss all or parts of the suit, which has not been ruled on yet by the court. Due to the preliminary nature of the litigation, we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this lawsuit, nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement.
We are currently involved in a lawsuit regarding the handling of security deposits in California. The lawsuit, Julie E. Ko v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. and Does 1 through 100, was filed on June 6, 2003, in California’s Los Angeles Superior Court. The suit purports to be brought on behalf of all of the Company’s former California residents who, during a four-year period, paid a security deposit to the Company for the rental of residential property in California and allegedly had a portion of the deposit withheld by the Company in excess of the damages actually sustained by the Company. We have agreed with the plaintiff on the terms of a settlement with the purported class. The settlement terms have been approved by the court, subject to final certification and approval after administration of the settlement, which is expected in April 2006. The Company has accrued for the costs it expects to incur in connection with the settlement, although there can be no assurance that the final settlement cost (which depends on the number of claims properly submitted) will not exceed the Company’s estimate.
We are involved in litigation with York Hunter Construction, Inc. and National Union Fire Insurance Company related to a community that has since completed development. A non-jury trial in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Westchester, ended in April 2004, and in May 2004, the court issued a ruling finding that (i) York Hunter breached the Construction Management Agreement between it and the Company in failing to complete the project and abandoning the construction site and is therefore liable to the Company for consequential damages, and (ii) National Union, having failed to exercise its various rights to perform and complete, is liable to the Company for consequential damages. The court issued a ruling dated October 6, 2004, awarding the Company approximately $1,250,000 plus interest. The Company has filed an appeal to seek an increase in the damage award.
We are involved in various other claims and/or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While no assurances can be given, we do not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
