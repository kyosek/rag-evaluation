Item 2. Properties
Turkey
General. As of December 31, 2015, we held interests in 18 onshore and offshore exploration licenses and 25 onshore production leases covering a total of approximately 1.4 million gross acres (approximately 880,000 net acres) in Turkey. We acquired our interests in Turkey through acquisitions, as well as through farm-in agreements with existing third-party license holders and through applications submitted to the Turkish General Directorate for Petroleum Affairs (the “GDPA”), the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey.
The following map shows our interests in Turkey:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2015, we had total net proved reserves of 10,815 Mbbl of oil and 15,847 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 10,931 Mbbl of oil and 20,253 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 11,205 Mbbl of oil and 70,739 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey.
Equipment Yards. As of December 31, 2015, we leased equipment yards in Muratli, Diyarbakir and Tekirdag and owned equipment yards at Selmo and Edirne.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and natural gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. The royalty rate is 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. Our revenue from the Selmo oil field is subject to an additional 10% royalty, which is offset by the amount of exploration expense that TEMI and DMLP, the owners of our interest in the Selmo oil field, incur in Turkey. As of December 31, 2015, our carryforward exploration credit from TEMI and DMLP was $56.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively. If those exploration expenses do not equal or exceed the amount of this additional 10% royalty, we would owe the difference. Dividends repatriated from Turkey would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 15% unless reduced by a tax treaty. There is also an 18% value added tax. However, for exploration licenses, no value added tax is assessed on drilling, completion, workover, seismic and geologic activities.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA. A new petroleum law was passed by the Turkish government in May 2013, amending some of the processes related to licensing and operations in Turkey. The regulations concerning implementation were passed by the Turkish government in January 2014. The existing licenses and future licensing processes are currently in a transition phase from the old petroleum law to the new petroleum law. The new law provides that operators have the option to maintain their licenses under the old petroleum law for the duration of the existing terms of a license or to convert their licenses to the new petroleum law prior to the expiration of the license.
The GDPA awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells. A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for and production of petroleum.
Licensing Under the Old Petroleum Law. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments. A final three-year term may be granted as an appraisal period for any oil or natural gas discovery registered in the previous terms. No single company may own more than an aggregate of 100% of eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the size of the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder may apply to convert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares (approximately 62,000 acres), to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years and may be extended for two further terms of 10 years each. Annual rentals are due based on the size of the lease. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease.
Licensing Under the New Petroleum Law. A license has a term of five years and requires the license holder to post a bond equal to 2% of the cost of the work commitments to secure the fulfillment of the work commitments. Licenses shall be based on map sections of scale equal to 1/50,000 (approximately 148,000 acres) or 1/25,000 (approximately 37,000 acres). A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments, including the drilling of at least one well in each separate extension period, and providing a bond to secure fulfillment of the additional work commitments. A final two-year term may be granted to appraise a petroleum discovery made during the prior terms. An additional six-month extension may be granted during any of the foregoing terms in order to complete the drilling or testing of a well.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder may apply to convert part of the license area, covering the prospective petroleum field, to a production lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years and may be extended for two further terms of 10 years each. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease.
The expiration dates reported on our exploration licenses and production leases below are subject to various extensions available under the old petroleum law and the new petroleum law. Those portions of exploration licenses with production are available during any term for conversion to a production lease with a term of 20 years plus two further 10 year extensions if production is maintained. We have applied to the GDPA to convert some of our qualifying acreage into the new petroleum law regulations. This will be a gradual process, but we anticipate that conversion into the new petroleum law will provide for the renewal of the exploration license terms for qualifying acreage.

We are the operator of Production Lease 829, which expires in June 2025.
Bulgaria
General. As of December 31, 2015, we held interests in one onshore exploration permit and one onshore production concession in Bulgaria. We acquired all of our Bulgarian interests through the purchase of Direct Petroleum Bulgaria EOOD (“Direct Bulgaria”) in February 2011. In January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in the Republic of Bulgaria. The legislation also had the effect of preventing conventional drilling and completion activities. In June 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament amended the legislation to clarify that conventional drilling and completion activities were not intended to be affected by the law. As long as this legislation remains in effect, our unconventional natural gas exploration, development and production activities in Bulgaria will be significantly constrained. The following map shows our interests in Bulgaria at December 31, 2015:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2015, there were no economic reserves associated with our properties in Bulgaria.
Commercial Terms. Bulgaria’s petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties and income tax.
The royalty ranges from 2.5% to 30%, based on an “R factor” which is particular to each production concession agreement, but is typically calculated by dividing the total cumulative revenues from a production concession by the total cumulative costs incurred for that production concession.
The production concession holder pays Bulgarian corporate income tax, which is assessed at a rate of 10%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Bulgaria are subject to a dividend withholding tax between 10% and 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary to conduct petroleum operations. There is also a 20% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while natural gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Bulgaria for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in two stages: exploration permit and then production concession.
Under an exploration permit, the government grants exploration rights for a term of up to five years to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, including drilling. The recipient of an exploration permit commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. The area covered by an onshore exploration permit may be as large as 5,000 square kilometers. The exploration permit may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms, subject to fulfillment of minimum work programs, and may be extended for an additional one-year term in order to appraise potential geologic discoveries. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable, subject to government approval. The permit holder is required to pay an annual area fee equal to 40 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $25 at December 31, 2015) per square kilometer, or 40 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $25 at December 31, 2015) per square kilometer in the event the permit term is extended.
Upon the registration of a commercial discovery, an exploration permit holder may apply for a production concession. The production concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The duration of a production concession is 35 years and may be extended by a further 15 years subject to the terms and conditions of the production concession agreement. Interests under a production concession are transferable, subject to government approval. No bonus is paid to the government by the company upon conversion to a production concession.
Koynare. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 3.02% overriding royalty interest and Koynare Development Ltd.’s (“KDL”) 50% farm-in interest, in the Koynare production concession covering approximately 163,000 acres. The Koynare Concession Area contains the Deventci-R1 well, where we discovered a reservoir in the Jurassic-aged Ozirovo formation at a depth of approximately 13,800 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic and commercial discovery. In November 2011, we commenced drilling the Deventci-R2 appraisal well on the Koynare Concession Area, which we suspended following the enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. During the second half of 2013, we resumed drilling the Deventci-R2 directional well on our Koynare Concession Area. In January 2014, we reached target depth of 14,100 feet on the Deventci-R2 well, and conducted a long-term test on the well during the second quarter of 2014 with an initial production test of approximately 2.0 Mmcf/d of natural gas with condensates. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received approval from the Bulgarian government to acidize the well. We conducted the acidizing operation in December 2014 to enhance its productivity. Following the acidizing operation, the Deventci-R2 well was deemed unproductive and was temporarily abandoned in the second quarter of 2015.
Stefenetz. In November 2011, we initiated the application process for a production concession covering approximately 395,000 acres over the southern portion of our former A-Lovech exploration permit. The Stefenetz Concession Area is estimated to contain over 300,000 prospective acres for Etropole shale at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. During 2012, we initiated an environmental impact assessment, which the Bulgarian government must approve prior to granting the production concession.
In September 2011, we entered into an agreement with Esrey Energy (“Esrey”) pursuant to which Esrey funded the drilling of an exploration well on the Stefenetz Concession Area to core and test the Etropole shale formation. This well, the Peshtene-R11, reached total depth in late November 2011, from which we collected more than 900 feet of core. We suspended the completion of the Peshtene-R11 well following enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. If we obtain a production concession over the Stefenetz Concession Area, Esrey would fund up to an additional $12.5 million in exchange for a 50% working interest in the production concession. The remaining 50% working interest in the production concession would be split equally between us and KDL.
Aglen. We have applied to relinquish the Aglen exploration permit, which covers approximately 1,700 acres within the boundaries of the former A-Lovech exploration permit and lies within the boundary of the Stefenetz Concession Area.
Albania
General. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 100% of the interests in three onshore oil fields and one onshore gas field. The following map shows our interests in Albania at December 31, 2015:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2015, we had total net proved reserves of 4,258 Mbbl of oil and 5,527 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 13,062 Mbbl of oil and 14,256 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 9,620 Mbbl of oil and 23,884 Mmcf of natural gas in Albania. In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in Stream to GBC Oil. Stream’s wholly owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Albania, owns all of our former Albanian assets and operations. Prior to the sale of Stream to GBC Oil, TransAtlantic Albania entered into an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which TransAtlantic Albania will assign its Delvina natural gas assets and the Delvina Gas Liabilities to Delvina Gas to be effective immediately upon receipt of required
contractual consents. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required contractual consents. We are currently negotiating a joint venture with a third party for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a joint venture for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas. See “Item 1. Business-Recent Developments.”
Commercial Terms. The following description of the commercial terms in Albania is limited to the Delvina gas field. The Delvina gas field is subject to a License Agreement between Agjencia Kombëtare e Burimeve Natyrore, the Albanian National Agency of Natural Resources (“AKBN”), and Albpetrol, the state owned oil company in Albania, and a Petroleum Agreement with Albpetrol, which together give the owner the right to access and develop the onshore gas field. The License Agreement has a 25-year term, with unlimited five-year renewal options.
The operator is required to submit annual work programs and budgets to Albpetrol each year, including the nature and amount of capital expenditures, which is required to be consistent with the plans of development (“PODs”) for the Delvina gas field approved by AKBN. Significant deviations from the PODs are subject to the approval of AKBN and Albpetrol.
Pursuant to the terms of the Petroleum Agreement, the operator pays a 2% to 7.2% gross over-riding royalty to Albpetrol, which may be paid in kind or cash. In addition, the operator is required to pay a royalty to Albpetrol based on the amount of pre-existing production (“PEP”) from the wells taken over from Albpetrol. The PEP royalty is calculated on a well by well basis and is initially equal to 65% to 70% of the PEP preceding the takeover of the well from Albpetrol. The PEP royalty declines at a rate of 5% per year.
In 2008, a new 10% mineral tax was enacted by the Albanian Ministry of Finance. The new mineral tax is equal to 10% of gross sales after deducting any PEP royalties paid. Under the Petroleum Agreement, any new financial burdens (including new mineral taxes) are to be neutralized by amendments to the Petroleum Agreement. The operator is working with officials from Albpetrol and AKBN to finalize amendments to the Petroleum Agreement to neutralize the 10% mineral tax.
Delvina Field. The Delvina natural gas field was discovered in 1987 and produces natural gas and natural gas liquids from reservoirs at a depth of 2,800 to 3,500 meters from fractured carbonates of Cretaceous-Paleocene age. The Delvina natural gas field is connected to potential markets by an existing pipeline, but needs additional downstream capacity. The field has two previously producing vertical wells, the Delvina D4 and D12 wells.
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following table summarizes our net proved, probable and possible reserves at December 31, 2015.
(1)
In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in Stream to GBC Oil. Stream’s wholly owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Albania, owns all of our former Albanian assets and operations. Prior to the sale of Stream to GBC Oil, TransAtlantic Albania entered into an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which TransAtlantic Albania will assign its Delvina natural gas assets and the Delvina Gas Liabilities to Delvina Gas to be effective immediately upon receipt of required contractual consents. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required contractual consents. We are currently negotiating a joint venture with a third party for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a joint venture for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas. As of December 31, 2015, our Albanian assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale and presented within discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, PV-10 and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2015:
(1)
Includes amounts related to our Albanian assets that were sold in February 2016 As of December 31, 2015, our Albanian assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale and presented within discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2)
The PV-10 value of the estimated future net revenue is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure:
(1)
Includes amounts related to our Albanian assets that were sold in February 2016. As of December 31, 2015, our Albanian assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale and presented within discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following discussion of our proved reserves, proved undeveloped reserves, probable reserves and possible reserves as of December 31, 2015 has not been adjusted to reflect the sale of our Albanian assets in February 2016.
Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved reserves were 18,636 Mboe, a decrease of 14,113 Mboe, or 43.1%, compared to 32,749 Mboe at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in oil prices which caused developed and undeveloped reserves to become uneconomic at an earlier time, and technical revisions on Albanian reserves based on actual performance following the 2015 work program.
At December 31, 2015, we recorded a decrease in proved reserves due to technical revisions of 12,303 Mbbl and 638 Mmcf (12,409 Mboe total). The revision in oil of 12,303 Mbbls was mostly attributable to pricing and economics due to the substantial decline in oil prices. As Brent oil price drops, wells become uneconomic at an earlier time thus reducing future reserves. Approximately 75% of these reductions were attributable to the Albania properties. There were no material revisions due to performance in Turkey. The revision in natural gas of 638 Mmcf was primarily attributable to a reduction in Delvina natural gas reserves of 2,722 Mmcf due to market constraints and a reduced realized price, which was partially offset by an increase in proved natural gas reserves for our Turkey assets of 2,084 Mmcf due to improved performance. The decrease in proved reserves also consisted of sales volumes of 2,066 Mboe in 2015, consisting of 1,651 Mbbls of oil and 2,491 Mmcf of natural gas. The estimated undiscounted capital costs associated with our proved reserves in Turkey is $167.9 million.
At December 31, 2015, we recorded an increase in proved reserves of 362 Mboe through extensions and discoveries. These increases were due to the discovery of productive pay in the Hazro formation in the Bahar oil field.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 7,334 Mboe, a decrease of 3,066 Mboe, or 29.5%, compared to 10,400 Mboe at December 31, 2014. Of this decrease in proved undeveloped reserves, 2,566 Mboe was due to lower pricing and capital constraints forcing a slower development of these locations. All of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 will be developed within five years of the date the reserve was first disclosed as a proved undeveloped reserve. The estimated undiscounted capital costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves in Turkey is $163.1 million of which $1.5 million is expected to be incurred in 2016. In addition, during 2015, we converted 500 Mboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves and incurred $8.6 million of capital expenditures during 2015 to convert such reserves.
The proved undeveloped reserves assume development costs will be funded from future cash flows from operations and financing activities, which may not be sufficient or available at commercially economic terms and could impact the timing of these development activities.
Probable Reserves
Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
Possible Reserves
Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain an outside independent engineering firm to prepare estimates of our proved, probable and possible reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Management has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2015. Senior management reviews and approves our reserves estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of three outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves, and we are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves, using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves presented as of December 31, 2015 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our external engineers. The technical person at DeGolyer and MacNaughton that is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. He has over 32 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with DeGolyer and MacNaughton to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them for the preparation of their reserves estimates. Our vice president of engineering has over 13 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas Tech University.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third-party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Supplemental Information -Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved, probable and possible reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a detailed evaluation of our Selmo, Arpatepe, Bakuk, Molla and Thrace Basin properties in Turkey, our Cakran, Gorisht, Ballsh and Delvina properties in Albania and our West Koynare field in Bulgaria. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that their estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether proved reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under Canadian Law
As a reporting issuer under Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario securities laws, we are required under Canadian law to comply with National Instrument 51-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities” (“NI 51-101”) implemented by the members of the Canadian Securities Administrators in all of our reserves related disclosures. DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated the Company’s reserves as of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the reserves definitions of NI 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluators Handbook (“COGEH”). Our annual oil and natural gas reserves disclosures prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and COGEH and filed in Canada are available at www.sedar.com.
