Item 2. Properties
Our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico, Alabama and Texas. The offshore fields are found in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7,200 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically results in high production rates. The reservoirs in our onshore fields are generally characterized as having low porosity and permeability and require stimulation and artificial lift to produce. The following describes our 10 largest fields as of December 31, 2013, based on quantities of proved reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis in a descending order. At December 31, 2013, these fields accounted for approximately 83% of our proved reserves. Our interests in several of our offshore fields are owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, W&T Energy VI, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, “drilling” in the field descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth, as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SEC’s definition for completion.

Mcfe/d=Thousand cubic feet equivalent per day. Boe/d= barrel of equivalent per day. The amount was determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.

The data for the 2013 Average Daily Equivalent Sales Rate is based on production from the acquisition date of November 5, 2013 to December 31, 2013.
Our Fields
On December 31, 2013 we had two fields of major significance (having proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis). The Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) is located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Below is a description of these fields.
Spraberry Field (Yellow Rose).
The Spraberry field is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We acquired a 100% working interest in approximately 21,900 net acres in connection with the acquisition of the Opal Properties in May 2011. In separate transactions, we acquired approximately 9,500 net acres in 2011 and approximately 2,200 net acres in 2013. We are the operator for these properties. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1935 and extends over several counties in West Texas comprising about 1.6 million acres. The field is 150 miles long and 75 miles wide, and it has undergone much change and expansion over the years, both aerially and vertically. The correlative interval is now over 3,500 feet thick and includes the Clearfork, Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Dean, and Wolfcamp formations. These formations are correlative over the area but are lenticular in nature and vary in thickness, porosity, and permeability even over short distances. The general completion technique includes hydraulic fracturing and installation of sucker rod pumps. During 2013, we drilled 32 additional wells, which included five horizontal wells. During 2012, we drilled 64 additional wells, which included one horizontal well. Cumulative field production through 2013 is approximately 4.6 MMBoe (27.3 Bcfe) from our wells. In 2014, we plan to drill 25 vertical wells and seven horizontal wells. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in the Spraberry field were 38.2 MMBoe (229.3 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013, 31.6 MMBoe (189.8 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012 and 28.1 MMBoe (168.5 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from the Spraberry field for 2013, 2012 and from the acquisition date of May 11, 2011 to December 31, 2011.

MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany).
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2013 is approximately 33.9 MMBoe gross (203.4 Bcfe gross). This field is a sub-salt development with eight productive horizons below salt at depths up to 17,000 feet. In 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan (the “2010 Development Plan”). As a result, in 2011, we drilled and completed one development well and one exploration well. In 2012, two additional wells were sidetracked, one well was drilled and completed, and another well was drilled to target depth. In 2013, the well reaching target depth in 2012 was completed, one well was drilled and completed and we had one well being drilled as of December 31, 2013. All of the wells drilled under the 2010 Development Plan have been successful. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 22.9 MMBoe (137.7 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013, 22.7 MMBoe (136.3 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012 and 20.3 MMBoe (121.7 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.

The following is a description of the remainder of our top 10 properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2013, three of which are located on the conventional shelf and five are located in the deepwater. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of our total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Fairway Field. The Fairway field is comprised of Mobile Bay Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) and located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship in the Fairway field, from Shell in August 2011. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2013, six wells have been drilled, one of which was a replacement well. Cumulative field production through 2013 is approximately 114.5 MMBoe gross (686.9 Bcfe gross). This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. During December 2013, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 14 Bbls of oil per day, 1,024 Bbls of NGLs per day and 16,077 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 3,718 Boe per day (22,309 Mcfe per day).

Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation and we are the operator for the majority of these properties. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2013, 48 wells have been drilled in this field, 30 of which were successful. Cumulative field production through 2013 is approximately 43.0 MMBoe gross (258.1 Bcfe gross). One new well reached target depth in 2011 and began production in 2012. In addition, one workover was performed in 2012. In 2013, we drilled and completed one well, which began production during 2013. During December 2013, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 249 Bbls of oil per day, 297 Bbls of NGLs per day and 14,888 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 3,027 Boe per day (18,160 Mcfe per day).

The field area covers Mississippi Canyon block 243, with a single floating, tension leg production platform on Mississippi Canyon block 243. Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine discovered the field in 2002. We acquired a 100% working interest in the field from Total E&P USA Inc. (“Total E&P”) in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2013 is approximately 23.5 MMBoe gross (141.3 Bcfe gross). This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 9,850 feet. As of December 31, 2013, 30 wells have been drilled, 13 of which have been successful. During 2013, we drilled one well, which began production in 2013, and we drilled another well, that had reached target depth but had not yet been completed as of December 31, 2013. During December 2013, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 1,981 Bbls of oil per day, 540 Bbls of NGLs per day and 15,576 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 5,117 Boe per day (30,705 Mcfe per day).
Main Pass 98 Field. Main Pass 98 field consists of Main Pass blocks 98 and 180. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 55 miles east of Venice in 91 feet of water. We acquired our 100% working interest in these blocks from NCX Co LLC in 2009. The field produces from low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands located between two merging, generally south dipping faults.

Proved Reserves
Our estimated proved reserves totaled 117.7 MMBoe (705.9 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013. The mix by product was 50% oil, 13% NGLs and 37% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below. Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant.
Our proved reserves are summarized below. These reserve amounts are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies.
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet equivalent
(1)
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2013 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2013. Prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials. For oil, the West Texas Intermediate posted price was used in the calculation and, after adjustments, a price of $99.65 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the oil price using SEC guidance. The NGLs price of $35.21 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was used in the calculation and the adjusted price of $3.80 per Mcf was used in computing the amounts above. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production, development costs and ARO are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2)
Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3)
We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves increased more than production, resulting in a slight net increase, and were 117.7 MMBoe (705.9 Bcfe) at December 31, 2013 compared to 117.5 MMBoe (705.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2012. The change between periods is primarily as a result of extensions and discoveries of 20.2 MMBoe (121.0 Bcfe) due to the completion of eight successful exploratory wells (gross), utilizing 40 acre down-spacing onshore and joint interest activity. The extensions and discoveries were primarily in the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) (12.6 MMBoe /75.4 Bcfe), the Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany) (4.2MMBoe/25.3 Bcfe) and the Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend) (1.9MMBoe/11.5 Bcfe). For the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), the increase in proved reserves was primarily due to six exploration wells being completed, further development of the field from 40 acre down-spacing, movement of reserves from possible reserves to proved due to drilling activity by us and others and purchase of additional acreage in the field. For the Ship Shoal 349/359 field, the increase in proved reserves was from the successful drilling and completion of an exploratory well. The increase at the Mississippi Canyon 698 field was due to a successful exploration well. Estimated proved reserves also increased from the acquisition of Callon Properties discussed in Item 1, Business, which added 2.1 MMBoe (12.7 Bfe). Reserves decreased from revisions of previous estimates by 3.8 MMBoe (22.8 Bcfe) primarily at our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) (4.9 MMBoe/29.6 Bcfe) and our High Island 21/22 field (2.3 MBoe/13.9 Bcfe) our due to performance, partially offset by increases due to price changes (1.9 MBoe/11.3 Bcfe). The sale of interests in three fields resulted in a decrease of 0.5 MMBoe (3.2 Bcfe). Decreases due to production were 18.0 MMBoe (107.9 Bcfe). See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2013. See Financial Statements - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2013 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 25 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 29 years. He has over 36 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 22 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Reservoir Engineering Director has served in that capacity since 2013, as Reservoir Engineering Manager since 2006, and as Staff Reservoir Engineer upon joining the Company in 2004. Prior to joining the Company, he served as a Reservoir Engineer at Shell, then VP of Reservoir Engineering at Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and later as Manager Acquisitions Engineering at Matrix Oil & Gas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from Iowa State University in 1972.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
·
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
·
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
·
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
·
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert Bbl to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2013 were estimated at $910.0 million.
The following table presents our PUDs by field (in MMBoe):
The following table presents a reconciliation of our PUDs (in MMBoe):
Volume measurements:
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Activity related to PUDs in 2013:
·
During 2013, we drilled numerous development wells that converted PUDs to proved developed reserves (“PDs”) and spent $270.4 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2013 allowed conversion of approximately 47% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2012 to PD’s as of December 31, 2013.
·
At our Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany), we drilled and completed the SS 359 A14 BP2 well, which resulted in the conversion of all of the PUDs existing at 2012 to PDs in 2013. The SS 359 A14 BP2 well was the fifth well drilled under our 2010 Development Plan. As of December 31, 2013, we were in the process of drilling our sixth well (SS 359 A015) under this multi-well program. This multi-well program is expected to continue into 2014 and beyond. Also, as a result of our successful drilling program, one new PUD location was added during 2013.
·
The PUDs at our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) and our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo) were obtained through acquisitions in 2010. We drilled and completed one development well (MC 243 A2 ST2 BP2) at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), which moved PUDs to PDs. Also, one new PUD location was added during 2013. Development of these two fields is expected to continue into future years.
·
PUDs at our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) were obtained primarily through an acquisition in 2011. We drilled and completed 33 development wells, which moved PUDs to PDs. In addition, PUDs were decreased due to certain wells being evaluated as uneconomical due to performance and for technical reasons. PUDs were increased due to exploration drilling activity, both by us and other companies, and also from additions related to 40 acre down-spacing. Our drilling plans for 2014 include an active drilling program in the Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) and we expect to continue our drilling activity beyond 2014.
·
In the High Island 21/22 field, we drilled and completed the HI 0021 A1 BP1 well, which initially resulted in the conversion of all the PUDs to PDs. Subsequently, these PDs were removed from proved reserves due to well performance.
·
The additional PUDs at the Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend) were from our joint interest ownership in the non-operated field and are related to the MC 698 #1 well, which was drilled in 2012.
Activity related to PUDs in 2012:
·
During 2012, we drilled numerous development wells that converted PUDs to PDs and spent $263.6 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2012 allowed conversion of approximately 58% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2011 to PD’s as of December 31, 2012.
·
At our Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany), we completed one well, (SS 359 A5 ST) and two additional wells were side tracked. As of December 31, 2012, we were in the process of completing the SS 359 A9 ST well, which moved additional reserves from PUDs to PDs.
·
We completed one well (MC 243 A4 ST) at Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) in 2012.

At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), we completed 53 development wells and 11 exploration wells. One of the wells completed was a horizontal well and two other horizontal wells reached target depth in 2012, which proved the concept and allowed additional horizontal PUD locations to be booked. Additionally, wells completed in 2011 and 2012 proved that the concept of down spacing to 40-acres was viable in a portion of the field, allowing the conversion of certain unproven locations to PUDs in 2012.
·
In the High Island 21/22 field, a field study demonstrated that additional reserves could be recovered by drilling a replacement for a well that had experienced a mechanical failure. This allowed unproved reserves in 2011 to be reclassified as proved reserves in 2012.
See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements - Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the Spraberry, Ship Shoal 349/359, Mississippi Canyon 243 and Viosca Knoll 823 fields.
We believe that we will be able to develop all but 1.3 MMBoe of the reserves classified as PUDs, out of a total of 31.6 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31, 2013, within five years from the date such reserves were initially recorded. The exception is at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) where the field is being developed using a single floating tension leg platform requiring an extended sequential development plan. The platform cannot support a rig that would allow additional wells to be drilled, but can support a rig to allow sidetracking of wells. These PUDs were originally recorded in our reserves as of December 31, 2010. The development of the 1.3 MMBoe of PUDs will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. Based on the latest reserve report, a well is expected to be drilled to develop the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) PUDs in 2016.
Our capital budget for 2014 for development is $233.0 million, split 76% offshore and 24% onshore. The capital allocated to our development activities will assist us in converting the PUDs to PDs.
Acreage
The following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2013. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 57% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 13% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, 78,113 net acres (25%) of the total 315,991 net undeveloped offshore acres could expire in 2014, 57,166 net acres (18%) could expire in 2015, 33,228 net acres (11%) could expire in 2016, 80,332 net acres (25%) could expire in 2017, and 67,152 net acres (21%) could expire in 2018 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, our rights to approximately 146,436 net acres of the total 158,310 net undeveloped onshore acres (93%) could expire in 2014 without additional drilling, 9,662 net acres (6%) could expire in 2015 and 2,212 net acres (1%) could expire in 2016. There are 141,109 net acres of the undeveloped onshore leasehold that can be extended by drilling two additional wells in 2014 and further extended by additional operations or production in future years. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2014 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net offshore acreage decreased 49,387 net acres (6%) from December 31, 2012 and our net onshore acreage decreased 1,493 net acres (1%) from December 31, 2012. The decrease in our net offshore acreage was primarily due to certain offshore leases that terminated, partially offset by acreage added from the Callon Properties acquisition and other offshore property interests acquired through purchase.
Production
For the years 2013, 2012 and 2011, our net daily production averaged 295.7 MMcfe, 280.9 MMcfe and 278.2 MMcfe, respectively. Production increased in 2013 from 2012 and in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2011 and increases in the Ship Shoal 349 field attributable to development activities, partially offset by decreases related to storms, pipeline shutdowns and natural reservoir declines.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three years.
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Refer to the descriptions of our 10 largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose) and Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany) over the past three fiscal years, each of which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 of this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2013 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest.
Offshore Wells
Onshore Wells
All Productive Wells (1)
(1)
Includes five gross (3.2 net) oil wells and seven gross (4.6 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 in our onshore operations. In 2013, we increased the onshore-horizontal drilling activity compared to 2012, which take longer to drill and are more expensive on a per well basis compared to vertical wells. Our onshore drilling activity is primarily in the Spraberry field, which was acquired by acquisition in May 2011, coupled with additional leasehold interests acquired in 2011 and 2013.
The tables below are based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine productive wells drilled.
Development Drilling
The following table sets forth information related to our development wells drilled over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross development wells drilled during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively.
Exploration Drilling
The following table sets forth information related to our exploration drilling over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our gross exploration wells drilled during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 89%, 96% and 94%, respectively.
Recent Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth 2014 drilling activity to February 15, 2014.
As of February 15, 2014, we were in the process of drilling and/or completing on a gross well basis two offshore exploration wells, four onshore exploration wells and three onshore development wells.
Capital Expenditures
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. For 2013, our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and equipment of $634.4 million included $82.7 million for acquisitions, $198.7 million for exploration activities, $308.3 million for development activities and $44.6 million for seismic, capitalized interest and other leasehold costs.
