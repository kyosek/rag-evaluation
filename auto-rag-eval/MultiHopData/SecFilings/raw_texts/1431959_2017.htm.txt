Investment in oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is detailed as follows:
Property acquisition costs presented above exclude interest capitalized into the full cost pool of $1,010,868 in 2017 and $215,938 in 2016.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Property acquisition cost relates to the Company’s acquisition of additional working interests in the Hazel Project in west Texas and the acquisition of the Warwink Project, also in west Texas. The development costs include work in the Orogrande and Hazel projects in west Texas. No development costs were incurred for Oklahoma properties in 2017.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Reserve Estimates
SEC Case. The following tables sets forth, as of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, the estimated present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10%) of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes (PV-10) and after future income taxes (Standardized Measure) of our proved reserves and our estimated net probable oil and natural gas reserves, each prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with assumptions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of our reserves are located in the United States.
The PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies. We believe investors and creditors use PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and neither it nor the Standardized Measure is intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions at December 31, 2017. For purposes of determining prices, we used the average of prices received for each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, adjusted for quality and location differences, which was $48.53 per barrel of oil and $2.58 per MCF of gas. This average historical price is not a prediction of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
The upward revisions of previous estimates from 2016 to 2017 of proved producing reserves of 900 BBLS and 20,500 MCF results primarily from 2017 reserve report calculations for the Company’s properties driven by industry conditions and the change in the proportional quantities of oil and gas in production from the Judy well in Oklahoma from 2016 to 2017.
Reserve values as of December 31, 2017 are related to a single producing well in Oklahoma - the Judy well in the Prairie Grove AMI.
BOE equivalents are determined by combining barrels of oil with MCF of gas divided by six.
Standardized Measure of Oil & Gas Quantities - Volume Rollforward
Year Ended December 31, 2017
The following table sets forth the Company’s net proved reserves, including the changes therein, and proved
developed reserves:
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, both proved and probable reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows, and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
In estimating probable reserves, it should be noted that those reserve estimates inherently involve greater risk and uncertainty than estimates of proved reserves. While analysis of geoscience and engineering data provides reasonable certainty that proved reserves can be economically producible from known formations under existing conditions and within a reasonable time, probable reserves involve less certainty than reserves with a higher classification due to less data to support their ultimate recovery. Probable reserves have not been discounted for the additional risk associated with future recovery. Prospective investors should be aware that as the categories of reserves decrease with certainty, the risk of recovering reserves at the PV-10 calculation increases. The reserves and net present worth discounted at 10% relating to the different categories of proved and probable have not been adjusted for risk due to their uncertainty of recovery and thus are not comparable and should not be summed into total amounts.
Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies
The reserve estimates, including PV-10 estimates, set forth above were prepared by PeTech Enterprises, Inc. for the Company’s Properties in Oklahoma. A copy of their full reports with regard to our reserves is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K. These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
We do not have any employees with specific reservoir engineering qualifications in the company. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer worked closely with PeTech Enterprises Inc. in connection with their preparation of our reserve estimates, including assessing the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the methods and assumptions used in this process.
PeTech Enterprises, Inc. (“PeTech”), who provided 2017 reserve estimates for our Oklahoma Properties, is a Texas based family owned oil and gas production and investment company that provides reservoir engineering, economics and valuation support to energy banks, energy companies and law firms as an expert witness. PeTech has been in business since 1982. Amiel David is the President of PeTech and the primary technical person in charge of the estimates of reserves and associated cash flow and economics on behalf of the company for the results presented in its reserves report to us. He has a PhD in Petroleum Engineering from Stanford University. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas (PE #50970), granted in 1982, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Proved Nonproducing Reserves
As of December 31, 2017, our proved nonproducing reserves totaled -0- barrels of oil equivalents (BOE) compared to 124,733 as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of 124,733 BOE. The proved nonproducing reserves at December 31, 2016 were associated with our Hunton project Judy and Loki wells located in Oklahoma. The Loki well was determined to be uneconomic at 12/31/17. The change consists of a decrease of 124,733 BOE based on the 2017 engineering. These numbers are taken from the third party reserves studies prepared by PeTech for 2017 and 2016. The net reserves change associated with nonproducing reserves from this property is a decrease of approximately 46,800 bbls of oil and a decrease of approximately 467,600 Mcf of gas (calculated with a gas-oil equivalency factor of six). The Company does not intend to pursue any behind pipe reserves which may exist and there is no additional acreage available to consider future development.
We made investments and development progress during 2017 to further develop proved producing reserves in the Orogrande and Hazel Projects in the Permian Basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2017 three test wells have been developed in the Orogrande Project and four test wells have been developed in the Hazel Project. Although the Hazel wells have each produced a quantity of oil (the Flying B #3 is in continuous production at December 31, 2017), the wells remain categorized as test wells for 2017.
Our current drilling plans, subject to sufficient capital resources and the periodic evaluation of interim drilling results and other potential investment opportunities, include drilling additional evaluation wells in the Orogrande and Hazel AMI’s to continue to derisk the prospects and obtain initial production from the development efforts. The next scheduled well in the Hazel Project is scheduled to spud near the end of May, 2018. The first horizontal well in the Orogrande Project was spudded in November, 2017 and was in development as of December 31, 2017.
Production, Price, and Production Cost History
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we produced and sold 10,391 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $52.37 per bbl. We produced and sold 9,259 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $2.84 per MCF. Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $14.51 per BOE. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $7.39 per BOE.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced and sold 8,488 barrels of oil net to our interest at an average sale price of $34.15 per bbl. We produced and sold 36,513 MCF of gas net to our interest at an average sales price of $1.77 per MCF. Our average production cost including lease operating expenses and direct production taxes was $22.54 per BOE. Our depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense was $43.67 per BOE.
The changes in production were impacted by the divesture of the Oklahoma Cimmaron and the Texas Marcelina properties early in 2016 and by the production from the Flying B #3 well in the Hazel Project beginning in late September, 2017.
Our 2017 production was from properties located in central Oklahoma and in west Texas. Reserves at the beginning of 2017 from central Oklahoma comprised more than 15% of total reserves. For 2017, approximately 2,000 BOE was produced in Oklahoma and 9,935 BOE produced in Texas, or 17% from Oklahoma and 83% from wells in west Texas.

Current Projects
As of December 31, 2017 the Company had interests in four oil and gas projects:, the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas, and the Hazel Project in Sterling, Tom Green, and Irion Counties, Texas, the Winkler Project in Winkler County, Texas, and the Hunton wells in partnership with Husky Ventures in Central Oklahoma .
Orogrande Project, West Texas
On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2017, leases covering 133,000 acres remain in effect. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we issued 868,750 shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a total of $100,000 in geologic origination fees to third parties. Additionally, Mr. McCabe has, at his option, a 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a participation and development agreement. All drilling obligations through December 31, 2017 have been met.
On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“HOC”), entered into a Farmout Agreement by and between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP (“Pandora”), Founders Oil & Gas, LLC (“Founders”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes) for the entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The Farmout Agreement provided for Founders to earn from HOC and Pandora (collectively, the “Farmor”) an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by Founder’s spending a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the following two years.
Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610 - 1989 Model Form Operating Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures) (“JOA”) also entered into on September 23, 2015, Founders is designated as operator of the leases.
On March 22, 2017, the Company, along with Founders, their operating partner, signed a Drilling and Development Unit (DDU) Agreement with University Lands on its Orogrande Basin Project. The agreement has an effective date of January 1, 2017 and required a payment from both Torchlight and Founders of $335,323 as part of the extension fee. Torchlight's portion of the fee was paid by Founders in April 2017 and will be deducted from the required spud fee payable to Torchlight at commencement of the next well drilled.
The DDU agreement allows for all 192 existing leases covering the 133,000 net acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one lease for development purposes. The time to drill on the unit is extended through April of 2023 on the first extension. The agreement also grants exclusive right to continue through April of 2028 if compliance with the agreement is met and extension fee associated with the additional time paid. The Company's drilling obligations begin with one well in the first year, and increase to five wells per year by year 2023. The drilling obligation set is a minimum requirement and may be exceeded if acceleration is desired. The DDU agreement replaces all prior agreements and will govern future drilling obligations on the lease.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
The Orogrande Rich A-11 test well that was drilled by Torchlight in second quarter, 2015 was evaluated and numerous scientific tests were performed to provide key data for the field development thesis. Future utility of this well may be conversion to a salt water disposal well in the course of further development of the Orogrande acreage.
The second test well, the University Founders B-19 #1, was spudded on April 24, 2016 and drilled in second quarter, 2016. The well successfully pumped down completion fluid in the third quarter of 2016 and indications of hydrocarbons were seen at the surface on this second Orogrande Project test well. Future utility of this well may be conversion to a salt water disposal well in the course of further development of the Orogrande acreage.
During the fourth quarter, 2017, the Company took back operational control from Founders Oil and Gas on the Orogrande Basin Project. Torchlight was joined by Wolfbone Investments, LLC, ("Wolfbone"), a company owned by Greg McCabe, Torchlight's Chairman. The two entities have entered into an Assignment of Farmout Agreement with Founders and will share the remaining commitments under the prior agreement with Founders. All original provisions of Torchlight's carried interest will remain in place including reimbursement to the Company on each wellbore. Founders will remain a 9.5% Working Interest owner in the project under the agreement for the $9.5 million it has spent to date and be carried until the remaining $40.5 million is spent by Wolfbone and Torchlight, with each contributing 50% of that capital spend, under the existing agreement. Torchlight's interest in the Project thereby increased by 20.25% Working Interest to a total of 67.75% and Wolfbone now owns 20.25%.
Founders will operate a newly drilled well called the University Founders #A25 with supervision from Torchlight and its Partners. The University Founders #A25 was spudded on the 27th of November and satisfies the obligation under the University Lands D&D Agreement. Once the #A25 is completed Torchlight will assume full operational control including managing drilling plans and timing for all future wells drilled in the Project.
Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
Effective April 1, 2016, Torchlight Energy Inc. acquired from McCabe Petroleum Corporation, a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin in exchange for 1,500,000 warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 for five years and a back-in after payout of a 25% working interest to the seller.
Initial development of the first well on the property, the Flying B Ranch #1, began July 10, 2016 and development continued through September 30, 2016. This well is classified as a test well in the development pursuit of the Hazel Project. It is anticipated that this wellbore will be utilized as a salt water disposal well in support of future development.
In October, 2016, the holders of the Company's Series C Preferred shares (which were issued in July, 2016) elected to convert into a 33.33% Working Interest in the Company's Hazel Project, reducing Torchlight's ownership from 66.66% to a 33.33% Working Interest.
On December 27, 2016, drilling activities commenced on the second Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #2. The well is a vertical test similar to the Company's first Hazel Project well, the Flying B Ranch #1. Recompletion in an alternative geological formation for this well was performed during the three months ended September 30, 2017 however the results were uneconomic for continuing production. It is anticipated that this wellbore will be utilized as a salt water disposal well in support of future development.
The Company commenced planning to drill a horizontal well in the Project in June, 2017 in compliance with the continuous drilling obligation. The well, the Flying B Ranch #3, was spudded on June 10, 2017. The well was completed and began production in late September, 2017.
Acquisition of Additional Interests in Hazel Project
On January 30, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Acquisition Corporation, a Texas corporation (“TAC”), entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Plan of Merger with Line Drive Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Line Drive”), under which agreements TAC merged with and into Line Drive and the separate existence of TAC ceased, with Line Drive being the surviving organization and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Line Drive, which was wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman, owned certain assets and securities, including approximately 40.66% of 12,000 gross acres in the Hazel Project and 521,739 warrants to purchase our common stock (which warrants had been assigned by Mr. McCabe to Line Drive). Under the merger transaction, our shares of common stock of TAC converted into a membership interest of Line Drive, the membership interest in Line Drive held by Mr. McCabe immediately prior to the transaction ceased to exist, and we issued Mr. McCabe 3,301,739 restricted shares of common stock as consideration therefor. Immediately after closing, the 521,739 warrants held by Line Drive were cancelled, which warrants had an exercise price of $1.40 per share and an expiration date of June 9, 2020. A Certificate of Merger for the merger transaction was filed with the Secretary of State of Texas on January 31, 2017. Subsequent to the closing the name of Line Drive Energy, LLC was changed to Torchlight Hazel, LLC.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - continued
Also on January 30, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“TEI”), entered into and closed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Wolfbone Investments, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Wolfbone”) which is wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman. Under the agreement, TEI acquired certain of Wolfbone’s Hazel Project assets, including its interest in the Flying B Ranch #1 well and the 40 acre unit surrounding the well, for consideration of $415,000, and additionally, Wolfbone caused to be cancelled a total of 2,780,000 warrants to purchase our common stock, including 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe, and 1,280,000 warrants held by Green Hill Minerals, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe’s son, which warrant cancellations were effected through certain Warrant Cancellation Agreements. The 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation had an exercise price of $1.00 per share and an expiration date of April 4, 2021. The warrants held by Green Hill Minerals included 100,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.73 and an expiration date of September 30, 2018 and 1,180,000 warrants with an exercise price of $0.70 and an expiration date of February 15, 2020.
Since Mr. McCabe held the controlling interest in both Line Drive and Wolfbone Investments, LLC, the transactions were combined for accounting purposes. The working interest in the Hazel Project was the only asset held by Line Drive. The warrant cancellation was treated in the aggregate as an exercise of the warrants with the transfer of the working interests as the consideration. The Company recorded the transactions as an increase in its investment in the Hazel project working interests of $3,644,431 which is equal to the exercise price of the warrants plus the cash paid to Wolfbone.
Upon the closing of the transactions, the Company’s working interest in the Hazel project increased by 40.66% to a total ownership of 74%.
Effective June 1, 2017, the Company acquired an additional 6% working interest from unrelated working interest owners in exchange for 268,656 shares of common stock valued at $373,430, increasing its working interest in the Hazel project to 80%.
Winkler Project, Winkler County, Texas
On December 1, 2017, the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization that we and our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Wolfbone Properties, Inc., a Texas corporation (“TWP”), entered into with McCabe Petroleum Corporation, a Texas corporation (“MPC”), and Warwink Properties, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Warwink Properties”) closed. Under the agreement, which was entered into on November 14, 2017, TWP merged with and into Warwink Properties and the separate existence of TWP ceased, with Warwink Properties becoming the surviving organization and our wholly-owned subsidiary. Warwink Properties was wholly owned by MPC which is wholly owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman. Warwink Properties owns certain assets, including a 10.71875% working interest in 640 acres in Winkler County, Texas. At closing of the merger transaction, our shares of common stock of TWP converted into a membership interest of Warwink Properties, the membership interest in Warwink Properties held by MPC ceased to exist, and we issued MPC 2,500,000 restricted shares of common stock as consideration. Also on December 1, 2017, MPC closed its transaction with MECO IV, LLC (“MECO”) for the purchase and sale of certain assets as contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November 9, 2017 (the “MECO PSA”), to which we are not a party. Under the MECO PSA, Warwink Properties received a carry from MECO (through the tanks) of up to $1,475,000 in the next well drilled on the Winkler County leases. A Certificate of Merger for the merger transaction was filed with the Secretary of State of Texas on December 5, 2017.
Also on December 1, 2017, the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“TEI”), entered into with MPC closed. Under the Purchase Agreement, which was entered into on November 14, 2017, TEI acquired beneficial ownership of certain of MPC’s assets, including acreage and wellbores located in Ward County, Texas (the “Ward County Assets”). As consideration under the Purchase Agreement, at closing TEI issued to MPC an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $3,250,000, payable in monthly installments of interest only beginning on January 1, 2018, at the rate of 5% per annum, with the entire principal amount together with all accrued interest due and payable on December 31, 2020. In connection with TEI’s acquisition of beneficial ownership in the Ward County Assets, MPC sold those same assets, on behalf of TEI, to MECO at closing of the MECO PSA, and accordingly, TEI received $3,250,000 in cash for its beneficial interest in the Ward County Assets. Additionally, at closing of the MECO PSA, MPC paid TEI a performance fee of $2,781,500 in cash as compensation for TEI’s marketing and selling the Winkler County assets of MPC and the Ward County Assets as a package to MECO.
