ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2011 we owned interests in producing oil and natural gas properties in 498 fields in the Permian Basin, Texas Panhandle, Wyoming, Oklahoma and several other states, operated 2,473 gross productive wells and owned non-operated interests in 3,483 gross productive wells. The following table sets forth information about our proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2011. The standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. For a definition of “standardized measure,” please see the glossary of terms at the beginning of this annual report on Form 10-K.
____________________
(a)
Reserves as of December 31, 2011 divided by annualized fourth quarter production volumes.
(b)
Texas margin taxes and the federal income taxes associated with a corporate subsidiary have not been deducted from future production revenues in the calculation of the standardized measure as the impact of these taxes would not have a significant effect on the calculated standardized measure.
(c)
As the Spraberry/War San field contains 11.1 MMBoe, or 17.5% of total proved reserves of 63.4 MMBoe, the following table presents the production, by product, for the Spraberry/War San field for the last three fiscal years:
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Our most significant fields are the Spraberry/War San, Texas Panhandle, East Binger, Jordan, Langlie Mattix, Denton, Fourbear/Fourbear Frank’s Fork and Farmer. As of December 31, 2011, these eight fields accounted for approximately 51% of our Standardized Measure and 49% of our total estimated proved reserves.
Spraberry/War San Field. The Spraberry/War San field is located in Andrews, Howard, Midland, Martin, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas. This Spraberry/War San field summary includes wells in the War San field which produce from the same formations and in the same area as our Spraberry field wells. This field produces from
Spraberry and Wolfcamp age formations from 5,000 to 11,000 feet. We operate 200 active wells (198 producing, 2 injecting) in this field with working interests ranging from 5.5% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 4.2% to 90.8%. We also own another 122 non-operated wells (120 producing, 2 injecting). As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Spraberry/War San field contained 11.1 MMBoe (67% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $217.5 million. The average net daily production from this field was 2,183 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 13.9 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
30 wells were drilled on Legacy Reserves’ properties in the Spraberry/War San field in 2011. We have identified 65 more proved undeveloped projects, primarily 40-acre infill drilling locations, and 15 behind-pipe or proved developed non-producing re-completion projects in this field.
Texas Panhandle Fields. The Texas Panhandle fields are located in Carson, Gray, Hartley, Hutchinson, Moore, Potter, Sherman and Wheeler Counties, Texas.

There have been a total of 26 20-acre infill wells drilled on the Unit in four different drilling programs from 1983 to 2007. All four 20-acre infill drilling programs were successful. We have 23 more proved undeveloped locations and an additional 41 unproved 20-acre locations.
Denton Field. The Denton field is located in Lea County, New Mexico. The Devonian Formation at depths of 11,000 to 12,700 feet is the primary reservoir in the Denton field. Additional production has been developed in the Wolfcamp Formation at depths of 8,900 to 9,600 feet. We operate 21 wells in the Denton field with working interests ranging from 86% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 75.1% to 87.5%. We also own another nine wells (seven producing, two injecting) with a 15% average non-operated working interest and a 13.1% average net revenue interest. As of December 31, 2011, our properties in the Denton field contained 2.2 MMBoe (82% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $39.0 million. The average net daily production from this field was 474 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2011. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for the field is 12.6 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
Fourbear/Fourbear Frank’s Fork Fields. The Fourbear and Fourbear Frank’s Fork fields are located in Park County in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. These fields produce from multiple formations which primarily include the Pennsylvanian age Phosphoria and Tensleep formations from 3,000 to 4,000 feet.

Oil and Natural Gas Data
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth a summary of information related to our estimated net proved reserves as of the dates indicated based on reserve reports prepared by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. (“LaRoche”). The estimates of net proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency. Standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The following information represents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. These reserve estimates have been prepared in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and accounting standards using current costs and the average annual prices based on the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2011 was based on an un-weighted 12-month average West Texas Intermediate posted price of $92.71 per Bbl for oil and a NYMEX natural gas price of $4.12 per MMBtu. See the table below.
____________________
(a)
Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (using current costs and the average annual prices based on the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general administrative expenses and debt service or to depletion, depreciation and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. For the purpose of calculating the standardized measure, the costs and prices are unescalated. Because we are a limited partnership that allocates our taxable income to our unitholders, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been provided for in the calculation of standardized measure. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Cash Flow from Operations.”
(b)
Oil and natural gas prices as of each date are the average annual prices based on the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, with these representative prices adjusted by property to arrive at the appropriate net sales price, which is held constant over the economic life of the property.
Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure is required for re-completion.
The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Please read “Risk Factors - Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.” Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Standardized
measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by Financial Accounting Standard Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
From time to time, we engage LaRoche to prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of properties that we are considering purchasing. Neither LaRoche nor any of its employees have any interest in those properties, and the compensation for these engagements is not contingent on their estimates of reserves and future net revenues for the subject properties. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid LaRoche approximately $337,372, $151,176 and $141,666, respectively, for such reserve and economic evaluations.
Internal Control over Reserve Estimations
Legacy's proved reserves are estimated at the well or unit level and compiled for reporting purposes by Legacy's reservoir engineering staff, none of whom are members of Legacy's operating teams nor are they managed by members of Legacy's operating teams. Legacy maintains internal evaluations of its reserves in a secure engineering database. Legacy's reservoir engineering staff meets with LaRoche periodically throughout the year to discuss assumptions and methods used in the reserve estimation process. Legacy provides LaRoche information on all properties acquired during the year for addition to Legacy’s reserve report. LaRoche updates production data from public sources and then modifies production forecasts for all properties as necessary. Legacy provides to LaRoche lease operating statement data at the property level from Legacy’s accounting system for estimation of each property’s operating expenses, price differentials, gas shrinkage and NGL yield. Legacy's reserve engineering staff provides all changes to Legacy’s ownership interests in the properties to LaRoche for input into the reserve report. Legacy provides information on all capital projects completed during the year as well as changes in the expected timing of future capital projects. Legacy provides updated capital project cost estimates and abandonment cost and salvage value estimates. Legacy's internal engineering staff coordinates with Legacy's accounting and other departments and works closely with LaRoche to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to LaRoche for its reserve estimation process. All of the reserve information in Legacy's secure reserve engineering data base is provided to LaRoche. After evaluating and inputting all information provided by Legacy, LaRoche, as independent third-party petroleum engineers, provides Legacy with a preliminary reserve report which Legacy's engineering staff and its President and Chief Financial Officer review for accuracy and completeness with an emphasis on ownership interest, capital spending and timing, expense estimates and production curves. After considering comments provided by Legacy, LaRoche completes and publishes the final reserve report. Legacy's engineering staff, in coordination with Legacy's accounting department and President and Chief Financial Officer, ensure that the information derived from LaRoche's reports is properly disclosed in our filings.
Legacy’s Acquisition and Planning Manager is the reservoir engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates by the third-party engineering firm, LaRoche. He has held a wide variety of technical and supervisory positions during a 34-year career with four publicly traded oil and natural gas producing companies, including Legacy. He has over 24 years of SEC reserve report preparation experience in addition to continuing education courses on reserve estimation and reporting, including one in 2009 covering the effect of the SEC’s Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. For the professional qualifications of the primary person responsible for the third party reserve evaluation, please see the last paragraph of Exhibit 99.1 - Summary Reserve Report from LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth a summary of unaudited information with respect to our production and sales of oil and natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
____________________
(a)
Reflects the production and operating results of the Wyoming and COG acquisition properties from the closing dates of such acquisitions on February 17, 2010 and December 22, 2010, respectively, through December 31, 2010.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2011 relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2011 relating to our leasehold acreage.
____________________
(a)
Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells or wells capable of production.
(b)
Undeveloped acres are acres which are not held by commercially producing wells, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. All of our proved undeveloped locations are located on acreage currently held by production.
(c)
A gross acre is an acre in which we own a working interest. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which we own a working interest.
(d)
A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed by Legacy during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The drilling activities associated with the properties acquired in the Wyoming acquisition (February 17, 2010) and the COG acquisition (December 22, 2010) are included subsequent to those acquisition dates. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the numbers of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.
Summary of Development Projects
We are currently pursuing an active development strategy. We estimate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2012 will be approximately $62 million for development drilling, re-completions and fracture stimulation and other development related projects to implement this strategy. This capital budget includes, but is not limited to, the drilling of 52 gross (28.0 net) development wells and execution of 24 gross (18.1 net) re-completions and fracture simulations projects, all of which are included in our SEC reserve report. All of these development projects are located in the Permian Basin, Texas Panhandle, Wyoming and the East Binger field in Oklahoma. We will consider adjustments to this capital program based on our assessment of additional development opportunities that are identified during the year and the cash available to invest in our development projects.
Operations
General
We operate approximately 73% of our net daily production of oil and natural gas. We design and manage the development, re-completion or workover for all of the wells we operate and supervise operation and maintenance activities. We do not own drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties we operate except for two single pole pulling units and a cable tool rig used for shallow well work in the Texas Panhandle fields. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ drilling, production, and reservoir engineers, contract geologists and other specialists who have worked and will work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. We also employ field operating personnel including production superintendents, production foremen, production technicians and lease operators. We charge the non-operating partners an operating fee for operating the wells, typically on a fee per well-operated basis. Our non-operated wells are managed by third-party operators who are typically independent oil and natural gas companies.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. In the Permian Basin, this amount generally ranges from 12.5% to 33.7%, resulting in an 87.5% to 66.3% net revenue interest to us. Most of our leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments.
South Justis Unit Operating Agreement
In connection with our acquisition of the South Justis Unit from Henry Holding LP on June 29, 2006, we became the successor in interest to Henry Holding LP as unit operator under the Unit Operating Agreement. As unit operator, we are entitled to receive from the other working interest owners a per well operating fee which was initially anticipated to be an aggregate of $1.7 million annually and is subject to an annual cost escalator. Under the terms of the Unit Agreement, we may be removed as unit operator upon default or failure to perform our duties by a vote of two or more working interest owners representing at least 80% of the working interest other than the interest held by us. In the event that we transfer our working interest ownership, we will be removed as unit operator.
Derivative Activity
We enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties with respect to oil, NGL and natural gas prices to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. The majority of our derivative contracts are in the form of fixed price swaps for NYMEX WTI oil, West Texas Waha natural gas, ANR-Oklahoma natural gas and Rocky Mountain CIG natural gas. Additionally, we have sold two call options related to an existing WTI oil swap. These swap related options (“swaptions”) allow the counterparty to extend the contract covering calendar year 2011 to either 2012, 2013 or both. The counterparty exercised the option covering calendar year 2012 on December 30, 2011 and must exercise or decline the option
covering calendar year 2013 on December 31, 2012. We have also entered into a NYMEX WTI oil collar that combines a long put option or “floor” with a short call option or “ceiling”, as well as multiple NYMEX WTI oil derivative three-way collar contracts. Each three-way contract combines a short call, a long put and a short put. The use of the short put allows us to buy a put and sell a call at higher prices, thus establishing a higher ceiling and limiting our exposure to future settlement payments while also restricting our downside risk. Like a collar, we receive the short call price (net) if the market price is above the short call price, and we receive the market price if the market price is in between the short call and long put prices. Unlike a collar, however, if the market price is below the price of the long put, we receive the long put price only if the market price is still above the short put price. If the market price has fallen below the short put price, we receive the NYMEX WTI market price plus the spread between the short put and the long put prices. We also enter into derivative transactions with respect to LIBOR interest rates to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates. All of our interest rate derivative transactions are LIBOR interest rate swaps, which do not require option premiums. Our derivatives swap floating LIBOR rates for fixed rates. All of our derivative counterparties are members of our bank group. For a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities, please read “Business - Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Activities,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cash Flow from Operations” and “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title opinions have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties.
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this document.
