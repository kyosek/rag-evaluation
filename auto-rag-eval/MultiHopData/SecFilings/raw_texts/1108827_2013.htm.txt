ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Exploration and Production - QEP Energy
QEP's exploration and production business is conducted through QEP Energy in two core regions - the Northern Region (including the states of Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and North Dakota) and the Southern Region (including the states of Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana).
Northern Region
Pinedale
QEP's largest property, in terms of proved reserves, is Pinedale, where the Company is targeting the Lance Pool tight gas sand reservoir. The top of the Lance Pool reservoir ranges from 8,500 to 9,500 feet across QEP Energy's acreage. The Company currently estimates that there are over 600 additional wells required to fully develop its Pinedale acreage on 5 to 10-acre density. At December 31, 2013, QEP Energy had four operated rigs drilling in the Pinedale Anticline. In addition to QEP Energy's 798 gross producing wells, QEP Energy has an overriding royalty interest in an additional 50 wells at Pinedale.
Williston Basin
QEP has approximately 116,000 net acres of leaseholds in the Williston Basin in western North Dakota, where the Company is targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations. During the third quarter of 2012, QEP Energy closed the acquisition of oil and gas properties in the Williston Basin (the 2012 Acquisition), which added 27,600 net acres of producing leasehold. The top of the Bakken Formation ranges from approximately 9,500 feet to 10,000 feet across QEP Energy's leasehold. The Three Forks Formation lies approximately 60 to 70 feet below the Middle Bakken Formation and is also a target for horizontal drilling. As of December 31, 2013, QEP Energy had eight operated rigs drilling in the Williston Basin.
Since the 2012 Acquisition, the Company has been successful in lowering development well costs, de-risking unproven reserves, and increasing production, the number of future drilling locations and its estimate of recoverable reserves. In spite of completion delays due to downstream and weather-related issues, current Williston Basin oil production has grown to levels consistent with the Company's expectations at the time of the acquisition.
Uinta Basin
The majority of the Uinta Basin proved reserves are found in a series of vertically stacked, laterally discontinuous reservoirs at depths of 4,500 feet to deeper than 18,000 feet. QEP Energy owns working interests in approximately 257,000 net leasehold acres in the Uinta Basin. QEP Energy had one operated rig drilling in the Uinta Basin at December 31, 2013, targeting the Lower Mesaverde Formation productive fairway in the Red Wash Unit, in which QEP holds 32,300 net acres.
Legacy
The remainder of QEP Energy Northern Region leasehold interests, productive wells and proved reserves are distributed over a number of fields and properties managed as Legacy.
Southern Region
Haynesville/Cotton Valley
QEP Energy has approximately 50,500 net acres of Haynesville Shale leaseholds in northwest Louisiana and additional lease rights that cover the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations. The top of the Haynesville Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 12,500 feet across QEP Energy's leasehold and is below the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations that QEP Energy has been developing in northwest Louisiana since the 1990's. As of December 31, 2013, QEP Energy did not have any operated rigs drilling in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley area.
Midcontinent
QEP Energy's Midcontinent operations cover all properties in the Southern Region except the Haynesville/Cotton Valley area of northwest Louisiana and are distributed over a large area, including the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
QEP Energy has approximately 76,000 net acres of Woodford "Cana" Shale leaseholds in western Oklahoma. The top of the Woodford Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 14,500 feet across QEP Energy's leasehold. As of December 31, 2013, QEP Energy had two operated rigs drilling in the Woodford/Cana play.
QEP Energy has approximately 35,000 net acres of Granite Wash/Atoka Wash leaseholds in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma and has been drilling vertical Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells for over a decade. The top of the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash interval ranges from approximately 11,100 feet to 15,900 feet across QEP Energy's leasehold. As of December 31, 2013, QEP Energy did not have any operated rigs drilling in the Texas Panhandle.
Reserves - QEP Energy
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 89% and 91%, respectively, of QEP Energy's estimated proved reserves were Company operated. Proved developed reserves represented 53% and 54% of the Company's total proved reserves at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, while the remaining reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. All reported reserves are located in the United States. QEP Energy does not have any long-term supply contracts with foreign governments, reserves of equity investees or reserves of subsidiaries with a significant minority interest. QEP Energy's estimated proved reserves are summarized in the table below:
____________________________
(1)
Oil and NGL are converted to natural gas equivalents at the ratio of one bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGL to six Mcf of equivalent natural gas.
QEP Energy's reserve, production and production life index for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, through December 31, 2013, are summarized in the table below:
____________________________
(1)
Reserve life index is calculated by dividing year-end proved reserves by production for that year.
Proved Reserves
Reserve and related information is presented consistent with the requirements of the SEC's rules for the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. These rules expand the use of reliable technologies to estimate and categorize reserves and require the use of the average of the first-of-the-month commodity prices, adjusted for location and quality differentials, for the prior 12 months (unless contractual arrangements designate the price) used to calculate economic producibility of reserves and the discounted cash flows reported as the Standardized Measure of Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Reserves. Refer to Note 17 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited), in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves and the preparation of such estimates.
QEP Energy's proved reserves in major operating areas are summarized in the table below:
Estimates of the quantity of proved reserves increased during 2013 primarily related to reserve additions in the Williston Basin, offset by decreases in estimated Haynesville/Cotton Valley and Legacy proved reserves. The increase in Williston Basin reserves was primarily the result of extensions and additions from the recognition of additional proved undeveloped locations due to QEP's increased drilling program. The Haynesville/Cotton Valley decrease was primarily related to changes in performance estimates based on well performance during 2013 as well as the natural decline in reserves from production without reserve replacement from the lack of new wells being drilled. Legacy's proved reserves decreased as a result of property divestitures in 2013.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Significant changes to proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) that occurred during 2013 are summarized in the table below:
____________________________
(1)
Negative revisions were caused by a change in well spacing assumptions in Pinedale and Haynesville. Some more densely spaced wells were removed from the Company’s reserves. However, certain less densely spaced wells with higher estimates of recoverable oil and gas were rebooked as extensions and discoveries. Negative revisions were also partially offset by positive pricing-related revisions due to increased oil and gas prices during 2013.
(2)
Extensions and discoveries in 2013 increased proved undeveloped reserves due to extensions and discoveries of 263.9 Bcfe in Pinedale, 169.6 Bcfe in the Williston Basin, 170.3 Bcfe in Haynesville, and 83.9 Bcfe in Midcontinent. Extensions and discoveries in Pinedale and Haynesville related to certain less densely spaced wells with higher estimates of recoverable oil and gas, which were rebooked to replace wells removed from the Company's reserves through negative revisions caused by a change in well spacing assumptions in these areas.
(3)
All of QEP Energy's PUDs at December 31, 2013, are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date such locations were initially booked as PUDs, except for 120 Bcfe of reserves located within the northern portion of the Company's Pinedale Anticline leasehold in western Wyoming. Long-term development of gas reserves in Pinedale is governed by the BLM's September 2008 ROD on the FSEIS. Under the ROD, QEP Energy is allowed to drill and complete wells year-round in designated concentrated development areas. The ROD contains additional requirements and restrictions on the sequence of development, which require the Company to develop its leasehold from the south to the north. These restrictions result in protracted, phased development that is beyond the control of the Company. The Company has an ongoing development plan and the financial capability to continue development in the manner estimated.
The costs incurred to continue the development of PUDs were approximately $645.9 million, $513.0 million and $533.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The costs incurred in 2013 related to the drilling of PUDs in QEP's development projects. This investment resulted in the transfer in 2013 of 332.7 Bcfe of reserves from PUDs to proved developed reserves, representing 18% of the Company's total proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2012.
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $852.6 million in 2014, $1.2 billion in 2015, and $1.1 billion in 2016. Estimated future development costs include capital spending on major development projects, some of which will take several years to complete. PUDs related to major development projects will be reclassified to proved developed reserves when production commences.
Internal Controls Over Proved Reserve Estimates, Technical Qualifications and Technologies Used
Estimates of proved oil and gas reserves have been completed in accordance with professional engineering standards and the Company's established internal controls, which includes the compliance oversight of a multi-functional reserves review committee reporting to the Company's Board of Directors. The Company retained Ryder Scott Company, independent oil and gas reserve evaluation engineering consultants (Ryder Scott), to prepare the estimates of 100% of its proved reserves as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The individual at Ryder Scott who was responsible for overseeing the preparation of QEP's reserve estimates as of December 31, 2013, is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Colorado and graduated with a Masters of Science degree in Geological Engineering from the University of Missouri at Rolla in 1976. The individual has over 30 years experience in the Petroleum Industry, including experience estimating and evaluating petroleum reserves. A more detailed letter of the individual's professional qualifications has been filed as part of Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The individual at QEP responsible for insuring the accuracy of the reserve estimate preparation material provided to Ryder Scott and reviewing the estimates of reserves received from Ryder Scott is QEP's Chief Engineer. This individual is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in Geological Engineering from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in 1979. He is a registered Professional Petroleum Engineer in the state of
Colorado. This individual has over 30 years experience in the Petroleum Industry, including more than 20 years reservoir engineering experience in most of the active domestic basins in the U.S.
To establish reserves, the SEC allows a company to use technologies that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. A variety of methodologies were used to determine QEP's proved reserve estimates. The principal methodologies employed are performance, analogy, volumetric methods or a combination of methods.
All of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods. Performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of historical production data available through December 2013 in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. For wells currently in production, forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
Approximately 99% of QEP's proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were estimated by analogy. The remaining one percent of such reserves was estimated by the volumetric method. The volumetric analysis utilized pertinent well data furnished to Ryder Scott by QEP or obtained from available public data sources through December 2013. Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet in production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by QEP. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in these estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies. The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. Some combination of these methods is used to determine reserve estimates in substantially all of QEP's fields.
Refer to Note 17 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information pertaining to QEP Energy's proved reserves as of the end of each of the last three years.
In addition to this filing, QEP Energy will file reserves estimates as of December 31, 2013, with the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy on Form EIA-23. Although QEP uses the same technical and economic assumptions when it prepares the EIA-23 as used to estimate reserves for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, it is obligated to report reserves for only wells it operates, not for all of the wells in which it has an interest, and to include the reserves attributable to other owners in such wells.
Production, Prices and Production Costs
The following table sets forth the net production volumes and field-level prices of gas, oil and NGL produced, and the related operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

A summary of gas production by major geographical area is shown in the following table:
A summary of oil production by major geographical area is shown in the following table:
A summary of NGL production by major geographical area is shown in the following table:
A summary of natural gas equivalent total production by major geographical area is shown in the following table:
A regional comparison of average field-level prices is shown in the following table:
Northern Region
Pinedale
Production from the Pinedale Anticline decreased 5% to 94.7 Bcfe during 2013 compared to 2012. This decrease in production was primarily a result of lower NGL production due to operating in ethane rejection mode throughout the majority of 2013 compared to operating in ethane recovery throughout the majority of 2012. Additionally, QEP had lower average interest in wells drilled in the 2013 drilling program.
Production from Pinedale grew 26% to 99.7 Bcfe during 2012 compared to 2011, driven by increased drilling activity over the period and the fee-based processing agreement at Blacks Fork II entered into in the third quarter of 2011 between QEP Energy and QEP Field Services.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Pinedale's production represented 31%, 31%, and 29% of QEP Energy's total production, respectively.
Williston Basin
In the Williston Basin, production increased 133% to 47.2 Bcfe during 2013 compared to 2012, due to increased oil and NGL production. The increase in production volumes was primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the 2012 Acquisition, which contributed 2,591.6 Mbbls of increased oil and NGL volume. The remaining 1,598.0 Mbbls increase in 2013 related to increased development drilling on QEP's existing pre-acquisition acreage.
During 2012, production increased 186% compared to 2011, due to increased oil-directed drilling activity in the basin. In addition, the 2012 Acquisition contributed 5.2 Bcfe of increased production in the fourth quarter 2012.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Williston Basin production represented 15%, 6%, and 3% of QEP Energy's total production, respectively.
Uinta Basin
In the Uinta Basin, production increased 13% to 26.9 Bcfe during 2013, due to increased drilling activity in the Lower Mesaverde formation in the Red Wash Unit. NGL production increased 92.7 Mbbl during 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of QEP Energy executing a fee-based cryogenic processing agreement with QEP Field Services for a portion of the Red Wash Unit's gas production in mid-2012, which was partially offset by decreased production related to processing plants running in ethane rejection mode throughout the majority of 2013.
During 2012, production increased 15% due to increased drilling activity in the Lower Mesaverde formation in the Red Wash Unit. NGL production increased 264.7 Mbbl during 2012 compared to 2011, primarily as a result of QEP Energy executing a fee-based cryogenic processing agreement with QEP Field Services for a portion of the Red Wash Unit's gas production in mid-2012.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Uinta Basin production represented 9%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, of QEP Energy's total production.
Legacy
QEP Energy's Legacy's production decreased 13% to 11.9 Bcfe during 2013 compared to 2012, due to declining production on older wells and divestitures of certain of QEP's noncore properties in the Northern Region during 2013.
Legacy's production decreased 4% to 13.7 Bcfe during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, due to declining production on older wells partially offset by increased drilling activity in the Powder River Basin during 2012.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Legacy's production represented 4% of QEP Energy's total production.
Southern Region
Haynesville/Cotton Valley
Production from the Haynesville Shale and Cotton Valley decreased 36% to 72.2 Bcfe during 2013 when compared to 2012. Decreased production was due to the suspension of QEP's drilling program in the area due to depressed gas prices and QEP's focus on developing more oil rich areas during 2013.
Production from the Haynesville Shale and Cotton Valley increased 4% to 112.3 Bcfe during 2012 when compared to 2011. The increase in 2012 was due to the completion of several high-rate wells in early 2012 that were drilled during the latter half of 2011.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Haynesville/Cotton Valley's production comprised 23%, 35%, and 39% of QEP Energy's total production, respectively.
Midcontinent
Production in the Midcontinent grew 14% to 56.1 Bcfe during 2013 when compared to 2012, due to a 494.1 Mbbl increase in NGL production and a 4.2 Bcfe increase in gas production offset by decreased oil production of 61.0 Mbbl. The increase in gas and NGL production was driven by several high rate and high working interest well completions in 2013.
Net production in the Midcontinent grew 7% to 49.3 Bcfe during 2012 compared to 2011, driven by a 65% increase in oil production and an 18% increase in NGL production driven by the continued development of the Granite Wash, Marmaton and Tonkawa plays in Texas and western Oklahoma and the Woodford "Cana" Shale liquids-rich gas play in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma.
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Midcontinent's production represented 18%, 15%, and 17% of QEP Energy's total production, respectively.
Productive Wells
The following table summarizes the Company's productive wells as of December 31, 2013, all of which are located in the U.S.:
The term "gross" refers to all wells or acreage in which QEP has at least a partial working interest and the term "net" refers to QEP's ownership represented by that working interest. Although many wells produce both oil and gas, and many gas wells also have allocated NGL volumes from processing, a well is categorized as either a gas or an oil well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced at the wellhead. Each gross well completed in more than one producing zone is counted as a single well.
The Company also holds numerous overriding royalty interests in oil and gas wells, a portion of which is convertible to working interests after recovery of certain costs by third parties. Once the overriding royalty interests are converted to working interests, these wells are included in the Company's gross and net well count.
Leasehold Acreage
The following table summarizes developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage in which the Company owns a working interest or mineral interest as of December 31, 2013. "Undeveloped Acreage" includes leasehold interests that already may have been classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves and unleased mineral interest acreage owned by the Company. Excluded from the table is acreage in which the Company's interest is limited to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests. All leasehold acres are located in the U.S.
____________________________
(1)
Developed acreage is leased acreage assigned to productive wells.
(2)
Undeveloped acreage is leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
Expiring Leaseholds
A portion of the leases summarized in the preceding table will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless the leases are renewed or drilling or production has occurred on the acreage subject to the lease prior to that date. Leases held by production remain in effect until production ceases. The following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acres subject to leases summarized in the preceding table that will expire during the periods indicated:
Drilling Activity
The following table summarizes the number of development and exploratory wells drilled during the years indicated:
____________________________
(1)
Following the 2012 Acquisition, the Company began reporting the results of Williston Basin separately from Legacy in 2012. The Legacy well totals for the year ended December 31, 2011, include the total development and exploratory wells drilled in the Williston Basin.
The following table presents operated and non-operated well completions for the year ended December 31, 2013:
The following table presents operated and non-operated wells drilling and waiting on completion at December 31, 2013:
____________________________
(1)
QEP suspends Pinedale completion operations during the coldest months of the winter, generally from December to mid-March.
QEP utilizes multi-well pad drilling where practical. Wells drilled are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location. As a result, QEP had 63 gross operated wells waiting on completion as of December 31, 2013.
Delivery Commitments
QEP Energy is a party to various long-term sales commitments for physical delivery of gas with future firm delivery commitments as follows:
These commitments are physical delivery obligations with prices based on prevailing index prices for gas at the time of delivery. None of these commitments requires the Company to deliver gas produced specifically from any of the Company's properties. The Company believes that its production and reserves are adequate to meet these term sales commitments. If for some reason the Company's gas production is not sufficient to satisfy its firm delivery commitments, the Company believes it can purchase sufficient volumes of gas in the market at index-related prices to satisfy its commitments. See also Item 7 "Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments" for discussion of firm transportation and storage commitments related to gas deliveries.
In addition, none of the Company's production from QEP Energy's owned properties is subject to any priorities, proration or third-party imposed curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to its customers, any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond the Company's control that may affect its ability to meet its contractual obligations other than those discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Midstream Field Services - QEP Field Services
QEP Field Services provides midstream services (gathering, processing and treating) to QEP Energy and third-party customers, including major and independent producers. QEP Field Services' physical assets include the following:
•
810 miles of gathering lines in Utah and Louisiana;
•
six processing plants, which extract NGL from the natural gas stream and have an aggregate capacity of 1.52 Bcf per day of unprocessed natural gas;
•
treating facilities in northwest Louisiana which remove impurities from the natural gas stream and have an aggregate capacity of 600 MMcf per day of untreated natural gas;
•
compression facilities and field dehydration and measurement systems; and
•
the UBFS system, which consists of 100 miles of gathering lines and associated field equipment.
In February 2013, QEP Field Services put into service the 150 MMcf per day Iron Horse II cryogenic processing plant, an expansion of its Stagecoach and Iron Horse processing complex in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah. The plant predominantly provides fee-based processing services to third parties and affiliates. During the third quarter of 2013, QEP Field Services completed the 10,000 Bbl per day expansion of the NGL fractionation facility located at the Blacks Fork processing complex.
QEP Field Services also owns a majority interest in QEP Midstream, a publicly traded master limited partnership that was formed by QEP to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream energy assets. QEP Midstream was formed in 2013 and completed its initial public offering in August 2013. In connection with the IPO, QEP Field Services contributed certain assets to QEP Midstream in exchange for net proceeds of $351.1 million and a 57.8% interest in QEP Midstream. QEP Midstream's assets currently consist of the following:
•
Four gathering systems consisting of 1,129 miles of gathering lines in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and North Dakota;
•
Rendezvous Pipeline, a FERC regulated 21-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that can deliver up to 460 MMcf of natural gas per day to the Kern River Pipeline;
•
a 78% interest in Rendezvous Gas, a joint venture consisting of 310 miles of gathering lines and associated field equipment; and
•
a 50% interest in Three Rivers Gathering, a joint venture that consists of 52 miles of gathering lines and associated field equipment.
Delivery Commitments
The Company sells NGL under a term sales agreement that contains a delivery commitment for 8,500 barrels per day of NGL extracted at several of QEP Field Services' gas processing facilities in the Northern Region. The agreement, which became effective May 1, 2010, extends for a period of seven years and contains terms and conditions customary for an agreement of this type in the oil and gas industry. The Company believes that the reserves dedicated to gas processing facilities and projected processing volumes are adequate to satisfy its delivery commitments under this agreement.
Energy Marketing - QEP Marketing
QEP Marketing owns and operates an underground gas storage reservoir in southwestern Wyoming. The reservoir has a gas storage capacity of approximately 8 Bcf, comprised of approximately 4 Bcf of QEP Marketing-owned cushion gas and working gas storage capacity of about 4 Bcf.
Delivery Commitments
QEP Marketing is a party to various long-term sales commitments for physical delivery of gas with future firm delivery commitments as follows:
These commitments are physical delivery obligations with prices based on prevailing index prices for gas at the time of delivery. Historically, QEP Marketing has materially fulfilled its delivery commitments by purchasing and selling QEP Energy's gas production. The Company believes that QEP Energy's gas production and reserves to be sold to QEP Marketing are adequate to meet these term sales commitments. If for some reason QEP Energy's gas production sold to QEP Marketing is not sufficient to satisfy its firm delivery commitments, the Company believes it can purchase sufficient volumes of gas in the market at index-related prices to satisfy its commitments. See also Item 7 "Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments" for discussion of firm transportation and storage commitments related to gas deliveries.
ITEM 3.
