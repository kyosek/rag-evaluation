Description of Our Properties
Below is a description of our properties. More detail is provided for the properties that represent more than ten percent of our total assets or accounted for more than ten percent of our aggregate gross revenues or both as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Atlanta-Metro
Our Atlanta, Georgia facility, or Atlanta-Metro, is currently our largest data center based on total operating NRSF. As of December 31, 2016, the property consisted of approximately 969,000 gross square feet with approximately 821,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 453,000 raised floor operating NRSF. An on-site Georgia Power substation supplies 72 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators, and the facility has 120 MW of transformer capacity. The facility also includes a small amount of private “Class A” office space. As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 94% occupied by 227 customers across our 3Cs product offerings.
Portions of the Atlanta-Metro facility are included in our redevelopment pipeline, as we plan to continue to expand the facility in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we placed approximately 20,000 of raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 43,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 30,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this incremental space will cost approximately $23 million in the aggregate based on current estimates (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2016). Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 73,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 44,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 937,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 527,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, this facility is adjacent to six acres of undeveloped land owned by us that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 262,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 162,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These six acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
We are the beneficial owner of our Atlanta-Metro facility through a bond-financed sale-leaseback structure. This structure is necessary in the State of Georgia to receive property tax abatement. In 2006, the Development Authority of Fulton County (“DAFC”) issued a taxable industrial development revenue bond to us with a face amount of $300 million in exchange for legal title to the facility. The acquisition of the bond by us was “cashless” as the bond was issued to us in exchange for title to the facility. The bond matures on December 1, 2019 and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum. DAFC leased the facility back to us under a bond lease at a rent equal to the debt service on the bond. The bond lease is a triple net lease, which is standard in conduit financing transactions of this type. The rent under the bond lease payable by us, as lessee, is assigned by DAFC to us, as the bondholder. Because the rent and debt service amounts are equal and offsetting, no cash changes hands between DAFC and us. DAFC is the owner and lessor of the facility, but its rights to receive all rental payments and a security interest in the facility have been pledged to us, as the bondholder, as security for the bond. Therefore, we have complete control over the facility at all times. We have an option to buy the facility for $10 when the bond has been retired (the bond matures on December 1, 2019). If we wish to obtain title earlier, we can do so by simply surrendering and cancelling the bond and paying the $10 option price.

Atlanta-Suwanee
Our Suwanee, Georgia, or Atlanta-Suwanee, facility consists of approximately 370,000 gross square feet, and as of December 31, 2016 it had approximately 321,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 206,000 raised floor operating NRSF. Georgia Power supplies 36 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” private office space and our operating service center, which provides 24x7 support to all of our customers and data centers. As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 80% occupied by 335 customers.
Portions of the Atlanta-Suwanee facility were previously included in our redevelopment pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we placed approximately 20,000 of raised floor NRSF into service. In addition, this facility is adjacent to 15 acres of undeveloped land owned by us that we believe could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 262,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately would be 162,000 NRSF of raised floor. These 15 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.

Richmond
Our Richmond, Virginia data center is situated on an approximately 220-acre site comprised of three large buildings available for data center redevelopment, each with two to three floors, and an administrative building that also has space available for data center redevelopment. As of December 31, 2016, the data center had approximately 1.3 million gross square feet with approximately 397,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 167,000 of raised floor operating NRSF. Dominion Virginia Power supplies 110 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. As of December 31, 2016, one of these primary buildings was fully operational as a data center, another was partially operational, and the third was being redeveloped. We believe that our Richmond facility is situated in an ideal location due to its proximity to Washington, DC, which offers numerous sources of demand for our products including the federal government, and provides geographical diversification from the Northern Virginia data center market. There are three core segments that we believe represent the most significant opportunity for our Richmond data center: entities associated with the federal government, given the highly secured nature of this facility and its proximity to Washington, DC; regulated industries, such as financial institutions, given our investments in security and regulatory compliance; and large enterprise customers, given the large scale of this facility. Our Richmond mega data center can accommodate large and growing C1 customers, while also accommodating C2 and C3 customers, at attractive energy costs.
We acquired our Richmond facility in 2010 through a bankruptcy process. We estimate that the former owner, a semiconductor manufacturer, had invested over $1 billion to develop the facility prior to the bankruptcy. Because the facility operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility prior to our acquisition, it had significant pre-existing infrastructure, including 110 MW of utility power, approximately 25,000 tons of chiller capacity, “Class A” private office space and other related supporting infrastructure. As a result, to date the incremental cost to redevelop the facility into a data center has been lower than the typical cost of ground-up data center development or redevelopment of other types of buildings into data centers. As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 89% occupied by 97 customers across our 3Cs product offerings.
We are the fee simple owner of the Richmond facility, and the facility was subject to a $120 million secured credit facility which was terminated in October 2015 in conjunction with an amendment to our unsecured credit facility.
The Richmond facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline, as we plan to expand the facility in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we placed approximately 16,000 of raised floor NRSF into service. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 888,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 390,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 1.3 million total operating NRSF, including approximately 557,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, we own approximately 100 acres of undeveloped land on the site that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 1.8 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately 1.1 million NRSF would be raised floor. These 100 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.

Irving
We purchased our Irving facility in February 2013. Prior to our purchase, the facility was operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility. Similar to our Richmond facility, the Irving facility has significant pre-existing infrastructure. Specifically, the Irving facility has diverse feeds of 140 MW of utility power and approximately 698,000 gross square feet on 39 acres. We are the fee simple owner of the Irving facility.
We acquired our Irving facility because we believe that we will be able to execute a redevelopment strategy similar to our Richmond facility. Given the infrastructure that was already in place due to its former use as a semiconductor fabrication facility, we believe that the incremental costs to redevelop data center raised floor space in this facility will be lower compared to typical costs for ground-up development or redevelopments of other building types. In addition, the access to a significant amount of utility power provides the necessary power capacity to support our growth strategy for our Irving data center. Furthermore, we believe that the Dallas market is an important data center market primarily due to its strong business environment and relatively affordable power costs.
The Irving facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline, as we continue to convert the entire facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. The first phase was completed in July 2014, when approximately 28,000 raised floor NRSF was placed into service. We placed an additional approximately 26,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we placed an additional 69,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 126,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 51,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2016) approximately $35 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 309,000 total NRSF, of which approximately 101,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 668,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 276,000 NRSF of raised floor.
We own sufficient undeveloped land on the site, approximately 29 acres, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 524,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 324,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These 29 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 97% occupied by 56 customers.

MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. This amount reflects the annualized cash rental payments. It does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.

Leased Facilities Acquired in 2015
We acquired leased facilities as part of our acquisition of Carpathia on June 16, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, these leased facilities, including those subject to capital leases, consisted of eight domestic data centers located in Dulles, Virginia; Phoenix, Arizona; San Jose, California; Harrisonburg, Virginia and Ashburn, Virginia; and four international data centers located in Toronto, Canada; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Hong Kong and London, United Kingdom.
These leased facilities consist of approximately 166,000 gross square feet with approximately 109,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 71,000 raised floor operating NRSF and 20 MW of gross power. The leased facilities are included in our redevelopment pipeline. We can further expand the facilities by approximately 12,000 total NRSF, all of which would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facilities, we anticipate that the facilities would contain approximately 121,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 94,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2016, the facilities were approximately 84% occupied by 186 customers. The majority of the customers at these facilities are C3 customers which lease small amounts of space.
Lease Expirations. The following table sets forth a summary schedule of the lease expirations for leases in place as of December 31, 2016 at the acquired leased facilities. Unless otherwise stated in the footnotes, the information set forth in the table assumes that customers exercise no renewal options and all early termination rights.

Below is a description of our other properties.
Santa Clara
Our Santa Clara, California facility was acquired in November 2007. The facility, which is owned subject to a long-term ground sublease as described below, consists of two buildings containing approximately 135,000 gross square feet with approximately 102,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 56,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The facility is situated on a 6.5-acre site in Silicon Valley. Several Silicon Valley Power substations supply 11 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. We believe that Silicon Valley is an ideal data center location due to the large concentration of technology companies and the high local demand for data centers and cloud and managed services.
As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 83% occupied by 104 customers.
The Santa Clara facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 4,000 total operating NRSF, all of which is raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2016) approximately $2 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 131,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 81,000 NRSF of raised floor.
The Santa Clara facility is subject to a ground lease. We acquired a ground sublease interest in the land on which the Santa Clara facility is located in November 2007. The ground sublease expires in 2052, subject to two 10-year extension options. The current annual rent payable under the ground sublease is approximately $1.2 million, which increases annually by the lesser of 6% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay area. In addition, in 2018 and 2038, the monthly rent will be adjusted to equal one-twelfth of an amount equal to 8.5% of the product of (i) the then fair market value of the demised premises (without taking into account the value of the improvements existing on the land) calculated on a per square foot basis, and (ii) the net square footage of the demised premises. During the term of the ground lease, we have certain obligations to facilitate the provision of job training, seminars and research opportunities for students of a community college that is adjacent to the property. We are the indirect holder of this ground sublease.
Sacramento
Our Sacramento, California facility, which we acquired in December 2012, is located 120 miles from our Santa Clara facility on a 6.8-acre site. The facility currently consists of approximately 93,000 gross square feet with approximately 81,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 55,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District supplies 8 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility is an institutional grade data center with a classic “N+1” design that provides a single extra uninterruptible power supply module for use in the event of a system failure. This facility will provide our regional customer base with business continuity services along with Cloud and Managed Services. We believe the property’s location is a valuable complement to our Santa Clara facility for our customers, as it will allow them to diversify their footprint in the California market with a single provider. We intend to leverage our existing West Coast regional team and our Cloud and Managed Services sales and support staff to cater to customers in this property, many of which already used managed services when we acquired the property.
We are not currently redeveloping the Sacramento facility. Longer term, we can expand the facility by approximately 3,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that it will contain approximately 84,000 total operating NRSF including approximately 58,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 44% occupied by 151 customers. The majority of the customers at this facility are C2 customers which lease small amounts of space. We are the fee simple owner of the Sacramento facility.
Miami
Our Miami, Florida facility currently consists of approximately 30,000 gross square feet with approximately 26,000 total operating NRSF, including 20,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The property sits on a 1.6-acre site located at Dolphin Center with 4 MW of utility power supplied by Florida Power & Light and backed up by diesel generators. With a wind rating of 185 miles-per-hour, the facility is built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. Miami is a strategic location for us because it is a gateway to the South American financial markets and a transcontinental Internet hub. The Miami facility was under development when we acquired it in April 2008, and we completed the build-out in August 2008. Other than normally recurring capital expenditures, we have no current plans to further build-out or expand the Miami facility.
As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 66% occupied by 78 customers. We intend to continue to lease-up this property. We are the fee simple owner of the Miami facility.
Jersey City
Our Jersey City, New Jersey facility is a leased facility that consists of approximately 122,000 gross square feet with approximately 88,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 32,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The Jersey City facility was originally leased by another party in March 2004 and we acquired the lease in October 2006 when we acquired the lessee. The lease expires in September 2026 and is subject to one five-year extension option. The facility was redeveloped in November 2006, and we subsequently leased it to service customers in New Jersey and New York. The facility is comprised of four floors of a 19 story building located on one city block in the metropolitan New York City area, six miles from Manhattan. PSE&G supplies 7 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” office space. We believe that the location in Jersey City provides us with a crucial presence in the tri-state area, where space is highly coveted given the strong demand from financial services firms.
We are not currently redeveloping the Jersey City facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 109,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 53,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2016, the facility was approximately 89% occupied by 58 customers.
Princeton
Our Princeton, New Jersey facility, which we acquired on June 30, 2014, is located on approximately 194 acres and consists of approximately 554,000 gross square feet, including approximately 58,000 square feet of raised floor, and 22 MW of gross power. Concurrently with acquiring this data center we entered into a 10 year lease for the facility’s 58,000 square feet of raised floor with Atos, an international information technology services company headquartered in Bezos, France. The lease includes a 15 year renewal at the option of Atos.
The Princeton facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline. We can further expand the facility by another approximately 372,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 100,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 544,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 158,000 NRSF of raised floor.
Chicago
Our Chicago facility, which we acquired on July 8, 2014, is the former Sun Times Press facility near downtown Chicago, Illinois. The facility consists of approximately 467,000 gross square feet, including approximately 14,000 raised floor operating NRSF and 24 MW of gross power capacity, with 8 MW of available utility power currently available and another 47 MW available upon request.
The Chicago facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline, as we plan to convert the facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we placed approximately 14,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 52,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 28,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion
will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2016) approximately $32 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 341,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 166,000 would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 374,000 total operating NRSF with raised floor capacity of approximately 208,000 square feet and 37 MW of power.
Piscataway
Our Piscataway, New Jersey facility, which we acquired on June 6, 2016, currently consists of approximately 360,000 gross square feet with approximately 195,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 89,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The property is located on a 38-acre campus and includes an on-site 112kVA substation as well as solar panel that produce approximately 2 MW of power.
The Piscataway facility is included in our redevelopment pipeline, as we plan to convert the facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 18,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 10,000 NRSF of raised floor.
