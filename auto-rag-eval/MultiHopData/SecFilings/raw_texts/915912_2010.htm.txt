ITEM 2.
COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
●
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Established Communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of January 1, 2009, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
●
Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in, and that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.
●
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
●
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For communities that we wholly own, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community’s acquisition cost and is expected to have a material impact on the community's operations, including occupancy levels and future retention rates. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement, or by one of the Funds.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
As of December 31, 2010, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. As of January 31, 2011, our current communities consisted of 120 garden-style (of which 15 are mixed communities and/or include town homes), 22 high-rise and 31 mid-rise apartment communities.
Our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features, which may include:
●
fully-equipped kitchens;
●
lofts and vaulted ceilings;
●
walk-in closets;
●
fireplaces;
●
patios/decks; and
●
modern appliances.
Other features at various communities may include:
●
swimming pools;
●
fitness centers;
●
tennis courts; and
●
wi-fi lounges.
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service-oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe our mission of Enhancing the Lives of our Residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of 1,547 apartment homes in four communities and sold 1,007 apartment homes in three communities. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 16 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the average age of our Current Communities is 10 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2011, we owned:
●
a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 131 operating communities, nine of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in October 2026, November 2028, December 2034, December 2061, April 2095, September 2105, May 2105 and March 2142, and 82 of which are owned by subsidiary partnerships, limited liability companies or corporations;
●
a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in both Fund I and Fund II. Subsidiaries of Fund I own a fee simple interest in 19 operating communities, and subsidiaries of Fund II own a fee simple interest in nine operating communities;
●
a general partnership interest in two partnerships structured as “DownREITs,” as described more fully below, that own an aggregate of seven communities;
●
a membership interest in four limited liability companies and a partnership interest in two partnerships, each with direct or indirect third-party ownership interest therein, that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community, one of which is on land subject to a land lease expiring in February 2093; and
●
a residual profits interest (with no ownership interest) in a limited liability company to which an operating community was transferred upon completion of construction in the second quarter of 2006.
For some communities, a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration. We have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in October 2026, November 2028, December 2034 and April 2095. We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in the 14 Development Communities, all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and one of which is subject to a land lease expiring in April 2106.
In our two partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2011, there were 15,207 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities
As of December 31, 2010, we had 14 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 3,334 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $879,500,000. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further discussion of our 2011 outlook for development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2010, we had nine consolidated communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $113,100,000, excluding costs prior to redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate continuing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities (1):
(1)
The Company commenced the redevelopment of Avalon at Prudential Center in Boston, MA during the second quarter 2010 for an estimated total capitalized cost of $29.1 million. The redevelopment is primarily focused on the exterior and/or common area and is not expected to have a material impact on community operations, including occupancy, or the expected future level of rental revenue. This community is therefore included in the Established Community portfolio and not classified as a Redevelopment Community.
(2)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to redevelop the respective Redevelopment Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.
(3)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
(4)
Redevelopment efforts will be focused on the 368 units associated with the initial phase of this community which was acquired by a predecessor of the Company in Q3 1995.
(5)
The scope of the work completed during the fourth quarter did not impact the occupancy or rental income therefore these communities are included in the Established Community portfolio.
Development Rights
At December 31, 2010, we had $184,150,000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own, and $77,253,000 in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through an option to purchase or lease the land. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 26 Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of December 31, 2010, includes $143,813,000 in original land acquisition costs. We also have $49,979,000 in future land acquisition costs under our Commitment, related to a Development Right in Brooklyn, NY, as discussed under “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” elsewhere within this Form 10-K. The original land acquisition cost per home, including our obligation under the Commitment, ranged from $10,000 per home in Connecticut to $148,000 per home in New York City. In addition, the land for a Development Right that we control under a 99-year land lease agreement is subject to future minimum rental amounts of $6,600,000 per year. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 7,313 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.
For 18 Development Rights, we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel. While we generally prefer to hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, for the eight remaining Development Rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2010, we incurred a charge of approximately $2,741,000 of pre-development cost for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed.
You should carefully review Section 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The table below presents a summary of these Development Rights:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
Land Acquisitions
We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2010, we acquired eight land parcels for development, as shown in the table below, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $67,494,000. For seven of the eight parcels construction has either started or will start within the next 12 months.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
Other Land and Real Estate Assets
We own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately $105,218,000 that we do not currently plan to develop. These parcels consist of land that we (i) originally planned to develop and (ii) ancillary parcels acquired in connection with Development Rights that we had not planned to develop, as more fully described below.
i) The land that we originally acquired for future development has an original cost of $144,702,000, and a current carrying value of $83,215,000, and is comprised of nine parcels originally intended for the development of approximately 2,700 apartment homes. The current carrying value of these land parcels reflects impairment charges of $61,487,000 incurred in prior periods.
ii) The out parcels and certain other land parcels that we acquired in connection with various development pursuits without a view to developing have a current carrying value of $22,003,000, which reflects impairment charges of $12,166,000 incurred in prior periods.
We believe that the current carrying value of $105,218,000 for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value, or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired. However we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment, and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value, less costs to dispose.
Recent Disposition Activity
We (i) sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a non-taxable, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011, we sold our interest in three wholly owned communities, containing 1,007 apartment homes. The aggregate gross sales price for these assets was $190,450,000.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault and the Hayward Fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. We have in place with respect to communities located in California and Washington, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage. Earthquake coverage outside of California and Washington is subject to a $100,000,000 limit each occurrence and in the aggregate. In California the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence except that the next $350,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional self-insured retention until the total incurred self-insured retention exceeds $1,400,000.
On January 15, 2011, we elected to extend our property insurance policy for a new 16 month term in order to take advantage of market conditions. As a result, our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 10% with no material changes in coverage. We expect to renew this policy when it expires on May 15, 2012.
In August 2010, we renewed our general liability policy and worker’s compensation coverage for a one year term, and experienced an increase in the premium on these policies of approximately 3%, which for the workers compensation coverage primarily reflects increased volume at a slightly lower rate, and for the general liability coverage reflects a marginal rate increase. For both policies, there were no material changes in the coverage. These policies are in effect until August 1, 2011.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In December 2007, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back-stop program until 2014. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $250,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIPRA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides TRIPRA coverage (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.
An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and the Company’s related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1a., “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance,” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) that protect the Company, up to $5,000,000 per occurrence, from employee theft of money, securities or property.
ITEM 3.
