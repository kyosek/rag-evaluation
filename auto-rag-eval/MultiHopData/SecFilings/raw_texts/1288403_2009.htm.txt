Item 2. Properties
Substantially all of our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico. These fields are found in water depths ranging from less than ten feet up to 4,200 feet. The reservoirs in our fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically result in high production rates. The following describes our ten largest fields as of December 31, 2009, based on quantities of proved reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis. At December 31, 2009, these fields accounted for approximately 72% of our PV-10 value before estimated asset retirement obligations, or $803 million, and had proved reserves totaling 274.1 Bcfe.
(1) W&T operates all down hole operations.
Index to Financial Statements On December 31, 2009 we had one field of major significance (having proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis). Below is a description of this field, Ship Shoal 349, which is located on the conventional shelf.
Ship Shoal 349 Field. Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 169 Bcfe gross. This field is a sub-salt development with five productive horizons below salt at depths ranging to 17,000 feet. As of December 31, 2009, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 13 have been successful. We are currently developing a reservoir simulation model in order to optimize future development opportunities. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 122 Bcfe at December 31, 2009.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years.
(1) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs. The increase in 2009 production costs per Mcfe compared to 2008 primarily relates to higher insurance costs in 2009. In addition to our standard insurance policies for well control and hurricane damage, we have an additional $100 million of insurance for well control and hurricane damage on our Ship Shoal 349 field.
The following is a description of the remainder of our top ten properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2009, of which seven are located on the conventional shelf, one is located in the deepwater and one is located on the deep shelf. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 94, 102, 106, 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2009, 51 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 37 were successful. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 330 Bcfe gross. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 23.0 MMcf of natural gas per day and 1,193 Bbls of oil per day, or 30.2 MMcfe per day.
Index to Financial Statements Brazos A-133 Field. Brazos A-133 field is located 85 miles east of Corpus Christi, Texas in 200 feet of water. The field was discovered in 1978 by Cities Service Oil Company with production commencing in the same year. There are five active platforms, three of which are production platforms. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 850 Bcfe gross from the Middle Miocene Tex W and Big Hum sections. The bulk of the production is from the Big Hum CM-7 sand, which is a 4-way closure downthrown to the Corsair Fault and bisected by antithetic faults. The top of the CM-7 sand is at a subsea depth of 12,000 feet. Since its discovery, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 17 were successful. We own a 25% working interest that was obtained through a transaction with Kerr-McGee. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 6.7 MMcf of natural gas per day and 12 Bbls of oil per day, or 6.8 MMcfe per day.
West Delta 30 Field. West Delta 30 field is located approximately six miles off the coast of Louisiana in 40 feet of water. Our interests in this field are in West Delta Block 29, which straddles the eastern side of a major piercement salt dome with large accumulations of oil and natural gas sands found in traps along the salt flanks. In 1997, we entered into a farmout agreement with ChevronTexaco to further explore and develop potential reserves. Following a thorough 3-D seismic analysis, we have drilled a total of 17 exploration and development wells, all but one of which have been successful. Our working interests in these wells range from 37.5% to 100%. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 700 Bcfe gross. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 276 Bbls of oil per day, or 1.7 MMcfe per day.
Green Canyon 646 Field. Green Canyon 646 field is located approximately 150 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 4,200 feet of water. The discovery well, which we drilled to a total depth of 12,365 feet in January 2004, is a subsea well tied back to the Front Runner Spar located more than 20 miles away in Green Canyon 338. The field play consists of stacked sheet sands located on the flank of a salt dome between 10,500 and 12,000 feet. The well commenced production in September 2009. We own a 60% working interest in the field and are the operator of the field. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately two Bcfe gross. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 1.7 MMcf of natural gas per day and 2,303 Bbls of oil per day, or 15.5 MMcfe per day.
East Cameron 321 Field. East Cameron 321 field is located approximately 97 miles off the Louisiana coastline in 225 feet of water. Two production facilities, the “A” and “B” platforms, are located on the block. This field has multiple sands that are productive in faulted, structural traps. As of December 31, 2009, 75 wells have been drilled of which 57 have been successful. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 545 Bcfe gross. We own a 100% working interest in the field and are the operator of the field. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 3.0 MMcf of natural gas per day and 1,958 Bbls of oil per day, or 14.8 MMcfe per day.
Mobile 823 Field. Mobile 823 field is located off the coast of Alabama in approximately 60 feet of water. It is a natural gas field comprised of two OCS blocks, Mobile Blocks 822 and 823. The field was discovered by Mobil Oil Corporation in 1983, with initial production commencing in 1991. We acquired our 12.5% working interest in 2003 from ConocoPhillips. ExxonMobil currently operates the majority of the field. We operate one well, a Miocene “Luce” sand discovery drilled in 2006. Production is primarily from the Jurassic Norphlet sandstone at 21,500 feet, with minor production from Miocene sands at 3,000 to 7,000 feet. The trapping mechanism is a combination structural and stratigraphic trap. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 787 Bcfe gross from eleven productive wells. The field has one processing platform and three independent structures. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 4.8 MMcf of natural gas per day and 178 Bbls of oil per day, or 5.9 MMcfe per day.
South Timbalier 228 Field. South Timbalier 228 field is located 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana in about 220 feet of water and includes South Timbalier blocks 229 and 230. The field was discovered in November 1994 by The Louisiana Land and Exploration Company. We acquired South Timbalier block 229 from Burlington Resources and became operator of the field in November 2002. We acquired South Timbalier block 230 in OCS Lease Sale 194, with an effective date of June 2005. We are a 100% working interest owner in this field. We
Index to Financial Statements
have drilled six wells since becoming operator, all of which were successful. All of the producing sands are within the basal Nebraskan section. Cumulative production from this field through 2009 is approximately 43 Bcfe gross. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 0.5 MMcf of natural gas per day and 852 Bbls of oil per day, or 5.6 MMcfe per day.
Ship Shoal 208 Field. Ship Shoal 208 field is located approximately 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana in 96 feet of water and includes Ship Shoal block 214. The discovery well for Ship Shoal block 214 was drilled by Kerr-McGee in 1961. This field covers the eastern side of a large piercement salt dome, which acts to trap significant accumulations of Upper Miocene and Pliocene-age oil and natural gas deposits. We own a 64.5% working interest in the field and are the operator of the field. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 907 Bcfe. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 3.7 MMcf of natural gas per day and 311 Bbls of oil per day, or 5.6 MMcfe per day.
Mustang Island 889 Field. Mustang Island 889 field is located approximately 20 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas in 30 feet of water. The field was discovered by Shell in 1958. We have a 50% working interest in the well, which was drilled to a total depth of 13,500 feet in 2005 and was completed in the S Sand. Two additional pay sands are behind pipe. These Oligocene Frio sands are trapped in three-way structures upthrown to several down-to-the-basin growth faults. Minor faulting complicates the structures. Cumulative field production through 2009 is approximately 168 Bcfe. During December 2009, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 0.6 MMcf of natural gas per day and 30 Bbls of oil per day, or 0.8 MMcfe per day.
Proved Reserves
In December 2008, the SEC adopted new rules related to modernizing reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies, which became effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. The new rules permit the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Other definitions and terms were revised, including the definition of proved reserves which was changed to indicate, among other things, that commencing with year-end 2009 entities must use the unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month commodity prices over the preceding 12-month period, rather than end-of-period prices, when estimating quantities of proved reserves. Similarly, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the estimated future net revenues used to calculate the ceiling test are based on the 12-month average commodity price for each product. Also, because it is our policy to use end-of-period reserves in the determination of quarterly depletion, our depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (“DD&A”) expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 was calculated using proved reserves at December 31, 2009 that were determined in accordance with the new rules. Another significant provision of the new rules is a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
Applying the new rules, our proved reserves at December 31, 2009 totaled 371.0 Bcfe. Approximately 76% of our reserves were classified as proved developed and 24% were classified as proved undeveloped. Classified by product, 45% of our reserves were natural gas and 55% were oil and natural gas liquids, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. Our proved reserves were estimated by our independent petroleum consultant, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Index to Financial Statements Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2009 are summarized below. These reserve amounts are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies.
(1) Includes approximately 1.7 Bcfe of reserves with a PV-10 (before estimated asset retirement obligations) of $12.4 million that were shut-in at December 31, 2009 because of damage caused by Hurricane Ike in September 2008. We anticipate that the majority of these reserves will be reclassified to producing in the first half of 2010.
(2) Refer to footnote (3) under “Reserves Pricing Sensitivities” below for a reconciliation of PV-10 to the most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our proved reserves as of December 31, 2009 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January 2009 through December 2009. For oil and natural gas liquids, the average West Texas Intermediate posted price of $57.65 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price of $3.87 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations. We refer to this estimate of our proved reserves as the “SEC Case.”
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves decreased 120.1 Bcfe to 371.0 Bcfe at December 31, 2009 from 491.1 Bcfe at December 31, 2008, primarily attributable to production of 94.8 Bcfe and divestitures of certain non-core oil and natural gas fields. In the second quarter of 2009, we sold one of our fields in Louisiana state waters, and in the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold 36 non-core oil and natural gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico, subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreements. These dispositions collectively accounted for a 23.9 Bcfe reduction in total proved reserves. We also had negative revisions of 4.7 Bcfe due to performance. These decreases in reserves were partially offset by an increase in total proved reserves of 23.4 Bcfe, the majority of which is attributable to extensions and discoveries resulting from our participation in the drilling of eight successful exploratory wells in 2009, all of which were on the conventional shelf.
The remaining significant component of our decrease in total proved reserves from December 31, 2008 are revisions primarily from the adoption of the new SEC rules related to modernizing reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The initial application of these rules resulted in the removal of 23.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves associated with two of our fields for which our plan of development was not within five years from when the reserves were initially recorded, as required. In addition, positive revisions of 27.5 Bcfe that would have resulted from using end-of-period commodity prices as of December 31, 2009 ($76.00 per barrel for oil and natural gas liquids and $5.79 per MMBtu for natural gas) were offset by 25.1 Bcfe, the impact of which is attributable to the new requirement that oil and natural gas reserves are to be measured using the 12-month average commodity price for each product ($57.65 per barrel for oil and natural gas liquids and $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas).
Index to Financial Statements Reserves Pricing Sensitivities
In addition to the SEC Case proved reserves, our independent petroleum consultant also prepared estimates of our year-end proved reserves using two alternative commodity price assumptions. The following table summarizes our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2009 under each of the three cases:
(1) The Flat Case is based on the posted spot prices as of December 31, 2009 for both oil and natural gas. For oil and natural gas liquids, the West Texas Intermediate posted price of $76.00 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the Henry Hub spot price of $5.79 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) The NYMEX Case is based on the applicable monthly forward closing prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange for oil and natural gas as of December 31, 2009. For oil and natural gas liquids, the price was based on a crude oil price which increased from $79.36 per Bbl to $101.92 per Bbl during the life of the reserves and was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the price was based on a natural gas price which increased from $5.57 per MMBtu to $9.05 per MMBtu over the life of the properties and was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(3) We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues before asset retirement obligations as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant, adjusted by the Company to include estimated asset retirement obligations discounted using a 10% annual discount rate. PV-10 is not a financial measure prescribed under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles our calculation of PV-10 under the SEC Case to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. There is no directly comparable GAAP measure for the Flat case PV-10 or the NYMEX case PV-10. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Management believes that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. Further, professional analysts and sophisticated investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies’ reserves. Management also uses this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating us. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. The reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2009 for the SEC Case is as follows (in millions):

Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was estimated by our independent petroleum consultant, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 21 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 25 years. He has over 32 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 18 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
Index to Financial Statements
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Reserves
We produce natural gas liquids as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of natural gas liquids in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. In our December 31, 2009 reserve report prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, natural gas liquids represented approximately 4.8% of our total proved reserves. Natural gas liquids are products sold by the gallon. Therefore, in reporting reserve and production amounts of natural gas liquids, we include this production in the oil category. Prices for natural gas liquids in 2009 were approximately 47% lower on average than prices for equivalent volumes of oil. We report our average oil prices realized after taking into account the effect of the lower prices received for sales of natural gas liquids. We report all production information related to natural gas net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of natural gas liquids.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2009, as estimated by our independent petroleum consultant, were 87.5 Bcfe. Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2009 totaled approximately $152 million, substantially all of which is expected to be spent after December 31, 2010. In 2009, we developed approximately 11% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2008, consisting of three gross (1.9 net) wells and the subsea tie-in of one gross (0.6 net) deepwater well at a net cost of approximately $104.5 million.
Only one of our proved undeveloped well locations remains undeveloped past 5 years from the date of initial recognition as proved undeveloped. Green Canyon 646 #1 sidetrack was initially booked in 2003. This proved undeveloped location is a sidetrack to a currently producing well, a subsea oil producer tied back to the Front Runner Spar, located over 20 miles from the well location. The capital cost for this tie-in was approximately $60 million. Due to the high development cost, the proved undeveloped location will utilize the existing well bore in order to sidetrack updip to the target location, which will only be drilled after substantial depletion of the producing well. As of December 31, 2009, proved undeveloped reserves associated with this location were 10.6 Bcfe.
Acreage
The following summarizes gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2009. Net acreage is our percentage ownership of gross acreage. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 79% of our total gross acreage is held-by-production, which permits us to maintain all of our exploration, exploitation and development rights (including deep rights below currently producing zones) to the leased area as long as production continues. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects, including deep exploration projects, on the majority of our acreage.
Approximately 21% of our total gross acreage is undeveloped leasehold. Of our 186,615 total gross undeveloped acres, our rights to approximately 27% could expire in 2010, 7% in 2011, 1% in 2012, 16% in 2013
Index to Financial Statements
and 49% in 2014 and beyond, if not extended by exploration and production activities prior to the applicable lease expiration dates. Our drilling activity for 2010 will give consideration to our undeveloped leasehold that may expire in 2010 in order to retain the opportunity to exploit such acreage, based on the appropriate technical criteria, before expiration of the lease.
In the second quarter of 2009, we sold one of our fields in Louisiana state waters, and in the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold 36 non-core oil and natural gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico, subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreements. In connection with the sale of these properties, we retained the right to participate in certain identified drilling opportunities that could be proposed by the new owners. As a result of the sale of these properties and lease expirations, our total gross and net acreage decreased 37% and 30%, respectively, as of December 31, 2009 from year-end 2008.
Production
During 2009, our net production averaged approximately 259.7 MMcfe per day. Approximately 8.7 Bcfe of net production was deferred during 2009 as a result of damage caused primarily by Hurricane Ike during the third quarter of 2008.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three fiscal years.
Refer to the descriptions of our ten largest fields earlier in Item 2 - “Properties” for historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from our Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years, which is the only field at December 31, 2009 with proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves. Also refer to Item 6 “Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information” for additional historical operating data.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2009 in our productive oil and natural gas wells, including wells that were temporarily shut-in on that date primarily because of Hurricane Ike in 2008. A net well is our percentage working interest of a gross well.
(1) Includes 7 gross (4.5 net) oil wells and 11 gross (6.1 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Index to Financial Statements Our ownership in wells that were temporarily shut-in at December 31, 2009 primarily because of Hurricane Ike in 2008 is as follows:
Drilling Activity
During 2009, we participated in the drilling of 10 gross exploratory wells and three gross development wells, of which 12 were on the conventional shelf and one was on the deep shelf. Eight of the 10 exploration wells and two of the three development wells were successful. We operate five of the eight successful exploratory wells.
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and equipment of $276.1 million included $90.6 million for exploration activities, $162.1 million for development activities and $23.4 million for seismic, capitalized interest and other leasehold costs.
Development Drilling
The following sets forth information relating to our development wells drilled over the past three fiscal years.
Our success rates related to our gross development wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 67%, 100% and 100%, respectively.
Index to Financial Statements Exploration Drilling
The following sets forth information relating to our exploration drilling over the past three fiscal years.
Our success rates related to our gross exploration wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 80%, 75% and 86%, respectively.
Current Drilling Activity
During the period beginning January 1, 2010 and ending February 24, 2010, we participated in the drilling of one gross (1.0 net) unsuccessful exploratory well. We were in the process of drilling one gross (1.0 net) exploratory well as of February 24, 2010.
Item 3.
