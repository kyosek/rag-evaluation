Our telephone number is (604) 602-1675. We have an additional office located in Kelowna, British Columbia, where we have 1,200 square feet of office space, which includes several offices for a monthly rental of CAD$1,652. Our current locations provide adequate office space for our purposes at this stage of our development.
Resource Properties
As at October 31, 2013, our company currently owns a 42% gross working interest in the PPF12-1 and PPF12-3A wells; a 50% gross working interest in wells PP-4 and PP-5 all located in Mississippi under various agreements with Griffin and Griffin Exploration, L.L.C. The most significant of these wells are the producing oil wells PP-1, PP-3A, PP-4, and PP-5 located within the Belmont Lake oil field which is itself located in the Palmetto Point region. The Belmont Lake oil field is onshore, as are all of our company’s wells, but located in a flood plain of the Mississippi River which forces seasonal constraints on certain field activities. Other than the four oil wells noted immediately above, our company has no other producing wells. Additional details of these interests are noted below and not all of these wells were successful.
Subsequent to October 31, 2013, the working interest in the the 38 wells to be drilled has expired, and the Company has participated in the drilling of the PP-7 well with a working interest of 13.3% .
Mississippi: Palmetto Point Project
On December 21, 2005, our company agreed to purchase a 20% gross working and revenue interest in a 10 well drilling program in Palmetto Point, Mississippi owned by Griffin & Griffin Exploration for cash payments of $700,000, comprised of $220,000 paid upon entering the Agreement and the remaining balance of $480,000 paid on January 17, 2006. Our company applied the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties and as of July 31, 2009, seven wells were found to be proved wells, and three wells were found impaired. One of the wells was impaired due to uneconomic life, and the other two wells were abandoned due to no apparent gas or oil shows present. The costs of impaired properties were added to the capitalized cost in determination of the depletion expense. Palmetto Point is approximately 150 miles southwest of Jackson, Mississippi and approximately 50 miles north/northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It is 30 miles west of Woodville, Mississippi off of State Highway 33 and is entirely within Wilkinson County.
There were no further costs to our company in earning our interest in the 10 well drilling program, including well development costs or pipeline connections. Griffin has agreed that the leases held by it covering any mineral estate underlying the applicable well site acreage shall not provide for more than twenty-five (25%) percent royalty and overriding royalty interest. Our company’s net interest in any oil and gas produced is calculated by subtracting the applicable royalties from its 20% gross interest. Consequently, its original net working interest in the drilling program was a minimum fifteen (15%) percent net working interest. Griffin conducted the Drilling Program in its capacity as Operator and receives a 15% carried interest.
One of these original 10 wells was the PP-1 well, which was the discovery well of a field now known as the Belmont Lake field. All of these original 10 wells were targeting the Frio geological formation of the Cenozoic era and Oligocene series, which is characterized in this region as a generally shallow, sandstone-rich layer. In this area of Mississippi, the Frio geologic formation is generally found between 2,000 and 4,500 foot depth from surface.
On September 22, 2006, our company elected to participate in an additional two-well program in Palmetto Point, Mississippi owned by Griffin by paying an additional $140,000 (paid). Our company earned the same 20% gross interest in the two (2) additional wells (12 wells total and all drilled) and subsequently increased our gross interest to 32% in these 12 wells, or a net revenue interest of 20.802815% . As of July 31, 2009, the two wells were found to be proved wells.
On June 23, 2007, our company acquired an assignment of a 10% gross working interest in the Palmetto Point wells described above from a third party for $520,000 which was payable by a secured loan. The $520,000 loan was valued at a Net Present Value of $501,922, which is the capitalized amount. Our company calculated the net present value of the secured loan payable by applying 8% interest rate, which was based on a T-bill rate of 4.28% plus a risk premium.
On October 4, 2007, our company elected to participate in the drilling of the PP-3 well in Palmetto Point, Mississippi which was conducted by Griffin. This well was the second well drilled in the Belmont Lake oil field. Our company had a 30% gross working interest and paid $266,348. On July 31, 2008, our company accrued and paid an additional cost of $127,707 for the workovers of wells PP and PP-3. PP has had intermittent production from October 2007, and PP-3 has had intermittent production from November 2007.
On April 3, 2009, our company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Delta Oil & Gas, Inc., and The Stallion Group to acquire additional interests in its existing core producing Mississippi oil and gas properties. Our company paid $40,073 to acquire an additional two percent (2%) working interest in the proven Belmont Lake oil and gas field and an additional 10% working interest in potential nearby exploration wells. Total working interest for Belmont Lake as of July 31, 2009 is 32%; and total working interest in the exploration wells on approximately 140,000 acres surrounding Belmont Lake in all directions as of July 31, 2010, is 60%.
Our company had a short-lived opportunity to acquire additional fractional interests in the upcoming Belmont Lake 12-4 well which was expected to be a horizontal well. An unrelated third party did not participate in its right to participate in the 12-4 well, and therefore a share of its interest (a “non consent” interest) was made available to the other participating parties including our company. On August 28, 2009 and effective on September 1, 2009, to take best advantage of this opportunity, our company entered into four separate assignment agreements, three of which were with people or companies with related management. Our company received from these four parties proceeds of $371,609 to fund additional interests in this well. As a result, our company has a 25.84% perpetual gross interest in the well (18.0% net revenue interest); as well as a 5.2% net revenue interest in the non-consent interest. The non-consent interest remains valid until such time as the well produces 500% of all costs and expenses back to the participants in the form of revenue, at which time the non-consent interest ends. Enertopia, a company with related management, had acquired from our company a 6.16% perpetual gross interest in the 12-4 well; David DeMartini, a director of our company, had acquired from our company a 5% gross interest in the non-consent interest in the 12-4 well; and 0743608 BC Ltd. a company owned by the President of our company, had acquired from our companyour company a 11.60% gross interest in the non-consent interest in the 12-4 well.
On May 31, 2010, our company signed a Settlement Agreement with Enertopia Corp., whereby our company issued 499,893 units at $0.12 per unit. Each unit consists of one restricted share of our common stock and one share purchase warrant exercisable at $0.20 per share for a period of two years in exchange for the working interest initially assigned on August 28, 2009.
On June 16, 2010, our company signed a Settlement Agreement with a third party, who had originally participated in the August 28, 2009, opportunity in the non-consent interest for Belmont Lake 12-4. Our company returned $144,063 to the third party and cancelled its participation.
On July 29, 2010, our company had agreed with its Operators at Belmont Lake not to proceed to drill a horizontal 12-4 well. Rather, two of the three proposed vertical wells 12-2, 12-4, or 12-5 were proposed to be drilled in August 2010. To take best advantage of this opportunity, our company cancelled all previous agreements relating to August 28, 2009 with respect to Belmont Lake horizontal well 12-4 and entered into three separate assignment agreements, of which all three were with people or companies with related management. Our company received total proceeds of $324,677 to fund additional interests in these wells. As a result, our company has a 32% perpetual gross interest in the wells (24.0% net revenue interest); as well as a 8% gross interest (6% net revenue interest) in the non-consent interest. The non-consent interest remains valid until such time as the well produces 500% of all costs and expenses back to the participants in the form of revenue, at which time the non-consent interest ends. Emerald Atlantic LLC, a company owned by a director of our company, has acquired from our company a 8.74% gross interest in the non-consent interest in two of the three vertical wells; and 0743608 BC Ltd. a company owned by our president, has acquired from our company a 20.79% gross interest in the non-consent interest in two of the three vertical wells; an advisor to our company has acquired from our company 2.46% gross interest in the non-consent interest in two of the three vertical wells.
On September 13, 2010, Lexaria Corp. (the “Company”) entered into three separate assignment agreements, replacing the July 29, 2010 agreements with Kelowna Resources Group formerly known as 0743608 BC Limited, solely owned by a Director/Officer of the Company; Emerald Atlantic LLC, solely owned by a Director of the Company, and the Senior VP Business Development. (the “Assignees”), whereby the Assignees have paid a fee of US$408,116 to earn a 24% share of the Company’s gross non-perpetual 32% interest in the three oil wells being drilled in Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As a result of the three assignment agreements, Lexaria receives at no cost to the company, a carried interest of 8% in these same rights and benefits. The Company assigns, transfers and sets over to the Assignees, all proportionate rights, interest and benefits in the Assigned Non Perpetual Interest held by or granted to the Assignor in and to the Participation Agreement between the Company and Griffin but limited to a gross 500% revenue payout based on the total amount paid under the Initial Consideration and the Subsequent Consideration after which all rights, interests and benefits cease.
Total working interest for Belmont Lake as of October 31, 2013 is 42%, with the exception of a 50% interest in wells PP-4 and PP-5; and total working interest in the exploration wells on approximately 140,000 acres surrounding Belmont Lake in all directions as at October 31, 2013, is 60%.
During the year ended October 31, 2013, there were additional well interest changes or workovers pending of well PP-4 in the amount of $91,613 (2012: $378,967 for wells PP, PP, PP-3 and PP).
As of January 24, 2014, the status of the Palmetto Point, Mississippi wells is as follows:
Mississippi and Louisiana: Frio-Wilcox Project
After participating in the Palmetto Point project, we entered into a separate agreement that expanded both our percentage interest in future wells, and also expanded the geographical area on which those wells could be drilled.
On August 3, 2006, we entered into a Phase II agreement with Griffin, to acquire a working interest in multiple zones of potential oil and gas production in Mississippi and Louisiana. This agreement contemplates up to a 50 well drill program, which are exclusive to the participants, for Wilcox and Frio wells, at our company’s option, within the defined area of mutual interest (“AMI”). From these 50 prospects, Griffin and the participants will select all drill locations with the expectation that the wells will be drilled to depths sufficient to test prospectively for producible hydrocarbons from the top of the Frio Formation to the bottom of the Wilcox Formation.
These 50 wells are in addition to all wells drilled under the original 10-well agreement and also in addition to any development wells to be drilled at the Belmont Lake oil field discovery. The AMI originally included over 200,000 gross acres located non-contiguously between Southwest Mississippi and North East Louisiana which include the approximately 32,000 acres of the Palmetto Point area but also include other areas.
Our company had contracted to assume a 40% gross interest in this AMI, meaning we were obligated to pay 40% of costs related to licensing, permitting, drilling, completion and all other related costs. Upon payment of 40% of the costs, we earned a net 32% of all production from all producible zones to the base of the Frio formation (Frio Targets); and, 30% of all production to the base of the Wilcox formation (Wilcox Targets). All working interests are to be registered in the name of our company. This 50-well AMI was intended to be drilled in several stages.
Our company’s pro rata share of the first stage had a total cost $1.6 million. As of October 31 2007, we had placed $1,600,000 in trust to completely fund this initial commitment. During the drill program, an unrelated third party participant elected not to continue their participation in the program, and we assumed our pro-rata portion of their 10% gross working interest as our own, at no additional cost, bringing our total gross working interest in the seven (7) wells and their leases (Initial AMI Drilling Program), to 45%.
On June 21, 2007, we acquired an additional 10% from a third party for all rights, title and benefits excluding the seven wells drilled under the AMI Agreement between August 3, 2006 and June 19, 2007, specifically wells CMR-USA-39-14, Dixon #1, Faust #1 TEC, CMR/BR, RB Red Bug #2, BR, and Randall #1, and any offset wells that could be drilled to any of these specified wells (Subsequent AMI Drilling Program). This brought our interest in the remaining 43 wells to 50% and we drilled 5 wells under this arrangement.
On April 3, 2009, we acquired an additional 10% working interest in the 38 exploration wells remaining to be drilled, bringing its total gross working interest to 60% in the 38 wells that remain to be drilled of this original 50-well option in over 140,000 acres surrounding Belmont Lake in all directions.
On December 16, 2010, we entered into an assignment agreement with Emerald Atlantic LLC, a company solely owned by a director of our company, whereby Emerald Atlantic has paid a fee of $30,076 to earn 18% of a 4.423% share of our company’s net revenue interest after field operating expenses for a well USA 1-27 that was subsequently drilled in Wilkinson County and found to have no economic oil or gas reserves.
As of October 31, 2013, the AMI had expired as scheduled, and all related oil and gas acquisition and exploration costs have been written off.
Initial AMI Drilling Program
Our company’s pro rate share of the first stage had a total cost $1.6 million. As of October 31 2007, we had placed $1,600,000 in trust to completely fund this initial commitment. During the drill program, an unrelated third party participant elected not to continue their participation in the program, and we assumed our pro-rata portion of their 10% gross working interest as our own, at no additional cost, bringing our total gross working interest in these seven (7) drilled wells and their leases, to 45%.
We successfully drilled and completed seven (7) wells under this drilling program. Certain wells were placed into production.
Details of the drill program are outlined below:
In December 2006, the first well CMR-US 39-14 was found to have sufficient hydrocarbons to become economic. USA 1-37 and BR had started intermittent production from November 2007. Our company applied the full cost method to account for its oil and gas properties.
As at January 31, 2007, we abandoned Dixon #1 due to no economic hydrocarbons being present and $162,420 of drilling costs was added to the capitalized costs. The Dixon #1 was the only Wilcox well our company has drilled to date. Every other well we have participated in located in Mississippi and Louisiana is a Frio well. Slightly deeper than the Frio targets, but also of the Cenozoic era, the Wilcox geologic formation is of the Eocene series, generally found at depths of less than 8,000 feet.
On June 2, 2007, we abandoned Randall #1 and $107,672 drilling costs were added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
During August to October 2007, three additional wells, PP, PP, and PP were drilled in the area. These Frio wells were abandoned due to modest gas shows and a total of $306,562 drilling costs was added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
During December 2007, two additional wells, PPA and PP, were drilled and were plugged and abandoned due to non-economic gas shows. A total of $247,086 drilling costs were added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
During 2013 the following wells were plugged and abdoned:
BFR-33
US-39-14
USA 1-37
PPF-6B
PPF-118
PPF-42
PPF-36
PPF-39
PPF-40
PPF-52A
Subsequent AMI Drilling Program
Five additional wells were drilled under the 50-well AMI. Each of these wells encountered non commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and were plugged and abandoned. Effective October 31, 2013, the AMI has expired and all acquisition and exploration costs have been written off.
Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions
None to Report.
Production and Prices
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil and natural gas, and certain price and cost information for fiscal years ended October 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Productive Wells
The following table summarizes information at October 31, 2013, relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, but specifically exclude wells drilled and cased during the fiscal year that have yet to be tested for completion (e.g., all of the operated wells drilled by our company during this year have been cased in preparation for completion, but no operations have been initiated that would allow these wells to be productive). Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests in the gross wells.
Unaudited Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
The unaudited reserve estimates for Mississippi, as of October 31, 2013, were prepared by Veazey & Associates, an independent petroleum engineering firm.
The estimated proved reserves prepared by Veazey and Associates are summarized in the table below, in accordance with definitions and pricing requirements as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Prices paid for oil and natural gas vary widely depending upon the quality such as the Btu content of the natural gas, gravity of the oil, sulfur content and location of the production related to the refinery or pipelines.
There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating proved reserve quantities and in projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. In addition, reserve estimates of new discoveries that have little production history are more imprecise than those of properties with more production history. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed oil and gas reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Unaudited net quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil and natural gas (all located within United States) are as follows:
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas and oil reserves is as follows:
Year-end price per Bbl of oil used in making standardized measure determinations as of October 31, 2013 was $106.22
Estimated Net Quantities of Natural Gas and Oil Reserves:
The following table sets forth our proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed reserves at the end of October 31, 2013.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth the undeveloped and developed acreage, by area, held by us as of October 31, 2013. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Developed acres are acres, which are spaced or assignable to productive wells. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which we have a working interest. Net acreage is obtained by multiplying gross acreage by our working interest percentage in the properties. The table does not include acreage in which we have a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which we have not yet received leasehold assignments.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth our drilling activity during the years ended October 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
