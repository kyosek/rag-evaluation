Bolivia - San Bartolomé Mine
The San Bartolomé open pit silver mine, operated by Empresa Minera Manquiri SA (“Manquiri”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico Mountain bordering the town of Potosí, Bolivia. Access to the property and the Company’s processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potosí.
Silver production for 2009 was 7.5 million ounces compared to 2.9 million ounces in 2008. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2009 were $7.80 per ounce compared to $8.22 per ounce in 2008. Total cash costs per ounce (which includes production taxes and royalties) for 2009 were $10.48 per ounce compared to $10.53 per ounce in 2008.
The mineral rights for the San Bartolomé mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian State Mining Company (“COMIBOL”). Manquiri controls 67 square kilometers under lease from COMIBOL and 16,600 acres under lease from the cooperatives at San Bartolomé and approximately 17.8 square miles of concessions at the Khori Huasi property, a gold exploration target south of Potosí. The San Bartolomé lease agreements, executed between 1996 and 2003 and with 25 year
terms, are generally subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company acquired additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The Company incurred royalty payment obligations for these mining rights totaling $20.0 million and $6.6 million for the years ended 2009 and 2008, respectively.
On October 14, 2009, the state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining cooperatives who hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine its activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and the Company timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. It is uncertain at this time how long the temporary suspension will remain in place.
Coeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (“ASARCO”) on September 9, 1999. Manquiri’s principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolomé mine. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolomé.
We completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually. In 2003, SRK, an independent consulting firm, was retained to review the reserve/resource estimate to include additional sampling data to incorporate additional resources acquired with the Plahipo project at Cerro Rico. During 2003, we retained Fluor Daniel Wright to prepare an updated feasibility study which was completed at the end of the third quarter of 2004. The study provides for the use of a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit which will result in the production of a doré that may be treated by a number of refiners under a tolling agreement which results in the return of refined silver to the Company that is readily marketed by metal banks and brokers to the ultimate customer. During 2004, the Company obtained all operating permits and commercial construction activities commenced.
The Company’s total capital cost (excluding political risk insurance premiums and capitalized interest) to place the mine into production was $237.9 million. The property, plant and equipment were placed into service in June 2008 and are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventative maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility. Water is supplied to the property by a public water source.
In November 2007, Bolivia’s Congress approved a reform to the mining tax code. The Bolivia tax rate on most mining companies has increased from 25% to 37.5%. However, mining companies similar to San Bartolomé that produce a doré product will receive a 5% credit based upon their specific operation. Thus, the tax rate for San Bartolomé will be 32.5%.
The Company obtained political risk insurance policies from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation (“OPIC”) and another private insurer. The combined policies are in the amount of $155 million and cover Coeur up to the lesser of $131 million or 85% of any loss arising from expropriation, political violence or currency inconvertibility. The policy costs approximately $3.4 million per year, which was capitalized during the development and construction phases and is now included as a cost of inventory produced (estimated at approximately $0.21 per ounce of silver produced) over the term of the policies which expire in 2019 and 2024.
The silver mineralization at San Bartolomé is hosted in gravel (pallacos) and reworked gravel (sucu and troceras) deposits and oxide stockpiles and dumps from past mining that occurred on the flanks of Cerro Rico. Cerro Rico is a prominent mountain in the region that reaches an elevation of over 15,400 feet (over 4,700 meters). It is composed of Tertiary-aged volcanic and intrusive rocks that were emplaced into and over older sedimentary, and volcanic, basement rocks. Silver, along with tin and base metals, is located in multiple veins and vein swarms that occur in a northeast trending belt which transects Cerro Rico. The upper parts of the Cerro Rico mineralized system were subsequently eroded and re-deposited into the flanking gravel deposits. Silver is hosted in all portions of the
pallacos, sucus, and troceras with the best grades segregated to the coarser-grained silicified fragments. These deposits lend themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. Of the several pallaco deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo and Santa Rita.
In 2009, exploration at San Bartolomé consisted of collecting additional data from new pits (pozos) to further define and/or expand the ore reserves.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - San Bartolomé Mine
Year-end Mineralized Material - San Bartolomé Mine
Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2009. The metal price used for current ore reserves was $13.25 per ounce of silver.
(2)
Ore reserves are open pit-minable and include variable mining recovery factors from 96.1 to 100%
(3)
Metallurgical recoveries are variable per ore type but average 62.2% based on operating experience to date for silver and should be applied to the total contained silver ounces.
(4)
Ore reserves were prepared by G. Blaylock (consultant Mining Engineer) and J. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s technical staff.
(5)
Proven and probable ore reserves are defined by surface drill holes and pits (pozos) with an average spacing of no more than 70 meters. Proven reserves are those reserves in stockpile at the end of 2009. The grade of ore reserve block is determined by the grade of proximal drill hole and/or pit composites and three-dimensional models of geologic controls. A minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 composite were used to classify proven and probable ore reserves and variable geostatistical estimation variances. Mineralized material is similarly classified.
(6)
Includes production taxes and royalties, if applicable.
(7)
Costs per ounce of silver represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs.”
Argentina - Martha Mine
The Martha mine is an underground silver and gold mine owned and operated by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which is located in the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina. Access to the mine is provided by all-weather gravel roads 30 miles northeast of the town of Gobernador Gregores.
Production at the Martha mine in 2009 was approximately 3.7 million ounces of silver and 4,709 ounces of gold compared to 2.7 million ounces of silver and 3,313 ounces of gold in 2008. The 36.8% increase in silver production was primarily due to an 90.0% increase in tons milled as a result of increased processing of ore stockpile in 2009. Cash operating costs per ounce for 2009 were $6.19 per ounce compared to $6.87 per ounce in 2008. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $6.68 in 2009 compared to $7.57 in 2008. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce was attributed to the increase in silver production as compared to 2008 due to a significant increase in tons milled in 2009. The Company expects active mining operations will cease in late 2010 unless additional mineralization is discovered during the year. In addition, the Company is pursuing strategic alternatives for Martha.
The mineral rights for the Martha property are fully-owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. totaling 195 square miles (50,623 hectares) of exploration concessions (claims), 86.4 square miles (22,377 hectares) of discovery concessions, and 0.54 square miles (142 hectares) of exploitation concessions. Martha is centered on the exploitation concessions, which fully cover the area of the mine infrastructure and the ore reserves reported herein. Concessions do not have an expiration date; subject only to required annual fees. Surface rights covering the Martha deposit are controlled by the 137.8 square mile (35,705-hectare) Cerro 1o de
Abril Estancia which is owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Included on the estancia is a 60-person man camp, mine and exploration offices, and assay lab.
The Company acquired the property in 2002 through the purchase of a subsidiary of Yamana Resources Inc. for $2.5 million. The prior owner conducted minor underground mining on the near-surface portion of the Martha vein from late 2000 to mid 2001. The Company is obligated to pay a 2% net smelter royalty on silver and gold production to Royal Gold Corporation granted by Yamana Resources. In addition, the Company is subject to a 3.0% net proceeds royalty payable to the Province of Santa Cruz. The Company incurred royalty payments totaling $1.8 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Prior to 2008, ore from the Martha mine was trucked approximately 600 miles by road for processing at the Company’s Cerro Bayo mill located approximately 270 miles away. In 2007, the Company commenced the construction of a 240 ton per day flotation mill which was completed in December 2007 and produces a flotation concentrate. During December 2007, the newly-constructed facility commenced operating. In 2008, concentrate began to be shipped to a third-party smelter located in Mexico. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is provided by Company-owned diesel generators.
Total capital expenditures at the Martha mine in 2009 were $1.6 million and the Company plans approximately $0.4 million of additional capital expenditures in 2010.
At Martha, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Chon Aike Formation. The veins and veinlets occur as sub-parallel clusters largely trending west-northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy) and native silver.
During 2009, we spent $3.1 million on exploration near the Martha Mine in the Santa Cruz province and $0.8 million on reserve development at the Martha mine to discover new silver- and gold-bearing veins and define new reserves. In 2009, exploration tested extensions at depth and on strike on the Martha, R4, Catalina, Francisca, Belen, Esperanza and Isabel and Betty ore-bearing structures. A total of 61,266 feet (18,764 meters) of drilling was completed in 2009.

Chile - Cerro Bayo Mine
The Cerro Bayo District is located south of Coyhaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and due west of the town of Chile Chico. The underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facilities lie on the east side of the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and are serviced by an all-weather gravel road from Chile Chico.
There was no production during 2009 because of the temporary suspension. Production at the Cerro Bayo mine in 2008 was approximately 1.2 million ounces of silver and 21,761 ounces of gold. Cash costs per ounce of silver produced in 2008 were $8.56.
The mineral rights for the Cerro Bayo property are fully-controlled by Compañia Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd. (CMCB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, encompassing an 89 square mile contiguous block (23,106 hectares) of exploitation concessions and 18.1 square miles (4,700 hectares) of exploration concessions. The Company also controls several other concessions southeast of the Cerro Bayo District. The Company’s ore reserves
and rights to operate are fully-contained within the exploitation concessions and separate surface use agreements from private surface land owners. Exploitation concessions are maintained by annual payments (taxes).
The Company acquired the property in 1990 from Freeport Chilean Exploration Company. No mining or processing was conducted by the prior owner. Initial mining and processing commenced, by the Company in 1995, at the Laguna Verde area, in the western portion of the holdings. Mining and processing temporarily ceased in late 2000 then recommenced in 2002 at the Cerro Bayo area on the east. The entire holdings and infrastructure are now referred to as the Cerro Bayo district. Construction of two ramps to intersect the high-grade Lucero Vein, in the Cerro Bayo zone on the east side of its holdings, commenced in November 2001. Additional mineralized high-grade gold and silver vein systems were discovered since then from surface and underground exploration.
The ore processing mill for the Cerro Bayo Mine uses a standard flotation process to produce a high grade gold and silver concentrate. The mill has a design capacity of 1,650 tons per day. On October 31, 2008, the Company announced a temporary suspension of operating activities at the Cerro Bayo mine due primarily to lower metal prices and continuing higher operating costs. The Company has placed the Cerro Bayo mine under a care and maintenance plan, while undertaking efforts to further explore its holdings and develop a new mine plan and ore reserves in an effort to re-commence operations. The Company is also pursuing strategic alternatives for the Cerro Bayo mine. The property, plant and equipment are maintained in good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility as well as generators. Mining is conducted utilizing underground methods. Total capital expenditures at the Cerro Bayo property in 2009 were $1.1 million. The Company does not plan to incur capital expenditures in 2010.
Silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets and lesser amounts of stockworks and breccias within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Ibañez Formation. Veins and veinlets occur in sub-parallel clusters largely trending north-northwest and dipping steeply to the west or east. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite and electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy). Numerous epithermal veins located within the Cerro Bayo district offer exploration and development opportunities for us. To date, we have discovered over 100 veins.
During 2009, the Company continued its exploration and development program in the district with its efforts concentrated in the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde zones in the east and west sections of the Company’s land holdings. In 2009, $2.7 million was spent on exploration in Chile and $1.0 million on reserve development at Cerro Bayo with 108,700 feet (33,130 meters) of core drilling completed during the year. Most of this drilling was focused on exploration and definition of the new Delia silver and gold-bearing vein discovered approximately one half mile south of the ore processing facilities at Laguna Verde and other targets at Cerro Bayo. Other targets drilled were Granja Temer, Polvorin, Cerro Coigues, Trinidad, Caiquenes, Juncos, Gaby and Taitao, also all near the ore processing facilities. District reconnaissance identified new targets at Zona 2, Ema, Brillantes and Cerro Bayo Este for future drilling. The Company plans to continue its exploration programs in the Chile and the Cerro Bayo district in 2010 with a budget of $0.9 million for this work.

North America
Mexico - Palmarejo Silver and Gold Mine
On December 21, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bolnisi Gold NL (“Bolnisi”) and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation (“Palmarejo”) resulting in 100% ownership of the Palmarejo mine. The Palmarejo mine commenced commercial production on April 20, 2009. The Palmarejo mine is an open-pit and underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facility, located in the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico. Access to the Palmarejo property is by paved and all weather dirt roads southwest from the capital city of Chihuahua.
In its initial year of operations, production at the Palmarejo mine was 3.0 million ounces of silver and 54,740 ounces of gold. Cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce of silver for 2009 were $9.80. Operational results continue to improve and the Company now expects production for 2010 to be approximately 7.9 million ounces of silver and approximately 109,000 ounces of gold.
The Company’s property position at Palmarejo consists of 32 mining concessions totaling 46.9 square miles (12,141 hectares). Of the total concessions, 23 concessions consisting of 46.1 square miles (11,949 hectares) are owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. (Coeur Mexicana), formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), and the remaining nine concessions, representing 0.74 square miles (191.96 hectares) are held by Coeur Mexicana under various agreements and leases. All of the company’s reserves are located on concessions owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana. All concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until at least 2029. In addition to Palmarejo, the Company also acquired the Yecora exploration-stage property located in Sonora, on the border with Chihuahua, and the El Realito and La Guitarra exploration-stage properties in Chihuahua.
Total capital costs in 2009 were $162.8 million. The Company incurred $190.3 million of capital expenditures in 2008. All property and equipment are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. Power is supplied to the property by the local power utility as well as by generators. Water is supplied to the property by pipeline from the Chinipas River and also from recycled process water collected at site.
Commercial production commenced in April 2009, and the commissioning of the plant continued during the second half of 2009. Recovery of gold has been consistent with metallurgical testwork and feasibility study estimations, and averaged 88.2% during 2009. The recovery of silver has not achieved the feasibility study values and averaged 66.3% during 2009. Consequently, during the fourth quarter, the Company conducted substantial
metallurgical test work and third party reviews of the processing plant, which led to a number of improvements now being implemented and causing silver recoveries to increase during January and February.
The terrain at the Palmarejo mine is characterized by steep-sided hills and V-shaped valleys, although sites for mining infrastructures such as a mill should not pose a significant problem. Dumps and tailings will likely need to be placed within the upper reaches of drainage valleys, which would require the construction of a retention dam(s).
The Palmarejo mine is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest-trending Sierra Madre Occidental is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo mine area, locally forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico.
The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo mine, typical of many of the other silver and gold deposits in the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits, and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias and fractures. These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on the structures ranges from about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures gold and silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit to a gold-rich basal portion, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization. The Palmarejo property contains a number of mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the far north of the concessions which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine based on the northwest-southeast trending La Prieta and La Blanca gold-silver bearing structures. In addition to Palmarejo, mineralized vein and alteration systems in the Trogan license area have been identified on other strongly mineralized corridors, roughly sub-parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including Animas) and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property and are currently under investigation by the Company’s exploration teams.
The Company spent $7.6 million on exploration in Mexico of which $7.4 million was committed to the Palmarejo District in 2009, to discover new silver and gold mineralization and define new ore reserves. This program consisted of drilling 136,024 feet (41,460 meters) of core drilling at Palmarejo and 5,154 feet (1,571 meters) on other targets in Mexico. The exploration budget for Mexico for 2010 is $9.2 million of which $8.4 million is allocated to the Palmarejo district.

USA - Rochester Mine
The Rochester Mine is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, which is located approximately 25 paved and all-weather gravel road miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The Company owns 100% of the Rochester Mine by virtue of its 100% ownership of its subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. (“Coeur Rochester”). The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, due south of Rochester.
Production at the Rochester mine in 2009 was approximately 2.2 million ounces of silver and 12,663 ounces of gold, compared to approximately 3.0 million ounces of silver and 21,041 ounces of gold in 2008. Production was lower due to decreased ounces recovered from the ore on leach pad. Cash operating costs per ounce of silver increased to $1.95 per ounce in 2009, compared to $(0.75) per ounce in 2008. Total cash costs per ounce of silver (which includes production taxes and royalties) were $2.58 per ounce in 2009 compared to $(0.03) per ounce in 2008. This increase was primarily due to lower by-product credit of gold production in 2009 compared to 2008.
Coeur Rochester controls 541 US Federal unpatented claims (including 54 mill sites), 23 patented claims, and leases an additional 53 unpatented claims, totaling approximately 7,200 acres. All of the Company’s mineral resources and reserves are located within the claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and to Pershing County, which acts as administrator of the claims. Real property taxes to the State of Nevada are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually; all leases are in good standing.
The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired initial interest in the adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003. Very limited mining and processing was conducted at Nevada Packard by the prior owner. Collectively, the Rochester and Nevada Packard properties comprise the Company’s Rochester silver and gold mining and processing operation.
In August of 2007, the Company completed mining of the existing ore reserves. While mining operations were discontinued, it is expected that metal production will continue as a result of residual leaching until approximately 2014.
The Rochester Mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid, telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office facilities. All of these facilities are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. The mine utilizes the heap leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined using conventional open pit methods.
Based upon actual operating experience and certain metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate recovery rates from the crushed ore of between 59.0% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and 93% for gold. See Note C - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
The Company completed a technical and economic study in early 2010 demonstrating the viability of an expansion of mining and leaching operations at its Rochester mine through 2017. The Company prepared an Amended Plan of Operations for resumption of mining within the existing and permitted Rochester Pit and construction of an additional heap leach pad, all within the currently permitted mine boundary. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deemed this plan complete in August 2009 under federal regulations and initiated the NEPA process. An Environmental Assessment is currently being prepared and approvals are anticipated in late summer 2010. A modification to the Water Pollution Control Permit will also be required from the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection. Application is pending and approvals are expected in a similar time period.
The Company’s capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine totaled approximately $0.3 million in 2009. The Company plans capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine of $0.8 million in 2010. The Company is obligated to pay a net smelter royalty interest only when the market price of silver equals or exceeds $22.87 per ounce up to a maximum rate of 5% to ASARCO, the prior owner. No royalties were required to be paid by the Company during the three years ended December 31, 2009.
At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, argentian tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein and vein swarms and stockworks) with variable but lesser amounts of pyrite.
In 2009, exploration expenditures consisted of evaluation of prior drilling results and target selection for 2010. The Company has plans to follow-up on targets in the Rochester and Nevada Packard area and has allocated $0.2 million for the first phase of drilling in 2010.

Operating Data
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2009. Metal prices used in calculating proven and probable reserves were $14.50 per ounce of silver and $850 per ounce of gold.
(2)
Reserves were estimated with a cutoff grade of 0.54 silver equivalent ounces per ton.
(3)
The mineralized material was estimated with gold and silver prices of $1100 and $17.00 per ounce, respectively, historical metallurgical recoveries for gold and silver, historical mine operating costs within a non-optimized Whittle®
open pit model, and include no additional factors for mining dilution or recovery. The estimate of mineralized material and reserves was constrained to exclude any silver and gold mineralization beneath existing leaching operations.
(4)
The Company estimates the ultimate metallurgical recovery to be approximately 61% for silver and 92% for gold. However, ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease.. Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery, calculated based on the ounces recovered as a percent of the ounces placed on the pad. The ore reserves were estimated by J. Sims (Geologist) and C. Kiel (Superintendent of Rochester Technical Services) of the Company’s technical staff. The firm of Pincock, Allen & Holt, an independent consulting group, was used to review engineering studies and the consulting firm of Reserva International was used to model results from drilling l.
(5)
Ore reserves are defined by drilling on grid of 100 feet by 200 feet, or closer, and includes open pit mine production sampling to assist with determination of gold and silver grades. The grade is defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. The number of drill samples used in estimation of grades must be at least 4 with a maximum search distance 150 feet at Rochester and 120 feet at Nevada Packard.
(6)
Mining and crushing operations terminated in August 2007 and are planned to resume in 2010. L leaching will continue until approximately 2 years following depletion of the ore reserves.

Australia
New South Wales - Endeavor Mine
The Endeavor Mine, is an underground silver and base metal operation, located in north central New South Wales, Australia, about 447 miles (720 kilometers) from Sydney. Access to the mine is by paved roads 30 miles (18 kilometers) to the northwest from the community of Cobar.
Production at the Endeavor mine in 2009 was 461,800 ounces of silver compared to 824,093 ounces of silver in 2008. The decrease in silver production was due to a 46.3% decrease in tons milled partially offset by a 18.4% increase in ore grades as compared to 2008. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per ounce of silver produced were $6.80 in 2009 compared to $2.55 in 2008. This increase was primarily due to the price participation component of the transaction which was not in effect until 2009.
The ore reserves at Endeavor are covered by five consolidated mining leases issued by the state of New South Wales to Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”). The leases form a contiguous block of 10,121 acres in size and expire between 2019 and 2027.
The Endeavor Mine has been in production since 1983. On September 12, 2003, CBH acquired the Elura mine and processing facilities from Pasminco and changed the name to the Endeavor Mine. On May 23, 2005, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (“CDE Australia”), acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine, which is owned and operated by CBH, for $44.0 million including transaction fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25 per ounce is also payable by CDE Australia in respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007, $2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable silver reserves under the terms of the contract. This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests acquired and is being amortized using the units of production method.
On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-sharing provision is deferred until such time as CDE Australia has received approximately two million cumulative ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever is later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. The conditions relating to the second payment were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In January 2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on April 1, 2008, plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. CDE Australia has received approximately 2.5 million payable ounces to-date, and the current ore reserve contains approximately 9.8 million payable ounces based on current metallurgical recovery and current smelter contract terms. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the modified contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a result of the conversion of portions of the property’s existing inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries. CBH conducts regular exploration to discover new mineralization and to define reserves from surface and underground drilling platforms.
As of December 31, 2009, CDE Australia had recovered approximately 50% of the transaction consideration consisting of 2.5 million payable ounces, or 13%, of the 20 million maximum payable silver ounces to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement. No assurances can be made that the mine will achieve its 20 million payable silver ounce cap to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement.
The mine employs bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is sold to a third-party smelter. Silver recovery averaged approximately 49.9% in 2009 and 56.5% in 2008. Power to the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local communities. The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition, by CBH, through a regular preventive maintenance program with periodic improvements as required.
The Company is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine.
At Endeavor, silver, lead, zinc and lesser amounts of copper mineralization are contained within sulfide lenses hosted in fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic-aged Amphitheatre Group. Sulphide lenses are elliptically-shaped, steeply-dipping to the southwest and strike to the northwest. Principal ore minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead and zinc rich sulphide zones.
CBH conducts regular exploration to define new reserves at the mine from both underground and surface core drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, which is the fiscal year used by the operator (CBH), the exploration expenditure at the mine was A$2.5 million (US$2.0 million).

Discontinued Operation
New South Wales - Broken Hill Mine
Effective July 1, 2009, the Company sold to Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. its 100% interest in silver contained at the Broken Hill mine for $55.0 million in cash. As a result of this transaction, the Company realized a gain on the sale in the third quarter of 2009 of approximately $25.5 million, net of income taxes. Coeur originally purchased this interest from Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. in September 2005 for $36.9 million. This transaction closed on July 30, 2009.
Silver production in 2009 from the Broken Hill mine amounted to approximately 0.8 million ounces of silver compared to 1.4 million ounces of silver in 2008. The decrease in silver production was due to the sale of the company’s interest in the silver production from the Broken Hill mineral interests on July 1, 2009. The cash cost per ounce of silver production, which includes the operating cost contribution and smelting, refining and transportation costs, was $3.40 in 2009 compared to $3.41 in 2008.

SILVER AND GOLD DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
USA - Alaska - Kensington Gold Project
The Kensington underground gold project, consisting of the Kensington and adjacent Jualin properties, is located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The mine will be accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilize conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. The ore will be processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which will be sold to third party smelters. Waste material will be deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied to the site by on-site diesel generators. Access to the project is presently by helicopter, float plane or boat from Juneau.
The Company estimates $81.7 million of remaining capital expenditures are required to complete construction and mine related activities at Kensington and to commence production during the third quarter of 2010. Production during the mine’s initial partial year is expected to be approximately 40,000 ounces of gold. Based on an initial 12.5 year mine life based solely on proven and probable mineral reserves, the Company expects gold production to average approximately 120,000 ounces annually and total operating costs to average approximately $475 per ounce annually.
Coeur Alaska, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Coeur Alaska”), controls two contiguous land groups: the Kensington and Jualin. The Kensington property consists of 51 private patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 766 acres, 294 federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 3,127 acres, and eight State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 95 acres. The Company controls the Jualin Property, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, through the cessation of mining, so long as the Company makes timely payments pursuant to the lease agreement. The Jualin Property consists of 23 patented lode and mill-site claims covering approximately 383.6 acres, 438 federal unpatented lode claims and one unpatented mill-site claim covering approximately 7,911 acres, and 17 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 110 acres. The Federal and State claims, as well as the private patented lode and mill-site claims, provide Coeur with the necessary rights to mine and process ore from Kensington. All of the Company’s ore reserves are located within the patented claims. The unpatented claims and mill site are maintained via annual filings and fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which acts as administrator of the claims. State claims are maintained via filings and fees to ADNR - Juneau Recorder’s Office. Real property taxes to the State of Alaska are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing.
The property is located on the east side of Lynn Canal between Juneau and Haines, Alaska. Coeur Alaska is obligated to pay a scaled net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur Alaska recoups the $32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after July 7, 1995 in connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at $400 per ounce gold prices to a maximum of 21/2% at gold prices above $475 per ounce, with the royalty to be capped at 1.0 million ounces of production.
On June 22, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that invalidated the previously issued Section 404 Permit for the tailings facility for the Kensington gold mine. The Kensington property litigation, described in Note U of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, “Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge”, has contributed to an increase in capital costs.
Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision, on August 14, 2009, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers re-activated the Company’s 404 permit, clearing the way for construction at the tailing facility to continue.
Construction activities have recommenced at the Kensington mine and production is expected to begin in the second half of 2010.
No assurances can be given as to whether or when regulatory permits and approvals granted to the Company may be further challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing agencies, or as to whether the Company will ultimately place the Kensington project into commercial production.
The Kensington ore deposit consists of multiple precious metals bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate, pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in the Cretaceous age Jualin diorite. The gold-telluride-mineral calaverite is associated with the pyrite mineralization.
In 2009, the Company continued the exploration program started in the third quarter of 2005 designed to increase the size and geologic continuity of gold mineralization in its mineralized material inventory and ultimately result in an increase in ore reserves. In 2009, a total of $0.3 million was spent on this program.
Year-end Proven and Probable Ore Reserves - Kensington Property
Year-end Mineralized Material - Kensington Property
(1)
Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2009. Metal price used in calculating proven and probable reserves was $750 per ounce of gold.
(2)
The ore reserves are underground minable and include factors for mining dilution and recovery. A factor of approximately 10% additional tonnage at 0.063 ounces per ton of dilution was included. An average 97% mining recovery was included.
(3)
Metallurgical recovery factor of 95.3% should be applied to the contained gold reserve ounces.
(4)
The ore reserves were estimated by J. Barry (Mine Engineer) and J. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s technical staff. Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, an independent consultant group, performed an independent review of the Company’s updated resource estimate model used to prepare the ore reserve estimates and AMEC, an independent consultant group, were used to help prepare the Company’s mine plan and mining cost estimates.
(5)
Proven and probable reserves are defined underground drilling and underground workings. In practice, reserve blocks are defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. Proven ore
reserves include stockpiled ore. Ore reserve must be defined by at least 10 drill samples from at least 2 drill holes spaced not more than 60 feet from the block center. Mineralized material is similarly classified.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY
Coeur, either directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns, leases and has interests in certain exploration-stage mining properties located in the United States, Chile, Argentina, Tanzania, Bolivia, and Mexico. Exploration and reserve development expenditures of approximately $18.9 million, $23.6 million and $11.9 million were incurred by the Company in 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Highlights of the 2009 program include:
•
Drilling and engineering studies on the Guadalupe structure at Palmarejo led to estimation of the first proven and probable ore reserve estimate for that important gold and silver system in south east Palmarejo.
•
Discovery of new high-grade mineralization at the La Negra zone at Joaquin in Argentina located northwest of the Company’s Martha mill facility.
•
Discovery of a new gold-bearing vein and vein system at Kensington called Kimberly. Fourteen core holes were completed on this new discovery.
•
Definition drilling on the Delia vein at Cerro Bayo, discovered in late 2008, resulting in the first proven and probable ore reserve estimate for that gold and silver-bearing vein.
Coeur plans to spend $17.9 million in exploration during 2010 with approximately 80% of the budget earmarked for expansion of mineral resources and reserves at or near its existing operations at Palmarejo (Mexico), Kensington (Alaska), Rochester (Nevada), Martha (Argentina) and Cerro Bayo (Chile).
USA - Kensington/Jualin
Fourteen core holes, totaling 4,100 feet, were completed in 2009 at Kensington. This work targeted a new blind vein (not exposed on surface) called the Kimberly. Eight of the core holes intersected significant gold mineralization in Kensington-style veins. The Company plans for an additional drilling program in 2010 on Kimberly and other targets with a budget of $2.0 million. Approximately $0.3 million was spent in exploration in 2009 at Kensington; all at Jualin.
USA - Rochester
The Company did not explore around the Rochester and Nevada Packard deposits in 2009 but used results from 2008 and prior years drilling to assess the viability of recommencing mining and leaching of new ore and in combination with existing leaching of prior-placed ore, extend the mine life and production. In 2010, the Company has allocated $0.2 million for exploration.
Chile - Cerro Bayo Mine
Coeur continued to conduct extensive exploration at its 100%-owned Cerro Bayo gold/silver mining operation in southern Chile. Approximately $2.2 million was spent in exploration for new silver and gold-bearing veins, and an additional $1.0 million was capitalized as reserve development during 2009. Over 103,900 feet (31,700 meters) of core drilling was completed during the year to discover new mineralization and define new ore reserves. The most significant result of this program was the expansion and definition of new ore reserves at the Delia vein discovered near the Laguna Verde ore processing facility in 2008. Silver and gold mineralization at Delia extends for over 1 kilometer on strike and over 100 meters vertically and forms a significant part of the reserves at Cerro Bayo. The Company believes that there is potential to discover additional high grade veins within the entire Cerro Bayo district. Late in 2009, new veins were discovered west of the mill facilities in a zone called Zona 2 and due east of the Cerro Bayo Dome in the eastern part of the district.
Chile - Other Properties
In 2009, Coeur completed a phase one drilling program on the Huantajaya silver property in northern Chile. During 2009, first phase of reverse circulation drilling totaling 4,783 feet (1,458 meters) was completed at Huantajaya at a total cost of $0.6 million including supports costs in Santiago. This work was not successful defining significant new mineralization. The 2010 exploration budget for Chile is expected to be $0.5 million.
Argentina - Martha Mine
In 2009, the Company’s exploration efforts consisted of mapping, sampling and 61,266 feet (18,674 meters) of core drilling for a total expenditure of $3.3 million, of which $0.8 million was capitalized as reserve development at Martha. At the Martha mine area, drilling amounted to over 35,400 feet (10,799 meters) of the total for Argentina.
Argentina - Other Properties
The Company also continued exploration in other parts of the Santa Cruz Province near the Martha mine. Activities focused on the Nico, Satelite and Joaquin properties as well as targets near to the Martha mine. A total of over 25,700 feet of drilling (7,039 meters) was completed on these areas. During 2010, we expect to spend $3.3 million on exploration for the discovery of new mineralization and reserve development, across all our large land holdings in the province of Santa Cruz.
Drilling at Joaquin in the fourth quarter of 2009 returned encouraging results with of drilling on three targets; La Morena, La Negra and La Morocha. Joaquin is located about 80 kilometers north of the Company’s Martha mine, and the Company has an option to earn up to 71% managing interest in a joint venture with property owners Mirasol Resources Ltd. A fourth phase of drilling will begin early this year.
The Company has budgeted $3.3 million for 2010 in Argentina, Joaquin and reconnaissance exploration in the country.
Africa, Tanzania
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company acquired ten prospecting licenses for properties located in the Lake Victoria Gold Belt of Tanzania, Africa, and in 2005, 2006 and 2007 added the Saragurwa, Bismark and Pangea properties, respectively. Based on results from its annual exploration programs, four of the original ten concessions were not renewed. Except for Saragurwa, Bismark and Pangea, all properties are held 100% by Tanzanian subsidiaries of the Company. Saragurwa, Bismark and Pangea were all returned to their respective owners. The Company changed its business plan in 2009 and actively sought to attract a partner or buyer for its interests and companies.
