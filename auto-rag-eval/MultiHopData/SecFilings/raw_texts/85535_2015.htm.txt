ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have royalty or streaming interests and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage royalties and streams, as well their respective reserves, are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have royalties, including reports filed with the
SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The description of our principal royalties and streams set forth below includes the location, operator, royalty or stream rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which royalty and stream interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our royalty and stream interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such royalty and stream interests are no longer principal to our business. Currently, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically) to be principal to our business.
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
As of June 30, 2015, we owned a royalty equivalent to 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the deposit at the Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold, and 50% of the gold produced in excess of 910,000 payable ounces of gold. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 259,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold. Please refer to Item 1, Business, Recent Business Developments, for an update on our interest at Andacollo.
Andacollo is an open-pit copper mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by CMCA. Andacollo is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo project by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Gold production at Andacollo decreased approximately 21% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in production is primarily due to reduced mill throughput associated with unplanned maintenance activities during the September 2015 quarter and planned maintenance activities during the March 2015 quarter. Teck expects higher mill throughput rates during the remainder of calendar 2015.
Andacollo production attributable to Royal Gold, resulting from our new streaming interest, will switch to metal sales completed in the quarter (instead of provisional estimated ounces in concentrate and true-ups based upon final smelter settlements). The eleven concentrate shipments (approximately 22,900 ounces of contained gold based on provisional weights and assays) that were not final settled as of June 30, 2015 will be subject to the new stream agreement. Andacollo will deliver gold to RGLD Gold within five business days following the end of the month in which final smelter settlement occurs. RGLD Gold typically sells gold ounces over a three week period following physical receipt. Andacollo final settlements generally take 5-6 months from the bill-of-lading date. The difference in timing between Andacollo quarterly production and final smelter settlements may result in divergences of ounces between Teck's figures and those reported by Royal Gold for future quarters.
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a large open-pit and underground mine, utilizing mill and heap leach processing. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline, South Pipeline, part of the Gap pit and Crossroads deposits which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)Reserve Claims ("GSR1"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the "Reserve Claims," which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR royalty rate on the Reserve Claims is tied to the gold price as shown in the table below and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation.
(b)GAS Claims ("GSR2"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the "GAS Claims," which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR royalty rate on the GAS Claims, as shown in the table below, is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation.
(c)Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty ("GSR3"). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)Net Value Royalty ("NVR1"). This is a fixed 1.25% NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. The Company owns 81.098% of the 1.25% NVR (or 1.014%) while limited partners in Crescent Valley Partners, L.P., which is consolidated in our financial statements, own the remaining portion of
the 1.25% NVR. A 0.618% portion of our NVR1 royalty covers the mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
The following shows the current sliding-scale GSR1 and GSR2 royalty rates under our royalty agreement with Cortez:
Production at Cortez increased 140% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, as surface mining activity increased at the Pipeline and Gap pits, where our royalty applies, while no significant activity occurred in these areas during the prior fiscal year. Barrick has indicated that mining in calendar 2015 will include Cortez Hills, which is not subject to our interest, and Crossroads pre-stripping. As a result, production subject to our interests is expected to be lower during the remainder of calendar 2015.
Holt (Ontario, Canada)
We own a sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Holt portion of the Holloway-Holt mining project located in Ontario, Canada and owned 100% by St Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ("St Andrew"). The Holloway-Holt project straddles Ontario Provincial Highway 101 for approximately 25 miles beginning east of Matheson, Ontario, Canada and extending to the Quebec, Canada border. The sliding-scale NSR royalty rate on gold produced from the Holt portion of the mining project is derived by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. For example, at a quarterly average gold price of $1,300 per ounce, the effective royalty rate payable would be 16.9%.
Production at Holt decreased approximately 1% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. St Andrew reported higher tonnes milled and lower grades during the period.
Mount Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 52.25% of the payable gold produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by Thompson Creek Metals Company, Inc. ("Thompson Creek"). The cash purchase price is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price. The Mount Milligan project is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The
Mount Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Mount Milligan began the commissioning and start-up phase during the third quarter of calendar 2013 and reached commercial production as of February 2014. Ramp-up activities continued throughout calendar 2014 and are ongoing. Thompson Creek management reported during the second half of calendar 2014 that additional crushing capacity is necessary to reach 60,000 tonnes per day on a consistent basis and temporary crushing was initiated. Due to current metal prices, construction of a secondary crushing circuit will not commence until market conditions improve.
Throughput and production were negatively impacted by unscheduled mechanical issues in the grinding and flotation circuits in the mill and by frozen ore and plugged feeders during the first quarter of calendar 2015. Thompson Creek reported solutions are underway to address the issues experienced during the first quarter, and it remains Thompson Creek's objective to achieve daily mill throughput of approximately 60,000 tonnes per by the end of calendar 2015.
In light of first quarter calendar 2015 operational results, Thompson Creek revised its calendar 2015 gold production guidance to 200,000-220,000 payable ounces from 220,000-240,000 payable ounces. Despite the revision, the updated guidance represents an increase in payable gold production from calendar 2014 of approximately 13% to 18%. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, Thompson Creek reported its highest average daily mill throughput of 44,940 tonnes per day, and for May and June 2015 averaged 49,913 tonnes, which is over 80% of design capacity.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, RGLD Gold purchased approximately 74,300 ounces of physical gold. RGLD Gold sold approximately 76,900 ounces of gold during the period at an average price of $1,223.77 per ounce, and had approximately 5,300 ounces of gold in inventory as of June 30, 2015.
Mount Milligan delivers gold to RGLD Gold within two business days of the receipt of the final smelter settlement proceeds, and RGLD Gold typically sells gold ounces over a three week period following physical receipt. Mount Milligan final settlements generally take five months from the bill-of-lading date. The difference in timing between Mount Milligan quarterly production results and final smelter settlements may result in divergences of ounces between Thompson Creek's figures and those reported by Royal Gold for each quarter.
Mulatos (Sonora, Mexico)
We own a 1.0% to 5.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Mulatos open-pit mine and heap leach operation in southeastern Sonora, Mexico. The Mulatos mine is located approximately 137 miles east of the city of Hermosillo and 186 miles south of the border with the United States, and is operated by a subsidiary of Alamos Gold, Inc. ("Alamos"). Access to the mine from the city of Hermosillo is available via private chartered flight or ground transportation on a paved and gravel road.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based on the gold price as shown in the following table:
The Mulatos royalty is capped at 2.0 million gold ounces of production. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 1.41 million cumulative ounces of gold have been produced.
Production attributable to our royalty interest at Mulatos decreased approximately 6% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Lower than planned throughput and recovery associated with milling operations negatively impacted production during the current period. Alamos expects that a new grinding circuit in the mill will reduce grind size and improve gold recovery, allowing the mill to ramp up to targeted recoveries in mid-calendar 2015.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp Inc. ("Goldcorp"). The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Production for gold at Peñasquito increased approximately 39% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as Goldcorp experienced higher sulfide ore gold grades but lower recoveries. Reported production for silver and lead decreased approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, while reported zinc production increased approximately 10% when compared to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
In April 2015, Goldcorp reported that it integrated its Concentrate Enrichment Process and Pyrite Leach Process into a single Metallurgical Enhancement Project ("MEP"). The MEP entered the feasibility study phase, which Goldcorp expects to complete in early calendar 2016. Goldcorp expects the study to form the basis of a new life-of-mine plan for Peñasquito, which could extend mine life by more than five years through increased gold and silver recoveries, result in production of higher quality processing, and lower mining costs through minimization of re-handling and simplified mining of complex ores.
Robinson Mine (Nevada, USA)
We own a 3.0% NSR royalty on all mineral production from the Robinson open-pit mine operated by a subsidiary of KGHM International Ltd. ("KGHM"). Access to the property is via Nevada State Highway 50, 6.5 miles west of Ely, Nevada, in White Pine County.
Copper and gold production attributable to our royalty interest at Robinson increased approximately 45% and 24%, respectively, during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The production increase was due to higher copper grade and
recovery as mining returned to the Ruth pit during the second half of calendar 2014, whereas mining primarily came from the lower grade Kimbley pit during the prior fiscal year. KGHM stated that mining will continue in the Ruth pit until the December 2015 quarter, when it expects that ore deliveries primarily will come from lower grade stockpiled ores.
Voisey's Bay (Labrador, Canada)
Labrador Nickel Royalty Limited Partnership ("LNRLP"), of which the Company is the indirect 90% owner, holds a 3.0% NSR royalty (or an effective 2.7% NSR royalty for the Company interest) on the Voisey's Bay nickel-copper-cobalt mine located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and operated by Vale Newfoundland & Labrador Limited ("Vale"). A non-controlling interest owns the remainder of LNRLP. The Voisey's Bay project is located on the northeast coast of Labrador, on a peninsula bordered to the north by Anaktalak Bay and to the south by Voisey's Bay. The property is 560 miles north-northwest of St. John's, the capital of the Province. Access to the property is primarily by helicopter or small aircraft.
Historically, Vale supplied us with Voisey's Bay nickel concentrate shipment data on a monthly basis, and copper concentrate shipment data on a quarterly basis. This data allowed us to estimate our Voisey's Bay quarterly royalty revenue for financial reporting purposes. We did not receive all of this data for the months relevant to the royalty payments due for the December 2014 and March 2015 quarters, and in April 2015 we announced our intention to recognize Voisey's Bay royalty revenue on a cash basis, or in the period in which actual payment information is received from Vale, beginning with the June 2015 quarter. Accordingly, the revenue recognized for the Voisey's Bay royalty for the June 2015 quarter only included positive adjustments from the estimated March 2015 quarterly revenue (approximately $3.0 million).
Vale reported that it is processing a blend of nickel matte from its Indonesian operations and nickel concentrates from Voisey's Bay at its new Long Harbour hydrometallurgical plant, and that it will process only Voisey's Bay concentrate at Long Harbour as of the end of calendar 2015. We received the first quarterly royalty payment relating to processing Voisey's Bay nickel concentrates at Long Harbour. In response to questions concerning Vale's determination of the Long Harbour smelter and refining charges deducted from actual proceeds to calculate the NSR royalty payable, Vale recently stated that the charges included "the cost of product sold, pre-operating costs, depreciation and cost of capital." The Company strongly disagrees with Vale's determination that these charges are permissible deductions pursuant to the royalty agreement and is requesting further clarification of the basis for these charges while aggressively pursuing its legal remedies. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of litigation between the Company and Vale.
Nickel and copper production attributable to our royalty interest at Voisey's Bay decreased approximately 49% and 16%, respectively, during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. We did not receive sufficient production information for our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2015 to explain the difference.
Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea (Western Region, Ghana)
As discussed in further detail in Item 1, Business, Recent Business Developments, RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 8.5% of the gold produced from the Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea projects, operated by Golden Star, until 185,000 ounces have been delivered, 5.0% until an additional 22,500 ounces have been delivered and 3.0% thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay Golden Star a cash price equal to 20% of the spot price for each ounce delivered at the time of delivery until 207,500 ounces have been delivered, and 30% of the spot price for each ounce delivered thereafter. The transaction closed on July 28, 2015, and RGLD Gold anticipates its first purchase of gold from Golden Star during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company considers the gold stream principal to its business.
The Wassa open pit mine and oxide ore mill are located near the village of Akyempim in the Wassa East District, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 50 miles north of Cape Coast and 93 miles west of the capital Accra. The main access to the site is from the east, via the Cape Coast to Twifo-Praso road, then over the combined road-rail bridge on the Pra River. There is also an access road from Takoradi in the south via Mpohor. There is an airport at Takoradi that is capable of handling jet aircraft and is serviced by several commercial flights each day. Future Wassa production will come from both open pit and underground operations.
Bogoso and Prestea are open pit operations producing both oxide and refractory ores located in the Ashanti gold district in the central eastern section of the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 6 miles south of the town of Bogoso. Access to the property is by commercial air carrier to Accra and then by vehicle on a paved and gravel road.
Golden Star is pursuing a strategy of transforming to a low cost non-refractory gold producer. In line with this strategy, the refractory mining and processing operations at Bogoso were due to be closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. On July 3, 2015, Golden Star reported the failure of a ball mill motor in the refractor ore mill, which will impact production for calendar 2015. Golden Star management is contemplating the early shutdown of the refractory ore operations. Future production at Bogoso and Prestea will come from open pit and underground operations.
Principal Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal development stage properties. Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
As of June 30, 2015, we owned a 0.78% to 5.23% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. Also as of June 30, 2015, the Company owned an additional royalty equivalent to 1.05% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. Please refer to Item 1, Business, Recent Business Developments, for an update on our interest at Pascua-Lama. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick's operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interest is applicable to all gold production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million; (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) we also increased our interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note: Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
Pascua-Lama is one of the world's largest gold and silver deposits with nearly 18 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, 676 million ounces of silver contained within the gold reserves, and an expected mine life of 25 years. It is expected to produce an average of 800,000-850,000 ounces of gold and 35 million ounces of silver annually during its first full five years of operation.
During the fourth quarter of calendar 2013, Barrick announced the temporary suspension of construction at Pascua-Lama, except for activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance. A decision to restart development will depend on improved economics and reduced uncertainty related to legal and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the timing of any such decision to restart, permitting timelines, construction schedule and timing of first production are uncertain.
Phoenix Gold (Ontario, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 6.30% of any gold produced from the Phoenix Gold Project until 135,000 ounces have been delivered, and 3.15% thereafter. For each delivery of gold, RGLD Gold will pay a purchase price per ounce of 25% of the spot price of gold at the time of delivery.
The Phoenix Gold Project is located in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada, and operated by Rubicon Minerals Corporation ("Rubicon"). The Red Lake greenstone belt is host to one of Canada's preeminent gold producing districts, the Red Lake District. The Phoenix Gold Project is located in this belt, which also hosts the Red Lake and Cochenour mines. The project is located approximately 350 miles by road northwest of Thunder Bay and approximately 295 miles by road east-northeast of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Red Lake can be reached via Highway 105, which branches off the Trans-Canada Highway 17 some 105 miles south of Red Lake. Red Lake is also serviced with daily flights from Thunder Bay and Winnipeg.
Rubicon announced on June 24, 2015, that the Phoenix Gold Project successfully poured its first gold of approximately 741 ounces and that construction of the mill was complete. The commissioning of the mill circuit continues with the processing of low-grade mineralized material. Rubicon further reported in June 2015 that two stopes were ready for production and five stopes were in various stages of development.
As of June 30, 2015, the Company considers Phoenix Gold to be a principal development stage property. RGLD Gold anticipates its first purchase of gold from the Phoenix Gold Project will occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, at which time the Company will reclassify our Phoenix Gold stream interest to a principal producing property.
Reserve Information

(1)Reserves have been reported by the operators of record as of December 31, 2014, with the exception of the following properties: Hasbrouck Mountain-June 3, 2015; Svetloye-January 1, 2015; Don Mario-September 30, 2014; Gwalia, King of the Hills, Kundip and South Laverton-June 30, 2014; Back River and Red Dam-February 28, 2014; El Toqui, Inata, Troy, Wharf and Williams-December 31, 2013; Celtic/Wonder North-November 21, 2013; Schaft Creek-December 31, 2012; Southern Cross-June 30, 2012; Don Nicolas, Johnson Camp, Pascua-Lama and Robinson-December 31, 2011; Mara Rosa-October 28, 2011; Balcooma-June 30, 2011; Kutcho Creek-February 15, 2011; Pine Cove-June 30, 2010; and Caber-July 18, 2007.
(2)Gold reserves were calculated by the operators at the following per ounce prices: $1,450-Kundip; A$1,400-Celtic/Wonder North, Meekatharra (Nannine, Paddy's Flat, Reedys and Yaloginda), South Laverton and Southern Cross; A$1,390-King of the Hills; $1,366-Schaft Creek; $1,350-El Toqui; A$1,310-Red Dam; $1,300-Canadian Malartic, El Limon, El Morro, Leeville, Marigold, Peñasquito, Pinson, Svetloye, Twin Creeks and Wharf; $1,225-Hasbrouck Mountain; $1,250-Back River, Dolores, Holt, La India, Mount Milligan, Mulatos, Soledad Mountain and Taparko; A$1,250-Gwalia Deeps; $1,200-Andacollo, Gold Hill, Pascua-Lama, Rainy River, Robinson and Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea; $1,100-Bald Mountain, Cortez, Don Mario, Don Nicolas, Goldstrike, Mara Rosa, Ruby Hill and Williams; $950-Inata; and $983-Pine Cove. No gold price was reported for Balcooma, Caber or Kutcho Creek.
(3)Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Reserve" is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. "Proven (Measured) Reserves" are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established. "Probable (Indicated) Reserves" are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
(4)Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation
as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(5)The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)"Contained ounces" or "contained pounds" do not take into account recovery losses in mining and processing the ore.
(7)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $375 - 1.75%; >$375 to $400 - 2.0%; >$400 to $425 - 2.25%; >$425 - 2.5%. All price points are stated in 1986 dollars and are subject to adjustment in accordance with a blended index comprised of labor, diesel fuel, industrial commodities and mining machinery.
(8)GSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $210 - 0.40%; $210 to $229.99 - 0.50%; $230 to $249.99 - 0.75%; $250 to $269.99 - 1.30%; $270 to $309.99 - 2.25%; $310 to $329.99 - 2.60%; $330 to $349.99 - 3.00%; $350 to $369.99 - 3.40%; $370 to $389.99 - $3.75%; $390 to $409.99 - 4.0%; $410 to $429.99 - 4.25%; $430 to $449.99 - 4.50%; $450 to $469.99 - 4.75%; $470 and higher - 5.00%.
