Item 2. Properties
Description of the Underlying Properties
The Underlying Properties consist of 35,390 gross (22,997 net) acres in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends over 75,000 square miles in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, consists of multiple, stacked hydrocarbon-bearing formations and has produced over 30 billion Bbls of oil and more than 75 Tcf of natural gas since its discovery in 1921. The basin is further characterized by a favorable operating environment, high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, significant in-place midstream infrastructure, a well-developed network of oilfield service providers and long-lived reserves with generally consistent geologic attributes and reservoir quality.
The Underlying Properties consist of long-life reserves in mature, conventional oil fields with established decline curves. As of December 31, 2020, the Underlying Properties had proved reserves of 7.9 MMBoe and 58% of the volumes and 66% of PV-10 value were attributable to proved developed reserves. Approximately 91% of the 7.9 MMBoe of proved reserves, based on PV-10 value, were operated by Boaz Energy. For more information regarding changes in proved reserves, see Note 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Major Producing Areas
The Underlying Properties consist of the following four operating areas:
The Permian Clearfork area consists of 2,434 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Hockley and Terry Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Clearfork area comes from wells in the Kingdom Clearfork field, which primarily produce from the Clearfork formation. Boaz Energy's waterflooding operations were first implemented in the Kingdom Clearfork field in March 2015. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“Cawley Gillespie”) estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Clearfork to have 1.2 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 48% of which are proved developed reserves. Decreased reserves in the Permian Clearfork area were primarily the result of a negative price revision.
The Permian Abo area consists of 1,667 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Terry and Cochran Counties, Texas. A majority of the production in the Permian Abo area comes from wells in the Kingdom Abo field, which primarily produce from the Abo formation. In 2011, a waterflood pilot program was implemented in the North West Terry Abo unit (“NWTA”) located in the Kingdom Abo field that converted one producing well to an injection well. Boaz Energy fully converted the field to water injection upon purchasing the NWTA in June 2016, and in January 2017 installed a new injection pump that added an additional injection capacity of 2,500 barrels of water per day. In August 2017, NWTA 313 demonstrated initial waterflood response. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Abo to have 0.6 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 84% of which are proved developed reserves.
The Permian Shelf area consists of 14,727 net acres on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Glasscock, Schleicher, Stonewall and Coke Counties, Texas. A significant portion of the production in the Permian Shelf area comes from wells in the Fort McKavitt and Flowers fields, which primarily produce from the Canyon formation. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Shelf to have 0.9 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 45% of which are proved developed reserves.
The Permian Platform area consists of 4,169 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Ward, Crane, Terry and Ector Counties, Texas. The properties primarily produce from the Clearfork, San Andres, and Devonian formations. As of December 31, 2020, Cawley Gillespie estimates the Underlying Properties in the Permian Platform to have 0.4 MMBoe of total proved reserves, 94% of which are proved developed.
Oil and Natural Gas Data
Proved Reserves
Cawley Gillespie, independent petroleum and geological engineers, estimated crude oil and natural gas (including natural gas liquids) proved reserves of the Underlying Properties’ full economic life and for the Trust life as of December 31, 2020. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserve volumes and values, and the estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of the reserves may vary significantly from the estimates. In addition, the reserves and net revenues attributable to the Net Profits Interest include only 80% of the reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties that are expected to be produced within the term of the Net Profits Interest. The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the review of the third-party reserve reports is Casey Morton, Boaz Energy's Executive Vice President, Engineering. Mr. Morton received a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from Texas Tech University in 2003. Prior to joining Boaz Energy, Mr. Morton served as an engineer for Netherland, Sewell & Associates from September 2008 to January 2012. Mr. Morton has over 17 years of experience working in various capacities in the energy industry, including acquisition analysis, reserve estimation, reservoir engineering and operations engineering. Mr. Morton is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 107582). Mr. Morton consults regularly with Cawley Gillespie during the reserve estimation process to review properties, assumptions and relevant data.
The independent petroleum engineer’s report as to the proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2020 was prepared by Cawley Gillespie. Cawley Gillespie, whose firm registration number is, was founded in 1961 and is a leader in the evaluation of oil and gas properties. The technical person at Cawley Gillespie primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve estimates with respect to the Underlying Properties and the Net Profits Interest attributable to the Trust is Mr. Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at Cawley Gillespie since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055) and has over 33 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 31 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; he is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserve definitions and guidelines.
Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should at least be a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
The technical and economic data used in the estimation of the proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production performance decline curve analyses, well logs, geologic maps, well-test data, production data (including flow rates), well data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. Cawley Gillespie uses this technical data, together with a combination of standard engineering and geoscience methods, including the production performance, volumetric and analogy methods. After estimating the reserves of each proved developed property, it was determined that a reasonable level of certainty exists with respect to the reserves which can be expected from any individual undeveloped well in the field. The consistency of reserves attributable to the proved developed wells, which cover a wide area, further supports proved undeveloped classification.
The proved undeveloped locations in the Underlying Properties are predominantly direct offsets of other producing wells. Data from both Boaz Energy and offset operators with which Boaz Energy has exchanged technical data demonstrate a consistency in these conventional plays over an area significantly larger than the Underlying Properties. In addition, information from other analogous fields in similar geographical locations have also been used to analyze secondary reserves on the underlying properties.
Boaz Energy's internal petroleum engineer works closely with its independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to the independent reserve engineers in their reserve estimating process. Periodically, the Boaz Energy petroleum engineer meets with the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used by Boaz Energy and the independent reserve engineers to prepare reserve estimates.
Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues which are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please read "Risk Factors" appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes estimated proved reserve quantities and PV-10 attributable to the Trust as of December 31, 2020:
-------
(1)
Reserves for natural gas liquids are included as a component of natural gas reserves.
(2)
Boe represents an approximate energy equivalent basis such that one Bbl of crude oil equals approximately six Mcf of natural gas. However, the value of oil and natural gas fluctuate and the value of reserve volumes of oil and natural gas are often substantially different than the amount implied by the Boe ratio.
(3)
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows using the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices, after adjustment for differentials in location and quality, for each of the preceding twelve months. An estimate of PV-10 is provided because it provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. PV-10 is considered relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated reserves of the Underlying Properties.
(4)
For 2020, $1.985 per MMBtu of natural gas and $39.57 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue.
Reserve quantities and revenues for the Net Profits Interest were estimated from projections of reserves and revenues attributable to the Underlying Properties. Since the Trust has a defined Net Profits Interest, the Trust does not own a specific percentage of the oil and natural gas reserve quantities. Accordingly, reserves allocated to the Trust pertaining to its 80% Net Profits Interest in the Underlying Properties have effectively been reduced to reflect recovery of the Trust’s 80% portion of applicable production and development costs. Because Trust reserve quantities are determined using an allocation formula, any changes in actual or assumed prices or costs will result in revisions to the estimated reserve quantities allocated to the Net Profits Interest.
Estimates of proved reserves were prepared in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions based upon the annual average Henry Hub spot market gas price and the average annual WTI Cushing spot market price for oil. These prices are determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity price for the twelve months prior to the effective date of the evaluation. All prices are then further adjusted for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials.
Information concerning changes in net proved reserves attributable to the Trust, and the calculation of the standardized measure of the related discounted future net revenues is contained in the notes to the financial statements of the Trust included in this Form 10-K. Boaz Energy has not filed reserve estimates covering the Underlying Properties with any other federal authority or agency.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)
The following table summarizes the changes in estimated proved undeveloped reserves of the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2020:
-------
(1)
Reserves for natural gas liquids are included as a component of natural gas reserves.
Changes in proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended December 31, 2020 were revisions to previous estimates primarily due to the extended period of depressed pricing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and international disputes over production levels.
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2020 relating to the leasehold acreage associated with the Underlying Properties. Developed acreage consists of acreage spaced or assigned to productive wells and does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease. Undeveloped acreage is defined as acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
-------
(1)
A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which a working interest is owned.
(2)
A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Producing Wells Count
The table below summarizes the producing wells on the Underlying Properties as of December 31, 2020. Although many of these wells produce both oil and natural gas, a well is categorized as an oil well or a natural gas well based upon the ratio of oil to natural gas production. All wells in the table below are oil wells except for 4 gross (2.6 net) natural gas wells.
-------
(1)
Boaz Energy's total gross wells associated with the Underlying Properties include 324 operated wells and 179 non-operated wells.
(2)
A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned.
(3)
A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Drilling Results
The following is a summary of the number of development and exploratory wells drilled and completed on the Underlying Properties during the years indicated.
During 2020, there were 18 gross (2.2 net) producing wells and 0 injection wells drilled, and 3 producing wells converted into injection wells on the Underlying Properties. During 2019, there were 31 gross (3.3 net) producing wells and 0 injection wells drilled, and 3 producing wells converted into injection wells on the Underlying Properties. During 2018, there were 24 gross (2.1 net) producing wells and 0 injection wells drilled, and 0 producing wells converted into injection wells on the Underlying Properties. As of March 31, 2021, there were no producing wells in the process of being drilled by Boaz Energy.
On June 14, 2016 and December 14, 2017, Boaz Energy acquired certain oil and gas leasehold acreages located in the State of Texas and various other related rights, permits, contracts, equipment and other assets, known, respectively, as the Memorial Acquisition and the Crane Acquisition. Revenues and direct operating expenses of the assets acquired in the Memorial Acquisition that are subject to the Net Profits Interest are referred to as the "Memorial Underlying Properties". All of the assets acquired in the Crane County Acquisition are subject to the Net Profits Interest and are referred to as the “Crane County Underlying Properties”.
Oil and Natural Gas Production
The following table presents the oil and natural gas sales volumes, average sales prices and average costs per Boe for the Underlying Properties on a historical basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. All production derived from the Underlying Properties is from the Permian Basin.
-------
(1)
Production from the Kingdom Clearfork field during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 106, 142 and 191 MBoe, respectively, consisting of 105, 140 and 189 MBbls of oil, respectively, and 0.6, 8.7 and 13.6 MMcf of natural gas, respectively. Production from the Kingdom Abo field during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 76, 98 and 109 MBoe, respectively, consisting solely of oil. Such fields are the only fields that contain 15% or more of the total proved reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Production costs for oil and natural gas attributable to the Underlying Properties for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
Abandonment and Sale of Underlying Properties
Boaz Energy or any transferee has the right to abandon its interest in any well or property if Boaz Energy or such transferee, acting as a reasonable and prudent operator, believes a well or property ceases to produce or is not capable of, producing in commercially paying quantities. Upon termination of the lease, the portion of the Net Profits Interest relating to the abandoned property will be extinguished.
Boaz Energy generally may sell all or a portion of its interests in the Underlying Properties, subject to and burdened by the Net Profits Interest, without the consent of the Trust unitholders. In addition, Boaz Energy may, under certain circumstances cause the Trust to release or sell portions of the Net Profits Interest.
Title to Properties
The Underlying Properties are or may be subject to one or more of the burdens and obligations described below. To the extent that these burdens and obligations affect Boaz Energy’s rights to production or the value of production from the Underlying Properties, they have been taken into account in calculating the Trust’s interests and in estimating the size and the value of the reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties.
Boaz Energy’s interests in the oil and natural gas properties comprising the Underlying Properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:
·
royalties and other burdens, express and implied, under oil and natural gas leases and other arrangements;
·
overriding royalties, production payments and similar interests and other burdens created by Boaz Energy’s predecessors in title;
·
a variety of contractual obligations arising under operating agreements, farm-out agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the Underlying Properties or their title;
·
liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements that are not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;
·
pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders;
·
easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property;
·
conventional rights of reassignment that obligate Boaz Energy to reassign all or part of a property to a third party if Boaz Energy intends to release or abandon such property;
·
preferential rights to purchase or similar agreements and required third-party consents to assignments or similar agreements;
·
obligations or duties affecting the Underlying Properties to any municipality or public authority with respect to any franchise, grant, license or permit, and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authority; and
·
rights reserved to or vested in the appropriate governmental agency or authority to control or regulate the Underlying Properties and also the interests held therein, including Boaz Energy’s interests and the Net Profits Interest.
Boaz Energy believes that the burdens and obligations affecting the Underlying Properties are conventional in the industry for similar properties. Boaz Energy also believes that the existing burdens and obligations do not, in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use of the Underlying Properties and will not materially adversely affect the Net Profits Interest or its value.
In order to give third parties notice of the Net Profits Interest, Boaz Energy recorded the Conveyance in Texas in the real property records in the Texas counties in which the Underlying Properties are located, or in such other public records of Texas as required under applicable law to place third parties on notice of the Conveyance.
Under Texas law, the Conveyance constitutes the conveyance of a presently vested, non-possessory interest in real property. Therefore, Boaz Energy and the Trust believe that, in a bankruptcy of Boaz Energy, the Net Profits Interest will remain outside of any Boaz Energy bankruptcy estate and will be a continuing obligation of any successor to Boaz Energy as the operator of the Underlying Properties under Texas law and, as such, outside of Boaz Energy’s bankruptcy estate.
Boaz Energy believes that its title to the Underlying Properties is, and the Trust’s title to the Net Profits Interest will be, good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions as are not so material to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties or royalty interests. Under the terms of the Conveyance, Boaz Energy has provided a special warranty of title with respect to the Net Profits Interest, subject to the burdens and obligations described in this section.
