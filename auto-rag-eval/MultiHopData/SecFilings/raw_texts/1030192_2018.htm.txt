GOLDEN CHEST MINE
Figure 2 - Photo of New Golden Chest Mine in September 2018
Property Location
The Golden Chest Mine is comprised of an underground mine, an open pit mine, and an exploration project located about 1.5 miles east of Murray, Idaho, comprised of 25 patented mining claims (280 acres) and 90 unpatented claims (1,390 acres). The site is along Forest Highway 9 and is accessible by several improved dirt roads from the paved highway. A three-phase power line was installed at the property in 2014 with power supplied by Avista Utilities.
Property Ownership
NJMC owns 100% of the Golden Chest LLC (owner of the Golden Chest Mine). The Company consolidated its ownership in December 2015, purchasing Marathon Gold Corporation’s (“Marathon”) 52.22% stake in Golden Chest LLC for $180,000 along with a 2% NSR on production from the Golden Chest property, as well as an adjacent Area of Interest. Golden Chest LLC purchased the mine from Metaline Contact Mines and J.W. Beasley Interests for $3.75-million. The purchase was financed through a promissory note of $3,250,000 after a down payment of $500,000. On October 25, 2017, NJMC paid off the remaining balance owed on the note.
Property History
The Golden Chest Mine was developed in the late 1800’s through the early 1900’s as part of the first gold production from the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. Historical accounts vary, but the district is believed to have produced approximately 300,000 ounces of gold from placer sources. It is estimated that the historic hard rock mining operations on the Golden Chest property produced approximately 65,000 ounces of gold, primarily from shallow, underground, high-grade veins. The Golden Chest Mine is considered to be the largest historic lode producer of gold in northern Idaho.
Modern exploration of the Golden Chest area began in the late 1970’s with several companies, including Cominco-American and Golden Chest Inc. (“GCI”), targeting gold and massive sulfides. Drill tests by GCI included a 200-foot hole from surface that intersected a 60-foot zone containing multiple low-grade gold-bearing quartz veins.
Newmont Exploration Ltd. followed GCI’s discovery by evaluating the veins for bulk mineable potential in the late-1980s. A geochemical survey yielded soil samples from the mine area that were anomalous in both gold and arsenic, indicating a well-developed vein system. Newmont then drilled 35 shallow reverse-circulation and five core holes, establishing an historic resource, most of which is related to the Idaho Vein system on the south end of the property.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
Exploration & Development by NJMC & Golden Chest LLC
NJMC first leased the property in 2003, then explored, drilled, and developed it over subsequent years, producing 8,400 tonnes of ore averaging 6.9 gpt gold, all of which was processed at its New Jersey Mill for total production of nearly 2,000 ounces of gold. From 2004 through 2008, the Company completed an exploration core drilling program at the Golden Chest totaling 3,415 meters of core during that period, successfully extending the Idaho Vein below the No. 3 Level. NJMC connected the historic No. 3 Level to the surface by driving a 440-meter ramp (the “North Ramp”), which was completed in 2008.
In 2010, NJMC terminated its operating leases to form Golden Chest LLC with Marathon. NJMC contributed certain mining claims, all geological data, and mining equipment to the venture, while Marathon contributed $4-million cash. As Marathon is a Canadian issuer, the joint venture operated and issued technical disclosures in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).
In 2011, Golden Chest LLC completed the most aggressive exploration project in the history of the property, totaling 11,300 meters of surface drilling. Other work completed included the construction of a new core shed, construction of new roads, surface geological work, surface and underground surveying, underground exploration drifting, and mine rehabilitation. In 2012, Golden Chest LLC completed an additional 7,000 meters of drilling and exploration drifting on the Popcorn Vein. Based on the results of those work programs, Golden Chest LLC delineated an updated gold resource and filed a technical report in compliance with NI 43-101.
As part of the Company’s efforts to seek a listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange an updated National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report was completed and released. The report included current mining operations and activity that occurred in 2016 and 2017.
The Juniper Lease & Mine Modernization
In September 2013, the Skookum Shoot portion of the Golden Chest property was leased to Juniper, which later reassigned the lease to Gold Hill, an affiliate company. Gold Hill began construction in Q3 2014, spending an estimated $7 to $9-million on mine development and infrastructure, building a modern gold mine that reached production in May 2015. Mining activities continued until September 2015 when Gold Hill ceased operations and terminated its lease, forfeiting the mine and infrastructure back to Golden Chest LLC.
While in operation, NJMC processed Golden Chest ore at its New Jersey Mill, earning cash from milling fees and its share of a 2% net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty on gold production. In total, Gold Hill mined 40,840 dry metric tonnes of ore at an average grade of 6.70 gpt gold, resulting in production of approximately 8,000 ounces of gold.
Underground Operations
NJMC completed the first stope cut on the 851 level in mid 2018. Commissioning of the cemented rockfill (CRF) backfill plant was completed during the summer of 2018, and backfilling was completed in the third quarter of 2018. A second haul truck and LHD were added to the company’s underground mining fleet at this time, and a second mining crew and mechanic were hired during the third quarter as well. Additional development of stope access ramps was completed during the third quarter. Mining under backfill produced and placed by NJMC was successfully completed in fourth quarter of 2018. A total of 4,260 tonnes were mined during the startup phase of underground mining operations in 2018. The average grade of the underground material was 7.0 gpt Au.
Open-Pit Gold Production at Golden Chest
In 2016, NJMC used its internal study, including tightly-spaced drill data in an outcrop area, to identify a mineable open-pit near the Idaho Vein outcrop. Following the receipt of necessary permits, the Company began pit excavation and resumed gold production in Q3 2016 and resumed shipping ore to the New Jersey Mill in Q4 2016. Surface mining continued through 2017, producing approximately 3,525 ounces of gold for the year. An expanded pit was permitted in 2017 and surface mining continued through an area of increased waste stripping between shoots of gold mineralization and a total of 2,540 ounces were recovered from the open pit in 2018.
While significant modern drilling, underground development, and pit excavation have resulted in industrial scale mining and recovery of gold, there are no mineral reserves at the Golden Chest, as recognized by the SEC.
Exploration Plans
Modern exploration, including nearly 30,000 meters of drilling, reveals six NW-trending ore shoots at Golden Chest that demonstrate strong periodicity, consistent width and spacing, along the Idaho Fault. Most historic production came from the northernmost of these shoots, the Katie-Dora and the Klondike. Excellent mineralization potential remains in unmined portions of the northern shoots as well as in the unmined Paymaster and Joe Dandy shoots to the south. Drilling is planned at depth for the entire the strike length of the Idaho Fault at the property. The Company also plans to evaluate the potential of heap leaching the moderate grade, oxidized footwall material with a laboratory column test. The results of this test could drive future exploration and development efforts.
Recent data compilation efforts by NJMC have integrated all available modern exploration data from the property and across the Murray area, including work by Cominco, Newmont, NJMC, Golden Chest LLC, and the recent information provided by Gold Hill. Based on these studies and the Company’s own exploration results, management believes the Golden Chest property has district-scale production potential for the longer term, not only near the recently constructed mine, but in areas of past exploration and historic production.
Present Condition of Plant & Equipment
During the lease, Gold Hill made many improvements to the Golden Chest property including approximately 1,000 meters of underground development at a nominal cross section of 4 meters by 4 meters, the establishment of a secondary escape-way and ventilation raises, the installation of three-phase power, and many surface improvements such as a septic field and a new haul road to keep mine traffic separate from employee and visitor traffic. NJMC constructed a 2,500 square-foot steel-clad pole building in 2011 which stands at the top of the most easterly driveway to the property and is used primarily for office space and core logging. A 600 square-foot steel-clad pole building, constructed by NJMC in 2005, is also present near the northern ramp portal.
Geology & Mineralization
Gold mineralization occurs in veins associated with multiple faulting and folding events in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The gold mineralization is of a broad type known as orogenic gold, but it also appears to have an association with igneous rock activity. Hence, the vein deposits may be described as intrusion-related orogenic gold. The principal vein being exploited at the Golden Chest Mine is associated with the Idaho Fault, which juxtaposes the quartzites of the upper Prichard Formation against finer-grained argillites, also of the upper Prichard Formation.
Veins occur adjacent to the Idaho Fault and in its footwall but to a lesser extent in its hangingwall. The mineralization occurs in two types of quartz veins, banded and massive, that are generally conformable to bedding in the Proterozoic age Prichard Formation. Banded veins, which occur primarily in argillite, contain, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, sphalerite and visible gold. Thicker, massive veins occur in quartzite and contain pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, scheelite and visible gold.
NEW JERSEY MILL
Property Location
The New Jersey Mill is a fully-permitted, 360-tonne per day, flotation mill and concentrate leach plant (“CLP”) located two miles east of Kellogg, Idaho, in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. The mill is located on the same property as the New Jersey Mine, adjacent to U.S. Interstate Highway 90 and easily accessed year-round by local roads. Three-phase electrical power is supplied to the New Jersey Mill by Avista Utilities.
Project Ownership
In 2011, NJMC signed a joint venture (“JV”) agreement with United Mine Services (“UMS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Silver Corporation, to increase the capacity of the New Jersey Mill. UMS funded the mill expansion in return for a 35% interest in JV assets plus the right to process 7,000 tonnes of its ore per month. NJMC is the JV manager and retains a 65% interest in JV assets as well as the right to process its own ore at the rate of 3,000 tonnes per month and to allocate unused and excess capacity in its role as manager. The property covered by the JV agreement includes the crushing circuit, grinding circuit, gravity circuit, flotation circuit, CLP, buildings and surface rights only over the patented mill site claim. Unpatented mill site claims are also part of the JV.
Present Condition of Plant & Equipment
Mill Expansion and Crescent Ore Processing
The mill expansion was completed in 2012, rendering the mill capable of processing 360 tonnes of sulfide ore per day (a four-fold increase) to produce a single flotation concentrate. The expansion cost approximately $3.2 million, all of which was funded by UMS under terms of the JV (Ex. 10.1). The expansion project included the installation of a new cone crusher, a new fine ore bin, new conveyors, a new 2.4-meter by 4.0-meter ball mill, additional flotation cells, a new paste thickener, associated pumps, and a new building. Subsequent to the mill expansion, the New Jersey Mill processed 8,470 dry tonnes of silver ore from the Crescent Mine before operations ended.
In April 2014, Hale Capital Partners, through its subsidiary Crescent Silver LLC (“Crescent”), acquired the assets of UMS, including its stake in the New Jersey Mill JV, in a consensual foreclosure process. Therefore, Crescent is now the NJMC’s joint venture partner at the New Jersey Mill.
Mill Upgrades and Golden Chest Ore Processing
In September 2013, the Skookum Shoot portion of the Golden Chest Mine was leased to Juniper Resources LLC which, through its affiliate companies, developed a modern gold mine that reached full production in May 2015. NJMC processed Golden Chest ore at its New Jersey Mill, earning cash from milling fees and its share of a 2-percent net smelter return royalty on gold production.
Significant additional upgrades, including installation of a new gravity gold recovery circuit and a tune up of the crushing, grinding, flotation, and tailings circuits were completed in 2014 in anticipation of ore deliveries from the Golden Chest Mine. From December 2014 through September 2015, 40,840 dry tonnes from the Golden Chest Mine were successfully processed at the New Jersey Mill producing approximately 8,000 ounces of gold.
In addition to producing concentrates in 2015, NJMC leached approximately 10 tonnes of flotation concentrate, produced from Golden Chest ore, in the CLP at the New Jersey Mill. An improved leaching process that employs a Carbon-in-Leach finishing tank was tested, with objectives of reduced process time and increased gold recovery. Test results provided an understanding of which capital improvements to the leach circuit will be necessary to reach these objectives and also, as expected, confirmed that Golden Chest concentrates are amenable to leaching.
Current Ore Processing Operations
NJMC now has 100-percent ownership of the Golden Chest Mine. In October 2016, the Company resumed operations at the New Jersey Mill, processing ore extracted from open-pit development at the Golden Chest.
The mill recycles process water and utilizes a paste tailings disposal process patented by NJMC founder Fred Brackebusch to minimize impacts to the environment. By implementing paste tailings processing methods, NJMC is able to recycle process water and prevent the discharge of process water to surface waters. At full capacity, this method saves more than 50 million gallons of water per year. NJMC was recognized as a “Pollution Prevention Champion” by the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality in 2014 for its efforts to reduce pollution at the mill.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a net capital cost of $4,396,920 associated with the New Jersey Mill.
BUTTE HIGHLANDS PROJECT
Property Location
In January 2016, NJMC purchased a 50% interest in Butte Highlands Joint Venture LLC (“BHJV”) from Timberline Resources Corporation (“Timberline”). BHJV owns the Butte Highlands Gold Project, located 15 miles south of Butte, Montana, within a gold-producing region that includes several large gold deposits. The property can be accessed via State Highway 2 and county and USFS roads. Electricity and water are available on the property.
Property Ownership
The Butte Highlands property covers approximately 135 acres and includes 11 patented claims. All of the private lands within the Butte Highlands property are patented lode and placer claims. BHJV is responsible for paying Montana state property taxes on all patented lands and for paying annual BLM maintenance fees on any unpatented mining claims.
Butte Highlands Joint Venture
In 2009, Timberline formed a 50/50 joint venture, the BHJV, with Highland Mining LLC (“Highland”) for the purpose of developing and mining the Butte Highlands property, with Highland to fund all mine development costs through to commercial production. In 2012, Montana State Gold Company LLC (“MSGC”) purchased Highland, assuming its project loan and its funding commitment.
NJMC purchased Timberline’s 50% “carried to production” interest in BHJV in 2016, with Highland funding all development costs and NJMC’s 50% share of costs to be paid from proceeds of future mine production. Proceeds are to be split on an 80/20 basis (to Highland and NJMC, respectively) until payback is reached, after which proceeds will be split evenly.
Property History
The Butte Highlands gold mine was an historic lode mine that produced an estimated 60,000 ounces of gold from 1937 until the War Production Board forced its closure at the onset of WWII. The property was later explored by Battle Mountain, Placer Dome, ASARCO, and Orvana in the 1980’s and 1990’s which, in total, drilled more than 30,000 meters at Butte Highlands, prior to its acquisition by Timberline in 2007.
In 2009, Timberline formed a 50/50 joint venture with Highland to create BHJV for the purpose of developing and mining the property. In 2009 and 2010, Timberline conducted surface exploration, drilling, and permitting work as Highland began building surface and underground infrastructure.
In 2011, BHJV completed an underground exploration ramp and a 16,000-meter underground core drilling program to support mine modeling, focusing on the upper portion of the “Old Mill Block” which has dimensions of approximately 85 meters along strike, 335 meters down dip, and a mineralized thickness of 2.5 to 4.5 meters. The program returned many significant mineralized intercepts, including a highlight of 4.4 meters grading 232 gpt gold.
A NI 43-101 compliant technical report for Butte Highlands was completed in May 2013 by Mine Development Associates of Reno, Nevada.
The project has experienced significant timeline delays due, in part, to miscalculations of the permitting process and other technical issues. Permitting advanced more effectively from 2013 to 2015 with the following critical milestones successfully achieved:
•In July 2013, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) issued the final Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“MPDES”) water discharge permit;
•In January 2015, the Montana DEQ authorized BHJV to construct and operate an underground gold mine by publishing positive Record of Decision (“ROD”) on Final Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”);
•In October 2015, the U.S. Forest Service (“USFS”) released its Final Decision Notice on haul road with a Finding of No Significant Impacts.
These milestones represent the final major hurdles to the receipt of necessary permits allowing the project to proceed. Final construction designs and completion of work will be required, along with bond payments, before final authority is granted to proceed with the proposed operation. Once final designs and road construction are complete, the USFS will grant authority to use local USFS roads for material haulage. Upon payment of the reclamation bond, the Hard Rock Operating Permit will be granted by the Montana DEQ.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
Prior to NJMC’s purchase of its stake in BHJV, the BHJV partners envisioned a 4 to 5-year mine life with estimated annual production of 30,000 to 35,000 ounces of gold. Mining was proposed to be conducted by cut and fill methods at a rate of 400 tons per day with a cut-off grade estimated at 4.8 gpt gold. Waste rock will be replaced underground as cemented rock backfill in the mined ore zones to supply geotechnical stability. Preliminary metallurgical testwork indicates recoveries of approximately 85% of the contained gold in a flotation concentrate. Based on a draft internal
scoping study produced by Timberline, NJMC Management purchased the Company’s interest in Butte Highlands with a belief that the deposit has the potential to contain 300,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold.
NJMC is working to advance an agreement to assume management control of the Butte Highlands Project. If successful in negotiating a definitive agreement, NJMC will evaluate the possibility of building an on-site mill, which will require additional permitting but may improve overall economics of the project.
Present Condition of Plant & Equipment
Highland has invested nearly $40-million at Butte Highlands building a modern gold mine, including nearly a mile of underground mine development and construction of surface facilities, all of which are located on private lands owned by BHJV. Most surface facilities and infrastructure required for mining operations are already in place.
Geology & Mineralization
Gold mineralization at Butte Highlands is hosted primarily in lower Paleozoic Wolsey Shale with higher-grade mineralization occurring within sediments proximal to diorite sills and dikes. The project is within a favorable geologic domain that has hosted several multi-million-ounce gold deposits. There are currently no mineral reserves as defined by the SEC at Butte Highlands Project.
NEW JERSEY MINE PROJECT
Property Location
The New Jersey Mine is an underground gold mine located two miles east of Kellogg, Idaho, in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. The mine is adjacent to U.S. Interstate Highway 90 and is easily accessed year-round by local roads. The New Jersey Mill is located on the same property, providing a unique opportunity for small-scale production. Three-phase electrical power is supplied to the New Jersey Mill by Avista Utilities.
Property Ownership
At the New Jersey Mine and Mill complex, the Company owns 102 acres of private land with surface and mineral rights, 108 acres of private land with mineral rights only, 40 acres of private land with surface rights only, and approximately 130 acres of unpatented mining claims. The unpatented claims are on federal land administered by the BLM. The gold-bearing Coleman Vein system, including the underground workings and the Coleman Pit, are located on the patented mining claims that are wholly-owned by the Company and not part of the Mill Joint Venture.
Property History
In the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, New Jersey Mining and Milling (an unrelated company) drove more than 760 meters of development workings on the Coleman Vein and its northwest branch, including drifts, crosscuts, shafts, and raises. The historic development also included a 10-stamp gravity mill that was operated for a short period.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
Since 2001, NJMC has drilled 14 holes totaling 1,765 meters to explore the Coleman Vein and associated zones. Drilling confirmed vein system continuity and resulted in the discovery of the broad, low grade (averaging about 0.70 gpt gold) Grenfel zone. The Company’s best intercept assayed 2.76 gpt gold over 12.5 meters, which included 6.80 gpt gold over 2.5 meters.
In 2008, the Company performed underground exploration on the Coleman Vein at the 740 level, including 84 meters of drifting, with 20 meters along the vein before it was displaced by a fault. The Company also drill-tested the Scotch Thistle prospect, but a 400-meter program encountered silicification and associated alterations with no significant gold mineralization. There are at least 14 gold prospects within or near the New Jersey Mine.
In 2010, a raise was driven upward on the 740 level to explore a narrow high-grade vein that crosscut the main Coleman Vein. This raise was driven 12 meters vertically, leading to the extraction of 367 dry tonnes that assayed 2.68 gpt gold in processing at the New Jersey Mill.
NJMC has not conducted material work at the New Jersey Mine since 2010, but Company geologists are again evaluating the known gold-bearing veins and historic targets. With the New Jersey Mill actively processing ores from the Golden Chest Mine, the potential economics of nearby gold prospects may have improved significantly.
While the Company has conducted significant drilling, underground development, and even limited gold production from the New Jersey Mine, the project has no mineral reserves as recognized by the SEC.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a capitalized development plus investment cost of $248,289 associated with the mine.
Geology & Mineralization
The New Jersey Mine area is underlain by argillites and quartzites of the Proterozoic-age Prichard Formation, which commonly hosts gold mineralization regionally. The property occurs adjacent to and north of the major Osburn Fault, an important geological structure of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The Prichard Formation is divided into nine units of
alternating argillites, siltites, and quartzites; the units exposed in the New Jersey Mine area appear to belong to the lower members. Gold mineralization is associated with sulfide-bearing quartz veins that cut the bedding in Prichard argillite and quartzite. Associated sulfides are pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, low-silver tennantite, galena, and sphalerite.
CROWN POINT PROJECT
Property Location
The Crown Point Project is comprised of three patented mining claims covering 46 patented acres and 700 acres of unpatented mining claims, west of Murray, Idaho. The property is a gold exploration project without known reserves. The lower portion of the property near the Four Square mine can be accessed via Forest Highway 9 and the higher elevation part of the property is accessed seasonally via dirt roads.
Property Ownership
The core of the property is held through an option-type of agreement with a private party that covers 46 patented acres surrounded by 293 acres of unpatented mining claims. The agreement required payment of 1.33 million of the Company’s common shares and $100,000 cash in 2018. A second payment of 1.33 million shares and $100,000 cash is due on September 30, 2019. A final payment of $200,000 is payable in either shares or cash, due on September 30, 2020. The claims covered by this agreement are subject to a 2% net smelter royalty. The Company also holds an additional 413 acres of unpatented lode claims adjacent to the core group of claims that are wholly owned by the Company and not subject to a royalty.
Property History
The property consists of two mineralized areas, one near the Four Square Mine and the second at the Crown Point claim on the eastern part of the property. The Four Square Mine was mined intermittently in the early 20th century with most of the mining completed in the 1930’s. Three levels were developed in the 1930’s to exploit three east-west striking quartz gold veins. A mill was located on the property and the historic production of the Four Square mine is estimated at approximately 6,400 ounces of gold. The Crown Point fault structure is a steeply dipping, northerly trending shear zone made up of quartz veins and silica flooded rock. It has been explored historically by underground drifting and crosscuts as well as surface pits.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
In 2018, the Company focused its exploration efforts on the Crown Point area with surface sampling, road building, core drilling and environmental permitting work. Four core holes were completed during 2018 at various locations along the strike of the Crown Point Shear Zone and all holes intersected anomalous gold mineralization with the best intercept assaying 0.5 gpt gold over 9.3 meters. The Company plans to conduct additional core drilling in 2019.
Geology & Mineralization
Gold mineralization at the Crown Point Project is hosted in the Prichard Formation. Gold mineralization at the Four Square is hosted in narrow quartz veins that strike easterly and dip to the north. The veins are frequently faulted by a series of northeasterly trending faults. Gold mineralization at the Crown Point area is found in a steeply dipping zone of silicification and quartz veining. Outcropping of the zone can be traced for over 250 meters and the width of zone varies, but in some places is nearly 20 meters wide. Gold is associated with sulfide minerals including pyrite and galena.
BUTTE GULCH PROJECT
Property Location
The Butte Gulch Project is directly adjacent to the east of Golden Chest Mine and is accessed by Forest Highway 9. It is comprised of 60 acres of both patented surface and mineral rights, 117 acres of patented mineral rights, and 602 acres of unpatented claims. All of the patented mineral rights are subject to a 2% NSR to a third party while the unpatented claims are unburdened by a royalty. The property is an exploration property without known reserves.
Property Ownership
The patented surface and mineral rights were purchased from a third party in mid 2018 and any lode production from the patented claims is subject to a 2% NSR. The patented claims where the Company only owns the lode mineral rights can be placer mined by the current owner who was the vendor of the property. NJMC holds a first right of refusal for the purchase of the surface rights not already owned by the Company. The unpatented lode claims are wholly owned by the Company and not subject to a royalty.
Property History
Butte Gulch has been placer mined in several different operations over the last century, however, there are no gold productions records from these historic placer mining efforts. There is evidence of historic lode prospecting in the form of surface pits and exploration adits on the property, but the Company is not aware of any modern exploration occurring on the property.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
The property is an exploration stage property adjacent to the Golden Chest Mine. The property vendor has retained the placer mining rights in the bottom of the drainage on the patented claims and completed placer mining activity last year. NJMC has no affiliation or connection with the placer mining operation. NJMC’s geologists have performed preliminary sampling and investigations on the property but no serious exploration efforts have taken place yet. NJMC plans to conduct additional sampling, mapping, and trenching in advance of a potential core drilling program.
Geology & Mineralization
Cursory investigations of the Butte Gulch geology indicate that the area is underlain by Prichard Formation argillite, siltite, and quartzite units. It is located on the western limb of the Trout Creek Anticline. More geologic fieldwork is planned for the upcoming season to explore for gold mineralization.
BUCKSKIN PROJECT
Property Location
The Buckskin Project is comprised of 12 patented mining claims covering 218 acres and 73 unpatented mining claims covering approximately 1,367 acres west of Murray, Idaho. The property is a gold exploration project without known reserves. The property can be accessed via dirt roads from Forest Highway 9.
Property Ownership
The 218 acres of patented mining claims was acquired through an exploration and mining lease. The Buckskin Lease term runs for 7.5 years and includes annual payments of $12,000 and a 2-percent NSR on future production from the property. If the property is placed into production, the lease will continue as long as production is underway and also includes a right of first refusal for NJMC to purchase the property. The Company also holds 700 acres of unpatented lode claims adjacent to the core group of claims that are wholly owned by the Company and not subject to a royalty. These claims require an annual claim fee payment to the BLM.
Property History
The Buckskin property was mined intermittently for both gold and base metals in the early 20th century with most of the mining completed in the 1930’s. The property contains numerous old workings, most of which are inaccessible. A mill was located on the property but the historic production is unknown.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
In 2018, the Company conducted exploration efforts in the Buckskin area with surface sampling, road building, underground mapping and sampling. Evaluation of the sampling results is ongoing. The Company plans to conduct core drilling in 2019.
Geology & Mineralization
Gold mineralization at the Buckskin Project is hosted in the Prichard Formation. Prospects and adits appear to have been developed along northerly trending shear zones made up of quartz veins and silica flooded rock. Gold is associated with sulfide minerals including pyrite and galena.
GIANT LEDGE
Property Location
The Giant Ledge Project is located six kilometers east of Murray, Idaho. It is an exploration project without known ore reserves. The project is accessed by Forest Highway 9 and secondary dirt roads.
Property Ownership
The Company’s land position consists of 57 unpatented lode claims covering an area of 1,119 acres. This claim total includes 3 separate claim blocks; Giant Ledge, Porphyry and Bear. These claims require an annual claim fee payment to the BLM.
Property History
The Giant Ledge Project consists of several historical prospected areas. The Giant Ledge Mine was active in the 1920’s when a 122 meter deep shaft was sunk and about 450 meters of drift development was completed. A flotation mill was erected and a minor amount of undisclosed production was achieved. Bunker Hill Mining Company also examined and mapped the mine workings in the 1950’s. Sunshine Mining Company conducted exploration at the Giant Ledge in the mid-1980’s and drilled two core holes. In 2008, the Company obtained core from Sunshine’s drilling program, and it was re-logged and assayed. The best of the mineralization showed 4.6 meters of 0.908 gpt gold and 0.24% combined copper and lead. An extensive soil sampling program was completed in conjunction with a VLF and magnetometer survey.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
The property is an exploration stage property east of the Golden Chest Mine. Although no significant work was performed at Giant Ledge during the 2009-2018 period, the Company is preparing to resume exploration efforts in 2019.
Geology & Mineralization
Host rocks at the property are Prichard Formation and Cretaceous-age intrusives. The primary mineralizing structure is the French Gulch Fault which transects the property. The property hosts polymetallic lead, copper and gold mineralization in and along the contact of the igneous intrusive.
POTOSI
Property Location
The Potosi Project is located 4.4 kilometers southwest of the Murray, Idaho. It is an exploration project without known ore reserves. The project is accessed by the paved Beaver Creek county road and other secondary dirt roads.
Property Ownership
NJMC acquired fee simple title to of 3 patented lode claims as part of the 2018 Butte Gulch land acquisition. The 3 patented claims cover a 71 acre area.
Property History
Potosi has been placer mined in several different operations over the last century, however, there is no gold production records from these historic placer mining efforts. There is evidence of historic lode prospecting in the form of surface pits and exploration adits on the property, but the Company is not aware of any modern lode exploration occurring on the property.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
Minor reclamation work was completed in 2018, and minor trenching efforts are planned for 2019.
Geology & Mineralization
Host rocks at the property are siltites and argillites of the Prichard Formation. Geologic mapping suggest fault structures associated with the Crown Point Shear Zone may cross the property.
McKINLEY PROJECT
Property Location
The McKinley Property encompasses a number of historic prospects in central Idaho and extends, from the town of Riggins northward for nearly five miles. The property is an early-stage, gold exploration project accessed via public and private dirt roads off of US Highway 95.
Property Ownership
In 2013, NJMC acquired the McKinley Property through its acquisition of Idaho Champion Resources (“ICR”). The property is held by 28 unpatented claims and an agreement known as the Rupp Lease. The Rupp Lease consists of a mineral lease for 1,728 acres with an additional 1,518 acres of land with certain rights for access and surface disturbance. The 3,246 total acres held through the Rupp Lease requires an annual rental payment of $6,100. If an ore reserve of 250,000 ounces of gold is achieved within the Rupp Lease, there is a 1% NSR royalty on future production less recoupment of capital costs. The Company also holds 28 unpatented claims, totaling 560 acres, adjacent the 4 patented claims of the McKinley Mine and the lands of the Rupp Lease. These claims require an annual claim fee payment to the BLM. NJMC has dropped the mineral lease for the 4 patented claims where the historic McKinley Mine workings are located.
Property History
The McKinley Property is located in the Simpson Mining District and was first prospected in 1891. The property was subject to intermittent mining activity until it was shut down during WWII. The property remained largely dormant until Hunt Energy executed a sampling program in the late 1970’s and Kennecott Exploration completed a property evaluation in the early-1990s. In 2012, ICR started surface exploration of the property, including a ground magnetic survey, before the acquisition by NJMC in 2013.
ICR previously conducted ground magnetic survey over a large portion of the property, approximately 2.4 by 5.6 kilometers. The survey indicates that potentially major structures passing through the district are associated with some degree of demagnetization. It also appears to indicate the potential mineralization at the McKinley Mine along with several potential target areas, including historic mines and prospects that extend for several miles along the known trend.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
Surface mapping and sampling by NJMC identified two areas with significant gold mineralization in outcrop: the Monarch Zone, about one kilometer S-SW of the McKinley Mine, and along Fiddle Creek, which crosses the southern portion of the property. At the Monarch Zone, several samples returned high-grade gold with values up to 26 gpt. At Fiddle Creek, 10 of 20 samples exceeded 3 gpt gold with one sample exceeding 50 gpt gold. Both areas have had historic prospecting but no significant development and much of the ground between these prospects remains unexplored. More geologic fieldwork is planned for the upcoming season to explore for additional gold mineralization between the Monarch and Fiddle Creek zones.
Geology and Mineralization
The McKinley Project is located within the rocks of the Riggins and Seven Devils Groups of the Blue Mountains Island-Arc Complex. The metasediments of the accreted Riggins and Seven Devils Groups are considered to be the source of coarse gold found in the nearby historic placer operations. Mapping and geophysics both suggest major northerly trending fault structures cut these metasediments. Rock alteration consists of carbonization and silicification. Gold mineralization is associated with auriferous pyrite and quartz-carbonate veining.
EASTERN STAR PROJECT
Property Location
The Eastern Star property is located about four miles west of Elk City in central Idaho. It consists of 11 patented lode mining claims acquired by NJMC in 2014 and an additional 45 unpatented lode claims (413 acres) located in 2018. Eastern Star is an early-stage exploration project with no mineral reserves as recognized by the SEC. The property is accessible via improved dirt roads off of Idaho State Highway 14.
Property Ownership
NJMC acquired fee simple title to the 11 patented claims from Premium Exploration Inc. (“Premium”) for $250,818 in 2014. The Company also holds the 45 unpatented lode claims (413 acres) surrounding the core group of patented claims. All of the Eastern Star claims are wholly owned by the Company and not subject to a royalty. The unpatented claims require an annual claim fee payment to the BLM.
Property History
The Elk City Mining District is an historic gold mining region dating back to the 1860s that once supported more than 20 underground mines, including the Eastern Star, along with placer dredging operations. Modern exploration in the district by companies including Cypress-Amax, Kinross Gold, and Bema Gold has focused on near-surface bulk tonnage gold potential, while the many smaller-scale high-grade gold occurrences have largely been ignored.
In recent years, prior operator Premium collected grab samples from three separate locations, representing nearly one-half mile of mineralized trend. Of 25 grab samples, nine returned gold values greater than 16.9 gpt. Premium then drilled three core holes at Eastern Star, targeting a bulk mineable gold deposit.
Present Condition, Work Completed, and Exploration Plans
In 2014, The Company completed mapping, sampling and trenching programs. Company geologists identified several quartz veins that had been exploited by historic prospect pits and small shafts. Surface grab samples from these veins confirmed the widespread presence of high-grade gold within mineralized quartz vein material.
The Company performed an 880-meter trenching program. The channel samples intercepted notable gold mineralization including contiguous samples up to 10.4 meters of 2.25 gpt gold and 6.4 meters of 7.97 gpt gold (which included 4.3 meters of 11.34 gpt gold).
Although no significant work was performed at Eastern Star during the 2015-2018 period, the Company is preparing to resume exploration efforts in 2019. The Company’s exploration objective at Eastern Star is to evaluate its potential for high-grade gold-bearing quartz veins, similar to those that led to historic production and patenting of the mineral claims.
Geology & Mineralization
The Eastern Star property is underlain by extensively weathered, high grade metamorphic rocks such as biotite gneiss and schist, intruded by dikes and sills emanating from the Idaho Batholith. Two types of gold mineralization are present at the Eastern Star property. The first is the large, low-grade, bulk tonnage mineralization associated with the northerly trending Orogrande Shear Zone and the second is the easterly trending high-grade gold quartz veins.
