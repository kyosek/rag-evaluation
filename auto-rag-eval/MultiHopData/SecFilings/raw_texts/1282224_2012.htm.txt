Business Summary
Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. is dedicated to the production of high-quality digital content. With the launch of Dolphin Digital Studios, the Company is at the forefront of the growing digital entertainment sector. Dolphin Digital Studios is committed to consistently delivering premium, best-in-class entertainment and securing premiere distribution partners to maximize audience reach and commercial advertising potential.
The growth of online video viewing is well-documented. While all major demographics have experienced an increase in online video viewing for several years in a row, it is worth mentioning the tremendous potential of the “tween” and “teen/young adult” space online. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8-18 year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes across a typical day, or more than 53 hours per week, to using entertainment media. This creates a huge opportunity for quality content for this audience, which increasingly turns to the internet to source its entertainment options. Advertisers have taken notice, with leading digital-marketing research firm eMarketer estimating that online video ad spending (the fastest-growing advertising segment) will surpass $5 billion in the United States of America alone by 2014.
Management sees an opportunity for Dolphin Digital Media to become a “market leader” digital studio.
Dolphin Digital Media has also announced its entry into “Kids Clubs,” or online websites to serve as destinations for entertainment and information. Management seeks to partner with established “brands” in the children’s space, and to expand each brand’s existing online audience through the promotion of original content supplied and/or sourced by Dolphin Digital Studios. Premium entertainment offerings, such as original web series, will serve to both increase audience through positive word-of-mouth and to increase engagement, or length of time on site. Furthermore, the Kids Clubs will serve as the platform for sponsorships and other marketing opportunities, such as contests and sweepstakes. In addition, the Kids Clubs are tremendous marketing vehicles for the respective brands, as they keep the brands “top of mind” for the youngest generation, and in a space (the online world) where they increasingly go.
Dolphin Digital Media partnered with the University of Miami to launch its first kids club, the Coca-Cola Junior Canes Club, in September, 2011. In February 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. to launch a Kids Club in this upcoming back-to-school season. These are perfect examples of high-quality brands with tremendous reach to children nationwide that will benefit from the engagement that comes from a highly entertaining and informative Kids Club. To date, the Company has not generated any material revenue and has incurred $50,000 in expenses related to the Kids Clubs.
Finally, Dolphin Digital Media continues to enhance and support its online safety product for children, Dolphin Secure, which is an easy-to-use software that downloads onto any computer in a child’s life, and gives parents the ability to guide where their children can go, and who they can talk to, while online. Dolphin Secure was born out of a decision to provide a proactive solution for parents concerned with the online safety of their children. Busy parents need an easy-to-use system which gives them peace of mind that their rules for internet safety are being followed even when they are not around.
Dolphin Digital Studios
During the quarters ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012, September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011and March 31, 2011, the Company’s focus has primarily been devoted to Dolphin Digital Studios, which creates original content to premiere online. Substantially all of the Company’s operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 were incurred related to Dolphin Digital Studios.
Dolphin Digital Studios is a natural fit and progression in the core business of Dolphin Digital Media -entertaining its customers through high-quality digital programming. Premium online video is the largest growth sector for online advertising, with market leaders such as Yahoo!, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and AOL recently announcing major initiatives around original programming.
Dolphin Digital Media foresees 3 distinct demographics for its upcoming “web series”:
4.
Tweens (roughly 9-14 years old);
5.
Teens and Young Adults (roughly 14-24 years old); and
6.
General Market (roughly 14-49 years old).
Each of these demographics will be served with different content, and the Company may have different distribution partners for each of these demographics.
Dolphin Digital Studios earns revenue from the online distribution of its web series in three different ways:
4.
Producer’s Fees: Dolphin Digital Studios will earn fees for producing each web series, as included in the production budget for each project;
5.
Advertising Revenue: typically, Dolphin Digital Studios will be entitled to between 50-60% of all advertising revenue generated by its distribution partner from the online distribution of any particular web series; and
6.
Sponsorship Revenue: Dolphin Digital Studios will generally retain between 70-100% of any product integration fees, or sponsorship revenues, associated with any of its web series.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the Company recognized revenues of $2,098,500 and cost of revenues of $1,577,484 and during the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company recognized revenues of $998,582 and cost of revenues of $960,983 from Dolphin Digital Studios. Web series, in general, have a fairly short development and production cycle, thus allowing for quick distribution (as opposed to traditional television and film models). The Company received $359,000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2011, $536,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and $105,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2012 from investors through Equity Finance Agreements for web series in production through December 31, 2012. On January 1, 2013, the production “cycle” will cease and the Investors will be entitled to share in the future revenues of any productions for which the funds invested were used. Per the Equity Finance Agreements, the Company is entitled to a producer’s fee, not to exceed $250,000, for each web series before calculating the share of revenues owed to the investors. Based on the gross revenues of production to date and the amount of investor funds used to date, the Company is not required to pay the investors any amount in excess of the existing liability already recorded and as such did not record any additional provision related to these agreements as of September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012, September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011.
Dolphin Digital Studios expects to initially produce several web series a year. Some projects may be self-financed, while some projects currently under development will feature strategic and financial partnerships. This will allow Dolphin Digital Studios to have attractive project financing alternatives while developing its slate of programming.
Furthermore, the web series from Dolphin Digital Studios can be repackaged for distribution into “traditional media,” such as television and home video, on a worldwide scale, which will significantly increase the revenue potential for any particular web series. Web series that migrate to traditional media outlets will also benefit from having a pre-established track record and viewer base. For distribution into such outlets, Dolphin Digital Studios will capitalize on its existing relationship with Dolphin Entertainment, one of the top independent television producers and distributors in the world, with a specialty in quality children’s and teen programming. Founded in 1996, Dolphin Entertainment is an Emmy-nominated production and distribution company that has recently produced programming for Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Canada’s Family Channel. Dolphin Entertainment currently distributes its children’s and teen programming into 300 million homes in over 100 countries. Furthermore, Dolphin Entertainment has great experience with “general market” programming, as well, having distributed television movies from U.S. partners that include Lifetime, Anchor Bay, and Starz, to name a few.
Warner Bros. Digital Distribution Partnership
Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. announced in 2010 the first two productions for Dolphin Digital Studios. These first two live-action multi-platform digital series with top Hollywood talent are being co-financed through an agreement with entertainment industry veteran Dolphin Entertainment (Executive Producer of hit Nickelodeon series Zoey 101) and Warner Bros. Digital Distribution.
The first titles produced under this agreement will be the futuristic survival tale H+: The Series from blockbuster Director / Producer Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men , Superman Returns and The Usual Suspects, and Executive Producer of hit television series House ) and the action-packed high school spy thriller Aim High from multi-talented Executive Producer and Director McG (Director of Charlie’s Angels , Terminator: Salvation and Executive Producer of television series Chuck and Supernatural ).
“Aim High”
Aim High is the story of a young man leading a double life - juggling his studies by day and serving as a government agent by night. This series chronicles the life of Nick Green, a high school sophomore who’s just starting a new school year as one of the country’s 64 highly trained teenage operatives.
When he’s not risking his life on top-secret missions, Nick is dreaming of Amanda Meyers, the most popular girl in school, who’s cool, intelligent, and very alluring. Amanda mercilessly flirts with Nick, but before he can enjoy her advances he has to avoid Derek - her overly protective boyfriend who threatens him for even looking at her.
Aim High comes from Director/ Producer McG, production company Wonderland Sound and Vision, and production services were provided by Bandito Brothers. Peter Murrieta, who served as Executive Producer for the Disney Channel mega-hitWizards of Waverly Place, is the Executive Producer. The series is written by Heath Corson (Living with Abandon / Scary Godmother) and Richie Keen (Living with Abandon), who also serve as Executive Producers, directed by Thor Freudenthal ( Hotel for Dogs/ Diary of a Wimpy Kid ) and produced by Lance Sloane ( Yucatan ).
Jackson Rathbone, best known for his role as the scarred vampire “Jasper Hale” in the Twilight movie series, stars as teenage government operative “Nick Green.” He is joined by Aimee Teegarden, known to loyal Friday Night Lights fans as “Julie Taylor,” who stars as Nick’s charming love interest “Amanda Miles.”
Aim High also stars Rebecca Mader (Lost) as Nick’s sultry science teacher “Ms. Walker,” Johnny Pemberton ( Megadrive ) as the well connected best friend “Marcus,” Clancy Brown ( Highlander ) as Russian mercenary “Boris the Bear,” Jonathan McDaniel ( That’s So Raven ) as Amanda’s jealous boyfriend and swim team captain “Derek Long,” and Greg Germann ( Ally McBeal ) as the protective “Vice Principal Ockenhocker.”
“H+: The Series”
H+ takes viewers on an episodic two-and-a-half hour, apocalyptic journey into the future where technology has gone horrifically wrong. In 2019, 33% of the world’s population uses a radical new piece of technology - an implanted computer system called H+. This allows a person’s mind and nervous system to be connected to the Internet 24 hours a day.
But that same year, a mysterious and vicious computer virus is released, and within seconds millions of people die - leading to radical changes to the political and social landscape of the planet.
H+ is produced by Director / Producer Bryan Singer in association with Bad Hat Harry Productions (House). The series comes from the imaginative minds of writers John Cabrera ( Gilmore Girls ) and Cosimo de Tommaso who also serve as Executive Producers, directed by Stewart Hendler ( Sorority Row ) and produced by Lance Sloane ( Yucatan ). H+ is currently in post-production and was filmed in Santiago Chile.
Dolphin Digital Studios’ never became involved with the production of this second web series in the partnership and subsequently focused its resources on the production of Cybergeddon.
Cybergeddon
On March 30, 2012, the Company announced its new project Cybergeddon. Anthony Zuiker, the visionary creator of the CSI franchise and his production company Dare to Pass, and Yahoo, Inc. the premier digital media company have partnered with Dolphin Digital Studios for this ground breaking motion picture event which will bring to life the growing threat of cybercrime. True to his storytelling form, Zuiker has engaged Norton by Symantec to leverage its technical credibility and security insights to help inform and guide the narrative. Cybergeddon will be released this Fall, through Yahoo’s global online distribution, as a series of installments to roll out sequentially.
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company incorporated Cybergeddon Productions, LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary. The company entered into agreements with certain vendors and as part of these agreements is responsible for creating 6-12 digital episodes of approximately eight to fifteen minutes in length. The Company received $720,000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and $360,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that it recorded as Deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company completed the web series during the quarter ended September 30, 2012 and recorded revenues of approximately $2,099,000 related to this production during the quarter ended September 30, 2012. The Company began amortizing the capitalized production costs using the individual film forecast computation method and amortized costs of approximately $1,344,000 related to this production during the quarter ended September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, the Company has capitalized production costs related to this production, net of accumulated amortization and estimated tax credits, of approximately $959,000 that are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as capitalized production costs.
On April 9, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with a vendor to create a universal (iPhone and iPad) iOS app and an Android app for the series. For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company recorded $222,500 in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company expensed $320,000 as advertising costs related to this app during the quarter ended September 30, 2012.
Management expects future announcements relating to distribution partners for the tween and general market demographics.
Cambio Distribution Partnership
Cambio and Dolphin Digital Media have entered into an exclusive content deal, in which 4-6 original web series will be financed per year. In this deal Dolphin Digital Media and Cambio will collaborate to identify original material to produce, with an emphasis on established screenwriters, actors, directors and producers. Cambio holds exclusive rights to distribute the content online in the United States. Dolphin Digital Media holds the underlying copyright in each production, as well as worldwide distribution rights outside of the online rights in the United States.
This relationship with Cambio ensures a premium online distribution partner for the upcoming slate of teen/young adult web series from Dolphin Digital Studios.
Kids Clubs
Dolphin Digital Media sees tremendous opportunity from the combination of the following two consumer trends: 1) a greater number of children under 18 have access to the internet in their lives (and most “own” their own devices - i.e. laptop computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.); and 2) those children who do have access to the internet spend an increasingly greater amount of time “online.” Simply put, the internet has become the next generation’s “go to” destination for both entertainment and information.
“Offline” brands need to engage with their participants “online” or risk losing them altogether. It is a tremendous lost opportunity to build successful engagement with children and teenagers in the “real world” and offer them nothing (let alone an equivalent engagement opportunity) in the digital world. For example, Little Leagues may exist for the enjoyment of children, but their websites are overwhelmingly only used by parents. Similarly, non-profits may exist to provide enrichment and cultural opportunities for children, but their websites are seldom visited by the children they cater to.
Dolphin Digital Media recognizes that it is uniquely positioned to offer such children’s organizations a real alternative. Management has tremendous experience in building engaging websites for children, creating best-in-class premium original online entertainment content, and in coordinating large-scale sweepstakes and promotional contests. Management believes that Dolphin Digital Media will quickly become the preferred partner for a variety of children’s organizations that have neither the time, financial resources or experience to provide online engagement for their participants, but who see the value in doing so.
In September, 2011, Dolphin Digital Media partnered with the University of Miami to launch the enhanced Coca-Cola Junior Canes Club, an exciting fan club for children that combines unique “real-world” offerings with an engaging online experience. The core of the Junior Canes Club is a fun and unique fan experience online at www.juniorcanesclub.com. Junior Canes Club members can ask their favorite player or coach a question, see exclusive videos and photos from University of Miami athletics, play online games, create and customize their own personal profile page, take fan polls, and much more. The Junior Canes Club is open to children 12-years of age and younger. A registration fee of $20 provides each Junior Canes Club member with a Welcome Kit, which includes an Official Coca-Cola Junior Canes T-shirt, a membership card, and an autographed photo from Sebastian the Ibis. Each month thereafter is only $9.99, and entitles Junior Canes Club members to an array of benefits, both at sporting events and online, which currently hold over a $400 annual value. On November 25th, all Junior Canes were invited to receive free admission to the University of Miami vs. Boston College ACC Conference football game. Club members also received free admission to select men’s and women’s basketball games, as well as to select baseball games. By using their exclusive membership card, they also received free admission to all home women’s soccer and women’s volleyball games. There are multi-child discounts, with the second child (and each additional child) per household receiving 50% off the monthly fee (only $4.99 per month per additional child). The Company will share equally revenues from net membership fees with the University of Miami. For the quarters ended September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012, and September 30, 2011, the Company did not generate any significant revenues or incur significant expenses from this Partnership with the University of Miami.
In February 2012, Dolphin Digital Media entered into an agreement with U.S. Youth Soccer to create the “US Soccer Clubhouse” website. This site will give kids the opportunity to view photos of their favorite players and teams, get up to date news on games and events, view videos of popular TV shows and celebrities and play online games. Similar to the Junior Canes Club, they will be able to create their own personal profile page. The site will also feature an event calendar so the members can stay informed of upcoming games, fan celebrations, etc. In addition, there will be several sweepstakes throughout the year for an opportunity to meet a national celebrity. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the details concerning the membership benefits and fees. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company hired a third party to begin building the US Soccer Clubhouse website at an initial cost of $125,000. The first installment of $25,000 was paid during the first quarter, the second $25,000 installment was paid during the second quarter and the remaining payments will be made monthly over a period of two years upon receipt of the completed site which was subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2012.
On May 21, 2012, Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. entered into an agreement with a note holder to form Dolphin Kids Club LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed to convert $1,500,000 of notes payable into equity of Dolphin Kids Club, LLC and received additional capital contributions of $1,500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2012 (of which $1,325,000 has been received during the nine months ended September 30, 2012) for a 25% member interest in the newly formed entity. Dolphin holds the remaining 75% and thus controlling interest in the entity. The purpose of this entity is to create and operate online Kids Clubs for selected charitable, educational and civic organizations. The agreement encompasses Kids Clubs created between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. It is a “gross revenue agreement” and Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. will be responsible for paying all associated operating expenses. Net income will be attributable to each member based on the thresholds established in the operating agreement of the entity. Dolphin Kids Clubs, LLC has been consolidated in these financial statements with amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interest presented as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. As of September 30, 2012, the Company recorded a noncontrolling interest of $2,825,000 for the 25% interest in Dolphin Kids Clubs LLC. Except as noted in the preceding paragraph, the Company did not incur any liabilities or derive any revenue from this agreement during the third quarter of 2012.
Dolphin Secure
Dolphin Digital Media has developed Dolphin Secure, a groundbreaking family Internet solution that gives parents the tools to protect their children online. In a truly revolutionary offering, and one of the major aspects that makes Dolphin Secure a unique service, a child may fully utilize the “Dolphin Surf” social network and communicate with their friends only by using Dolphin Secure fingerprint identification. Upon registration, a new user scans their finger using the Dolphin Secure UPEK fingerprint reader. The scanned fingerprint is then converted into a number and stored in a protected, remote database. The child’s account details (e.g. parental settings and personal preferences) are associated with this number, which is created by an irreversible algorithm.
Once Dolphin Secure has been downloaded, the computer is unable to access the internet or IM applications without requiring identification from the user. With a fingerprint swipe, obviously unique to the user, Dolphin Secure is able to identify each user, thus allowing its safety settings to be customizable to each individual child within the household. Thus, Dolphin Secure protects where each child may go online, and who they may talk to, even when the parents are not home. The Dolphin Secure “master white list” of pre-approved sites ensures that children are free to explore and learn online more safely without the risk of stumbling onto pornography, inappropriate content or other illicit material. Furthermore, for the first time, parents have the option to set the boundaries of who their child can speak to, or who they can be approached by to speak with, online.
“Dolphin Surf,” the “landing page” associated with Dolphin Secure (i.e. where the child “starts from” on the internet once they’ve provided their fingerprint swipe) is a social network where kids have the opportunity to create a profile, IM with approved friends, search for new friends, upload photos, send e-mails and customize a homepage that includes a widget library of content, friend updates and much more, all under the protection of the Dolphin Secure system. “Dolphin Surf” differentiates itself from other social networking sites where users, and their personal content, are vulnerable to anyone who knows, or can guess, their password. It is the sharing of passwords among the overwhelming majority of children that exposes them to so many dangers of cyber-bullying, including online impersonation (e.g. when a classmate or “friend” who knows their password goes into their social network account and sends out an embarrassing e-mail, photo or IM to their entire address book, pretending to be them while also switching their password so that they can’t even access their account after the fact to try and limit the damage).
By creating and managing child-friendly social networking websites utilizing state-of the-art fingerprint identification technology, Dolphin Digital Media has taken an industry-leading position with respect to Internet safety for children.
On February 8, 2011, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Dolphin Media Germany, an unrelated party, for the licensing rights of Dolphin Secure. Under the deal terms, Dolphin Digital Media will receive a royalty from all customer licenses and sales, once royalty payments due to the Company exceed the initial license fee of $275,000. In turn, Dolphin Media Germany has retained the German-language rights to Dolphin Secure, as well as a right of first negotiation to launch the product in other European territories. There have been no royalties received by the Company in relation to the licensing agreement.
Management Expertise
The launch of Dolphin Digital Studios leverages our management expertise in creating high-quality entertainment, especially for children and young adults.
Dolphin Entertainment, founded in 1996 by our Chairman, C.E.O. and President, Bill O’Dowd, is one of the world’s leading entertainment companies specializing in children’s and young adult live-action programming, with divisions dedicated to Television Production, Feature Film Production, International Distribution and Merchandising and Licensing. Dolphin Entertainment served as Executive Producer to Nickelodeon’s Emmy™-nominated hit series Zoey 101 and Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide, as well as eight different television movies that have premiered on Nickelodeon in the past five years. Dolphin Entertainment distributes its programs worldwide, with sales in over 100 countries (reaching almost 300 million homes) for its current children’s properties, including Mexico, Italy, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and South Africa, among many others. Dolphin Entertainment has successfully launched international merchandising lines for its children’s properties in nearly every consumer category, including publishing, apparel, sleepwear, accessories, and cosmetics.
Dolphin Digital Media holds a multiyear exclusive licensing agreement with Dolphin Entertainment, currently not set to expire until June, 2018. Under the license, Dolphin Digital Media is authorized to use Dolphin Entertainment’s brand properties in connection with social networking sites. The license requires that Dolphin Digital Media pays Dolphin Entertainment royalties at the rate of fifteen percent of the net sales from performance of the licensed activities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company did not use Dolphin Entertainment’s brand properties and therefore no royalties were payable under the licensing agreement.
Results for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011
The Company has revenues of $0 and $275,000 from licensing and production fees for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively.

General and administrative costs increased by approximately $550,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011.

The Company is currently finalizing the terms of the employment agreement but has accrued for costs as per current discussions. The bonus is contingent on the CEO’s continued employment with the Company through 2012. The Company also made a payment of $100,000 as a charitable contribution. Legal fees have decreased by $42,000 from $64,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2011 to $22,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2012 since the Company settled litigation in the first quarter of 2011. The Company also decreased its Public Relations costs for the same periods by $45,000 by terminating a contract that it had with a Public Relations firm.
Interest expense increased by $41,402 from $25,839 to $67,241 due to a total of four promissory notes entered into during the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 for a total of $1,300,000 with an unrelated party. The promissory notes bear interest at 10% per annum. The increase is also due to an increase in the balance of the promissory note to our CEO.
During the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, the Company deconsolidated a Canadian subsidiary and recognized a gain on deconsolidation of $293,730, mostly from third party liabilities. It also wrote off accumulated other comprehensive income of $65,235 related to foreign currency translations.
The net loss was $956,575 or $(0.01) per share based on 81,892,352 weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared to a loss of $42,285 or $(0.00) per share based on 81,892,352 weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.

On March 23, 2012, one of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy in Canada. The Company recognized a gain on deconsolidation in the amount of $293,730 related to write off of third party liabilities.

Cash flows from financing activities increased by $147,000 during the first quarter of 2012. This is due to loans received in return for three unsecured promissory notes signed by the Company. During the first quarter of 2011, cash flows from financing activities increased mainly due to advances from our CEO in the net amount of $149,000, proceeds received from pay down of warrants in the amount of $100,000 and proceeds from revenue sharing agreements related to web series productions in the amount of $359,000.

Critical Accounting Policies
See “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and our current comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, for discussion of significant accounting policies, recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on the Company. These policies have been followed for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recent accounting pronouncements that the Company has adopted or will be required to adopt in the future are summarized below.
In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance for comprehensive income which requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. Also, the entity is required to present reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
In October 2012, the FASB issued new guidance on the Impairment Assessment of Unamortized Film Costs, ASU 2012-07, Entertainment -Films (Topic 926): Accounting for Fair Value Information That Arises after the Measurement Date and Its Inclusion in the Impairment Analysis of Unamortized Film Costs. The amendment in this ASU requires that if evidence of a possible need for a write down of unamortized film costs occurs after the date of the balance sheet but before the financial statements are issued, a rebuttable presumption exists that the condition leading to the write off existed at the balance sheet date and therefore requires that those conditions be incorporated into the fair value measurement as of the balance sheet date. The amendment also eliminates the requirement that an entity incorporate into fair value measurements used in the impairment tests the effects of any changes in estimates resulting from the consideration of subsequent evidence if the information would not have been considered by the market participants at the measurement date.
For SEC filers, the amendments are effective for impairment assessments performed on or after December 15, 2012. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for impairment assessments performed on or after December 15, 2013. The amendments resulting from this ASU should be applied prospectively. Earlier application is permitted, including for impairment assessments performed as of a date before October 24, 2012, if for SEC filers, the entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued, or, for all other entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. We will adopt this guidance during the fourth quarter when performing our impairment analysis for the financial statements of December 31, 2012.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There have not been any off balance sheet arrangements for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, March 31, 2012, and June 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
