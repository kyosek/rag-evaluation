Item 2. Properties
As of December 31, 1995, Registrant owned interests in six partnerships which each own one property and a minority interest in an additional partnership which owns one property. A summary description of each property is given below.
a. Locke Mill Plaza - consists of 78 residential condominium units and 6,700 sf of commercial/retail space (of which 1,600 sf is used for in-house office and maintenance services) in a 185 condominium unit project located at Buffalo Avenue and Union Street in North Concord, North Carolina. An affiliate of the Registrant owns an additional 10 units. In December 1988, Registrant acquired the units for $5,042,000, ($65.44 per sf) which was funded by Registrant's equity contribution and two $1,250,000 notes payable. In February 1992, one lender advanced $50,217 to pay real estate taxes. This amount was added to the then outstanding principal balance. Subsequently, at the recommendation of the lender, the existing property management contract was terminated and a new manager was engaged. Since that time, occupancy and cash flow have improved. However, the cash flow has still not been sufficient to cover operating expenses (including real estate taxes) and debt service, including principal amortization. In order to ease the debt service payment burden on the property, the Registrant discussed with its two lenders the possibility of restructuring its loan obligations. These discussions were not successful. In January 1994, the property's ad valorem property tax payments were in default and the taxing authorities commenced proceedings to sell the property. Since the property was unable to satisfy past due obligations and meet the demands of its secured creditors, on February 14, 1994, Locke Mill Partners ("LMP", the partnership to which the property was transferred on January 21, 1994) filed a reorganization petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 6, 1995, LMP filed the Second Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") and the Plan was confirmed in August 1995. The Plan provides for the following : (1) the sale of some or all of the units to satisfy the claims of its creditors; and (2) an extension of the maturity date of the notes payable for three years, with the option to extend for an additional two years if at least fifty percent (50%) of the principal amount of the debt outstanding at the confirmation of the Plan has been repaid. The net proceeds of the sales will be used to retire the principal balance of the debt. At December 31, 1995 none of the units have been sold. A new lender has placed a wrap-around mortgage on the property in the amount of $3,500,000 (principal balance of $3,583,625 at December 31, 1995) and has agreed to fund the necessary costs for the marketing and any improvements to the units. The wrap-around mortgage amount is supported by a current appraisal of the property, therefore the difference between the wrap-around mortgage and the underlying mortgages was accounted for as an adjustment to the related fixed assets. Monthly payments of interest to the new lender are to be made in an amount equal to net operating income, with a minimum of $25,000 per month. The note accrues interest at 12% and is due in August 2000. The property is managed by BCMI. As of December 31, 1995, 73 units were under lease (94%) with monthly rents ranging from $400 to $600, and 5,243 sf of commercial space were leased (78%) at annual rents ranging from $1.45 to $3.16 per sf.
All residential leases are renewable, one-year leases. The occupancy for the residential units for the previous four years was 93% for 1994, 96% for 1993, 94% for 1992 and 91% for 1991. The monthly rental range has been approximately the same since 1991. The occupancy for the commercial space was 46% for 1994, 46% for 1993, 41% for 1992 and 24% for 1991. The average annual rent has been $2.07 per sf in 1994, $5.10 to $6.75 per sf for 1993, $5.85 per sf for 1992 and $3.24 per sf for 1991. There are four tenants who each occupy ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. They operate principally as a beauty salon, modeling agency, leasing office and a maintenance shop. The leasing office and maintenance shop each have month to month leases which requires sixty (60) days notice to vacate. All leases are operating leases and the minimum future rentals on the noncancelable leases as of December 31, 1995 are $8,100. There are no contingent liabilities included in income for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.
The following is a table showing commercial lease expirations at Locke Mill Plaza for the next five years. Total annual rental covered % of gross Number of Total sf of by expiring annual rental leases expiring expiring leases leases from property
1996 2 3,683 $ 8,100 2% 1997 - -0- -0- 0 1998 - -0- -0- 0 1999 - -0- -0- 0 2000 - -0- -0- 0
Although no firm commitments have been made, the Registrant anticipates that the two leases which are scheduled to expire in 1996 will be extended for at least an additional year, due to the long-standing tenancy of the merchants and the availability of renewal options under their leases.
For tax purposes, this property has a federal tax basis of $5,756,314 and is depreciated using the straight-line method with a useful life of 27.5 years. The annual real estate taxes are $39,997 which is based on an assessed value of $3,703,390 taxed at a rate of $.46 per $100 by the City of Concord and a rate of $.62 per $100 by the County of Cabarrus. It is the opinion of the management of the Registrant that the property is adequately covered by insurance.
b. Firehouse Square - consists of 32,544 sf of commercial space at 902-910 King Street in Alexandria, Virginia. In December 1988, Registrant was admitted, with a 90% general partner interest, to Firehouse Square General Partnership ("FSGP"), a Virginia general partnership, for a cash capital contribution of $1,750,000. FSGP acquired and rehabilitated the property for $5,660,000 ($151.51 per sf), funded by the equity contribution and a mortgage note payable of $4,207,000. The original note terms, as amended on December 28, 1988, provided for interest payable monthly at a rate of prime plus 1/2% in addition to monthly principal installments of $2,600 with maturity in June 1993. Due to insufficient cash flow, FSGP ceased making debt service payments in November 1992. On December 1, 1992, FSGP was given notice of the existence of certain defaults under the loan documents. After the cure period expired, the lender accelerated the loan and declared it due and payable in full. In addition, the lender exercised its rights pursuant to the Assignment of Lessor's Interest in Leases and directed all tenants to commence making their rent payments directly to the lender. In order to forestall the lender's threatened
foreclosure, on January 28, 1993, FSGP filed a reorganization petition pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In May 1993 the lender sold its note and mortgage to another entity. On June 1, 1993, an agreement was entered into with the new holder of the note and mortgage to restructure the loan and the bankruptcy was subsequently dismissed. Accrued interest in the amount of $218,728 was added to the principal balance of the note. The lender also advanced $40,711 for real estate taxes and $33,627 for tenant improvements. Monthly payments of interest to the new note holder were to be made in an amount equal to net operating income, with a minimum of $22,916 per month. The note accrues interest at prime plus 1/2% (9% at December 31, 1995 and 1994). On November 16, 1994, a foreclosure sale was held the first mortgage holder bid its loan receivable at the sale, and became the successful bidder. The first mortgage holder sold its successful bid to a partnership known as 901 King Street Associates ("KSA"). KSA is a general partnership owned 90% by DHI-VI. The selling price of the mortgage was the outstanding balance of the mortgage immediately prior to foreclosure. The obligation has terms materially the same as the original mortgage loan and is secured by a new mortgage on the Property. Therefore, after the sale, the Registrant's interest in the Property is unchanged. The principal balance at December 31, 1995 was $4,202,189. The entire principal balance is due October 1998. In June 1995, the Registrant refinanced $900,000 of the first mortgage (principal balance of $895,661 at December 31, 1995). The new loan bears interest at 9.75%, payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of $8,021 and is due in June 2005. The property is managed by BCMI. As of December 31, 1995, Firehouse Square has 26,041 sf of space under lease (80%) at annual rates ranging from $6.57 to $26.96 per sf.
The occupancy for the previous four years was 88% for 1994, 87% for 1993, 53% for 1992 and 53% for 1991. The average annual rent has been $6.50 to $19.29 per sf for 1994, $6.50 to $30.18 per sf for 1993, $19.78 per sf for 1992, and $23 per sf for 1991. There are three tenants who each occupy ten percent or more of the rentable square footage. They operate principally as a civic association, a law firm and an architectural firm. All leases are operating leases and the minimum future rentals on the noncancelable leases as of December 31, 1995 are $409,160. There are no contingent liabilities included in income for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

The Registrant has entered into negotiations with a current tenant to expand into 452 sf of space under an expiring lease at $7.00 per sf and into 2,816 sf of vacant space at $10.50 per sf. There have been no additional negotiations regarding the remaining 5,663 sf of space under expiring leases and the Registrant expects that the space will be vacated.

e. Strehlow Terrace Apartments - consists of 70 low income apartment units located at 2024 North 16th Street, Omaha, Nebraska. In January 1989, Registrant was admitted with a 98% general partner interest to Strehlow Terrace Apartments Limited Partnership ("STALP"), a Nebraska limited partnership, for a cash capital contribution of $2,250,000. STALP acquired and rehabilitated the property for $5,817,000 ($52.02 per sf) funded by the equity contribution and three mortgage loans. The first loan, financed through the Governmental National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") is for $1,789,000 (principal balance at December 31, 1995 of $1,775,053), bears interest at 10-1/4%, is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of $15,540, and is due in 2030. In August 1993, six units were damaged by a fire at Strehlow Terrace. Due to the financial difficulties caused by the fire, STALP fell behind on its monthly debt service by several months. Although the property was able to reduce the arrearage by 50% and commenced regular, monthly payments by May 1994, the loan was declared in default and was assigned by GNMA to the Federal Housing Administration/Housing and Urban Development ("FHA/HUD"), on June 24, 1994. Although this assignment subjects the management and operation of this property to more intense scrutiny, it does provide greater flexibility for structuring a workout. A workout proposal, which provides for a reduced interest rate and repayment of the loan arrearage over thirty-six months, was submitted to FHA/HUD in August 1994. The workout proposal has been revised several times and it is anticipated that an acceptable workout agreement will be reached and the loan will be returned to a current status. The other two loans were made by the City of Omaha. One, in the amount of $1,700,000, bears interest at 1%, and the other, in the amount of $75,000, is non-interest bearing. The principal and interest (if any) on both City of Omaha loans is due upon the sale of the property or in the year 2030, whichever is earlier. The property is managed by a property management firm which is an affiliate of the Registrant's co-general partner of STALP. On December 31, 1995, 61 of the apartments were leased (87%) at monthly rents ranging from $275 to $533.
All leases are renewable, one-year leases. The occupancy for the previous four years was 91% for 1994, 95% for 1993, 96% for 1992 and 93% for 1991.

During 1990, Registrant made an additional cash contribution of $200,000. (The 1% limited partnership interest is also controlled by Registrant; it is held by a Pennsylvania corporation whose stock is owned by Registrant). CHHA acquired and rehabilitated the property for $9,700,000 ($94.41 per sf) which was funded by the equity contribution and a construction loan of $4,000,000 which bore interest at prime plus 1%. In order to extend the maturity date of the construction loan until September 1993, the Registrant agreed to make monthly principal payments of $7,500 in addition to the interest. CHHA ceased making these principal payments in April 1993 due to cash shortfalls resulting from expenditures for certain
deferred maintenance items. In September 1993, the loan was converted to a permanent loan with a maturity date of September 1998. Beginning in October 1993, principal payments of $2,500 per month and interest at prime plus 1% were made for one year. In October 1994, the interest became fixed at 7.75% and monthly principal (based on a 30-year amortization) and interest payments commenced. In October 1995, the Registrant ceased making debt service payments. The loan was sold in December 1995. The Registrant entered into an agreement with the new holder of the note (principal balance of $4,627,000 at December 31, 1995) whereby the maturity of the loan was extended to December 2000 and monthly payments of interest are to be made to the new note holder in an amount equal to net operating income, with a minimum of $30,000 per month.
