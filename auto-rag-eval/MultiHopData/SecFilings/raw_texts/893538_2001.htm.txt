Mid-Continent Region. Since 1973 St. Mary has been active in the Mid-Continent region, where operations are managed by our 32-person Tulsa, Oklahoma office. We have ongoing exploration and development programs in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas. The Mid-Continent region accounted for 33% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001, or 126.3 BCFE, 85% of which were proved developed and 94% of which were natural gas. We participated in drilling 88 gross wells in this region in 2001, including 30 wells operated by us, 83% of which were completed as producers.
St. Mary's development and exploration budget in the Mid-Continent region for 2002 totals $33.0 million. We plan to operate 28 drilling wells in the Mid-Continent region during 2002 and to utilize three to four drilling rigs throughout the year. Our 2002 budget also reflects participation in an additional 100 to 125 wells to be operated by other entities.
Anadarko Basin. Our long history of operations and proprietary geologic knowledge enables us to sustain economic development and exploration programs despite periods of adverse industry conditions. We are applying state of the art technology in hydraulic fracturing and innovative well completion techniques to accelerate production and associated cash flow from the region's tight gas reservoirs. We also continue to benefit from the continuing consolidation of operators in the basin. We periodically pursue attractive opportunities to acquire properties from companies that have elected to discontinue operations in this basin. The $31.6 million acquisition of properties from JN Exploration that closed in December 2000 is a good example of this type of opportunity.
Approximately one-half of the drilling activities for 2002 will be focused on low-to-medium-risk development in the Cromwell, Granite Wash, Osborne, Red Fork and Spiro formations. In addition, approximately one-half of our 2002 Mid-Continent capital budget is allocated to deeper, higher-potential wells in the lower Morrow formation below 19,000 feet at the NE Mayfield Field in Oklahoma and in various other fields within the Morrow and Springer formations at depths between 10,000 and 16,000 feet.
Carrier Prospect. Within its inventory of higher-risk higher-potential exploration prospects, St. Mary holds an aggregate 42% working interest in 5,700 acres in Leon County, Texas. Our Carrier Prospect acreage relates to a platform reef prospect located near the industry's prolific Cotton Valley pinnacle reef discovery and targets potentially larger platform reefs that we believe developed in the deeper waters of the basin during the Jurassic period. We plan to seek industry participation for an initial test well in 2002.
Arkoma Basin. In Coal County, Oklahoma, we have acquired a leasehold position of 5,700 net acres. In 2001, we spud five gross wells, all of which were completed as gas wells. The producing formations in this area include the Booch, Hartshorne, Wapanucka and the Cromwell, which is the deepest formation at approximately 6,700 feet. Our average working interest for these wells is 98%, and we anticipate drilling at least ten gross wells in this area in 2002. Initial production rates from the wells have varied from approximately 500 Mcf per day to 1,250 Mcf per day. We are also actively pursuing additional leasehold positions within this four township area both through leasing activity and the acquisition of producing properties.
In February 2002 we acquired oil and gas properties and an 89-mile gas gathering system in the Arkoma Basin from Merchant Resources #1 L.P. of Houston, Texas for $7.8 million in cash. The properties include undrilled locations and are expected to complement other St. Mary properties in the area. The properties currently produce an estimated 1,200 Mcf of gas and 65 barrels of oil per day.
Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico Region. St. Mary's presence in south Louisiana dates to the early 1900's when our founders acquired a franchise property in St. Mary Parish on the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. These 24,900 acres of fee lands yielded more than $5.5 million of gross oil and gas royalty revenue in 2001. Our onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico presence increased significantly in 1999 with the acquisition of King Ranch Energy. This acquisition included 260,000 gross undeveloped acres (81,000 net acres) and a large 3-D seismic database. The Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region accounted for 13% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001, or 50.3 BCFE, 90% of which were proved developed and 88% of which were natural gas.
St. Mary's diverse activities in the onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico are managed by our 16-person regional office in Lafayette, Louisiana and include ongoing development and exploration programs in multiple basins onshore south Louisiana as well as several offshore shallow-water Gulf of Mexico blocks. Advanced 3-D seismic imaging and interpretation techniques and extensive subsurface geological interpretations are revitalizing exploration and development activities in the Miocene trend along the Gulf Coast. Our exploration and development budget in the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region for 2002 is $18.0 million.
The Judge Digby Field is the largest field acquired in the King Ranch Energy acquisition and is located outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana in Point Coupee Parish. We have interests ranging from 12% to 20% in nine wells that are producing a total of 130 MMcf per day on a gross basis as of February 12, 2002. This ultra deep field produces from multiple Tuscaloosa reservoirs between 19,000 and 24,000 feet. The wells are characterized by high producing rates such as the Parlange #11 completed in 2000 at an initial rate of 92,000 Mcf per day. We believe this well had the highest initial production rate for a well ever completed onshore Louisiana. New drilling in this field is continuing with the completion of the Parlange #12 in the deepest field pay ever produced at Judge Digby with initial rates of 64,000 Mcf per day. The J. Wuertele #2 was also completed in 2001, at an initial rate of 45,000 Mcf per day. The J. Wuertele #3 was spud on November 15, 2001 and is currently drilling toward a projected total depth of 22,000 feet. In addition to the drilling activity, multiple
recompletions of several wells are anticipated in 2002 in this multi-pay geologically complex field.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we plan to test a large 3-D target at Matagorda 701 during 2002. Matagorda 701 is located 50 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas in 110 feet of water. We also plan to test a large fault block on the east flank of the Matagorda 700 field in 2002.
Fee Lands. St. Mary owns 24,900 acres of fee lands and associated mineral rights in St. Mary Parish located approximately 85 miles southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. Since the initial discovery on our fee lands in 1938, our cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowner's royalties, from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle fields have exceeded $235 million. We currently lease 10,357 acres and have an additional 14,557 acres that are unleased. Our principal operators on the fee properties are BP Amoco, Cabot, ExxonMobil and Badger Petroleum. We have encouraged development drilling by our lessees, facilitated the origination of new prospects on acreage not held by production and stimulated exploration interest in deeper, untested horizons. A discovery at South Horseshoe Bayou in early 1998 and a subsequent successful confirmation well in early 1999 established that significant accumulations of gas are sourced and trapped at depths below 16,000 feet.
Centennial Project. St. Mary participated in a 51 square mile 3-D seismic survey over the Spindletop field near Beaumont, Texas, which was completed in 2001. Our partner group has leased or optioned approximately 19,000 acres within the seismic outline. We have a 21% working interest in this project, which is planned to be a multi-year exploration and development program. The partner group plans to drill several wells in this project in 2002.
ArkLaTex Region. St. Mary's operations in the ArkLaTex region are managed by our 18-person office in Shreveport, Louisiana. The ArkLaTex region accounted for 13% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001, or 48.7 BCFE, 85% of which were proved developed and 84% of which were natural gas. In 1992, we acquired the ArkLaTex oil and gas properties of T. L. James & Company, Inc. as well as rights to over 6,000 square miles of proprietary 2-D seismic data in the region. Much of the Shreveport office's successful exploration and development programs have derived from niche acquisitions completed since 1992 totaling $18.2 million. These acquisitions have provided access to strategic holdings of undeveloped acreage and proprietary packages of geologic and seismic data, resulting in an active program of additional development and exploration.
Our holdings in the ArkLaTex region are comprised of interests in approximately 502 producing gross wells, including 98 wells operated by us; interests in leases totaling approximately 73,500 gross acres; and mineral servitudes totaling approximately 14,600 gross acres. Activities in the ArkLaTex region during 2001 focused on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields as well as final development of several important field discoveries made by our geoscientists since 1994. We have expanded into southern Mississippi where the objective is to leverage our technical expertise in the Mississippi salt play. St. Mary participated with a 50% working interest in two successful wells in 2000 in the James Lime play in east Texas, where it completed the Jones #1 and Jones #2 wells as multi-lateral wells, each with initial production exceeding 4,000 Mcf per day. We will continue to be active in this play in 2002.
In 2002 we will continue to focus on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields in which to apply our proprietary geologic models and production techniques. We anticipate participating in 30 gross wells in the ArkLaTex region and are the operator of properties representing approximately
75% of our 2002 $14 million drilling capital expenditures budget.
Williston Basin Region. Nance Petroleum Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Mary, has conducted operations in the Williston Basin in eastern Montana and western North Dakota on our behalf since 1991, initially under a joint venture arrangement and subsequently as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Williston Basin region accounted for 32% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001, or 121.9 BCFE, 87% of which were proved developed and 80% of which were oil.
Our office in Billings, Montana includes a 28-person staff, some of which have spent over 20 years and their entire careers in the Williston Basin. A significant portion of the exploration and development in the Williston Basin is based on the interpretation of 3-D seismic data. We have successfully used 3-D seismic imaging to delineate structure and porosity development in the Red River formation. Since 1991 we have successfully completed 30 out of 32 gross wells drilled and operated. Our prospect inventory continues to expand as results from current activity lead to additional areas to conduct 3-D seismic surveys. Seven 3-D surveys are planned for 2002, exceeding the number of surveys conducted in any prior year.
St. Mary spent $16 million on exploration and development in the Williston Basin in 2001. In November 2001 we completed a $40.5 million acquisition of properties from Choctaw II Oil & Gas, Ltd. The properties are located in our Williston Basin core area and the Green River Basin in Wyoming and produce approximately 1,200 barrels of oil and 4,600 Mcf of gas per day. Our 2002 Williston Basin exploration and development capital budget is $22.0 million. We plan to drill ten operated wells with working interests ranging from 60% to 100%. We are the operator of properties representing approximately 80% of our Williston Basin capital budget in 2002.
Permian Basin Region. The Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of eastern New Mexico and western Texas and is one of the major producing basins in the United States. The basin includes hundreds of oil fields undergoing secondary and enhanced oil recovery projects. 3-D seismic imaging of existing fields and advanced secondary recovery programs are substantially increasing oil recoveries in the Permian Basin. Our holdings in the Permian Basin resulted from a series of niche property acquisitions since 1995, which total $21.9 million. We believe that our Permian Basin operations provide us with a solid base of long-lived oil reserves, promising longer-term exploration and development prospects and the potential for secondary recovery projects. The Permian Basin region accounted for 9% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001, or 36.1 BCFE, of which 81% were proved developed and 65% were oil.
St. Mary participated in drilling 12 gross wells in 2001 with a 100% success rate. The East Shugart Delaware Unit waterflood project was initiated in 2000. The initial response from the water injection is anticipated in 2002, and we are hopeful the East Shugart waterflood will be an analog to our successful Parkway Delaware Unit waterflood that increased production from 325 Bbl per day in 1996 when the property was aquired to 1,125 Bbl per day as of February 12, 2002.
Our Permian Basin capital budget for 2002 is $9.0 million. In addition to drilling four injection wells in the East Shugart Delaware waterflood, two Morrow test wells are planned in the Parkway field and six in-fill wells are planned at Ft. Chadbourne. The HJSA top lease on 30,450 acres in Ward County, Texas became effective on August 5, 2000 and at year-end 2001 was producing 2,800 MCFE per day net to St. Mary. 3-D seismic data over the 50 square mile
lease was reprocessed and is currently being evaluated. We believe opportunities will develop with respect to our non-operated 21.4% interest in this lease.
Other Areas. In 2001 we acquired leases covering 115,000 acres in which we own an average 92% working interest in the Hanging Woman Basin of Montana and Wyoming for prospective coalbed methane development. We have drilled an 18-well pilot program and are evaluating its results. We are also currently investigating permitting and environmental issues related to these prospects. We will be unable to determine the future potential of these prospects until we have completed the evaluation of our pilot program and have resolved all such permitting and environmental issues. An environmental public interest group has filed a lawsuit against the federal Bureau of Land Management seeking to cancel certain federal leases related to coalbed methane development in Montana, which could affect 46,000 of our 115,000 leased acres. We will monitor this lawsuit as part of our investigation of environmental issues related to these prospects.
Coalbed methane production is similar to our traditional natural gas production as to the physical producing facilities and the product produced. However, the subsurface mechanisms that allow the gas to move to the wellbore and the producing characteristics of coalbed methane wells are very different from traditional natural gas production. Unlike conventional gas wells, which require a porous and permeable reservoir, hydrocarbon migration and a natural structural and/or stratigraphic trap, the coalbed methane gas is trapped in the molecular structure of the coal itself until released by pressure changes resulting from the removal of in situ water. Frequently, coalbeds are partly or completely saturated with water. As the water is removed, internal pressures on the coal are decreased, allowing the gas to desorb from the coal and flow to the wellbore. Unlike traditional gas wells, new coalbed methane wells often produce water for several months and then, as the water production decreases, natural gas production increases as the coal seams de-water.
Coalbed methane gas production requires state permits for the use of well-site pits and evaporation ponds for the disposal of produced water. However, groundwater produced from the coal seams can generally be discharged into arroyos, surface waters, well-site pits and evaporation ponds without a permit if it does not exceed surface discharge permit levels, and if it meets state and federal primary drinking water standards. All of these disposal options require an extensive third-party water sampling and laboratory analysis program to ensure compliance with state permit standards. Where water of lesser quality is involved or the wells produce water in excess of the applicable volumetric permit limits, additional disposal wells would have to be drilled to re-inject the produced water back into deep underground rock formations.
We are also currently investigating other potential unconventional natural gas projects in the Rocky Mountains.
Acquisitions
In November 2001, we completed a $40.5 million acquisition from Choctaw II Oil & Gas, Ltd. of oil and gas properties located in our Williston Basin core area and the Green River Basin in Wyoming. In December 2000 we completed a $31.6 million acquisition of oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent region from JN Exploration. Also in 2000 we completed $21.5 million of niche acquisitions in our other core areas. During the last five years we have completed over $171 million of acquisitions. For 2002 we have budgeted $60.0
million for property acquisitions. However, we have the financial capacity to commit substantially greater resources to purchases should additional opportunities be identified. In February 2002 we completed a $7.8 million acquisition of properties in the Arkoma Basin of the Mid-Continent region from Merchant Resources #1 L.P.
Reserves
The following table presents summary information with respect to the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, as prepared by both Ryder Scott Company, independent petroleum engineers, and us. For the periods presented, Ryder Scott Company evaluated properties representing approximately 80% of our total PV-10 value while we evaluated the remainder. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves owned by St. Mary. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated, but prices include the effects of hedging contracts. You should read the following table along with the sections entitled "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Information concerning our reserves and future net revenue estimates is uncertain".
As of December 31, --------------------------------- 2001 2000 1999 ---- ---- ---- Proved Reserves Data: Oil (MBbls) 23,669 20,950 18,900 Gas (MMcf) 241,231 225,975 207,642 MMCFE 383,247 351,673 321,042 PV-10 value (in thousands) (1) $ 363,795 $ 1,153,663 $ 351,016 Proved Developed Reserves 86% 87% 84% Production Replacement 166% 168% 541% Reserve Life (years) (2) 7.1 6.7 10.3 ------------------
(1) PV-10 value as of December 31, 2001 was calculated using prices in effect at December 31, 2001 of $19.84 per barrel of oil (NYMEX) and $2.65 per MMBtu of gas (Gulf Coast spot price). Both of these prices were then adjusted for transportation and basis differentials. These prices were 26 % and 72 % lower, respectively, than prices used to calculate PV-10 value as of December 31, 2000. (2) Reserve life represents the estimated proved reserves at the dates indicated divided by actual production for the preceding 12-month period. The value as of December 31, 1999 reflects the acquisition of King Ranch Energy in December 1999.

Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2001, we had interests in 947 gross (319 net) productive oil wells and 1,396 gross (268 net) productive gas wells. Productive wells are either producing wells or wells capable of commercial production although currently shut in. One or more completions in the same wellbore are counted as one well. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced when it first commenced production, and such designation may not be indicative of current production.
Drilling Activity
