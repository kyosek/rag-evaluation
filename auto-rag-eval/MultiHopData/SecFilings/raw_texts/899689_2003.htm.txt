The following table sets forth the percentage of the New York City Office Properties 2003 revenue by tenants’ industry:
The Company’s New York City Office property lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may include extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant’s share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.
No tenant in the New York City office segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s 2003 total revenue. Below is a listing of tenants that accounted for 2% or more of the New York City Office Properties revenues in 2003:

Retail Segment
The Company owns 60 retail properties, of which 48 are strip shopping centers primarily located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states; five are regional malls located in New York, New Jersey and San Juan, Puerto Rico; and seven are retail properties located in Manhattan. The Company’s strip shopping centers and malls are generally located on major regional highways in mature, densely populated areas. The Company believes these properties attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood market place because of their location on regional highways.
The Company’s strip shopping centers contain an aggregate of 8.8 million square feet and are substantially (over 80%) leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvement stores, discount apparel stores, membership warehouse clubs and “category killers.” Category killers are large stores that offer a complete selection of a category of items (e.g., toys, office supplies, etc.) at low prices, often in a warehouse format. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price and location.
The Company’s five regional malls are as follows:
The Green Acres Mall in Long Island, New York contains 1.6 million square feet, and is anchored by four major department stores: Sears, Roebuck and Co., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Federated Department Stores, Inc. (“Federated”) doing business as Macy’s, and Federated doing business as Stern’s, that is currently dark. In February 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Federated to take back 63,000 square feet of the former Stern’s store. The remainder of the Stern’s space will be operated as a Macy’s Men’s Store and a Macy’s Home Store. Federated will continue to pay the same rent (exclusive of real estate taxes for the space taken back by the Company). The complex also includes The Plaza at Green Acres, a 172,000 square foot strip shopping center which is anchored by Wal-Mart and National Wholesale Liquidators. The Company plans to renovate the interior of the mall. In addition, the Company will construct 70,000 square feet of free-standing retail space and parking decks in the complex, subject to governmental approvals. Further, the Company has entered into a ground lease with B.J.’s Wholesale Club who will construct its own free-standing store in the complex. The expansion and renovation are expected to be completed by 2006.
The Monmouth Mall, located in Eatontown, New Jersey was acquired on October 10, 2002, by a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest. The mall contains 1.5 million square feet and is anchored by four department store tenants (Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, J.C. Penney’s and Boscovs), three of which own their stores aggregating 719,000 square feet.
The Bergen Mall in Paramus, New Jersey, contains 903,000 square feet and is anchored by Macy’s, Value City, Marshalls and Off Saks Fifth Avenue. The Bergen Mall was acquired on December 12, 2003, for approximately $145,000,000.
The Montehiedra Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 554,000 square feet and is anchored by Home Depot, Kmart, and Marshalls.
The Las Catalinas Mall in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contains 493,000 square feet and is anchored by Kmart and Sears, which owns its store.
The following table sets forth the percentage of the Retail Properties 2003 revenues by type of retailer:
The Company’s shopping center lease terms range from five years or less in some instances for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenants’ sales and pass through to tenants of the tenants’ share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant’s direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 1% of total shopping center revenues in 2003. None of the tenants in the Retail Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s 2003 total revenues.
Below is a listing of tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Retail properties revenues in 2003:
The aggregate occupancy rate for the 12,889,000 square feet of retail properties at December 31, 2003 is 93.0%. The occupancy rate includes leases for 691,000 square feet (6%) at four locations, which have not commenced at December 31, 2003. The following sets forth the occupancy rate and the average annual base rent per square foot for the Strip Shopping Centers and Regional Malls at the end of each of the past five years.

During 2003, approximately 803,000 square feet of retail space was leased at a weighted average rent per square foot of $17.40, an 11.6% increase over the weighted average rent per square foot of $15.59 for the expiring leases and 243,000 square feet of land was ground leased to retailers at a weighted average rent per square foot of $10.60. Following is the detail by property:
(1) Most leases include periodic step-ups in rent, which are not reflected in the initial rent per square foot leased.
Former Bradlees locations:
Property rentals for the year ended December 31, 2003, include $5,000,000 of additional rent which, effective December 31, 2002, was re-allocated to the former Bradlees locations in Marlton, Turnersville, Bensalem and Broomall and is payable by Stop & Shop, pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992. This amount is in addition to all other rent guaranteed by Stop & Shop for the former Bradlees locations. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. The Company believes the additional rent provision of the guaranty expires at the earliest in 2012 and is vigorously contesting Stop & Shop’s position.
In February 2003, Koninklijke Ahold NV, parent of Stop & Shop, announced that it overstated its 2002 and 2001 earnings by at least $500 million and is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, this situation may have on Stop & Shop’s ability to satisfy its obligation under the Bradlees guarantees and rent for existing Stop & Shop leases aggregating approximately $10.5 million per annum.

Production facilities typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors that are located nearby. These customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in the facilities until they are shipped to the next stage of production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide variety of customers’ finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each distribution facility generally services the surrounding regional market. Public facilities generally serve the needs of local and regional customers under short-term agreements. Food manufacturers and processors use these facilities to store capacity overflow from their production facilities or warehouses. AmeriCold Logistics’ transportation management services include freight routing, dispatching, freight rate negotiation, backhaul coordination, freight bill auditing, network flow management, order consolidation and distribution channel assessment. AmeriCold Logistics’ temperature controlled logistics expertise and access to both frozen food warehouses and distribution channels enable its customers to respond quickly and efficiently to time-sensitive orders from distributors and retailers.

Of the construction budget of $630,000,000 (which excludes $29,000,000 for development and guarantee fees to the Company), $402,000,000 has been expended through December 31, 2003 and an additional $62,200,000 has been committed to at December 31, 2003. Construction is expected to be completed in 2005.
Bloomberg L.P. has leased 695,000 square feet of the office space (the “Bloomberg Space”). On November 15, 2003 Alexander’s delivered approximately 87% of that space.

The residential space is comprised of 105 condominium units. The offering plan filed for these units, as amended for price increases through December 31, 2003, would produce (inclusive of the value of existing contracts) an aggregate sale price of $457,000,000. As of December 31, 2003, Alexander’s has received deposits of $10,425,000 on sales of the condominium units.
On February 13, 2004, Alexander’s completed a $400,000,000 mortgage financing on the Office Space of its Lexington Avenue development project placed by German American Capital Corporation, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank. The loan bears interest at 5.33%, matures in February 2014 and beginning in the third year, provides for principal payments based on a 25-year amortization schedule such that over the remaining eight years of the loan, ten years of amortization will be paid. Of the loan proceeds, $253,529,000 was used to repay the entire amount outstanding under the Construction Loan with HVB Real Estate Capital (Hypo). The Construction Loan was modified so that the remaining availability is $237,000,000, which is approximately the amount estimated to complete the Lexington Avenue development project. The interest rate on the Construction Loan is LIBOR plus 2.5% (currently 3.64%) and matures in January 2006, with two one-year extensions. The collateral for the Construction Loan is the same, except that the Office Space has been removed from the lien. Further, the Construction Loan permits the release of the retail space for $15,000,000 and requires all proceeds from the sale of the residential condominiums units to be applied to the Construction Loan balance until it is finally repaid. In connection with reducing the principal amount of the Construction loan Alexander’s will write-off $3,050,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs in the first quarter of 2004, of which the Company’s share is $1,010,000.
The Company has agreed to guarantee to the construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of project costs in excess of a stated loan budget, if not funded by Alexander’s (the “Completion Guarantee”). The $6,300,000 estimated fee payable by Alexander’s to the Company for the Completion Guarantee is 1% of construction costs (as defined). Based upon the current status of construction, Management does not anticipate the need to fund pursuant to the Completion Guarantee.
The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership
In 1998, the Company and affiliates of Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund III, L.P. (“Apollo”) formed a joint venture (30% owned by the Company and 70% owned by Apollo) (“Newkirk JV”) to acquire general and limited partnership interests in a portfolio of 104 partnerships, which own triple net leased properties. Since its formation, Newkirk JV has acquired equity interests in the above partnerships, which own approximately 19.6 million square feet of real estate and acquired certain first and second mortgages (“Contract Rights”) secured by a portion of these properties. On January 1, 2002, Newkirk JV completed a merger of 91 of the partnerships as well as the other assets it owned relating to the other 13 partnerships into The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”). The partnerships were merged into MLP to create a vehicle to enable the partners to have greater access to capital and future investment opportunities. In connection with the merger, the Company received limited partner interests in the MLP equal to an approximate 21.1% interest and Apollo received limited partner interests in the MLP equal to an approximate 54.5% interest. At December 31, 2003, the Company has a 22.6% interest in the MLP and Apollo has a 54.1% interest. Newkirk JV is the general partner of the MLP.
Simultaneously with the merger on January 1, 2002, the MLP completed a $225,000,000 secured financing collateralized by its interests in the entities that own the properties, subject to the existing first and certain second mortgages on those properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 3% (8.5% at December 31, 2003) and matures on January 31, 2005, with two one-year extension options. As a result of the financing, on February 6, 2002 the MLP repaid approximately $28,200,000 of existing joint venture debt and distributed approximately $37,000,000 to the Company.
On November 24, 2003, Newkirk JV and the MLP obtained new financing in the amount of $525,000,000. Of this amount $316,527,000 is secured by the Contract Rights and guaranteed by the MLP and $208,473,000 is secured by the assets of the MLP. The loan bears interest at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) LIBOR plus 4.5% or (ii) Prime plus 2.5%. The loan matures on November 24, 2006 and has two one-year extensions. The proceeds of the loan were used primarily to repay the MLP’s outstanding balance of the existing $225,000,000 credit facility and to distribute funds to its partners, of which the Company’s share was $74,106,000.
The Company’s share of the MLP and the joint venture debt was approximately $266,024,000 at December 31, 2003.
The following table sets forth a summary of the real estate owned by the MLP:
As of December 31, 2003, the occupancy rate of the properties is 99.4%.
