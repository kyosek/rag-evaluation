ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The information included in this Report about the Company's oil, NGL and gas reserves at December 31, 2000, including Standardized Measure, is based on proved reserves as determined by the Company's engineers.
Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the Company's control. This Report contains estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and the related future net revenues, which are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and related Standardized Measure of proved reserves set forth in this Report. In addition, the Company's reserves may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore, estimates of the Standardized Measure of proved reserves should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.
Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas prices prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received
or that will be received for oil and gas because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any date are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net revenues may be materially different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.
The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves during 2000 to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC.
Proved Reserves
The Company's proved reserves totaled 628.2 million BOE at December 31, 2000, 605.5 million BOE at December 31, 1999 and 676.8 million BOE at December 31, 1998, representing $5.6 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure. The four percent increase in proved reserves in 2000 was primarily attributable to the Company's successful capital investments, while the 93 percent increase in Standardized Measure during 2000 was primarily due to increases in commodity prices. The divestiture of oil and gas properties, partially offset by upward revisions of reserve quantities as a result of increases in commodity prices, was the primary reason for the decrease in reserves during 1999.
On a BOE basis, 77 percent of the Company's total proved reserves at December 31, 2000 are proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2000, and using the Company's reserve report production information for 2001, the reserve-to-production ratio associated with the Company's proved reserves is 14 years on a BOE basis. The following table provides information regarding the Company's proved reserves and average daily production by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Reserve Replacement
During 2000, the Company's proved reserves increased by 22.7 MMBOE as compared to a decline of 71.4 MMBOE during 1999. The Company's additions to proved reserves during 2000 were comprised of 27.5 MMBOE of upward revisions to previous estimates, 38.0 MMBOE of new discoveries and extensions and 7.4 MMBOE of asset purchases. Proved reserves declined by 50.1 MMBOE during 2000 due to current year production of 43.6 MMBOE and asset divestitures of 6.6 MMBOE. The positive revisions of 2000 were split between changes in estimates of future quantities available for production and changes in estimates of future quantities from improved commodity prices. The Company added 91.1 MMBOE of proved reserves during 1999 from revisions of previous estimates of 74.4 MMBOE, purchases of minerals-in-place of 7.3 MMBOE and new discoveries and extensions of 9.4 MMBOE. Proved reserve reductions during 1999 were comprised of 111.4 MMBOE from asset divestitures and 51.1 MMBOE of 1999 production. The positive impact of revisions in 1999 primarily resulted from improved commodity prices as compared to December 31, 1998 prices. The downward revisions in 1998 relate primarily to the lower commodity prices as of December 31, 1998, as compared to December 31, 1997. The Company's reserves as of December 31, 2000 were estimated using the WTI Cushing, Oklahoma spot oil price of $26.69 per Bbl and the Henry Hub, Louisiana gas spot price of $9.95 per Mcf, resulting in average realized prices of $25.71 per Bbl of oil, $16.74 per Bbl of NGLs and $7.50 per Mcf of gas
after normal quality, gathering and transportation adjustments. The Company's reserves as of December 31, 1999 were estimated using the WTI Cushing, Oklahoma spot oil price of $25.60 per Bbl and the Henry Hub, Louisiana gas spot price of $2.33 per Mcf, resulting in average realized prices of $24.33 per Bbl of oil, $17.59 per Bbl of NGLs and $1.83 per Mcf of gas after normal quality, gathering and transportation adjustments. As prices increase or decrease in future periods, reserves will be revised upward or downward for quantities which become economical or uneconomical to produce under the new price assumptions.
During 2000, the Company replaced 167 percent of its annual production on a BOE basis (196 percent for oil and NGLs and 140 percent for gas). During 1999, the Company replaced 178 percent of its annual production on a BOE basis (262 percent for oil and NGLs and 99 percent for gas). The Company's 2000 and 1999 reserve replacement were primarily impacted by the increase in commodity prices. On a BOE basis, the Company's 1998 reserve replacement rate was negative due to severe declines in commodity prices which resulted in downward reserve revisions.
Finding Cost
The Company's acquisition and finding costs per BOE for 2000 and 1999 were $4.66 and $2.21 per BOE, respectively. During 1998, the Company's acquisition and finding costs were negative. The negative rate in 1998 was a result of downward reserve revisions related to the decline in commodity prices during 1998. The average acquisition and finding cost for the three-year period from 1998 to 2000 was $6.94 per BOE, representing a 17 percent decline from the 1999 three-year average rate of $8.36.
Description of Properties
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has operations in the United States, Argentina and Canada, and exploration opportunities in South Africa and Gabon.
Domestic. The Company's domestic operations are located in the Permian Basin, Mid Continent and Gulf Coast areas of the United States. Approximately 86 percent of the Company's domestic proved reserves are located in the Spraberry, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields. These mature fields generate substantial operating cash flow and have a portfolio of low risk infill drilling opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Company's other development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally. During 2000, the Company expended $119.9 million in domestic exploration and development drilling activities. The Company has budgeted approximately $260 million for domestic exploration and development drilling expenditures for 2001.
Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average Btu content of 1,400 Btu per Mcf. The oil and gas are produced from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. The center of the Spraberry field was unitized in the late 1950's and early 1960's by the major oil companies; however, until the late 1980's there was very limited development activity in the field. Since 1989, the Company has focused on acquisition and development drilling activities in the unitized portion of the Spraberry field due to the dormant condition of the properties and the high net revenue interests available. The Company believes the area offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas reserves because of the hundreds of undeveloped infill drilling locations and the ability to reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.
During 2000, the Company placed 86 Spraberry wells on production, drilled one developmental dry hole and, at December 31, 2000, had 40 wells in progress. The Company plans to drill approximately 140 additional wells in 2001.
Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in Southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Company's Hugoton properties represent approximately 13 percent of the proved reserves in the field and are located on approximately 257,000 gross acres (237,000 net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells
in the Hugoton field, 985 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and associated NGLs.
Production in the Hugoton field is subject to allowables set by state regulators, but the Company's Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately 150 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing and before reduction for royalties). The Company estimates that it and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced at or near capacity in 2000. During 2000, the Company completed two development wells in the Hugoton field. The Company plans to drill approximately 25 Hugoton development wells in 2001.
The Company is planning to submit an application to the Kansas Corporation Commission to allow infill drilling into the Council Grove Formation. The Company believes that such infill drilling could increase production from its Hugoton properties. There can be no assurance that the application will be filed or approved, or as to the timing of such approval if granted.
West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas where initial production commenced in 1918. These stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Company's gas in the West Panhandle field has an average Btu content of 1,300 Btu per Mcf and is produced from approximately 600 wells on more than 241,000 gross (185,000 net) acres covering over 375 square miles. The Company's wellhead gas produced from the West Panhandle field contains a high quantity of NGLs, yielding relatively greater NGL volumes than realized from many other gas fields. The Company operates the wells and production equipment and Colorado Interstate Gas Company (a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Corp.) owns and operates the gathering system. The production from the West Panhandle field is processed through the Company-owned Fain natural gas processing plant.
During 2000, the Company placed 51 new wells on production and has three additional wells in progress at December 31, 2000. The Company plans to drill approximately 59 wells in 2001.
Other domestic properties. In the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas, the Company is focused on reserve and production growth through a balanced portfolio of development and exploration activities. To accomplish this, the Company has devoted most of its domestic exploration efforts to these areas, as well as its investment in and utilization of 3-D seismic technology. During 2000, the Company expended $82.9 million to drill 17 development and 13 exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas. The Company's development of the Canyon Express gas project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is progressing as planned, with first production anticipated in mid-2002. The Company also expects to begin development of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico Devils Tower project during 2001, with first oil production expected in late 2002 or early 2003. The Company has budgeted approximately $66 million of 2001 development capital for the Canyon Express and Devils Tower projects. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Company-operated well at Eugene Island 208 was successfully completed with multiple oil and gas pays and tested at a combined gross rate of production of 1,250 barrels of oil per day and 950 Mcf per day. The Company has a 75 percent working interest in Eugene Island 208. During 2000, the Company also announced the completion of the High Island Block 582 A#4 well, which encountered over 230 feet of pay. The Company has a 5.5 percent working interest in the High Island Block 582 A #4 well, which was drilled to a total depth of 15,147 feet.
In the East Texas Bossier gas play, the Company expects to invest approximately $37 million of 2001 capital to drill 25 operated and 12 non-operated wells. Additionally, in the South Texas Gulf Coast area, the Company's exploitation efforts in the Pawnee field have increased production from the field by over 135 percent since December 1999, to approximately 26 MMcf per day in December 2000. Utilizing advanced 3-D seismic modeling in this Edwards Reef play, the Company has completed eight horizontal reentries and four new horizontal wells. Five new wells and two horizontal reentries are scheduled for 2001 in the Edwards Reef. The Company is also expanding its Edwards Reef development program to include surrounding fields that could add a significant number of new locations.
International. The Company's international operations are located in the Neuquen Basin and Tierra del Fuego areas of Argentina and the Chinchaga, Martin Creek and Rycroft/Spirit River areas of Canada. Additionally, the Company has
entered into agreements to explore for oil and gas reserves in South Africa and Gabon. Approximately 17 percent, four percent and one percent of the Company's proved reserves are located in Argentina, Canada and South Africa, respectively.
Argentina. The Company's Argentine properties are primarily located in the Neuquen and Austral basins. The Company's share of Argentine production during 2000 averaged 25.6 MBOE per day, or approximately 22 percent of the Company's equivalent production.
The Company's operated production in Argentina is concentrated in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest of Buenos Aires and just to the east of the Andes Mountains. Oil and gas are produced primarily from the Loma Negra/NI Block, the Dadin Block, the Al Norte de la Dorsal Block, the Neuquen del Medio Block, the Al Sur de la Dorsal Block and the Estacion Fernandez Oro Block in which the Company has 100 percent working interests. The Company acquired its working interests in the Al Sur de la Dorsal Block and the Estacion Fernandez Oro Block during 1999.
The production concession in the Austral basin is located in Tierra del Fuego, which is an island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina, approximately 1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires. Oil, gas and NGLs are produced from six separate fields in which the Company has a 35 percent working interest. Production increases are anticipated from the area through exploitation and exploration and improving the oil and gas processing facilities and infrastructure on the island. Currently, production is being sent to the mainland through oil tankers and gas pipelines and exported to Chile through pipelines.
During 2000, the Company expended $62.8 million on Argentine exploration and development activities and drilled 30 development wells and 54 exploratory wells in Argentina, of which 28 development wells and 38 exploratory wells were successful. The Company plans to spend approximately $87 million on oil and gas development and exploration opportunities in Argentina during 2001.
Canada. The Company's Canadian producing properties are located primarily in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Production during 2000 averaged 9.1 MBOE per day, or approximately eight percent of the Company's equivalent production. The Company continues to focus its development, exploration and acquisition activities in the core areas of northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. The core Canadian assets are geographically concentrated, predominantly shallow gas and more than 90 percent operated by the Company in the following areas: Chinchaga, Martin Creek and Rycroft/Spirit River.
Production from the Chinchaga areas is relatively dry gas from formation depths averaging 3,400 feet. In the Martin Creek area, production is relatively dry gas from various reservoirs ranging from 3,700 feet to 4,300 feet. The Rycroft/Spirit River area produces primarily oil and consists of four unitized waterfloods producing from reservoir depths ranging from 4,400 feet to 5,000 feet.
During 2000, the Company expended $34.1 million on Canadian exploration and development activities and drilled 21 development wells and 14 exploratory wells primarily in the Chinchaga and Martin Creek areas, of which 17 development wells and 12 exploratory wells were successful. Effective October 1, 2000, the Company increased its interest to 100 percent in its Chinchaga gas field in northeast British Columbia by acquiring the remaining 13 percent working interest. The Company added production of 475 BOE per day from this acquisition and plans to drill as many as 70 extension and infill drilling locations over the next three years. The Company, as operator, plans to drill approximately 19 development wells and 26 exploratory wells in Canada during 2001. The Company expects to participate in an additional seven wells operated by other companies in the same areas. The Company plans to spend $35 million on oil and gas development and exploration opportunities in Canada during 2001.
Africa. The Company has entered into agreements to explore in South Africa and Gabon. The South African agreements cover over 13 million acres along the southern coast of South Africa, generally in water depths less than 650 feet. During 2000, the Company expended $15.7 million of exploration drilling and seismic capital in South Africa and Gabon. The Company drilled three exploratory wells in South Africa during 2000, of which one was unsuccessful and two were in progress as of December 31, 2000. During 1999, the Company performed
and analyzed seismic studies necessary for the analysis, ranking and timing of prospects in South Africa and Gabon. During 1998, five wells were drilled by the Company in South Africa, of which two discovered reserves.
During January 2001, the Company announced a discovery on the E-DQ1 "Boomslang" prospect, encountering over 100 feet of net pay, consisting of an oil leg under a gas column at a depth of 6,600 feet. The Company's test of a portion of the oil leg interval flowed at rates up to 3,120 Bbls of oil per day and 2.6 MMcf of gas per day over a 48-hour period. The Company is also testing the overlying gas column which, over a five day period, was flowing at a constant rate of approximately 24 MMcf per day and 300 Bbls of condensate per day. An appraisal well is also planned on the Boomslang prospect during 2001. The Company has budgeted capital to begin development of the Sable oil field in South Africa during 2001 with first production expected in late 2002 or early 2003. In Gabon, the Company plans to spud an exploratory well on its Olowi Block during the second quarter of 2001. During 2001, the Company plans to spend approximately $28 million on exploration and development opportunities in South Africa and Gabon.
