Item 2. Properties
Description of Property held by Silver Reserve Corp. (“SRC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Infrastructure Materials Corp.
Property Location and Description
The following is a map highlighting the counties in the State of Nevada where the properties held by SRC are located.
The following claim groups are described below: Clay Peters Claim Group, Silver Queen Claim Group, Klondyke Claim Group, Quailey Claim Group, NL Extension Claim Group, Dyer Claim Group, Blue Dick Claim Group, Santa Fe Claim Group, Pansy Lee Claim Group, Gold Point Claim Group and Red Rock Mill. These claims were originally acquired by the Company and assigned to SRC.
Mojave Property Purchase Agreement
On August 1, 2006, the Company entered into a property purchase agreement (the “Mojave Property Purchase Agreement”) with the Mojave Silver Company, Inc. to acquire a 100% interest in claims located in Esmeralda County and Mineral County, Nevada (as further described below) and known as the Silver Queen Claim Group, NL Extension Claim Group, Klondyke Claim Group, Dyer Claim Group, Blue Dick Claim Group, Clay Peters Claim Group, Santa Fe Claim Group, and Quailey Claim Group (collectively the “Mojave Claims”). The Mojave Claims were conveyed in exchange for 3,540,600 shares of the Company’s common stock, then valued at $885,150. All of the Mojave Claims were subsequently assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, SRC.
Clay Peters Claim Group
The Clay Peters Claim Group consists of 273 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 12 miles east of Mina, Nevada. Access is by dirt road. The elevations on the claim area range from 6,800 feet to 7,000 feet. The Clay Peters claims are located on the southernmost part of the Gabbs Valley Range. The workings on the property consist of numerous shafts and prospects. This claim group covers approximately 5,640 acres. Twenty-one claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC has subsequently staked an additional 252 claims.
Geologic mapping completed in 2007 indicated strong NW/SE bearing mineralized trends running across the property. Subsequent mapping indicated new strong gold, silver and copper mineralization along NW/SE bearing structures.
In September and October of 2012, the Company completed approximately 2,300 meters of drilling in 19 reverse circulation holes. In January 2013, the Company retained Zonge International Inc. of Reno, Nevada (“Zonge”) to perform a ground magnetic survey at the Clay Peters project covering a total area measuring 3,450 meters by 4,500 meters with 150 meter spacing between 18 east-west lines for a total of approximately 62.1 line-km of survey coverage. In July 2013 the Company announced that Zonge had completed an Induced Polarization/Resistivity geophysical orientation survey program to further define the geophysical features and identify drilling targets. The Company also conducted a 7,000 ft reverse circulation drill program in the Fall of 2013.
The 273 Clay Peters lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by Nevada Mining Claim (“NMC”) numbers: 871216 through 871223, 871229 through 871240, 871244, 964722 through 964724, 964732, 964733, 1038681 through 1038684, 1070161 through 1070193,1071455 through 1071492, 1081001 through 1081012, 1085644 through 1085709, 1088297 through 1088380 and 1100296 through 1100305.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 61 of 273 mineral claims and drop 212 claims in this claim group.
SRC is the registered holder of these unpatented, lode mineral claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
On May 16, 2014, SRC completed the purchase of three patented claims covering approximately 59 acres (the “Property”) situated in Mineral County, Nevada. These claims are known as the claims named “Commodore,” “Thrush” and “George F.,” and are identified as Mineral County Parcel APN 009-170-04, PLSS T7N, R36E MDM Section 2 and 11, as Survey No. 2593 and recorded as Patent File No. 45651. The Property was acquired from Ralph L. Buhrman and Jacqueline Buhrman (together, the “Buhrmans”) for a total of $90,000 pursuant to an Exploration License with Option to Purchase (the “Buhrman Agreement”) dated as of May 15, 2012. Mineral production, if any, from the Property is subject to a 2% royalty payable to the Buhrmans based upon gross revenues less deductions as defined by the Buhrman Agreement. SRC has the exclusive right and option to purchase such royalty at any time for the sum of $1,000,000 less any payments previously made by SRC to the Buhrmans pursuant to such royalty.
In the past the Federal government permitted private parties to obtain title to a claim known as a “patented claim” if certain conditions were met. A patented mining claim arises where the Federal Government passes its title to the claimant, making it private land. A mineral patent gives the owner exclusive title to the mineral interests and title to the surface and other resources. Patents for claims are no longer issued. Unpatented lode mineral claims are created by physically inserting a stake in the ground at each corner of the claim and filing the location of the claim as so demarcated with a government BLM recording office. The rights associated with an unpatented claim are restricted to the extraction and development of mineral deposits. No land ownership is conveyed with an unpatented claim.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Silver Queen Claim Group
The Silver Queen Claim Group consists of 120 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately nine miles west of Silver Peak, Nevada on Highway 47. The claim area covers approximately 2,438 acres. The property is accessed by dirt roadways. Seventy claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC subsequently staked an additional 48 claims and also purchased two claims in 2008.
The claims are located in the Red Mountain District. The Silver Queen Claim Group covers a northwest trending group of silver deposits that include the Silver Queen and Mohawk mines. In 1920 a producing mine was constructed and production continued through the late 1950's at the Mohawk location.
In June 2008 four drill holes were completed to depths of 400 to 500 feet vertically in the Silver Queen area on surface anomalies noted during grid sampling. In July 2008 five holes were drilled to intercept unmined mineralized zones noted by a previous operator within the Mohawk workings.
SRC entered into an option agreement (the “MGold Agreement”) dated August 2011 with MGold Resources Inc. (“MGold”), pursuant to which MGold would have an option to earn a 50% interest in the Silver Queen Claim Group. In October 2011, MGold commenced drilling to test mineralization below the historical Mohawk mine workings. Five reverse circulation holes were drilled for a total of approximately 3,500 feet of vertical drilling. Two of the five holes were drilled to intercept the Silver Queen vein system and three of the holes were drilled to target surface silver anomalies. Effective April 2012 MGold elected to terminate the MGold Agreement and the Company retained its 100% interest in the Silver Queen Claim Group.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
The 120 Silver Queen lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 737071, 737072, 870453, 969847 through 969850, 870454 through 870456, 870460 through 870472, 870476 through 870486, 870489 through 870495, 870500 through 870514, 870516 through 870535, 966964 through 966966, 966969 through 966975, 966977 through 966979, 966982 through 966988, 966990 through 967001, 967003 through 967009, 969852 through 969853, 986543, and 1068562 through 1068563.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 83 of 120 mineral claims and drop 37 claims in this claim group.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Klondyke Claim Group
The Klondyke Claim Group consists of 88 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada. The Klondyke Claim Group is accessible by road from Tonopah, Nevada. The property lies at elevations ranging from 5,400 feet to 5,908 feet. The claim group covers approximately 1,818 acres and is accessed by Nevada Route 93 and dirt road access. Twenty-one claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC subsequently staked an additional sixty-seven claims. This claim group also includes three owned patented claims and two leased patented claims covering a total of approximately 94 acres.
The Klondyke district, which was discovered in 1899, lies about 10 miles south of Tonopah, Nevada. Most of the deposits occur in veins within limestone carrying both silver and gold. The claim area hosts numerous prospects and mine shafts. The property geology was mapped at a scale of 1:12000 in 2007 and 5 separate sample grids were laid out and sampled to cover what appeared to be anomalous zones outlined during the mapping program.
Mapping and grid sampling to date indicate strong NE/SW bearing anomalous zones to the south of the old mine working where the structure runs NW/SE. Surface sampling in this zone carried grades as high as 42.3 oz silver and 0.1 oz gold per ton.
Grid sampling has identified a large gold-only anomalous zone in the southern portion of the property. A trenching program is recommended to expand this anomaly.
Five reverse circulation holes were drilled in the spring of 2012 for a total of approximately 1,600 feet. Four of the holes targeted an anomalous vein system in the northwest portion of the property and one hole was drilled on a gold surface anomaly in the southeast portion of the property.
The 88 Klondyke lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 867448, 867450, 867458, 867461, 867467 through 867469, 867471, 867472, 867474, 867476, 867478, 867480, 867482, 867484, 867487, 867490, 867492, 867494, 867496, 867498, 936129, 936131, 964631, 964638, 964641, 964642, 964644, 964646, 964648, 964650, 964656, 964665, 964667, 964682, 964699, 1039914, 1039918 through 1039920, 1039924 through 1039938, 1039942, 1039943, 1039955, 1039963, 1039966 through 1039972, 1039974 through 1039978, 1039980 through 1039983 and 1058716 through 1058722, 1058724, 1058725 and 1058728 through 1058731.
SRC is the registered holder of these unpatented, lode mineral claims and the owned patented claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada. Also, the patented claims are subject to County real estate taxes.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 50 of 88 mineral claims and drop 38 claims in this claim group.
In September 2012 SRC purchased 3 patented claims covering approximately 60 acres. These claims are known as the claims named “Annex No. 1,” “Annex No. 2” and “Possibility,” and are identified as Esmeralda County Parcels APN 00-005-73, APN 00-005-74 & APN 00-005-76; PLSS T1N, R43E MDM Section 29 and 30, as Survey No. 4141 and recorded as Patent File No. 485355.
In addition, SRC leases two patented claims covering approximately 35 acres from Ovidia Harting (“Harting”) pursuant to an agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) dated May 30, 2008. The Lease Agreement has a renewable term of 10 years and permits SRC to explore the area covered by the patented claims. The Lease Agreement provides for annual payments of $1,000 per claim to Harting. The Lease Agreement also provides that SRC pay the real estate taxes imposed by Esmeralda County. These two patented claims are subject to a 3% net smelter return royalty to be calculated and paid to Harting within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. These claims are known as the claims named “President” and “Annex,” and are identified as Survey No. 4141 in Section 30, PLSS T1N, R43E, APN 000-005-75 and 005-005-79 of Esmeralda County. The Company may terminate this Lease Agreement at any time by giving 60 days notice in writing to Harting.

Quailey Claim Group
The Quailey Claim Group is located in Mineral County, Nevada, and consists of 27 unpatented, lode mineral claims covering approximately 558 acres. Four of the unpatented claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC subsequently staked an additional 23 claims. The Quailey Claim Group also includes 11 owned patented claims and one leased patented claim, collectively covering approximately 212 acres.
The Quailey claims are located approximately 16 miles south-southeast from the town of Hawthorne, Nevada on the northwest side of the Excelsior Mountains and are accessible from Hawthorne via Nevada Route 359 and dirt roadways to the claim area. A number of dirt roads provide access to the main workings of the former mine. Most of the information for the Quailey Mine Project was obtained from a 1975 report by J. McLaren Forbes. The early work on the property was done in 1882 when copper ores with silver and gold values were mined and smelted on the property. Later, between 1907 and 1914, Excelsior Enterprises Inc. was active on the property. Just prior to this activity, a number of the claims were surveyed and patented. During the period 1975-76 the mine was rehabilitated. This work was done by Ladd Enterprises Inc. of Reno, Nevada.
Historical records indicate that an unknown amount of copper, gold and silver ores were mined from 4,000 feet of developed mine workings.
The 27 Quailey lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 916095, 916096, 916099, 916103, 935444 through 935446 and 1070204 through 1070223.
SRC is the registered holder of these unpatented, lode mineral claims and the owned patented claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the unpatented, lode mineral claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada. Also, the patented claims are subject to County real estate taxes.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 17 of 27 mineral claims and drop 10 claims in this claim group.
The 11 owned patented claims are identified below. The ten owned patented claims listed below as Parcels 1, 2 and 3 were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. The owned patented claim listed below as Parcel 4 was purchased in July 2012.
Parcel 1: the claim named “Nevada” identified as Mineral County Parcel APN 009-200-11; PLSS T5N R31E MDM Sections 2 and 3, as Survey No. 3298 and recorded as Patent File No. 141100.
Parcel 2, which includes eight claims named “Butte,” “Central,” “Calumet,” “Red Bank,” “Bonanza,” “Great Eastern,” “Roosevelt” and “Bisbee” and identified as Mineral County Parcels APN 009-200-10 and APN 009-200-12; PLSS T5N R31E MDM Sections 1, 2, 3, 10 & 11, as Survey No. 3303 and recorded as Patent File No. 141941.
Parcel 3, which includes the Northeasterly 750 feet of the “San Juan” claim identified as Mineral County Parcel APN 009-200-05; PLSS T5N R31E MDM Section 2, as Survey No. 3303 and recorded as Patent File No. 141941.
Parcel 4, the claim named “Franklin-third” identified as Mineral County Parcel APN 009-200-09; PLSS T5N R31E MDM Section 1 & 2, as Survey No. 3303.
In addition, SRC entered into a mineral lease agreement effective February 29, 2012 (the “Gumaskas Agreement”) with Joseph W. Gumaskas (“Gumaskas”) to lease one patented claim covering approximately 10 acres (the “Claim”) in Mineral County, Nevada. The Claim is known as “San Juan SW 750 feet,” and is identified as Mineral County Parcel APN 009-200-02, PLSS T5N R31E MDM Section 2, as Survey No. 3303 and recorded as Patent File No. 463521. Unless terminated earlier by SRC, the term of the Gumaskas Agreement is ten years and will automatically renew on the same terms and conditions for additional five-year periods. The Gumaskas Agreement requires SRC to pay Gumaskas advance minimum royalty payments of $500 annually. In the event that the Claim becomes a producing claim, SRC will pay Gumaskas a 3% royalty based upon gross revenue less deductions as defined by the Gumaskas Agreement. SRC may terminate the Gumaskas Agreement at any time by giving 60 days’ notice in writing to Gumaskas.

NL Extension Claim Group
The NL Extension Claim Group (the “NL Project”) consists of 18 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately 6.5 miles southwest of Silver Peak, Nevada on Highway 47. The claim group covers approximately 372 acres. Fifteen claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC subsequently staked an additional three claims.
The NL Project is accessible along a dirt road 7 miles west of Silver Peak. Elevations on the property range from 5900 feet to 6400 feet. The NL Project lies on the eastern flank of Red Mountain and, with the Sixteen-to-One deposit, forms a mineralized zone which trends northwesterly. The veins trend northeasterly across the zone. The Nivloc Mine operated from 1937 to 1943. The Nivloc Mine is adjacent but not within the claim group held by the Company. The Nivloc mine encountered non-mineralized carbonates at around 900 feet and we assume that the reserves here are exhausted.
A 5-hole exploratory reverse circulation drill program was completed by SRC in January 2008. Hole NL5 intersected 30 feet with an average grade of 2.5 ounce silver and 0.033 ounce gold per ton. The hole also intersected a second 15-foot zone with five feet grading 21 ounces silver and an average grade of 8.5 ounce silver per ton but no gold. These intersections appear to be extension of the Nivloc veins 2800 feet east of the old mine workings. Hole NL3 also appeared to intercept the vein but was abandoned due to up-hole collapse. Two additional core holes were drilled to target the veins intersection in NL5 from different angles to verify if the original intercepts went through the vein.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. On February 25, 2011, SRC entered into an option and joint venture agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with International Millennium Mining Inc. (“IMMI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of International Millennium Mining Corp. (“IMMC”), to sell an 85% interest in the NL Project for total consideration of $350,000 and 1,925,000 shares of IMMC’s common stock (the “Consideration”). Under the terms of the Option Agreement, the Consideration is payable over a five-year period that ends on September 15, 2015, with IMMI’s interest in the NL Project vesting at the end of such period. If the NL Project is determined to be economically feasible, based upon criteria contained in the Option Agreement, SRC will be required to fund its portion of an operating budget proposed by IMMI in order to retain its 15% interest in the NL Project and to acquire a 15% interest in IMMI’s Nivloc Mine Project (the NL Project and the Nivloc Mine Project, collectively, the “IMMI Project”). In the event that SRC decides not to fund its portion of the budget, its 15% interest would be forfeited, but SRC would be entitled to a 2% net smelter return royalty if and when the IMMI Project enters the production phase. Upon funding of the operating budget and SRC’s acquisition of a 15% interest in the IMMI Project, SRC and IMMI would enter into a joint venture agreement.
On March 5, 2013, SRC executed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with IMMI to sell to IMMI (1) all of SRC’s interest in the NL Project, and (2) all of its interest in the Option Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Sale Agreement, upon closing IMMI would pay SRC a purchase price of $425,000 and the Option Agreement would terminate. Also, upon closing of the Sale Agreement, SRC would transfer 100% of its interest in the NL Project to IMMI. The terms of the Sale Agreement provided that all Consideration paid by IMMI under the Option Agreement prior to closing would be retained by the Company. The closing date was scheduled to occur on or about April 30, 2013, and was extended several times. In connection with the closing date extensions, IMMI paid a 10% (ten percent) non-refundable deposit of $42,500 towards the purchase price. On October 4, 2013, SRC elected to terminate the Sale Agreement after IMMI failed to close the transaction as contemplated. Accordingly, the non-refundable deposit of $42,500 was forfeited by IMMI. The Option Agreement, as discussed above, remains in effect.
From late 2011 through 2012, IMMI conducted a drill program that consisted of 37 core holes, all directed at infilling an un-mined portion of the historical Nivloc Mine workings. Most of the holes were drilled from pads located on SRC’s claim NL6. According to information provided by IMMI, 33 of the drill holes intercepted the target zone and drill results indicated the existence of two vein structures, the Main Nivloc vein and an almost vertical splay vein.
Subject to the terms of the Option Agreement, SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as all payments required by law to maintain the claims are made. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
The 18 NL Project lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 867511 through 867525 and 964719 through 964721.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Dyer Claim Group
The Dyer Claim Group consists of 6 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately 5 miles east of the town of Dyer, Nevada on Highway 3A. The Dyer group of claims is accessible from the town of Dyer and cover approximately 124 acres. The Dyer district consists of several prospects and a few small mines that were operated by unknown operators. Phelps Dodge Corp briefly held claims in the area in the 1990’s. Mineralization consists of copper-gold in quartz veins within limestone rocks. All six claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims.

THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Blue Dick Claim Group
The 19 Blue Dick claims are located in the SE part of the Palmetto Mining District and cover approximately 393 acres. The Blue Dick claims are accessible from the town of Lida, Nevada. All 19 claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. Production occurred prior to 1960 and the deposits contained silver, gold and lead and occur in veins, according to available public records. Most of these veins trend west or northwest. The claim area contains numerous prospects, tunnels, shafts and two small open pit mines. The Blue Dick mine has two shafts and two tunnels but no data is available.
Geologic mapping and sampling indicates complex low angle faulting traced from the historic underground mine workings along strike for a length of at least 3000 feet. Rock chip sampling underground carried grades of gold 1.3 opt and silver 69 opt.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims.

Santa Fe Claim Group
The Santa Fe Claim Group consists of 23 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately five miles north of Luning, Nevada. This claim group covers approximately 475 acres. Sixteen claims were acquired pursuant to the Mojave Property Purchase Agreement. SRC subsequently staked an additional seven claims. The Santa Fe claims are accessible from the town of Luning, Nevada.
The Santa Fe district is located in the Gabbs Valley Range northeast of Luning. The Santa Fe property was first located in 1879 and has produced silver and lead, according to public records. Workings consist of a 300 ft incline and several hundred feet of tunnels on different levels. Significant silver and gold values have been obtained from sampling on the vein systems warranting further exploration. The property was mapped in late 2007 and a follow up grid sampling program may be developed to define drill targets at a future date.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims.

Pansy Lee Claim Group
On August 1, 2006, the Company acquired the Pansy Lee Claims Group from Anglo Gold Mining Inc. in exchange for 1,850,000 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 1, 2006 (the “Pansy Lee Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Pansy Lee Purchase Agreement, a 2% net smelter royalty pertains to 8 of the 30 claims in this group, identified as follows: NMC 879333 through 879335 and NMC 859406 through 895410. In the event that any one or more of the 8 claims becomes a producing claim, any revenue generated is subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty where net smelter returns are based upon gross revenue. Gross revenue would be calculated after commercial production commences and includes the aggregate of the following amounts: revenue received by the Company from arm’s length purchasers of all mineral products produced from the property, the fair market value of all products sold by the Company to persons not dealing with the Company at arm’s length and the Company’s share of the proceeds of insurance on products. From such revenue, the Company would be permitted to deduct: sales charges levied by any sales agent on the sale of products; transportation costs for products; all costs, expenses and charges of any nature whatsoever which are either paid or incurred by the Company in connection with the refinement and beneficiation of products after leaving the property and all insurance costs and taxes.
The Pansy Lee Claim Group currently consists of 30 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Humboldt County, Nevada, approximately eight miles northwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. The claim group covers approximately 620 acres. The Pansy Lee claims are accessible by road from Winnemucca, Nevada. A graded dirt road runs northwesterly for a distance of 12 miles to the property which lies at elevations ranging from 4600 feet to 5200 feet.
A substantial amount of underground work has been done on the Pansy Lee Claims, as much as 910 feet below surface with over 6000 feet of horizontal tunneling on several levels. A mine was operated at the Pansy Lee claim site from 1937 to 1942. Further production occurred in 1964 and 1974. Work was undertaken again in 1981 and 1982 by Santa Fe Mining Company.
The Nevada Bureau of Mines Bulletin 59 (1964) reported the following production figures for this claim group:
In March and April of 2008, SRC drilled three core holes and completed to depths of 800 feet on angle below the existing workings. It appears the 'Swede' vein was encountered in all three holes. Work to date indicates the mineralized zone should extend to depth and along strike on the 2 main veins in the mine. We believe further drilling of these extensions is warranted.
As described above, SRC holds this claim group subject to the 2% net smelter return royalty rights of Anglo Gold Mining Inc. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
The 30 Pansy Lee lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 859406 through 859432 and 879333 through 879335.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 12 of 30 mineral claims and drop 18 claims in this claim group.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Gold Point Claim Group
On February 15, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Roger Hall, then an officer and director of the Company, to acquire 14 unpatented, lode mineral claims referred to as the Gold Point Claim Group in consideration of the sum of $5,000 dollars payable in cash and 175,000 common shares of the Company.
As of the date of this report, the Gold Point Claim Group consists of 6 unpatented lode mineral claims covering approximately 124 acres located in Nye County in the Gold Point District, about 10 miles north east of Current, Nevada off Nevada Route 6. Access is via Route 6 and along a dirt road for approximately two miles.
Mineralization from 0.5 to 10 ppm gold was noted in shaley rocks adjacent to substantial jasperoids on the property. The jasperoids found in Nevada are hard, dense purple-black rocks where silica solutions have replaced limestone.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
The 6 Gold Point lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 975797 through 975802.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 3 of 6 mineral claims and drop 3 claims in this claim group.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Red Rock Mill
On August 1, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with International Energy Resources, Inc. (“IERI”) to purchase a mill building and related milling equipment located on 28 mill site claims near the town of Mina in Mineral County, Nevada. The mill building is a corrugated steel structure. The assets were conveyed in exchange for 6,975,000 Shares of the Company then valued at $1,743,750 pursuant to a property purchase agreement with IERI.
On August 1, 2006, the Company also purchased the refinery equipment from Nevada Refinery Inc. in exchange for 88,500 shares of common stock of the Company, then valued at $22,125. This equipment can be used to refine “doré” bars or smelt concentrate produced from the milling process. “Doré” bars are bars of precious metal, in this case silver and gold, poured from molten material recovered in the final processing of the mill.
The milling facility is a custom mill installation located on Highway 95 near the town of Mina, Nevada, approximately 185 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada. Access is via a dirt road east of Highway 95. The mill has operated under various configurations to meet specific requirements of prior operators. Ore from various sources has been custom milled and processed for the production of concentrate or doré bars.
The mill is nominally designed to process 200 tons of ore per day. Depending on the ore hardness, the crushing circuit will be able to process up to about 250 tons of ore per day. The flotation and leach sections are also capable of running at the 200 tons per day rate. However, other areas of the processing section do not appear to have sufficient capacity to sustain the mill’s nominal design rate and some additions may be required.
Beginning in 2007, the Company engaged a series of independent consulting companies to provide environmental consulting services to facilitate the regulatory permitting process for the milling facility. Although not yet complete, this permitting process is well advanced.
In August 2009, 22 of the 28 originally acquired mill site claims were abandoned. The Red Rock Mill claims currently include six unpatented, mill site claims covering approximately 30 acres.
Among the Company’s efforts to generate liquidity, we are seeking opportunities to monetize the Red Rock milling facility. At its current advanced permitting stage and given its components and processing capacities, we believe that we have the opportunity to either sell the mill or enter into leasing arrangements.
SRC is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to these claims. SRC will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
The 6 Red Rock Mill site claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 417400 through 417403, 417406 and 417407.

Description of Property held by Infrastructure Materials Corp US (“IMC US”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Infrastructure Materials Corp.
The following claim groups and leased mineral rights are described below: The Blue Nose Claim Group and the Morgan Hill Claim Group.
Property Locations and Descriptions
The following is a map highlighting the counties in the States of Nevada where the properties held by IMC US are located.
Blue Nose Claim Group
The Blue Nose Claim Group consists of 87 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Lincoln County, Nevada, west of Tule Desert, along the south edge of the Clover Mountains. The claim group is 8 miles east of the Union Pacific rail line in the Meadow Valley Wash. Access is via the graded Carp and Bunker Peak roads. The claim group covers approximately 1,797 acres of land managed by the BLM and was acquired as a result of IMC US locating and staking the claims.
In July 2010, the BLM approved the Company’s Plan of Operations for the Blue Nose Claim Group and the Company posted a reclamation bond in the amount of $240,805 (the “Reclamation Bond”) with the BLM in connection with the Blue Nose Claim Group. The Reclamation Bond backs the Company’s obligations under the Plan of Operations to restore the site and reclaim disturbance (if any) caused by the Company’s activities on the Blue Nose Claim Group. In December 2013, the Company submitted an application to withdraw its Plan of Operations and to seek a refund from the BLM of a portion of the Reclamation Bond. In January 2014, the application was approved and the Company received $219,205 from the BLM as a partial refund of the Reclamation Bond. Under the Plan of Operations, the Company drilled 28 reverse circulation holes to depths ranging between 150 and 900 feet for a total of approximately 17,000 feet. When combined with three earlier drill programs, a total of 63 reverse circulation holes approximately 30,000 feet have been completed at the Blue Nose Claim Group.
The Company engaged Mine Development Associates of Reno, Nevada (“MDA”) to assess the data from these drill programs. In a report dated January 5, 2011, MDA stated that two basic limestone units were defined by the drilling. The Lower White limestone unit appeared to contain few impurities and contains relatively high-grade calcium oxide (CaO). The Lower White unit is overlain by another limestone unit that is generally lower grade and contains more impurities. MDA’s report concluded that while further study is required to better define the extent and quality of the units, the Blue Nose Claim Group is estimated to contain significant levels of fairly high-grade limestone.
The 87 Blue Nose lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 1002036 through 1002045, 1002051 through 1002060, 1002065 through 1002075, 1002186 through 1002098, 1002108 through 1002121, 1002131 through 1002144, 1002154 through 1002160, 1002268, 1002169, 1002188, 1002189, 1002208, 1002209, 1002228 and 1002229.
IMC US is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to the above claims. IMC US will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee of $155 per claim to the BLM. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
Subsequent to the period covered by this report, the Company elected to retain 40 of 87 mineral claims and drop 47 claims in this claim group.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
Morgan Hill Claim Group
The Morgan Hill Claim Group consists of 28 unpatented, lode mineral claims located in Elko County, Nevada, approximately 20 miles west of the town of Wells, Nevada. The claims are situated about five miles north of Interstate 80 and the Union-Pacific rail line. The property is accessed via the I-80 River Ranch Exit. The Morgan Hill claims cover approximately 578 acres of land managed by the BLM. All 28 claims were acquired when the Company purchased IMC US in November 2008.
The Morgan Hill claims cover a northeast trending package of sediments which include a block of favorable massive limestone that has a 2.5 mile strike length. This limestone exceeds 250 feet in thickness. The claim area contains very significant amounts of fine grained limestone within the Devonian Devil’s Gate and Nevada Formations. The unit thickness appears to range up to 500 feet and has varying amounts of interbedded magnesium oxide. There is adjacent sandstone for a silica supply required for cement. Morgan Hill has topography conducive to open pit mining. Preliminary tonnage estimates are positive with little to no initial strip ratio. Area topography allows access to drill areas with a track mounted drill rig. The property lies within 5 miles of the railhead. It is believed to be situated to competitively reach markets in Salt Lake City, Reno, Southern Idaho and Northern California. We have completed a 24-hole drill program on the project identifying three separate cement grade limestone zones of indeterminate thickness. Further drilling will be required to verify the thickness and continuity of the cement and high calcium zones.
The 28 Morgan Hill lode mineral claims are identified in the BLM records by NMC numbers: 989053 through 989055, 989058 through 989070, 989074, 989091, 989098 through 989099, 989103 through 989105, 989121 and 997416 through 997419.
IMC US is the registered holder of this claim group. There are no underlying agreements or royalty interests of third parties that pertain to the Morgan Hill claims. IMC US will remain as the record holder of the claims as long as it continues to make all payments required by law to maintain the claims. These payments include an annual fee to the BLM of $155 per claim. In addition, a claim holder is required to pay annual County filing fees in most counties within Nevada.
Included in the Morgan Hill Claim Group are two groups of mineral rights, the Perdriau Mineral Rights and the Hammond Mineral Rights.
Perdriau Mineral Rights
On November 30, 2009, IMC US entered into a Mineral Rights Agreement with Perdriau Investment Corp. (“Perdriau”) to purchase 50% of the mineral rights, including all easements, rights of way and appurtenant rights of any type that run with the mineral rights located in the section of Elko County, Nevada identified below (the “Perdriau Property”). The purchase price was $10 per net acre. IMC US purchased 340 net acres for a total purchase price of $3,400. Perdriau will be entitled to receive a royalty of $0.25 per ton for material mined and removed from the Perdriau Property. Material mined and stored on the Perdriau Property or adjacent property for reclamation purposes will not be subject to any royalty. Material removed from the Perdriau Property for the purposes of testing or bulk sampling, provided it does not exceed 50,000 tons, will also not be subject to any royalty. The royalty will be calculated and paid within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
The following description of the Perdriau Property is based upon reference points used in the Public Land Survey System (the “PLSS”) that is maintained by the BLM. The Perdriau Property is located on The National Map at T37N, R58E Elko County, Nevada in the following sections:
Hammond Mineral Rights Agreement
As of January 15, 2010, IMC US entered into a Mineral Rights Agreement with Eugene M. Hammond (the “Hammond Mineral Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company purchased a 25% interest in any and all minerals extracted from the 160 acres covered by the Hammond Mineral Rights Agreement, as described below (the “Hammond Mineral Rights Property”). The purchase price was $400. In addition, the seller is entitled to receive a royalty of $0.125 per ton on material mined and removed from the Hammond Mineral Rights Property. The Hammond Mineral Rights Agreement does not cover petroleum. The Hammond Mineral Rights Property is located at the following PLSS coordinates: T37N, R58E, Section 17, SE ¼, Elko County, Nevada.
THERE ARE NO KNOWN “RESERVES” IN THIS CLAIM GROUP. OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLAIM GROUP ARE ENTIRELY EXPLORATORY.
