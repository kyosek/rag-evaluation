Item 2. Properties
Property Overview
Our properties are primarily located in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio. The following illustrations depict the acreage position of our Exploration and Production segment and the midstream assets of our Midstream segment, each as of December 31, 2015.
The majority of our properties are located on or under private properties owned in fee, held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired without warranty of underlying land titles.
Exploration and Production Segment Properties
All of the current and planned operations of our Exploration and Production segment are located in what we believe to be the cores of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin. In addition, we have operations in the Upper Devonian Shale and Utica Shale on our Pennsylvania acreage. The properties of our Exploration and Production segment consist of interests in developed and undeveloped leases that entitle us to drill for and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, royalty and overriding royalty interests.
The table below summarizes data for our exploration and production operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
(1)
Marcellus Shale production for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was 89.6 Bcfe and 23.0 Bcfe, respectively.
(2)
Ohio Utica Shale production for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9 Bcfe.
Reserve Data
The information with respect to our estimated reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Amounts presented in this section exclude amounts attributable to our Marcellus joint venture for periods prior to the completion of our IPO in January 2014. In connection with our IPO, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in our Marcellus joint venture from our joint venture partner, and as such amounts shown as of December 31, 2014 include 100% of the amounts attributable to our Marcellus joint venture.
Reserves Presentation
Our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are based on evaluations prepared by our independent reserve engineers, Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (“NSAI”). A Copy of the summary report of NSAI with respect to our reserves as of December 31, 2015 is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. See “-Preparation of Reserve Estimates” for definitions of proved reserves and the technologies and economic data used in their estimation.
The following table summarizes our historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
(1)
Our historical estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure were determined using a 12-month average price for natural gas. The prices used in our reserve report yield weighted average wellhead prices, which are based on index prices and adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The index prices and the equivalent wellhead prices are shown in the table below.
(i)
Index price of our natural gas per MMBtu was $3.67 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013.
(ii)
Weighted average wellhead price of our natural gas per Mcfe was $3.90 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2013.
(2)
The table below summarizes historical estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2013 for our 50% interest in the Marcellus joint venture:
(3)
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Our pre-tax PV-10 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $0.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We estimate that our historical standardized measure as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is approximately $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately zero and $436 million, respectively, of future income taxes. However, the historical PV-10s and standardized measures of us and our Marcellus joint venture were equivalent, as of December 31, 2013, because our accounting predecessor, Rice Drilling B, and our Marcellus joint venture were not subject to entity level taxation. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state corporate income taxes provided for such periods because taxable income was passed through to Rice Drilling B’s and our Marcellus joint venture’s respective equity holders. However, in connection with the closing of our IPO, as a result of our corporate reorganization, Rice Energy Inc. became the sole member of Rice Drilling B. Rice Energy Inc. is a corporation subject to federal income tax and, as such, our future income taxes are dependent upon our future taxable income. We estimate that our historical standardized measure and the historical standardized measure for our Marcellus joint venture as of December 31, 2013, would have been approximately $269 million and $175 million, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately $148 million and $117 million, respectively, of future income taxes as a result of our being treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Proved undeveloped reserves are included in the previous table of total proved reserves. The following table summarizes the changes in the estimated historical proved undeveloped reserves of us during 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in MMcfe):
(1)
The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated historical proved undeveloped reserves during 2013 for our 50% interest in the Marcellus joint venture:
During 2015, extensions, discoveries, and other additions of 515 MMcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were added through the drillbit in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. These extensions, discoveries and other additions were partially offset by 334 MMcfe of downward net revisions. Revisions were largely the result of our reclassification of previously booked locations to the probable category as they are no longer expected to be drilled within five years of initial booking, partially offset by positive performance revisions. We incurred cumulative costs of approximately $129.6 million, of which $76.3 million was incurred in 2015, to convert 158 MMcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in 2015. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 are approximately $516.9 million over the next five years, which we expect to finance through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and other sources of capital financing. Our drilling programs are focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through delineation drilling. While we will continue to drill leasehold delineation wells and build on our current leasehold position, we will also focus on drilling our proved undeveloped reserves. Based on our reserve report as of December 31, 2015, we had 40 net drilling locations in the Marcellus Shale associated with proved undeveloped reserves and six net drilling locations in the Marcellus Shale associated with proved developed not producing reserves, and we had 15 net drilling locations in the Ohio Utica Shale associated with proved undeveloped reserves and seven net drilling location in the Ohio Utica Shale associated with proved developed not producing reserves. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of their initial booking date. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.”
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included in this Annual Report were based on evaluations prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firm of NSAI in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. Our independent reserve engineers were selected for their historical experience and geographic expertise in engineering unconventional resources.
Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. The technical and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, well-test data, production data (including flow rates), well data (including lateral lengths), historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. Our independent reserve engineers use this technical data, together with standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy. The proved developed reserves and EURs per well are estimated using performance analysis and volumetric analysis. The estimates of the proved developed reserves and EURs for each developed well are used to estimate the proved undeveloped reserves for each proved undeveloped location (utilizing type curves, statistical analysis, and analogy). Proved undeveloped locations that are more than one offset from a proved developed well utilized reliable technologies to confirm reasonable certainty. The reliable technologies that were utilized in estimating these reserves include log data, performance data, log cross sections, seismic data, core data, and statistical analysis.
Internal Controls
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to NSAI in their reserves estimation process. Ryan I. Kanto, our Vice President of Asset Performance, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has substantial industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Throughout each fiscal year, our technical team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process, a preliminary copy of the reserve report is reviewed by our senior management with representatives of our independent reserve engineers and internal technical staff.
Qualifications of Responsible Technical Persons
Ryan I. Kanto joined Rice Energy in June 2011 and serves as our Vice President of Asset Performance. Prior to Rice Energy, Mr. Kanto worked at EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. from June 2007 to May 2011.

Determination of Drilling Locations
Net undeveloped locations are calculated by taking our total net acreage and multiplying such amount by a risking factor which is then divided by our expected well spacing. We then subtract net producing wells to arrive at undeveloped net drilling locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Marcellus Locations - We assume these locations have 7,000 foot laterals and 750 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 121 acre spacing. In the Marcellus, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization and the risk associated with our inability to force pool in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 73,000 net acres in the Marcellus which results in 375 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Greene County Locations - We assume these locations have 7,000 foot laterals and 750 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 121 acre spacing. In Greene County, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization and the risk associated with our inability to force pool in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 19,000 net acres in Greene County which results in 112 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Upper Devonian Locations - We assume these locations have 7,000 foot laterals and 1,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 161 acre spacing. In the Upper Devonian, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization and the risk associated with our inability to force pool in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 85,000 net acres prospective for the Upper Devonian which results in 418 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Ohio Utica Locations - We assume these locations have 9,000 foot laterals and 1,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 207 acre spacing. In the Ohio Utica, we apply a 10% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 56,000 net acres prospective for the Utica in Ohio which results in 215 undeveloped net locations.
•
Undeveloped Net Pennsylvania Utica Locations - We assume these locations have 8,000 foot laterals and 2,000 foot spacing between wells which yields approximately 367 acre spacing. In the Pennsylvania Utica, we apply a 20% risking factor to our net acreage to account for inefficient unitization. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 49,000 net acres prospective for the Utica in Pennsylvania which results in 105 undeveloped net locations.
Production, Revenues and Price History
Natural gas, NGLs, and oil are commodities; therefore, the price that we receive for our production is largely a function of market supply and demand. While demand for natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically since 2000, natural gas and NGL supplies have also increased significantly as a result of horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation technologies which have been used to find and recover large amounts of oil and natural gas from various shale formations throughout the United States. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, weather and other seasonal conditions. Over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.”
The following table sets forth information regarding production, revenues and realized prices and production costs on a historical basis for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
(1)
Amounts presented in the table above exclude amounts attributable to our Marcellus joint venture for periods prior to the completion of our IPO in January 2014. In connection with our IPO, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in our Marcellus joint venture from our joint venture partner, and as such amounts shown for the year ended December 31, 2014 include 100% of the amounts attributable to our Marcellus joint venture from the date of acquisition forward and amounts for the year ended December 31, 2013 does not include amounts attributable to our Marcellus joint venture. The table below sets forth information regarding production, revenues and realized prices and production costs (excluding the impact of production taxes and impact fees) on a historical basis for the years ended December 31, 2013 for our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture:
(2)
The effect of hedges includes realized gains and losses on commodity derivative transactions.
(3)
Average costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, as presented, reflects cost attributable to our Exploration and Production segment. On a consolidated basis, the applicable costs per Mcfe as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, are as follows: lease operating - $0.22 and $0.26; gathering, compression and transportation - $0.42 and $0.36; production taxes and impact fees - $0.04 and $0.05; general and administrative - $0.51 and $0.63; and depletion, depreciation and amortization - $1.60 and $1.60.
Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 132 gross (120 net) producing wells in the Marcellus Shale, a total of four gross and net producing wells in the Upper Devonian Shale, and a total of 50 gross (19 net) producing wells in the Utica Shale, which includes one gross and net Utica Shale producing well in Greene County, Pennsylvania.
Acreage
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the total developed and undeveloped acreage in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 48% of our Marcellus acreage and 3% of our Utica acreage was held by production at December 31, 2015. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests is excluded from this table.
Undeveloped Acreage Expirations
The following table sets forth the number of total undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2015 that will expire in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and thereafter unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates or unless such leasehold rights are extended or renewed. We have not attributed any PUD reserves to acreage for which the expiration date precedes the scheduled date for PUD drilling. In addition, we do not anticipate material delay rental or lease extension payments in connection with such acreage.
Operated Drilling Activity
The following table describes our drilling activity on our acreage during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
We drilled three developmental wells and no exploratory wells during 2015, four exploratory wells during 2014 and one exploratory well in 2013.
Title to Properties
In the course of acquiring the rights to develop oil and natural gas, it is standard procedure for us and the lessor to execute a lease agreement with payment subject to title verification. In most cases, we incur the expense of retaining lawyers to verify the rightful owners of the oil and gas interests prior to payment of such lease bonus to the lessor. There is no certainty, however, that a lessor has valid title to its lease’s oil and gas interests. In those cases, such leases are generally voided and payment is not remitted to the lessor. As such, title failures may result in fewer net acres to us. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of
drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include:
•
customary royalty interests;
•
liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes;
•
obligations or duties under applicable laws;
•
development obligations under natural gas leases; or
•
net profits interests.
Midstream Segment Properties
The gathering, compression and fresh water distribution systems of our Midstream segment are located in what we believe to be the cores of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio, each of which are located in the Appalachian Basin. As of December 31, 2015, RMP owned our gas gathering systems in each of Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and our fresh water distribution systems in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio, and we owned our gathering system in Belmont County, Ohio.
RMP’s Gathering and Water Services
RMP has secured dedications from us under a 15 year, fixed-fee contract for gathering and compression services covering (i) approximately 93,000 gross acres of our acreage position as of December 31, 2015 in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and (ii) any future acreage we acquire within these counties, excluding the first 40.0 MDth/d of Rice Energy’s production from approximately 19,000 gross acres subject to a pre-existing third-party dedication and subject to the terms of contract. We have also granted RMP the exclusive right to provide certain fluid handling services to us until December 22, 2029 and from month to month thereafter. The fluid handling services include the exclusive right to provide fresh water for well completions operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for us within areas of dedication in defined service areas in Pennsylvania and Ohio. In addition, RMP has secured dedications from third-party customers under fixed-fee contracts for gathering and compression services in Washington County, Pennsylvania with respect to approximately 21,000 of their existing gross acres, and any future acreage they may acquire within areas of mutual interest of approximately 66,000 acres. RMP also provides water services to third parties to support well completion activities under fixed-fee contracts.
Washington County System
As of December 31, 2015, RMP’s Washington County gathering system consists of a network of 95 miles of 6- to 30-inch gathering pipelines and 13,240 horsepower of compression used to compress natural gas for our Exploration and Production segment and third-party producers. As of December 31, 2015, RMP’s Washington County gathering system had approximately 3.3 MMDth/d of gathering capacity with connections to Dominion, TCO, EQT and TETCO and was connected to all of our 88 horizontal Marcellus producing wells in Washington County.
Greene County System
As of December 31, 2015, RMP’s Greene County gathering system consists of a network of 18 miles of 6- to 16-inch gathering pipelines that collects natural gas from us and has a capacity of approximately 840 MDth/d. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, this system was connected to 36 horizontal Marcellus producing wells in Greene County, excluding wells acquired with the Greene County acreage acquisition. During 2016, RMP expects to expand the Greene County gathering system by adding additional compression.
Water Services
RMP’s water services assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio are engaged in the provision of water services to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for us and third parties in the Appalachian Basin. As of December 31, 2015, RMP’s Pennsylvania assets provided access to 8.7 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Monongahela River and several other regional water sources and RMP’s Ohio assets provided access to 10.7 MMgal/d of fresh water from the Ohio River and several other regional sources, both for distribution to our Exploration and Production segment and third parties.
Our Ohio Gathering Systems
In 2015, we completed construction on an aggregate of 48 miles of high-pressure gas gathering pipeline with 11,850 horsepower of compression used to compress natural gas for our Exploration and Production segment and third-party producers. As of December 31, 2015, our Ohio gathering system had approximately 2.6 MMDth/d of gathering capacity in the core of the Utica Shale in Belmont County, Ohio. Average daily throughput on our Ohio gathering system for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 247 MDth/d. This system services approximately 38,000 and 20,000 net acres of our current position and Gulfport’s current position, respectively, in Belmont County, Ohio.
On February 1, 2016, Strike Force Holdings, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Gulfport Midstream, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulfport, entered into the Strike Force LLC Agreement of Strike Force Midstream to engage in the natural gas midstream business in the Strike Force Midstream AMI. Under the terms of the Strike Force LLC Agreement, Strike Force Holdings made an initial contribution to Strike Force Midstream of certain pipelines, facilities and rights of way and cash in the amount of $41.0 million in exchange for a 75% membership interest in Strike Force Midstream. Gulfport Midstream made an initial contribution of a gathering system and related assets in exchange for a 25% membership interest in Strike Force Midstream.
Title to Properties
The real property tied to our midstream operations is classified into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our pipelines and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. We have leased or owned these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership of such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of its material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
