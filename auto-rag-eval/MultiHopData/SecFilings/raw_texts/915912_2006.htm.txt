ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES
Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights as defined below. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. The following is a description of each category:
Current Communities are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:
•
Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Established Communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of January 1, 2005, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
•
Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in, and that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.
•
Lease-Up Communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.
•
Redevelopment Communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For communities that we wholly own, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community’s acquisition cost. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement.
Development Communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.
In addition, we own approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Alexandria, Virginia, for our corporate office, with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases.
As of December 31, 2006, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:
Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.
Current Communities
Our Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. In January 2007, the Fund acquired one community containing 392 apartment homes. The Current Communities, as of January 31, 2007, include 115 garden-style (of which 15 are mixed communities and include townhomes), 21 high-rise and 15 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:
Other features at various communities may include:
We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy.
We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.
Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:
We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2006, including communities owned by joint ventures and the Fund, we completed construction of 1,368 apartment homes in six communities, acquired 1,397 apartment homes in six communities and sold 1,036 apartment homes in four communities. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 14.1 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the average age of our Current Communities is 9.3 years.
Of the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2007, we own:
•
a residual profits interest (with no ownership interest) in a limited liability company to which an operating community was transferred upon completion of construction in the second quarter of 2006.
We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in 17 of the Development Communities.
In each of our five partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of January 31, 2007, there were 144,955 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

(1) For the purpose of this table, Current Communities excludes communities held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
Development Communities
As of December 31, 2006, we had 17 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 5,153 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $1,323,300,000. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity.
The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees. Total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
(2)
Future initial occupancy dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
(4)
The remediation of our Avalon Lyndhurst development site, as discussed in Note 8, “Commitment and Contingencies” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included as Item 8 of this report, is substantially complete. The net cost associated with this remediation effort after considering insurance proceeds received to date, including costs associated with construction delays, is expected to total approximately $7.5 million. We are pursuing the recovery of these additional costs through insurance as well as from the third parties involved, but any additional recoverable amounts are not currently estimable. The total expected capitalized cost cited above does not reflect the potential impact of these additional net costs.
(5)
This community is being financed in part by third party, tax-exempt debt.
Redevelopment Communities
As of December 31, 2006, we had three consolidated communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be $25,800,000, excluding costs prior to redevelopment. In addition, the Fund has three communities under redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to Fund-owned communities, as well as communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.
The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Redevelopment Community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.
(2)
Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.
Development Rights
As of December 31, 2006, we are evaluating the future development of 54 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option. We generally hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 18 of the Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 14,185 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own. At December 31, 2006, there were cumulative capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $39,365,000 relating to Development Rights that we consider probable for future development. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $209,568,000 are reflected as land held for development as of December 31, 2006 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense.
You should carefully review Section 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.
The table below presents a summary of these Development Rights:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
We own the land parcel, but construction has not yet begun.
(3)
This Development Right is subject to a joint venture ownership structure.
(4)
This Development Right is subject to a joint venture arrangement. In connection with the pursuit of this Development Right, $125 million in bond financing was issued and immediately invested in a guaranteed investment contract (“GIC”) administered by a trustee as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
(5)
Represents improved land encumbered with debt. The improved land consists of occupied office buildings and industrial space. Net operating income from incidental operations from the current improvements are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
Recent Developments
Sales of Existing Communities. We seek to increase the value of our interests and increase our presence in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:
•
apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;
•
reduce operating expenses; and
•
leverage management talent.
To achieve this increased value creation and presence, we (i) sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a non-taxable, like-kind exchange transaction. We sold four communities, including one community previously held by a joint venture entity, containing an aggregate of 1,036 apartment homes, during the period from January 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007. Net proceeds from the sale of these assets were $218,492,000.
Land Acquisitions. We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2006, we acquired nine land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $91,574,000. The land parcels purchased, which are currently being developed or are held for future development, are as follows:
(1)
Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.
(2)
Future construction start dates are estimates. There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.
(3)
Excludes portion of land acquired that is not planned for development
In addition, in January 2007, we acquired a parcel of land located in Brooklyn, NY for approximately $70,000,000. We expect to begin construction of this high-rise community in the second half of 2007.
Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses
We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.
Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. A large concentration of our communities lies near, and thus is susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault and the Hayward Fault. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. We have in place with respect to communities located in California, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence. Earthquake coverage outside of California is subject to a $100,000,000 limit, except with respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a
$100,000 deductible per occurrence. In addition, up to a policy aggregate of $2,000,000, the next $400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional deductible.
We renewed the first $15,000,000 layer of our property insurance policy on May 1, 2006. We renewed the remaining layers on this policy on December 1, 2006. At that time, we elected to renew most of these layers so that they will now expire on May 1, 2007, in order to mitigate the risk of cost escalation and align the renewal date for the upper layers with the renewal date for the primary layer.
Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage renewed on August 1, 2006. We have completed our negotiations with the incumbent carrier and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year.
Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In December 2005, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act (“TRIEA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIEA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our general liability policy provides TRIEA coverage (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities. TRIEA is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. It is uncertain if Congress will extend TRIEA and continue to provide federal support for terrorism insurance. If Congress does not extend TRIEA, the cost and availability of terrorism insurance may be in question.
Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and the Company’s related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion on environmental contamination. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.
