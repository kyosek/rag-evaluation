ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2016, we had 199 properties in North America containing approximately 19.9 million RSF of operating properties and development and redevelopment of new Class A properties (under construction or pre-construction), including nine consolidated real estate joint ventures and one unconsolidated real estate joint venture. Property statistics presented are for our managed properties, which includes both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties at 100% of each property’s respective annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2016, and RSF, unless otherwise noted. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 96.6% as of December 31, 2016. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science and technology tenants. These improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:
•
Reinforced concrete floors;
•
Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•
Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•
Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•
Enhanced environmental control technology;
•
Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•
Laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2016, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of 28 properties that accounted for approximately 14% of our total number of properties. Of the 28 properties, we held 16 properties in the Greater Boston market, five properties in the San Francisco market, two properties in the New York City market, one property in the Maryland market, two properties in the Research Triangle Park market, and two properties in the Asia market pursuant to ground leasehold interests. As of December 31, 2016, our asset base also included one land parcel in North America which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests. Refer to further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 620 leases with a total of 463 tenants, and 88, or 44%, of our 199 properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of five to 10 years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2016:
•
Investment-grade tenants represented 49% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2016;
•
Approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;
•
Approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and
•
Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.
Top 20 Tenants: 73% of Top 20 Annual Rental Revenue from Investment-Grade Tenants
Our properties are leased to a high-quality and diverse group of tenants, with no individual tenant accounting for more than 4.1% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2016. The following table sets forth information regarding leases with our 20 largest tenants in North America based upon annual rental revenue as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

Leasing Activity
•
Executed a total of 179 leases, with a weighted-average lease term of 15.6 years, for 3,390,067 RSF, including 997,537 RSF related to our development and redevelopment projects during the year ended December 31, 2016; solid leasing activity in light of minimal contractual lease expirations at the beginning of 2016, and a highly leased value-creation pipeline; and
•
Achieved rental rate increases of 27.6% and 12.0% (cash basis) for lease renewals and re-leasing of space aggregating 2,129,608 RSF (included in the 3,390,067 RSF above) during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Approximately 69% of the 179 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, did not include concessions for free rent. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we granted tenant concessions/free rent averaging 1.8 months with respect to the 3,390,067 RSF leased.

Lease structure
Our Same Properties net operating income and Same Properties net operating income (cash basis) increases for the year ended December 31, 2016, of 4.7% and 6.0%, respectively, benefited significantly from strong market fundamentals. The limited supply of Class A space in AAA locations and strong demand from innovative tenants drove rental rate increases of 27.6% and 12.0% (cash basis) on 2.1 million renewed/re-leased RSF, while a favorable triple net lease structure with contractual annual rent escalations resulted in both a consistent Same Properties operating margin of 70% and occupancy of 97.1% across our 159 Same Properties aggregating 13,521,141 RSF. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained contractual annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Development, redevelopment, and future value-creation of new Class A properties
A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to development and redevelopment of new Class A properties located in world-class collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable space to meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. A significant number of our active development and redevelopment projects are highly leased and expected to be substantially delivered in the near future. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, and higher rental income and returns. Delivery of new Class A properties in our urban innovation cluster locations from our value-creation pipeline is expected to significantly increase net operating income:
(1)
Represents incremental annual net operating income upon stabilization of our development and redevelopment of new Class A properties, including only our share of real estate joint venture projects. RSF and percentage leased represent 100% of each property.
Development projects consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory and tech office space. We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A office/laboratory and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A facilities.
Predevelopment activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of predevelopment efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
As of December 31, 2016, we had seven ground-up development and one redevelopment of new Class A properties under construction in North America. The projects at completion will aggregate 2.0 million RSF, of which 102,938 RSF have been completed and were in service as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had future value-creation projects supporting an aggregate of 5.3 million SF of ground-up development in North America.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we commenced the following projects:
•
150,000 RSF development at 505 Brannan Street in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket, which is 100% leased to Pinterest, Inc., with an initial occupancy date in the fourth quarter of 2017;
•
Development of an additional building at 3215 Merryfield Row aggregating 170,523 RSF at our ARE Spectrum project in our Torrey Pines submarket; 100% leased to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with an initial occupancy date in the fourth quarter of 2017; and
•
Development of a parking structure located at 5200 Illumina Way in our University Town Center submarket; 100% leased to Illumina, Inc., with an initial occupancy date in the third quarter of 2017.
Our initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of net operating income upon stabilization and our investment in the property and excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time, and our average cash yields are generally expected to be greater than our initial stabilized yields (cash basis). Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs. Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term (s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis. Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property. Average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis, and our total cash investment in the property.
