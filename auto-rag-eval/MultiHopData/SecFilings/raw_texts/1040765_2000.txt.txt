OPERATIONS OF VORNADO OPERATING COMPANY
In October 1998, Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating") was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct.
The Company and Vornado Operating are parties to certain agreements described below.
Revolving Credit Agreement
Vornado Operating was granted a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility from the Company (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which expires on December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the Revolving Credit Agreement during its term. The Revolving Credit Agreement prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2000, $19,782,000 was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
Agreement with Vornado Operating
The Company and Vornado Operating are parties to an Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, (a) the Company will under certain circumstances offer Vornado Operating an opportunity to become the lessee of certain real property owned now or in the future by the Company (under mutually satisfactory lease terms) and (b) Vornado Operating will not make any real estate investment or other REIT-Qualified Investment unless it first offers the Company the opportunity to make such investment and the Company has rejected that opportunity.
Under the Agreement, the Company provides Vornado Operating with certain administrative, corporate, accounting, financial, insurance, legal, tax, data processing, human resources and operational services. For these services, Vornado Operating compensates the Company in an amount determined in good faith by the Company as the amount an unaffiliated third party would charge Vornado Operating for comparable services and reimburses the Company for certain costs incurred and paid to third parties on behalf of Vornado Operating. Pursuant to the Agreement, compensation for such services was approximately $330,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.
Vornado Operating and the Company each have the right to terminate the Agreement if the other party is in material default of the Agreement or upon 90 days written notice to the other party at any time after December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company has the right to terminate the Agreement upon a change in control of Vornado Operating.

("AmeriCold Logistics"). AmeriCold Logistics leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in this business from the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") which continue to own the real estate. The leases, as amended, generally have a 15 year term with two-five year renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage rent based on revenue AmeriCold Logistics receives from its customers. AmeriCold is also required to pay for all costs arising from the operation, maintenance and repair of the properties as well as property capital expenditures in excess of $5,000,000 annually. AmeriCold Logistics has the right to defer a portion of the rent for up to three years beginning on March 11, 1999 to the extent that available cash, as defined in the leases, is insufficient to pay such rent.
Total contractual rent was $160,494,000 and $130,213,000 ($164,464,000 and $133,100,000 including the effect of the straight-lining of rents) for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the period from March 11, 1999 to December 31, 1999. As at December 31, 2000, the balance of the tenant's deferred rent was $22,444,000(1) ($17,044,000(1) in 2000 and $5,400,000 in the fourth quarter of 1999) of which the Company's share was $13,466,000. Based on the Company's policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $9,780,000 of income in the year ended December 31, 2000.
On February 22, 2001, the Landlord restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to, among other things, (i) reduce 2001's contractual rent to $146,000,000 (the same amount recognized as rental income in 2000's Funds from Operations), (ii) reduce 2002's contractual rent to $150,000,000 (plus contingent rent in certain circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlord's share of annual maintenance capital expenditures by $4,500,000 to $9,500,000 effective January 1, 2000 and (iv) extend the deferred rent period to December 31, 2003 from March 11, 2002.

At December 31, 2000, the ratio of debt-to-enterprise value (market equity value plus debt less cash) was 43% based on debt of $3.8 billion which included the Company's proportionate share of debt of partially-owned entities. In the future, in connection with its strategy for growth, this percentage may change. The Company's policy concerning the incurrence of debt may be reviewed and modified from time to time by the Company without the vote of shareholders.
The Company may seek to obtain funds through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect thereto. The Company may offer its shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re-acquire its shares or any other securities in the future.

COMPETITION
The Company's four business segments, Office, Retail, Merchandise Mart Properties and Temperature Controlled Logistics, operate in highly competitive environments. The Company's success depends upon, among other factors, the trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, income tax laws, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of property and the quality and breadth of services provided. The Company has a large concentration of properties in the New York City metropolitan area, a highly competitive market. The economic condition of this market may be significantly influenced by supply and demand for space and the financial performance and productivity of the publishing, retail, pharmaceutical, insurance and finance industries.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
The Company's properties are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates governing, among other things, soil and groundwater contamination, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and employee health and safety. Under various Federal and state laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws can impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other Federal, state and local laws and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials that are damaged, decayed or distributed by demolition, or renovation or remodeling. The laws also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Air emissions and waste-water discharges and the operation and subsequent removal of underground storage tanks are also regulated by Federal and state laws. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of its properties, the Company could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to such regulated substances and tanks and related claims for personal injury, property damage or fines.
Each of the Company's properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental condition. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company.
INSURANCE
The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. Management of the Company believes that the Company's insurance coverage conforms to industry norms.
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES
Acquisitions and investments are not necessarily required to be based on specific allocation by type of property. The Company has historically held its properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant, from time to time. Further, the Company has not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which would be invested in a specific property. While the Company may seek the vote of its shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally the Company's activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by its Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders.
EMPLOYEES
The Company has approximately 1,300 employees consisting of 90 in the Office Properties segment, 37 in the Retail Properties segment, 520 in the Merchandise Mart Properties segment, 505 at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 148 corporate staff. This does not include employees of partially-owned entities.

The Company's shopping center lease terms range from 5 years or less in some instances, for smaller tenant spaces to as long as 25 years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenants' sales and pass through to tenants of the tenants' share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant's direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 2% of total shopping center revenues in 2000. None of the tenants in the Retail Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenues.

Bradlees filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on December 26, 2000 and closed all of its stores in February 2001. The Company leases 16 locations to Bradlees. Of these 16 locations, the leases for 14 are fully guaranteed, and the fifteenth lease is guaranteed as to 70% of the rent, by Stop & Shop Companies, Inc., under a Master Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 1, 1992. Stop & Shop is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koninklijke Ahold NV (formerly Royal Ahold NV), a leading international food retailer. The effectiveness of Stop & Shop's guarantee to Vornado of Bradlees' lease obligations is not affected by Bradlees' bankruptcy. None of these leases have been either rejected or assumed.
The 16th location, the 14th Street and Union Square property, is not guaranteed. In 1999, the Company paid Bradlees $11,000,000 to modify the terms of this lease to increase the rent by approximately $1,100,000 per annum to $4,600,000 effective March 2000, and to change the lease expiration date from October 2019 to March 15, 2002.

59th Street and Lexington Avenue:
Alexander's has completed the excavation and laying the foundation for its Lexington Avenue property as part of the proposed development of a large multi-use building. The proposed building is expected to be comprised of a commercial portion, which may include retail stores, offices, hotel space, extended-stay residences, residential rentals and parking; and a residential portion, consisting of condominium units. The capital required for the proposed building will be in excess of $650,000,000.
If the residential portion of the property is developed, the air rights representing the residential portion would be transferred to a taxable REIT subsidiary, as a REIT is not permitted to sell condominiums without being subject to a 100% excise tax on the gain from the sale of such condominiums.
While Alexander's anticipates that financing will be available after tenants have been obtained for these projects, there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained, or if obtained, that such financings will be on terms that are acceptable.
