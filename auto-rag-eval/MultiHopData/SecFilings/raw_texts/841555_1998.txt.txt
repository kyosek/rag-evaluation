Reserves and Mineral Deposits
The following table shows gold reserves net to the Company at December 31, 1998:
Mineable Proven and Probable Reserves (1)
Ore Gold Grade Contained Gold (Millions of tons) (oz/ton) (000 ozs)
Crown Jewel Project (2)(3) 3.748 0.188 705
(1) The information was provided by Battle Mountain, the Company's joint venture partner. The Company's proven and probable reserves are reported as mineable (extractable) ore reserves. Reserves do not reflect recovery losses in the milling process, but do include allowance for dilution of ore in the mining process. Reserves have been calculated based on a gold price of $325 per ounce. Metallurgical recovery of 88% was estimated.
(2) While Crown has 100% ownership of the Crown Jewel project, 54% is subject to Battle Mountain's right to acquire an interest in the property under the terms of the Crown Jewel Venture Agreement ("Venture Agreement") and, therefore, these ounces have not been included above.
(3) In addition to the Company's 46% interest in the Crown Jewel Proven and Probable Reserves shown above are mineral resource deposits of 257,000 tons at a grade of 0.191 ounces of gold per ton. These tons are included to be mined and processed in the current mine plan developed by BMG.
In addition to the above, Crown has identified mineral deposits on the Cord Ranch, Kings Canyon, Manhattan and Bongara properties.
The following discussion summarizes the primary mining properties in which the Company has interests. Company management believes the properties described below are favorable for mineral development, although there is no assurance that any of the properties in which the Company has or may acquire an interest will be economically viable.

The following map shows the location of the primary properties in which Crown has interests in the western United States and northern Mexico.
Crown Jewel Project
General. The Crown Jewel project is a joint venture between the Company and Battle Mountain, located on an approximate 8,000- acre property 24 miles east of Oroville, Washington. The joint venture agreement provides for Battle Mountain to fully fund exploration and development costs through the commencement of commercial production to acquire its interest. No monies are repayable by Crown to Battle Mountain for the costs Battle Mountain incurs prior to commercial production. Battle Mountain is required to construct a facility to treat a minimum of 3,000 tons of ore per day.
The Company discovered the Crown Jewel gold deposit in 1988, and has expended approximately $3.5 million in land, acquisition and exploration costs through December 31, 1998. In March 1990, the Company signed an option letter agreement with Battle Mountain to form a joint venture. Upon grant of the option the Company received $5.0 million from Battle Mountain and an additional $5.0 million in January 1991 when the option was exercised. Shortly thereafter, the Company and Battle Mountain entered into a definitive joint venture agreement, which replaced the option letter agreement, giving Battle Mountain the right to earn 51% in the Crown Jewel deposit.
In May 1994, Crown and Battle Mountain reached an agreement resolving certain contractual issues related to the Crown Jewel Venture Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Battle Mountain paid to Crown $4,250,000 in cash plus 435,897 shares of Battle Mountain common stock (valued at $4,250,000) in exchange for (1) the right to earn an additional 3% (to 54%) in the first 1.6 million ounces of gold recovered from the Crown Jewel property and (2) release of Battle Mountain from its obligation to make any of the quarterly $1.0 million payments to Crown which might otherwise have become due because of startup delays on the project. Production after 1.6 million ounces of gold are recovered will be shared 51% by Battle Mountain and 49% by Crown. The Company does not anticipate receiving additional mineral property proceeds from Battle Mountain under the joint venture agreement.
Geology and Land. The Crown Jewel deposit occurs within a large skarn system formed at the southern contact of the Buckhorn Mountain Cretaceous-aged diorite-granodiorite pluton with Triassic- aged limestones and andesites. Both the skarn system and ore body are relatively tabular and flat-lying in geometry. The skarn system is compositionally zoned in relation to the intrusive pluton with gold mineralization both concordant and crosscutting to the various skarn assemblages.
The property is held by a combination of fee ownership, private mining leases with options to purchase, state mining leases, with the balance being unpatented mining claims. Royalties vary from 4%-5% net smelter return ("NSR") royalties on certain private parcels, however, the ore body as currently defined is not subject to royalties payable to any third party.
Reserves. The following table summarizes the Crown Jewel reserves as of December 31, 1998, as provided by Battle Mountain:
Proven and Probable Reserves (100% basis) Contained Ounces, Grade Contained Crown's Tons (oz/ton) Ounces 46% Share
Crown Jewel 8,147,000 0.188 1,532,000 705,000
All reserves are considered to be open-pit mineable. The proven/probable reserve was based on results from 765 drill holes totaling 307,038 feet. The trial pit design utilized a 0.046 ounce per ton ("opt") gold cutoff grade, a waste to ore ratio of 11:1 and a metallurgical recovery factor of 88% for gold. The assumed economic parameters applied to the design included mining costs of $0.86 per ton of waste and ore. Processing costs were estimated at $10.28 per ton based on a 3,000 ton per day facility. A $325 gold price was used.
Based on the same cutoff grade and gold price, Battle Mountain has estimated that other mineral deposits of 558,000 tons at 0.191 opt gold (100% basis) also occur within the currently designed pit limits at Crown Jewel.
Exploration. The Company began an exploration program at Crown Jewel in mid-1988 and by the end of 1989 had drilled approximately 200 holes on the property. Between March 1990 and December 1992, Battle Mountain drilled over 550 holes designed to both confirm and expand the known reserve. To date, only 500 acres of the approximate 2,000 acres of prospective skarn geology have been drill-tested.
Feasibility Study. In March 1992, the results of an independent feasibility study commissioned by Battle Mountain were received by the Company. Based on these results, Battle Mountain announced its decision to proceed with development of the Crown Jewel gold deposit. The feasibility study confirmed Battle Mountain's previous reserve estimate.
Further engineering and reserve studies by Battle Mountain since the feasibility study was completed have generally confirmed the overall operating cost estimates and mineable reserves of the original 1992 feasibility study. The estimated direct cash production costs are approximately $165 per ounce of gold produced. Capital costs are now estimated at approximately $80 million to achieve commercial production. Battle Mountain will be responsible for funding capital costs. The current studies indicate an approximate eight-year mine life with production averaging 175,000 ounces (100% basis) of gold per year.
Permitting and Development. Battle Mountain submitted its original Plan of Operations to the WDOE and the USFS in January 1992. Several supplemental plans that further clarified or refined the proposed operational plans have been subsequently filed. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement was released in June 1995.
In February 1997, the FEIS was filed by the USFS and the WDOE. The FEIS describes the environmental effects of the plan to construct and operate the Crown Jewel mine, and alternatives to that plan. Also, in February 1997, a favorable ROD for the FEIS was filed by the USFS and the BLM. The ROD documents the decision by the USFS and BLM to select the mining alternative as presented in the FEIS. The alternative chosen by the USFS and the BLM was the Proponent's (Battle Mountain) alternative as described in the FEIS and as modified by the ROD.
Several appeals by certain persons and special interest groups contesting the FEIS were filed with the USFS in 1997. In May of 1997, the USFS Deputy Regional Forester upheld the ROD to approve the Crown Jewel mine project, denying four appeals which had been filed in March 1997. In May 1997, an action was filed in U.S. District Court against the USFS appealing certain issues. In January 1999, the Court ruled in favor of the USFS and denied all claims of the plaintiffs.
Most substantive permit applications necessary to begin construction have been filed with the various local, state and federal agencies and are undergoing review. As of February 1999, the Crown Jewel project has received positive permit decisions on 51 of 70, or 73%, of all the permits necessary for the project. In September 1997, an action was filed before the State of Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board ("PCHB"), a state administrative tribunal, challenging the FEIS and certain permit decisions. In March 1998, the PCHB excluded potential appeals on certain permits regarding water quality and wetlands permit applications.
In November of 1997, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued an opinion, which stated among other things, that the BLM should not approve plans of operations which rely on a greater number of mill site claims than the number of mining claims. In connection with the review of the Company's plan of operations for the Crown Jewel project, the BLM provided BMG with a procedure to be followed to allow for the use of a greater number of millsite claims than the number of mining claims. The BLM has advised BMG that it plans to obtain an opinion from legal counsel regarding the validity of the Crown Jewel millsite claims before making a decision on the plan of operations.
Construction of the Crown Jewel project is anticipated to begin upon successful completion of the remaining permit applications and resolution of the legal and administrative challenges. Construction of the Crown Jewel project could begin in the spring of 2000 and is forecast to take approximately 15 months. Potential delays due to the appeals process, permit process or litigation are difficult to quantify. See Legal Proceedings.
Financing. In order to acquire its 54% interest in the project, Battle Mountain is currently funding all general property, exploration and development costs through the start of commercial production, including the construction of a mill facility capable of processing a minimum of 3,000 tons of ore per day. No monies are repayable by Crown to Battle Mountain for the costs incurred through the pre-commercial production stage. Crown will be required to fund its 46% share of production costs upon the start of commercial production. In the event that Battle Mountain is unable to proceed with the project and must relinquish its right to acquire a 54% interest, the Company would then make a decision to either proceed with the project alone or seek a similar joint venture situation with another major mining company. There is no assurance that the Company could successfully pursue either strategy.
Cord Ranch Project
General. In 1989, the Company entered into an exploration and mining agreement with the surface and mineral rights owners of the 34,000-acre Cord Ranch located in Elko County, Nevada. The lease agreement was originally for a term of five years from August 31, 1989 and renewable thereafter.
Following several amendments, the lease no longer requires a work commitment beyond 1997. However, the agreement calls for non- recoupable minimum annual payments of $150,000 in each of 1998 and 1999 and recoupable annual advance royalty payments of $200,000 in 2000 and thereafter. Pursuant to the amended agreement, the Company may terminate the lease agreement at any time and avoid any future obligation or commitment, except reclamation.
Two property acquisitions immediately adjacent to the Cord Ranch were made in 1990. The Dixie Creek project, consisting of 1,240 acres, was acquired under agreements entered into in October 1990. At approximately the same time, the Pinon Range property, consisting of 640 acres of unpatented claims, was acquired.
In September 1994, Crown signed an agreement which has been assigned to a subsidiary of Royal Standard Minerals Inc. ("Royal Standard"). As of December 31, 1998, Royal Standard has earned a 70% interest in Crown's Cord Ranch and adjacent gold properties. In addition, Royal Standard must provide Crown's share of expenditures through the completion of a favorable feasibility study, with such expenditures to be repaid from Crown's share of production from the properties.
In April 1997, Royal Standard assigned Cameco (U.S.)Inc. ("Cameco") the right to earn a 51% interest in the Cord Ranch lease and claims reducing Royal Standard's interest to 19% upon earn-in. Cameco subsequently acquired two additional leases on adjacent properties, parts of which became subject to the September 1994 agreement providing Crown a 30% interest in these additional properties. Cameco is currently conducting exploration at the Cord Ranch project as part of its earn-in agreement with Royal Standard.
Geology. The Cord Ranch properties lie on the east side of the Pinon Range and are situated on the Carlin gold trend, where nearly four million ounces of gold are produced annually. Paleozoic strata underlying the western parts of the property are the same formations hosting major deposits in the southern section of the trend. The area has sustained multiple periods of deformation and structural preparation of the rocks is very good. Gold mineralization is generally associated with jasperoid rocks.
Mineral Deposits. To date, 418 drill holes have been completed on the Cord Ranch project. In early 1994, the Company estimated the size of two gold deposits, the Pinon Range and Dark Star deposits. Based on the results of 150 drill holes, the Pinon Range mineral deposit is estimated at 7.2 million tons containing 0.025 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt of gold. At Dark Star, 61 drill holes completed by the Company during 1991-92 define a mineral deposit totaling 7.5 million tons grading 0.020 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt of gold. Combined, the Company and Royal Standard hold 50% of the mineral rights and 100% of the surface rights at Dark Star.
Other Property Interests
Lamefoot Mine Royalty. In 1992, Crown acquired from various underlying lease holders a 0.75% NSR royalty interest in the Lamefoot deposit for an aggregate total of $306,000. This property lies approximately three miles from the Kettle River Project ("KRP") mill, operated by Echo Bay Mines Ltd. ("Echo Bay") in northeastern Washington state. According to Echo Bay, Lamefoot ores represent the primary ore feed source to the KRP mill through the next two years. Crown received approximately $139,000 in royalties from Lamefoot during 1998. Crown expects to receive approximately $100,000 in royalties from Lamefoot during 1999.
Kings Canyon. The Kings Canyon property in Utah consists of 3,391 acres of state leases and unpatented claims. Crown holds a 100% interest in the property, subject to a 1-4% NSR royalty to third parties.
The Company estimates the Kings Canyon property hosts a mineral deposit that contains 6.8 million tons of material grading 0.030 opt of gold at a cutoff grade of 0.013 opt gold. The gold occurs as sediment-hosted disseminated mineralization in Paleozoic carbonate rocks.
Manhattan. A 100% interest in the 540-acre Manhattan property in central Nevada was acquired in 1989. In November 1994, the Company signed a purchase option agreement with New Concept Mining, Inc. ("New Concept"), that allows New Concept to purchase 100% of the property by making a series of payments over a four and one- half year period totaling $500,000. As of December 31 1998, $340,000 remains to be paid.
Kendall Mine Royalty. In September 1991, Crown acquired Judith Gold Corporation, whose primary asset is the Kendall property located near Lewiston, Montana. Canyon Resources Corporation leases the Kendall property which entitles the Company to receive a 5% NSR royalty on production at the Kendall gold mine. Mining of ore at the Kendall mine has ceased and the mine site is presently in reclamation.
Snowstorm. The 5,400-acre Snowstorm property, located in northern Nevada, had been subject to a joint venture between the Company and Romarco Minerals, Inc. During 1998, Romarco Minerals,
Inc. relinquished its interest in the joint venture. Crown terminated its leases on the mining claims and no longer maintains an interest in the property.
MEXICO
Since 1997, the Company has conducted exploration and reconnaissance activities in Mexico, focusing its efforts in the state of Durango. In early 1999, the Company acquired the Magistral del Oro ("Magistral") and San Juan de Minas ("San Juan") properties covering approximately 13,000 acres and 700 acres respectively. During 1998 the Company dropped the La Pitarrilla concession. The Company is planning additional exploration and reconnaissance work in Mexico during 1999.
Magistral
The Magistral property covers most of a historic gold district which produced in excess of 600,000 ounces of gold through the 1960's. The primary target at Magistral is a series of gold bearing sub-horizontal veins that is over 3,000 feet long and up to 300 feet wide. Surface rock samples containing 0.01 to 0.20 ounces of gold per ton are common within this zone. Drilling is planned on the project in 1999.
Crown is earning a 100% interest in the project by spending $2,500,000 on the property over a three-year period, with a first year work commitment of $200,000. In addition to the work commitment, Crown will make initial cash payments totaling $50,000 during 1999 and will be required to make advance royalty payments of $250,000 after earn-in as well as $500,000 per year on subsequent anniversary dates. The property is subject to a sliding-scale royalty ranging from 3% when gold prices average less than $325 per ounce of gold to 5% when gold prices are greater than $375 per ounce of gold.
San Juan
The 700-acre San Juan property holds identified targets with potential to host high-grade silver, lead, zinc and gold vein mineralization as well as disseminated gold-silver mineralization in footwall and hanging wall zones of main fissure veins. Mineralization in veins and alteration are predominantly hosted in diorite and granite intrusions. Minor historic production, to depths of 130 feet, took place along the 6,500 foot long west- northwest trending vein zone. Individual veins range up to 15 feet thick with adjacent disseminated mineralization ranging up to 300 feet in width.
Crown will earn a 100% interest in the San Juan property by making cash payments to concession holders totaling $204,000 over four years, and an additional balloon payment of $700,000 at the end of four years. The Company is also required to pay all taxes and meet required work commitments as prescribed by Mexican law. The San Juan property was located by a third party consultant who will earn a commission totaling $50,000 during the first three years and subsequently will retain a NSR of 2%, subject to minimum annual payments of $40,000.

PERU
Bongara Zinc Project, Amazonas Department, Peru
General. Since 1993, the Company has leased exploration concessions or has filed claims for concessions currently covering approximately 102,000 acres in the Bongara area of northern Peru (the "Bongara project).
In December 1996, Solitario signed an agreement regarding the Bongara project with a subsidiary of Cominco. The agreement was modified in January 1999, increasing the joint venture's acreage to approximately 600,000 acres. Cominco has the right to earn a 65% interest in the Bongara project by spending a minimum of $27,500,000 on exploration and development and by making cash payments of between $100,000 and $500,000 per year (depending on the price of zinc) to Solitario over a seven-year period beginning in January 1997, as well as, fully funding the project through a positive feasibility study. Cash payments of $118,000, $354,000 and $250,000 have been paid by Cominco in January 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. In addition to the cash payments and work commitments, Cominco has agreed to finance Solitario's share of project development costs, subject to repayment, after a production decision is made, should Solitario not secure third-party financing. Through December 31, 1998, Cominco has spent approximately $10 million on exploration at the Bongara project.
Location. The Bongara project is situated approximately 225 miles by paved and gravel roads from the port city of Chiclayo to the southwest, in northern Peru. Most of the property lies within ten miles of a paved road with access to the coast. Travel within he project area is accomplished by foot or horseback or helicopter. The property falls on the east slope of the Andes at an average elevation of 5,000 feet.
Geology and Exploration. The property is underlain by northwest-trending Jurassic-Cretaceous-age carbonates, fine to coarse clastic sediments, and shales. Mapping conducted by Cominco indicates that zinc mineralization occurs within carbonate rock units in which limestone has been substantially altered to dolomite.
Mineralization at Florida Canyon occurs primarily in the middle member of the Chambara Formation of the Pucara Group of Jurassic geologic age. The middle member of the Chambara is approximately 700 feet thick and contains several very favorable rock horizons that are preferentially mineralized. Vertical structures, which host zinc mineralization have acted as feeder structures to the stacked stratigraphic mineralized horizons.
During 1998 and 1997, 52 core holes were drilled by Cominco at the Bongara project totaling 40,700 feet. Significant zinc mineralization was intersected in 27 of the 40 holes completed at the Florida Canyon prospect. At Florida Canyon, the widest intersection of mineralization encountered to date averaged 12% zinc over 193 feet and the highest grade intersection averaged 27% zinc over 17 feet. Twelve other drill holes were located in other areas of the project.
Regional exploration has consisted of satellite imagery interpretation, stream sediment geochemistry, geologic mapping and stratigraphic analysis, detailed rock and soil geochemistry, and hand digging shallow prospect pits. Eighteen surface anomalies were evaluated in detail during 1998. Surface rock alteration and geochemistry of the Florida Canyon and nearby Tesoro Canyon prospect areas are very similar. These two prospects may merge into a larger mineralized system measuring approximately three miles long and two miles wide.
Yanacocha Gold Property, Cajamarca Department, Peru
General. The Yanacocha property, located in northern Peru, is comprised of one contiguous block of approximately 155,000 acres located in the center of the Yanacocha district.
In October 1998, the Company signed an agreement with Placer Dome, Ltd. ("Placer") giving Placer the right to earn a 60% interest in the property by spending $4.05 million on exploration and making $200,000 in property payments to the Company over four years. The property had been explored previously under joint venture with Rio Tinto, Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corporation.
Location. The Yanacocha gold district lies in northern Peru's Cajamarca Department, 15 miles north of the historic provincial capital city of Cajamarca (population: 100,000). The Yanacocha district is a one hour drive north of Cajamarca on paved and improved gravel roads. Elevations range from 9,000 feet at Cajamarca to 13,800 feet at the highest points in and around Yanacocha.
Geology and Exploration. The property is located contiguous to the north and west of South America's largest gold mine, Newmont Mining Company's ("Newmont") 51%-owned and operated Minera Yanacocha heap leach gold mine (1998 production of 1.5 million ounces of gold). Total proven and probable reserves at the Yanacocha mine have been reported by Newmont to be more than 20 million ounces of gold at the end of 1998. The Corona gold-copper porphyry deposit (four million ounces of gold and one billion pounds of copper) lies one mile north of the Company's property position.
Geologically, the Yanacocha district is situated in Tertiary- age volcanic terrain which extends from Cajamarca to the Ecuadorian border, 225 miles to the north-northwest. The volcanic rocks are underlain by Cretaceous basement consisting of carbonate and quartzite sedimentary rocks intruded by Cretaceous or Tertiary-age porphyritic intrusives. The gold mineralization present at Newmont's Minera Yanacocha mine occurs within zones of silicified volcanic rocks and porphyritic intrusions. The gold and copper mineralization at the Corona deposit occurs in a typical Andean- style gold-copper porphyry setting within an altered intrusive body.
Work conducted by Solitario and its partners has consisted of geological mapping, rock and stream sediment geochemical sampling, helicopter-borne geophysical surveying, ground induced-polarization surveying and core drilling.
Sixteen drill holes totaling approximately 7,000 feet have been completed by Solitario through its joint venture partners during the past three years. Three areas have been drill tested thus far. These are the Los Negritos, Shuito and Chalhuaquero gold prospects, all situated in the southeastern portion of the claim block. Drilling has thus far intersected anomalous gold values and strong alteration but with sub-economic grades.
Soloco Zinc Property, Amazonas Region, Peru
General. In September 1997, the Company entered into a lease and option to purchase agreement on the Soloco Property covering approximately 9,700 acres. The Soloco Property is located in the department of Amazonas. In October of 1998, the Company signed a joint venture with Billiton Exploration and Mining Peru B.V. ("Billiton"). The agreement calls for Billiton to spend $3.0 million on exploration over a four-year period to earn a 60% interest in the property. As part of the earn-in, Billiton is also required to complete a minimum of 3,280 feet of drilling. Billiton can earn an additional 10% of the project by completing a bankable feasibility study within two years after completion of its work commitment.
Geology and Exploration. During 1998, Solitario conducted surface exploration on the property and defined two prospects displaying zinc values in excess of 20%. The geology consists of zinc mineralization hosted in favorable carbonate rock horizons in a Mississippi Valley-type geologic environment.
Shimbe Gold Property, Piura region, Peru
General. The 44,000 acre Shimbe gold property is located in the department of Piura in northern Peru ten miles from the Equadorian border. The property was staked in 1993 and 1997 by a third party on behalf of Solitario. The claims are currently being transferred to Solitario under the terms of a contract which requires no payments to the title holder. Under Peruvian law only citizens of Peru can stake claims within 30 miles of the border with neighboring countries. Transfer of title to Solitario is subject to approval by Presidential decree. This process is anticipated to take approximately one year. Solitario has the right to explore and exploit the minerals in any case through contract with the title holder.
Geology and Exploration. The Shimbe property consists of tertiary volcanic rocks with locally have irregular bodies and veins of quartz. Work to date has included stream sediment, soil and rock sampling and geochemistry. Rock samples have returned assays of up to 0.3 ounces per ton of gold.
Santa Barbara Gold Property, Cerro de Pasco Region, Peru
General. In April 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with RTZ Mining and Exploration ("RTZ") granting Solitario the right to earn a 60% interest in the Santa Barbara project. The property contains approximately 12,300 acres located 120 miles northeast of Lima, Peru in the Cerro de Pasco Region. Solitario can earn its interest in the property by spending $1.5 million over a three-year period. No cash payments are required to be made to RTZ. During 1998, Solitario and RTZ agreed to suspend annual work requirements due to low metal prices.
Geology and Exploration. Solitario completed 16 drill holes during 1997 totaling 9,200 feet. The two best holes intersected 512 feet grading 0.29% copper and 0.01 opt gold and 659 feet grading 0.38% copper and 0.01 opt gold.
ARGENTINA
In December 1997, Solitario made the decision to withdraw from exploration in Argentina to concentrate its attention and financial resources in Peru. In July 1998, Solitario completed the sale of its Argentinian subsidiary to TNR Resources, Ltd. ("TNR") of Vancouver, B.C. The purchase price of Cdn$500,000 was paid in 1,250,000 common shares of TNR and two-year warrants to purchase an additional 650,000 shares of TNR at Cdn$0.40 for the first year and Cdn$0.46 for the second year. Solitario also received a non- refundable binder payment of Cdn$65,000 upon signing a letter of intent in March of 1998. TNR reimbursed Solitario $29,000 for costs incurred through a cash payment of $8,000 and delivery of an additional 184,709 common shares of TNR. As a result of the transaction, Solitario owns approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of TNR.
Exploration Expenditure Overview
During 1998, the Company conducted exploration activities on several of its properties incurring approximately $1.5 million in expenditures, including $1.0 million in South America. Several of the Company's properties are subject to leases and/or options to purchase. The Company's share of 1999 annual lease and rental obligations and option payments totals $132,000 for properties it currently holds. Certain other mining claims and properties not subject to leases were acquired by the Company either by deed or were located by the Company. With respect to the claims and other properties acquired by deed or located by the Company, the obligation required to hold the claims is to pay ad valorem property taxes in the case of the patented mining claims and fee land, and annual rental fees in the case of the unpatented mining claims and concessions. See Considerations Related to Crown's Business.
1999 WORK COMMITMENTS
The Company's work commitments remaining to be fulfilled in 1999 are $200,000, pertaining to its Mexican properties.
