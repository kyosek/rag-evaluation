MINING PROPERTIES
Coeur Mining’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics are presented in the section entitled “Operating Statistics” below.
Mexico - Palmarejo
The Palmarejo complex consists of (1) the Palmarejo processing facility; (2) the Guadalupe underground mine, located about eight kilometers southeast of the Palmarejo mine; (3) the Independencia underground mine, located approximately 800 meters northeast of the Guadalupe underground mine; and (4) other nearby deposits and exploration targets. The Palmarejo complex is located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Access to the property is provided by air, rail, and all-weather paved and gravel roads from the state capitol of Chihuahua. Gold and silver production from the Palmarejo complex was approximately 122,722 ounces and 7.5 million ounces in 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we reported 693,000 ounces of gold reserves and 50.2 million ounces of silver reserves at the Palmarejo complex.
The Palmarejo complex consists of 71 wholly-owned mining concessions, covering approximately 67,296 acres (27,233 hectares) of land. In total, the Palmarejo complex covers over 105 square miles. All mining concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until at least 2029.
The Palmarejo complex is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest trending Sierra Madre Occidental is composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau, cut by numerous igneous intrusive rocks. This volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo mine area, forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico.
The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo complex, typical of many of the other gold and silver deposits in the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias, and fractures. These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on the structures ranges from
about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures, gold and silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit and higher gold values in the lower parts, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization, though local variations are common. The Palmarejo complex contains a number of mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the north of the mining concessions, which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine formed at the intersection of the northwest-southeast trending La Prieta and La Blanca gold-and-silver bearing structures. In addition to the Palmarejo zone, other mineralized vein and alteration systems in the district area have been identified all roughly sub-parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including Animas), Independencia, and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property, which are currently under development (Guadalupe and Independencia) and exploration (La Patria) by the Company.
A portion of the Palmarejo complex is subject to a gold stream agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation pursuant to which Coeur Mexicana sells 50% of applicable gold production for the lesser of $800 or spot price per ounce.
USA (Nevada) - Rochester
The Rochester mine, and associated heap leach facilities, is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, approximately thirteen miles northeast of the city of Lovelock. The Company owns 100% of the Rochester mine through Coeur Rochester. The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, southwest of the Rochester mine. In November 2018, Coeur Rochester acquired the Lincoln Hill and related assets adjacent to Rochester from Alio Gold. This land package, includes the Lincoln Hill, Gold Ridge and Wilco projects. The Rochester mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid, telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office facilities. Ore is mined using conventional open pit methods, with gold and silver recovered by heap leaching of crushed open-pit ore placed on pads located within the Rochester mining area. Based upon actual operating experience and metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate recovery rates from the crushed ore of 61.5% for silver, depending on the ore being leached, and 92.5% for gold. Gold and silver production from Rochester was approximately 54,388 ounces and 5.0 million ounces ounces in 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we reported 684,000 ounces of gold reserves and 106.2 million ounces of silver reserves at the Rochester mine.
Coeur Rochester lands, including the Lincoln Hill and related assets, consist of approximately 43,541 net acres, which encompasses 1,478 Federal unpatented lode claims, appropriating approximately 30,038 net acres of Public Land, 23 patented lode claims, consisting of approximately 392 acres, interests owned in approximately 6,929 gross acres of additional real property and certain rights in and to approximately 6,182 acres, held either through lease, letter agreement or license.
The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired its initial interest in the adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003. However, mining of the Nevada Packard property has since ceased. The prior owner conducted very limited mining and processing at Nevada Packard. Collectively, the Rochester and Nevada Packard properties, together with other adjacent and contiguous lands subsequently acquired, comprise the Rochester silver and gold processing operation. The Federal unpatented lode claims are maintained via annual filings and timely payment of claim maintenance fees to the BLM, which acts as administrator of the claims.
At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, silver-bearing tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein, vein swarms and stockworks) with variable amounts of pyrite.
The Company is obligated to pay an NSR royalty to ASARCO, the prior owner, when the average quarterly market price of silver equals or exceeds $23.60 per ounce indexed for inflation up to a maximum rate of 5% with the condition that the Rochester mine achieves positive cash flow for the applicable year. If cash flow is negative in any calendar year, the maximum royalty payable is $250,000.
USA (Alaska) - Kensington
The Kensington underground gold mine and associated milling facilities are located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The Company controls 100% of the mine through Coeur Alaska. The mine is accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilizes conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. Ore is processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate that is sold to third party smelters. Waste material is deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied by on-site diesel generators. Access to the mine is by either a combination of road vehicles, boat, helicopter, floatplane, or by boat direct from Juneau. Gold production at Kensington was 113,778 ounces of gold in 2018, which includes 8,208 ounces of gold from the Jualin underground mine before commercial production was declared in December 2018. At December 31, 2018, we reported 552,000 ounces of gold reserves at the Kensington mine.
Coeur Alaska controls two contiguous property groups: the Kensington Group and Jualin Group. The Kensington Group, totaling approximately 3,969 net acres, consists of 51 patented lode and patented mill site claims comprising approximately 766 net acres, 284 Federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 3,108 net acres, and 13 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 95 net acres. The Jualin Group, totaling approximately 8,366 net acres, is comprised of 23 patented lode and patented mill site claims covering approximately 388 net acres, 471 Federal unpatented lode claims and 1 Federal unpatented mill site claim appropriating approximately 7,916 net acres, a State of Alaska upland mining lease comprising approximately 682 acres, one State of Alaska mining claim comprising approximately three acres and four State-selected mining claims covering approximately 70 acres. 14 of the 23 patented lode claims cover private surface estate only. The mineral estate to these 14 patented lode claims is owned by the State of Alaska, the mineral rights to which are secured by a State of Alaska upland mining lease. The Company controls properties comprising the Jualin Group, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, which is valid until August 5, 2035 and thereafter, provided mining and production are actively occurring within and from the leased premises.
The Federal unpatented lode and Federal unpatented mill site claims are maintained via annual filings and timely payment of claim maintenance fees to the BLM, which acts as administrator of the claims. State of Alaska mining claims and upland mining leases are maintained via fees and filings to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mining, Land and Water and the Juneau Recorder’s Office. Real property taxes are paid annually to the City and Borough of Juneau for the patented lode claims. Private lease payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing.
The Kensington ore deposit consists of multiple gold bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate and pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in Cretaceous-aged Jualin diorite. Most of the gold is contained in calaverite (AuTe2) that occurs in association with native gold as inclusions in and interstitial to pyrite grains and in microfractures in pyrite.
USA (South Dakota) - Wharf
The Wharf mine is located in the northern Black Hills of western South Dakota, approximately four miles south and west of the city of Lead, South Dakota. Access is established by paved road with power supplied by a local power company. Coeur acquired the Wharf mine in 2015 and owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Wharf and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden Reward Mining Limited Partnership (“Golden Reward”), the owners of the Wharf mine. Gold production from the Wharf mine was 76,840 ounces in 2018. At December 31, 2018, we reported 882,000 ounces of gold reserves at Wharf.
There are two contiguous property groups located at the Wharf mine; the Wharf Group and the Golden Reward Group, owned or controlled by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Coeur and Wharf Resources. The Wharf Group is generally described as the northern and western portions of the project, while the Golden Reward Group is generally described as the southern and eastern portion of the project.
The Wharf Group comprises 362 patented lode claims, 35 government lots, 123 subdivided lots, and 59 federal unpatented lode claims. The Wharf Group is comprised of approximately 3,591 net acres of surface, 652 net mineral acres where both the Precambrian and younger formations are owned or controlled, 3,243 net mineral acres of non-Precambrian mineral estate, and 1,603 net mineral acres of Precambrian mineral estate and 287 net acres of federal unpatented lode claims. The Golden Reward Group encompasses 218 patented lode claims, 14 government lots, 19 subdivided lots and 34 federal unpatented lode claims. The Golden Reward Group is comprised of approximately 1,564 net acres of surface estate, 2,988 net mineral acres of mineral estate where both the Precambrian and younger formations are owned or controlled, 357 net mineral acres of Non-Precambrian mineral estate, 153 net mineral acres of Precambrian mineral estate and 25 net acres of federal unpatented lode claims.
The federal unpatented lode claims are maintained by the timely annual payment of claim maintenance fees, payable to the BLM. The patented lands are private land and therefore not subject to federal claim maintenance requirements. However, as private land, they are subject to ad valorem property taxes assessed by Lawrence County, South Dakota, which may be paid semi-annually.
The Wharf mine is a structurally controlled disseminated gold deposit, hosted by Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Tertiary alkalic intrusive rocks. Mining has occurred at Wharf for over 30 years as an open pit heap leach operation. Host rocks are sandstones of the upper and lower members of the Cambrian Deadwood Formation and Tertiary alkalic intrusive sills. Alteration styles as well as age dates in the deposit demonstrate both lithological and structural control, which are completely unrelated to the nearby gold deposits at the Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, South Dakota.
Wharf and Golden Reward are obligated to pay a sliding scale production royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. The royalty encumbers the majority of the land comprising the Wharf Group, together with a small portion of the lands encompassing the Golden Reward Group, and wholly excludes the Precambrian Mineral Estate. The sliding scale provides for a 2.0% royalty on the gross value less state severance taxes with a monthly average PM LBMA Gold Price of $500 or more per ounce.
Wharf and Golden Reward are also obligated to pay a 3.0% non-participating royalty to Donald D. Valentine, et al, on gold that is produced from ores mined and delivered to heap leach pads or recovered from tailings. This royalty encumbers the mineral estate, including the Precambrian Mineral Estate, of much of the lands comprising the Wharf Group, together with a small portion
of the lands encompassing the Golden Reward Group. Wharf holds a right of first refusal to purchase this royalty upon any proposed transfer by the royalty holder.
Canada (British Columbia) - Silvertip
The Silvertip mine is located in British Columbia, Canada and consists of sixty-four (64) contiguous mineral claims containing approximately 39,375 hectares (97,298 acres) and two mining leases containing approximately 1,528 hectares (3,777 acres). In total, the Silvertip mine covers an area of approximately 40,904 hectares (101,076 acres). All mineral claims are valid for one year after recording. To maintain a claim, the recorded holder must, on or before the expiry date of the claim, either perform exploration and development work on that claim (or contiguous block of claims) and register such work online, or register a payment instead of exploration and development work. Silver, zinc and lead production from Silvertip was approximately 0.3 million ounces, 6.8 million pounds and 3.9 million in 2018, respectively, which includes 0.2 million ounces of silver, 2.6 million pounds of zinc and 1.8 million pounds of lead related to production before commercial production was declared in September 2018. At December 31, 2018, we reported 14.9 million ounces of silver reserves, 291.2 million pounds of zinc reserves and 197.5 million pounds of lead reserves at the Silvertip mine.
Silvertip maintains two mining leases which are also subject to the Mineral Tenure Act regulations. Coeur Silvertip’s mining leases cover 1,528.79 hectares (3,777.72 acres). Mining leases are held by making an annual rental payment of CAD20 per hectare. The mining leases expire 30 years after the grant date, and all leases held by Coeur Silvertip are valid until 2045 or later.
The Silvertip mine is a carbonate-hosted massive sulfide deposit. Economic mineralization occurs at the top of the McDame limestone, at or near the contact with the upper Earn Group sediments. Mineable massive sulfides form gently plunging tubes or cape-shaped mantos up to about 20 meters thick and 30 meters wide, and in places extend for at least 200 meters. Discordant, high-angle chimney feeders are also present and have been the target of recent underground exploration. Geologic contact between the massive sulfide and the host limestone can be sharp and easy to see in both drill core and underground mining. Mineralization consists of pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and argentiferous galena. Additionally, silver-bearing phases can include pyrargyrite-proustite, boulangerite-jamesonite and tetrahedrite (freibergite). The mineralizing event is assumed to be Late Cretaceous, which is consistent with other ore deposits in a belt that extends through the Yukon to southern Alaska.
Coeur Silvertip is obligated to pay a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty payable to Maverix Metals, Inc. on all mineral products produced from the Silvertip mine. Coeur Silvertip is also obligated to pay to Silvertip Resources Investment Cayman Ltd. a net smelter returns royalty of 1.429% on the first 1,434,000 tons of mineralized material mined, and 1.00% thereafter, on all mineral leases that underlie the Silvertip mine and that were in existence at April 11, 2016. The Company is party to a formal agreement with the Kaska Nation dated December 12, 2013, under which the Company is obligated to make an annual payment to the Kaska Nation that is calculated based on financial performance of the Silvertip mine and can increase or decrease based on the average price of silver for the relevant calendar year.
Bolivia - San Bartolomé
In February 2018, the Company completed the Manquiri Divestiture. The San Bartolomé silver mine, and associated milling operation, operated by Manquiri, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico mountain bordering the town of Potosí, in the department of Potosí, Bolivia. Access to the property and Manquiri’s processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads leading south-southwest from Potosí. Silver was first discovered in the area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. Silver production from the San Bartolomé mine was approximately 0.6 million ounces through February 28, 2018, the completion date of the Manquiri Divestiture.

PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES
(1)
Certain definitions:
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “proven (measured) reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable (indicated) reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Proven and probable reserves include silver attributable to Coeur’s ownership or economic interest in the Endeavor project.
The term “cutoff grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cutoff grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the mineralized material to silver or gold extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
