ONE NORWEST CENTER
Completed in 1983, One Norwest Center is a 50-story, granite and glass office tower containing approximately 1,188,000 square feet of net rentable area and a 12-level, 1,004-vehicle parking facility. One Norwest Center is located in downtown Denver - the major business, financial, government and cultural center for the Rocky Mountain region. In downtown Denver, the compact central core area of offices, financial institutions, retail stores, and hotels is bordered by adjacent districts of public buildings. One Norwest Center is located at 17th Street and Lincoln Street on the east boundary of the financial district. Historically, this financial district has been a major hub for many financial institutions in the Rocky Mountain region.
One Norwest Center is owned by 1700 Lincoln Limited ("Lincoln") in which the Company owns a 90 percent general partnership interest through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ARICO-Denver, Inc., and a 10 percent general partnership interest through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 1700 Lincoln Inc. The Property is managed by Hines.
MARKET INFORMATION
As of December 31, 1996, the Denver MSA contained a total inventory of 64.6 million square feet of office space, of which 64.2% had been built since 1980, with most building occurring in the early 1980's. This increased inventory was largely due to increased interest in oil and gas exploration in the Rocky Mountain Region. The downtown submarket, where One Norwest Center is located, contains approximately 22.6 million square feet of this inventory. As of December 31, 1996, the overall downtown vacancy rate was 13.6%. The downtown submarket includes 11.0 million square feet of Class A office space with a vacancy rate of 8.8% as of December 31, 1996.
Set forth below is pertinent statistical information regarding the downtown Denver submarket:
- -------------------------------- Source: Torto Wheaton Research
The downtown Denver submarket vacancy rate improved from 18.8 percent in 1992 to 13.8 percent in 1994 reflecting strong space absorption in the submarket. The vacancy rate rose to 15.5 percent in 1995, due primarily to the actions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which closed offices in Denver and returned substantial space to the office leasing market. As of December 31, 1996, the vacancy rate had decreased slightly to 13.6 percent.
HISTORICAL OCCUPANCY RATES
As of the dates noted, the following percentage of the net rentable area in One Norwest Center was leased at the average Net Effective Rent per square foot set forth below:

- ---------------------------- (1) Calculated based on a total of 1,187,852 rentable square feet as of December 31, 1996.
NORWEST BANK DENVER NATIONAL ASSOCIATION LEASE. Lincoln entered into a lease agreement dated February 5, 1981, with the United Bank of Denver (the "United Bank of Denver Lease"). The United Bank of Denver Lease commenced on July 5, 1983 and expires July, 2013. During 1992, this lease was assumed by Norwest Bank Denver National Association as part of the acquisition of United Bank of Denver by Norwest Corporation. The net rental rate until July, 1998 is $14.89 per square foot. The net rental rate from July, 1998 through 2003 will be $16.00 per square foot. The net rental rate from July, 2003 through 2008 will be the sum of (i) $16.00 per square foot and (ii) 50 percent of the excess of the market rental rate for a single rate from July, 2008 through July, 2013 will be the greater of (i) the rental rate in the prior five-year period or (ii) the rental rate for such five-year period plus 50 percent of the excess of the market net rental rate for a single floor office tenant located between floors 1 and 20 in the building as of July, 2008 over the rate for the prior five-year period minus $1.00 per square foot. Norwest Bank Denver National Association has three five-year renewal options beginning in July, 2013.
In addition, Norwest Bank Denver National Association pays variable rent to Lincoln as lessor, equal to Norwest Bank Denver National Association's proportionate share of operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of One Norwest Center. Basic and variable rent are payable monthly.
APACHE CORPORATION LEASE: The Apache Corporation Lease commenced on April 1, 1987 and expires May 31, 1997. The net rental rate until May 31, 1997 is $12.00 per square foot. The Apache Corporation had two five year renewal options which it did not exercise.

The following table sets forth lease expirations for One Norwest Center. All rents are calculated on a net basis. For the year ended December 31, 1996, recoverable operating expenses at One Norwest Center were $5.40 per square foot.
- --------------------------------- (a) Total area in square feet covered by such leases. (b) Annualized Base Rent as of December 31, 1996. (c) Percentage of Annualized Base Rent as of December 31, 1996 represented by such leases. (d) The number of tenants whose leases will expire.
Real Estate Taxes
Real property tax expense for 1996 was approximately $1,834,000. The tenant leases for One Norwest Center generally contain provisions passing through to tenants the cost of real estate taxes, and therefore, such taxes should not have a material effect on net operating income from One Norwest Center (assuming that One Norwest Center is fully leased), although an assessment exceeding that of similar properties could affect occupancy or absorption.
NORWEST CENTER
Norwest Center is a 55-story, granite and glass office tower containing approximately 1,118,000 square feet of net rentable area and a 340-vehicle underground parking facility. Norwest Center is located at the center of downtown Minneapolis at the intersection of Seventh Street South and Marquette Avenue. The main business entrance to the building is on Seventh Street South, opposite the IDS Center, a prominent landmark in the Twin Cities. Pedestrian access is also available from Sixth Street South and Marquette Avenue; a grand ceremonial entrance to the building on Sixth Street South incorporates a rotunda and retail banking function.
Market Information
As of December 31, 1996, the Minneapolis MSA contained a total inventory of 50.8 million square feet of office space, of which 56.9% had been built since 1980. The Minneapolis CBD, where Norwest Center is located, contains approximately 20.6 million square fee of this inventory. As of December 31, 1996, the overall Minneapolis CBD vacancy rate was 6.7%. The Minneapolis CBD submarket includes 12.9 million square feet(.30) (.01) (.01) (.14) (.27) (.46) (.15) (1.19) of class-A office space, with a vacancy rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 1996.
Set forth below is pertinent statistical information regarding the Minneapolis CBD submarket:
The above table reflects strong space absorption in the Minneapolis CBD, which, when combined with the absence of new construction, has resulted in a steady reduction in vacancies from 1992 through 1994. The market has effectively absorbed the excess supply which came on the market in the late 1980's and early 1990's. In 1996, continued demand from tenants again resulted in positive absorption and a marginal decrease in the vacancy rate.
THE PARTNERSHIP
Norwest Center is owned by NWC Limited Partnership ("NWC"), a partnership in which the Company owns a 50 percent general partnership interest through its wholly-owned subsidiary ARICO-Minneapolis, Inc. Sixth and Marquette Limited Partnership ("S&M") owns a 49 percent managing general partnership interest and a 1 percent limited partnership interest in NWC. The managing general partner of NWC is currently S&M. The limited partners of S&M are Norwest Center, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and affiliate of Norwest Corporation, and Faegre & Benson, a Minnesota partnership, as nominee for a Minnesota partnership comprised of persons who were partners in Faegre & Benson as of August 5, 1986. The general partner of S&M is itself a Minnesota limited partnership in which Gerald D. Hines, individually, and entities affiliated with Gerald D. Hines are directly or indirectly the sole general partners. The Company has the right, at its sole discretion, to become the managing general partner of NWC. Norwest Center is managed by Hines.
Under the partnership agreement governing NWC, the managing general partner has the right to manage and operate NWC's business. Until certain cash flow levels have been achieved for two consecutive years (the "NWC Preference Period"), S&M and the Company each hold a 50 percent interest in NWC. After the NWC Preference Period ends, the Company will be entitled to hold a 60 percent interest (subject to increases in the Company's interest that may result from early termination of the NWC Preference Period), and S&M a 40 percent interest. The Company does not expect the Preference Period to end in the foreseeable future.
During the NWC Preference Period, the Company is entitled to receive an annual preference return (the "NWC Preference Return") equal to 7 percent of its capital base, which is $92.3 million as of December 31, 1996. The NWC Preference Return is cumulative, and if operating revenues (after payment of operating costs, capital expenditures and debt service) are not sufficient to fund the distribution of any NWC Preference Return then due, the amount of such deficiency shall accumulate and shall bear interest at the rate of 7 percent, compounded annually. Currently, there is no accrued deficiency outstanding on the NWC Preference Return.
Subject to the preferential distributions to the Company described above, all of NWC's operating revenues remaining after making payments required for the operations of NWC and Norwest Center and the payment of debt service will be distributed 50 percent to the Company and 50 percent to S&M during the NWC Preference Period.

REAL ESTATE TAXES
Real property tax expense for 1996 was approximately $10,582,000. The tenant leases for Norwest Center generally contain provisions passing through to tenants increases in the cost of real estate taxes, and therefore, increases in such taxes should not have a material effect on net operating income from Norwest Center (assuming that Norwest Center remains fully leased), although an assessment exceeding that of similar properties could affect occupancy or absorption.
WASHINGTON MUTUAL TOWER
Washington Mutual Tower is a 55-story, granite and glass office tower containing approximately 1,155,000 square feet of net rentable area (including the Galland and Seneca Buildings described below).

As of December 31, 1996, the Seattle MSA contained a total inventory of 51.3 million square feet of office space, of which 64.8 percent had been built since 1980. The Seattle CBD, where Washington Mutual Tower is located, contains approximately 15.9 million square feet of this inventory. As of December 31, 1996, the overall vacancy rate in the Seattle CBD was 6.7 percent. The Seattle CBD submarket includes 13.1 million square feet of Class A office space, with a vacancy rate of 5.3 percent.
Set forth below is pertinent statistical information regarding the Seattle CBD submarket:
The above table reflects strong space absorption in the Central Business District, which, when combined with the absence of new construction, has resulted in a steady reduction in vacancy in 1994 and 1995. The market has effectively absorbed the excess supply which came on the market in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
THE PARTNERSHIP
The Project Site is owned by Third Partnership. The Company owns, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ARICO-Seattle, Inc., a 50 percent general partnership interest in Third Partnership. 1212 Second Avenue Limited Partnership, a Washington limited partnership ("1212 Partnership"), currently holds a 49 percent managing general partnership interest and a 1 percent limited partnership interest in Third Partnership. Third Partnership is the successor in interest as lessee under a 13-year lease, expiring in 2005, of the Galland and Seneca Buildings.
The Company holds the right, at its sole discretion, to elect to become the managing general partner of Third Partnership. 1212 Partnership was originally the only general partner and is now the managing general partner with the obligation to manage and operate Third Partnership's business. Perkins Building Partnership, a Washington general partnership comprised of partners in the Seattle law firm of Perkins Cole, a Washington general partnership, is the sole limited partner of 1212 Partnership. 1201 Third Avenue Limited Partnership, a Washington limited partnership ("1201"), is the sole general partner of 1212 Partnership. Wright Runstad Associates Limited Partnership ("WRALP") is the sole general partner of 1201, and Wright Runstad & Co. is the sole general partner of WRALP. The majority of the limited partners of 1201 and WRALP are current or former employees or other affiliates of Wright Runstad & Co.
Until certain cash flow levels have been achieved for two consecutive years (the "Washington Preference Period"), all of Third Partnership's operating revenues remaining after making payments required for (i) the operations of Third Partnership and Washington Mutual Tower, (ii) net Block 6 costs, (iii) the payment of debt service and (iv) the Washington Preference Return (defined below), will be distributed 50 percent to the Company and 50 percent to 1212 Partnership. The Washington Preference Period is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. During the Washington Preference Period, the Company is also entitled to receive an annual preference return (the "Washington Preference Return") equal to 8 percent of its capital base, which was $100 million as of December 31, 1996. The Washington Preference Return is cumulative, and if operating revenues, adjusted for payment of operating costs, capital expenditures, debt service and for amounts due from 1212 Partnership and subsidiary of the Company under the partnership agreement, are insufficient to fund the distribution of any Washington Preference Return then due, the amount of such deficiency shall accumulate and shall bear interest at the rate of 8 percent, compounded annually. As of December 31, 1996, the Company is due a cumulative preference deficit, including accrued interest, of approximately $7.8 million which will be reduced as cash flow becomes available. On a priority basis to the Washington Preference Return described above, the Company also receives a 9.53 percent return on an additional equity investment of $47 million made in September 1995. The Company is entitled to receive this return through September 30, 2003, at which time the rate of return will adjust based on conditions in the interest rate markets.
