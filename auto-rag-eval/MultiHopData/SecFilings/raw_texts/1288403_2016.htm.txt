Item 2. Properties
Our producing fields are located in federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7,300 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, with high initial production rates. The following map provides the locations of our 10 largest fields as of December 31, 2016, based on quantities of proved reserves on an energy equivalent basis. At December 31, 2016, these fields accounted for approximately 83% of our proved reserves.
The following table provides information for our 10 largest fields determined using quantities of proved net reserves on an energy equivalent basis as of December 31, 2016. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water. Our interests in several of our offshore fields are owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, “drilling” or “drilled” in the field descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth, as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SEC’s definition for completion.
(1)
The conversions to barrels of oil equivalent and cubic feet equivalent were determined using the energy equivalency ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.
Volume measurements:
MBoe - one thousand barrels of oil equivalent
Boe/d - barrel of oil equivalent per day
Our Fields
On December 31, 2016, we had two fields of major individual significance (which we define as having year-end proved reserves of 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on an energy equivalent basis): the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and the Fairway Field, located in the Mobile Bay area of Alabama, which includes the associated Yellowhammer gas processing plant located onshore in Alabama. Following are descriptions of these fields.
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany).
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349 in 375 feet of water. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation (“Apache”) and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2016 is approximately 43.5 MMBoe gross. This field is a sub-salt development with eight productive horizons below salt at depths up to 19,000 feet. In 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan (the “2010 Development Plan”). As a result, in 2011, we drilled and completed one development well and one exploration well. In 2012, two additional wells were sidetracked, one well was drilled and completed, and another well was drilled to target depth. In 2013, the well reaching target depth in 2012 was completed, one well was drilled and completed and we had one well being drilled. In 2014, the well being drilled in 2013 was completed and we drilled and completed another well. A third well was spud at year end 2014, drilling was suspending in January 2015, drilling resumed during 2016 and completion occurred in the first quarter of 2017. All of the wells drilled under the 2010 Development Plan have been successful. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 19.8 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, 22.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2015, and 18.8 MMBoe at December 31, 2014.
The following presents our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes (net to our interests) from the Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three years.

Fairway Field.
The Fairway Field is comprised of Mobile Bay Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) and located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our initial 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship, in the Fairway Field and associated Yellowhammer gas processing plant, from Shell Offshore, Inc. (“Shell”) in August 2011 and acquired the remaining working interest of 35.7% in September 2014. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2016, six wells have been drilled, one of which was a replacement well. Cumulative field production through 2016 is approximately 129.9 MMBoe gross. This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 13.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, 14.0 MMBoe at December 31, 2015, and 14.6 MMBoe at December 31, 2014.

Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice, Louisiana in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation (“Kerr-McGee”) and we are the operator of this field. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2016, 48 wells have been drilled in this field, 30 of which were successful. Cumulative field production through 2016 is approximately 47.3 MMBoe gross. One new well reached target depth in 2011 and began production in 2012. In addition, one workover was performed in 2012. In 2013, we drilled and completed one well, which began production during 2013. During December 2016, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 211 barrels of crude oil per day, 317 barrels of NGLs per day and 17,190 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 3,393 Boe per day.

We own a 100% working interest in the main field pays, having acquired a 40% working interest from Kerr-McGee in 2006 and the remaining 60% from Petrobras America Inc. in 2014. Three recently successful deep wells are subject to a 50% working interest with Walter Oil and Gas Corporation. A single production platform is located on Block 910. Cumulative field production through 2016 is approximately 16.0 MMBoe gross. Production occurs from Pliocene and upper Miocene channel/levee sands set up by a combination of stratigraphic and structural traps. A newly acquired wide angle azimuth seismic data set is expected to help confirm several recently identified drilling opportunities in the field area. Since its discovery, 11 wells have been drilled, of which nine were successful. During December 2016, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 994 barrels of crude oil per day, 209 barrels of NGLs per day and 3,722 Mcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1,824 Boe per day.
Brazos A-133 Field. Brazos A-133 field is located 85 miles east of Corpus Christi, Texas in 200 feet of water. The field was discovered in 1978 by Cities Service Oil Company with production commencing in the same year. There are five active platforms, three of which are production platforms. Cumulative field production through 2016 is approximately 154.1 MMBoe gross from the Middle Miocene Tex W and Big Hum sections. The bulk of the production is from the Big Hum CM-7 sand, which is a 4-way closure downthrown to the Corsair Fault and bisected by antithetic faults. The top of the CM-7 sand is at a subsea depth of 12,000 feet. Since its discovery, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 17 were successful.

Proved Reserves
Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant, and amounts provided in this Form 10-K are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 are summarized below and the mix by product was 44% oil, 11% NGLs and 45% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below.
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet of gas equivalent
(1)
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2016. The WTI posted price and the Henry Hub spot price were utilized as the referenced price and after adjusting for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials, the average realized prices were $36.28 per barrel for oil, $16.82 per barrel for NGLs and $2.47 per Mcf for natural gas. In determining the estimated realized price for NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the crude oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the crude oil price using SEC guidance. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2)
Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3)
We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10, or PV-10 after ARO, from our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown above represent a current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
(1)
No future income taxes were estimated to be paid as our present tax position has sufficient tax basis to offset any future taxes. State income taxes were disregarded due to immateriality.
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 74.0 MMBoe compared to 76.4 MMBoe at December 31, 2015, representing an overall decrease of 2.4 MMBoe. After accounting for 15.4 MMBoe of 2016 production, total revisions were a positive 13.0 MMBoe. Positive technical revisions were 14.2 MMBoe, while negative revisions due to lower commodity prices were estimated to be 1.2 MMBoe.
See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2016. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our estimates of proved reserves, PV-10 and standardized measure as of December 31, 2016 are calculated based upon SEC mandated 2016 unweighted average first-day-of-the-month crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices, which may or may not represent current prices. Using the SEC methodology and prior to certain adjustments for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials, the price of crude oil declined to $39.25 per barrel for 2016 year-end compared to $46.79 per barrel for 2015 year-end. For natural gas, the price declined to $2.48 per MMBtu for 2016 year-end compared to $2.59 per MMBtu for 2015 year-end. If prices fall below the 2016 levels, which, absent significant proved reserve additions, may reduce future estimated proved reserve volumes due to lower economic limits and economic return thresholds for undeveloped reserves, as well as impact our results of operations, cash flows, quarterly full cost impairment ceiling tests and volume-dependent depletion cost calculations. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2016 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultants, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2013 and has over 14 years of prior industry experience. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Director of Reservoir Engineering has over 27 years of oil and gas industry experience and has managed the preparation of public company reserve estimates the last 13 years. He joined the Company in mid-2016 after spending the preceding 12 years as Director of Corporate Engineering for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. He has also served in various engineering and strategic planning roles with both Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas and with Conoco, Inc. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University in 1989 and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Houston in 1999.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert barrels to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one barrel of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2016 were estimated at $98.9 million.
The following table presents our PUDs by field (in MMBoe):
The following table presents a reconciliation of our PUDs (in MMBoe):
Activity related to PUDs in 2016:
•
During 2016, we drilled and converted one PUD location and 1.9 MMBoe to proved developed reserves (“PDs”). Approximately $33.9 million of capital expenditures were incurred related to development of PUDs. Development activity in 2016 resulted in reclassification of approximately 26% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2015 to proved developed status.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), PUD reserves were added due to drilling the A-18 well to target depth and beginning completion activities. Although the A-18 well was not completed by year-end 2016, the data available from the drilling activity and initial completion activities led to the conversion of the A-18 well from PUD to PD and resulted in the recognition of one additional offsetting PUD location.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), PUD reserves were added as two locations were reclassified from probable to PUD, which we plan on drilling in the fourth quarter of 2017 or in early 2018.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), reserves associated with existing PUD locations were added due to performance evaluations of adjacent PDs and economic field life extension resulting from ongoing success in managing and reducing lease operating expenses.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend), updated field performance data demonstrated an additional take point is unnecessary to recover estimated proved reserves, therefore we determined the well previous classified as a PUD will not be drilled and it was removed from PUD reserves.
Activity related to PUDs in 2015:
•
During 2015, we completed five offshore wells which affected the conversion of PUDs to PDs reserves and affected additional PUDs to be recognized. Three of the five wells were drilled prior to 2015. Approximately $141.0 million of capital expenditures was incurred related to these five wells during 2015. Activity, divestitures and development assessments in 2015 resulted in reclassification of approximately 88% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2014.
•
At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), our interests were divested and we were assigned an ORRI.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend), we completed one well which moved PUDs to PDs.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), one well was removed from PUDs as the development timing was beyond the five year limitation and another well was removed from PUDs as it was determined to be uneconomic.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 782 field (Dantzler), we completed two wells which moved PUDs into PDs.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), PUD reserves were added based on performance, remapping and technical changes.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), PUD reserves were added due to the assessment related to two wells.
Activity related to PUDs in 2014:
•
During 2014, we drilled 20 development wells that converted PUDs to PDs and spent $149.5 million on development of PUDs. Activity in 2014 allowed reclassification of approximately 15% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2013.
•
At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), we drilled and completed 20 development wells, which moved PUDs to PDs. In addition, PUDs were decreased due to certain wells being evaluated as uneconomic due to performance and for technical reasons. PUDs were increased due to exploration drilling activity, both by us and offset operators.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), we experienced technical difficulties from a cracked casing, which led us to abandon the well. As of December 31, 2014, we were in the process of drilling a new well (the A-18 well) which was expected to convert the PUDs to PDs, but stacked the rig in the first quarter of 2015 due to substantially reduced crude oil prices.
•
The PUDs at our Mississippi Canyon 782 field (Dantzler) were added as a result of drilling activity in 2013 and completion operations in 2014 to classify reserves as PUD. This field is not operated by us so we are subject to the decisions of the operator.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), a PUD location was added based upon reassessment of field performance and a revised reserve depletion plan. The plan revision was made due to the magnitude of the reserve potential.
See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
We believe that we will be able to develop all but 1.3 MMBoe, or approximately 14%, of the total 9.3 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31, 2016, within five years from the date such reserves were initially recorded. The lone exception is at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) where the field is being developed using a single floating tension leg platform requiring an extended sequential development plan. The platform cannot support a rig that would allow additional wells to be drilled, but can support a rig to allow sidetracking of wells. One of the sidetrack PUD locations in this field was originally recorded in our proved reserves as of December 31, 2010. The development of this PUD will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. Based on the latest reserve report, a well is expected to be drilled to develop this PUD location in 2023.
Our capital budget for 2017 is $125 million, which excludes potential acquisitions, with over 50% allocated for development. Three of our four PUDs as of December 31, 2016 are scheduled to be drilled in 2017.
Acreage
The following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2016. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 74% of our net acreage is held by production. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
Regarding the undeveloped leasehold, 47,500 net acres (40%) of the total 118,647 net undeveloped acres could expire in 2017, 19,975 net acres (17%) could expire in 2018, 32,720 net acres (27%) could expire in 2019, 11,912 net acres (10%) could expire in 2020, and 6,720 net acres (6%) could expire in 2020 and beyond. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2017 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net acreage decreased 90,160 net acres (17%) from December 31, 2015 due to lease expirations and relinquishments.
Production
For the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, our net daily production averaged 41,980 Boe, 46,709 Boe, and 48,317 Boe, respectively. Production decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to natural production declines and divestiture of the Yellow Rose properties, partially offset by production from Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend) and the Mississippi Canyon 782 field (Dantzler), which began production in the fourth quarter of 2015, and from one well completed during the year. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three years.
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Refer to the descriptions of our 10 largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany) and the Fairway Field over the past three fiscal years, which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 in this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2016 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest.
(1)
Includes eleven gross (7.2 net) oil wells and six gross (3.1 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014. As the Yellow Rose properties were divested during 2015 and we do not currently have any onshore drilling activities, historical data for onshore drilling was excluded from the table below.
The table below is based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine productive wells drilled.
Development and Exploration Drilling
The following table summarizes our development and exploration offshore wells completed over the past three years.
Our success rates related to our development and exploration wells drilled was 100% in each of the last three years.
Recent Drilling Activity
During January 2017, we completed the A-18 offshore development well at the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany). This well was spud in 2014, but drilling was suspended in 2015 and resumed in 2016.
Capital Expenditures
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; acquisition opportunities; liquidity and financing options; and the results of our exploration and development activities. Due to the sustained lower commodity price environment and the outlook for the remainder of 2017, we have set our 2017 capital expenditure budget at $125 million, which excludes potential acquisitions. Although this is an increase from the $49 million capital expenditures incurred in 2016, our current plan for 2017 is a significant reduction from 2015 and 2014 investment levels of $231 million and $630 million, respectively. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional capital expenditures information.
