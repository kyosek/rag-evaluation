Item 2.	Properties
The Fund has acquired a Limited Partnership interest in 382 Operating
Partnerships in 21 series, identified in the table set forth below. The
Apartment Complex owned by the Operating Partnership is eligible for the
Federal Housing Tax Credit. Occupancy of a unit in each Apartment Complex
which initially complied with the Minimum Set-Aside Test (i.e., occupancy by
tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median
income) and the Rent Restriction Test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does
not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to hereinafter
as "Qualified Occupancy." The Operating Partnership and the respective
Apartment Complex is described more fully in the Prospectus. The General
Partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
Please refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.
