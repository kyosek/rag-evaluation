As time permits, the Company will also work on advancing the Trout Creek gold project, Lander County, Nevada.
South Mountain Project, Owyhee County, Idaho
Under the BeMetals Corporation (TSX-V: BMET) Option Agreement, BeMetals and Thunder Mountain Gold formed a project team early in 2019 that is focused on advancing the South Mountain Project. This Boise Idaho-based team includes key management of Thunder Mountain Gold Inc., who have coordinated re-establishment of the Project site prior to the start of drilling. In addition, BeMetals appointed a project manager and project geologist for this team, along with technical and underground support.
With the help of Thunder Mountain Gold, BeMetals (BMET) commenced drilling at South Mountain in July of 2019 and drilled twenty-one holes totaling 7,517 feet (2,290 meters) from five underground drilling stations within the Sonneman level. The drilling program was designed to test potential down plunge extensions, and overall continuity to the mineralized zones and confirm the grade distribution of the current polymetallic mineral resource. All of the drill core recovered from the drilling was logged on site and assayed by ALS Chemex. Selected intervals and results are summarized in the Company`s 2019 Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
PHASE 2 TEXAS ZONE DRILLING - SOUTH MOUNTAIN PROJECT
A total of 8,904 feet (2,714 meters) of underground core drilling was completed during Phase 2, with 30 holes in both the Texas and DMEA zones. During this drilling campaign, our site team widened and advanced the existing Sonneman level eastwards by 170 feet (52 meters) to establish a new drill station closer to the Texas Zone (See Figure 1). With better access to drill the Texas Zone, a total of 24 holes were completed to test this zone of mineralization. Geological logging of the core supported by sampling results indicate that two styles of high-grade mineralization have developed in this area and are now identified as the Texas West and Texas East zones.
Table 1 below illustrates the drilling results received to date from the Texas West Zone. This zone is characterized by skarn-hosted, dominantly copper and silver mineralization. This is demonstrated, for example, in the drilled intercepts:
·3.81% Cu with 7.82 opt (244.3 g/t) Ag over 15.7 feet (4.79 meters) in hole SM20-043 (Interval 1),
·2.56% Cu with 8.32 opt (260.1 g/t) Ag over 35.6 feet (10.85 meters) in SM20-028, and
·2.23% Cu with 10.81 opt (337.9 g/t) Ag over 16.96 feet (5.17 meters) in hole SM20-038.
Important to note that from the geological logging of the core, the higher copper grades over significant drilled widths in Texas West appear to be controlled by the increased abundance of chalcopyrite, which is a common copper sulphide mineral, often extractable through conventional flotation methods. Representative sample material of this and other zones of the deposit have been identified and are being collected for metallurgical test work at the SGS Mineral Services site in Lakefield, Canada. Results from this study will be included with historical test work and incorporated into the planned PEA study later this year.
Table 2 below displays the drill hole intersections from the Texas East Zone where this mineralization is represented by predominantly massive sulphide hosted zinc, silver, and gold mineralization. Examples of this style of mineralization are intercepts:
·8.65% Zn, 6.98 opt (218.1 g/t) Ag and 0.078 opt (2.44 g/t) Au over 11 feet (3.37 meters) in hole SM20-043 (Interval 2), and
·4.17% Zn, 6.23 opt (194.8 g/t) Ag and 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) Au over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters) in hole SM20-050.
The gold grades of 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters); 0.066 opt (2.07 g/t) over 15.45 feet (4.71 meters) and 0.122 opt. (3.82 g/t) over 4.39 feet (1.34 meters) in holes SM20-050, SM20-043, and SM20-029, respectively, are of specific interest from a value potential for the Texas East Zone. These Texas East intersections represent the successful targeting and interpreted extension of mineralization below historical high-grade rib sampling in the Sonneman level from the 1980s (See Figure 1). (See Thunder Mountain Gold news release, dated; January 27, 2020).
The 2020 drill program intersected mineralization extending the Texas Zone further down dip of historical drilling and the exposures in the underground development. Texas Zone mineralization is now interpreted to continue from the collar of the old Texas Shaft some 1,150 feet (350 meters) down dip to the SM20-050 intercept. Both the Texas West and East zones remain open to depth (See Figure 1). Table 3 further below provides drill hole azimuth, dip, end of hole length and collar coordinates for each of the reported drill holes.
Table 1. Analytical and Assay Results from Texas West Zone
Note: Reported widths are drilled core lengths as true widths are unknown at this time. It is estimated based upon current data that true widths might range between 60-80% of the drilled intersection. A nominal cut-off grade of 0.5% Cu has been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections for this skarn-hosted mineralization with no more than 1.22 meters of internal dilution. *A nominal cut-off grade of 4.375 opt (150 g/t) Ag has been applied to this intersection.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
The project employs a rigorous QC/QA program that includes blanks, duplicates and appropriate certified standard reference material. All samples are introduced into the sample stream prior to sample handling/crushing to monitor analytical accuracy and precision. The insertion rate for the combined QA/QC samples is 10 percent or more depending upon batch sizes. ALS Global completed the analytical work with the core samples processed at their preparation facility in Reno, Nevada, U.S.A. All analytical and assay procedures are conducted in the ALS facility in North Vancouver, BC. The samples are processed by the following methods as appropriate to determine the grades; Au-AA23-Au 30g fire assay with AA finish, ME-ICP61-33 element four acid digest with ICP-AES finish, ME-OG62-ore grade elements, four acid with ICP-AES finish, Pb-OG62-ore grade Pb, four acid with ICP-AES finish, Zn-OG62-ore grade Zn, four acid digest with ICP-AES finish, Ag-GRA21-Ag 30g fire assay with gravimetric finish.
The South Mountain Project
South Mountain is a polymetallic development project focused on high-grade zinc and silver. It is located approximately 70 miles southwest of Boise, Idaho (see Figure 2). The Project was intermittently mined from the late 1800s to the late 1960s and its existing underground workings remain intact and well maintained. Historic production at the Project has largely come from high-grade massive sulfide bodies that remain open at depth and along strike. According to historical smelter records, approximately 53,642 tons of mineralized material has been mined to date. These records also indicate average grades; 14.5% Zn, 11.63 opt Ag, 0.063 opt Au, 2.4% Pb, and 1.4% Cu were mined. Thunder Mountain Gold Inc. purchased and advanced the Project from 2007 through 2019 investing approximately US$12M during that period. The current mineral resource estimate of the deposit is detailed in Table 3 below and the Company expects to provide a revised mineral resource update following a phase 2 drilling program in 2020.
The Project is largely on and surrounded by private surface land, and as such, the permitting and environmental aspects of the Project are expected to be straightforward. Permits are currently in place for underground exploration activities.

These are historic grades and recoveries not confirmed by the Company, but reportedly

South Mountain Mines Inc. (an Idaho Corporation) owned the patented claims from 1975 to the time the Company purchased the entity in 2007. They conducted extensive exploration work including extending the Sonneman Level by approximately 1,500 feet to intercept the down-dip extension of the Texas sulfide mineralization mined on the Laxey Level approximately 400 feet up-dip from the Sonneman. High grade sulfide mineralization was intercepted and confirmed on the Sonneman Extension. In 1985 South Mountain Mines Inc. completed a feasibility study based on historic and newly developed ore zones exposed in their underground workings and drilling. Although they determined positive economics, and that the resource was still open at depth with a large upside potential, the project was idled and placed into care and maintenance.
In 2008, the Company contracted Kleinfelder, Inc., a nationwide engineering and consulting firm, to complete a technical report “Resources Data Evaluation, South Mountain Property, South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho”. The technical report was commissioned by Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. to evaluate all the existing data available on the South Mountain property. Kleinfelder utilized a panel modeling method using this data to determine potential mineralized material remaining and to make a comparison with the resource determined by South Mountain Mines in the mid-1980s. Kleinfelder’s calculations provided a potential resource that is consistent with South Mountain Mines’ (Bowes 1985) historic reserve model.
In 2009, the Company contracted a third-party consulting firm that incorporated all the new drill and sampling data into an NI 43-101 Technical Report. This report was completed as part of the Company’s dual listing on the TSX Venture Exchange in 2010. The Company is also traded in the U.S. on the OTCQB under ticker THMG.
In January of 2018, the Company engaged Hard Rock Consulting LLC (HRC) from Denver, Colorado to update the South Mountain Project 43-101. HRC concluded that significant potential exists to increase the known mineral resource with additional drilling, as well as to upgrade existing mineral resource classifications with additional infill drilling. HRC also determined that the conceptual geologic model is sound, and, in conjunction with drilling results, indicates that mineralization is essentially open in all directions, and is continuous between underground levels and extends to the surface.
Hard Rock Consulting also noted that:
·THMG technical staff has thorough understanding of the geology of the South Mountain Project, and that the appropriate deposit model is being applied for exploration.
·Because the Project is largely located on and surrounded by private land, it greatly simplifies Project approvals compared to mining projects involving public lands.
·Initial metallurgical testing demonstrates that the South Mountain massive sulfide mineralization is amenable to differential flotation and concentration.
·The current mineral resource at the South Mountain Project is more than sufficient to warrant continued planning and development to further advance the Project.
Gold Breccia
HRC also reviewed the data on the anomalous gold-bearing multi-lithic breccia that was identified by THMG conducting reconnaissance work at South Mountain. In 2010, five holes were drilled in the anomaly for a total footage
of 3,530 feet, and 705 total samples taken every five feet of drill hole. Of the 705 samples taken, 686 samples contained anomalous gold, or 97% of the samples. The highest-grade intercept ran 0.038 ounce per ton. HRC reviewed the reports done on the breccia completed by both Kinross and Newmont; of note was Newmont’s comparison of the geology to the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada.
The Technical Report was authored by Ms. J.J. Brown, P.G., SME-RM, Mr. Jeffrey Choquette, P.E., and Mr. Randy Martin, SME-RM, all of Hard Rock Consulting, each of whom is an independent qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 The NI 43-101 Technical Report has an effective date of April 7, 2018 and has been filed in Canada on SEDAR in accordance with NI 43-101. The Report can be reviewed on the Company`s website at www.thundermountaingold.com.
Note to United States investors concerning estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources.
Disclosure of the NI-43-101 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, including Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), which differ from the current requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) set out in Industry Guide 7. The Highlights of South Mountain NI-43-101 section refers to “mineral resources,” “measured mineral resources,” “indicated mineral resources,” and “inferred mineral resources.” While these categories of mineralization are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, they are not recognized by Industry Guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be disclosed in SEC filings. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any of measured, indicated or inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Under Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the mineralization can be economically or legally extracted at the time the “reserve” determination is made. "Inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Disclosure of "contained ounces" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian reporting standards; however, Industry Guide 7 normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute "reserves" by Industry Guide 7 standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained in this 10-K containing descriptions of South Mountain’s mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of Industry Guide 7.
Phase I Drilling at South Mountain under BeMetals Option Agreement
The principal objectives of the Phase 1 work plan at South Mountain was to test for potential extensions of the mineralized zones and confirm the grade distribution of the current polymetallic mineral resource estimate. The Company has now successfully completed the phase 1 program comprised of 20 underground drill holes for a total of approximately 2,290 meters. Geological logging and sampling of all drill holes have now been completed with all analytical results received. These results have been compiled into the Project’s geological database and were used to design the phase 2 drilling program for 2020. Following the phase 2 drilling program, all new results will be integrated into an updated mineral resource estimation for the Project, expected to be completed towards the end of 2021.
Table 1. BeMetal`s Analytical and Assay Results for the Phase 1 Drilling Program
* Note: 1.00 meter (m) is equal to 3.28 feet (ft). One gram per tonne (g/t) is equal to 0.032 ounces per ton (oz/t, or o.p.t.)
Table 2 below shows the latest results received from holes SM19-016, SM19-017 and SM19-018.
Table 2. Drill Holes SM19-016, SM19-017 and SM19-018: Analytical and Assay Results
Note: Reported widths in tables 1 & 2 are drilled core lengths as true widths are unknown at this time. It is estimated based upon current data that true widths might range between 60-80% of the drilled intersection. For drill holes SM19-017* and SM19-018* true widths are unknown as these are the first drill intersections of the MD4 target. Intervals cut offs are based upon visual contacts of massive sulfide units with no more than 1.75 meters of internal skarn. For SM19-010 a nominal 0.5% copper cut off has been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections for this skarn hosted mineralization with no more than 1.4m of internal dilution. For SM19-016† (intervals 1, 3 and 4) a nominal 0.46 g/t gold cut off has been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections with no internal dilution. For SM19-017 & 018 a nominal 2.4% zinc cut off has been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections for this skarn hosted mineralization with no more than 2m of internal dilution. (Note: See details below in QA/QC section). 1.00 meter (m) is equal to 3.28 feet (ft). One gram per tonne (g/t) is equal to 0.032 ounces per ton (oz/t, or o.p.t.).
The above drill holes returned significant intersections of both massive sulfide and skarn styles of mineralization. Important sulfide minerals are pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. During the planned phase 3 campaign at South Mountain, the Company will carry out mineralogy and metallurgical test work studies to confirm historical other previous high-grade results, which will be included in the PEA.

Underground core drilling is being conducted to extend and upgrade the South Mountain resource - testing the continuity and down-dip extensions of the high-grade polymetallic massive sulfide zones. The Company plans additional core drilling in the DMEA and Laxey zones to complete the confirmation and extensional drilling. In addition, there are plans to retrieve bulk samples for metallurgical test work. More than 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) have been drilled at South Mountain and included in the model. The South Mountain historic ore zones remain open down-dip on the zones encountered. The successful drilling and development work prove that the South Mountain resource continues to grow with potential to increase the resource substantially.

Underground Pre-Development Work Completed in 2012 thru 2014
The reconstruction of the Sonneman and Laxey drifts continued successfully until January 2014 when the Project went into care and maintenance. The Sonneman Level advanced 2,711 feet from the portal and is constructed to 12 feet by 12 feet for future development and mining. Approximately 350 feet of drift remains to be rehabilitated to reach the historic Texas massive sulfide zone located at the end of the old workings. This advance through this zone will allow for the drill stations and underground drilling to further define the high-grade resource encountered by William Bowes group in the 1980s.
The historic 2,200-foot-long Laxey Level drift has been rehabilitated to 10 feet by 10 feet for approximately 720 feet. At that point the old tunnel had recently collapsed at an intrusive dike and preparations were being made to advance through the caved area. This old tunnel was rehabilitated and accessed along its full length in 2008, at which point it intercepted the Texas massive sulfide zone, one of many that had limited mining during and after the World War II period. Excellent high-grade massive sulfide is exposed in this area, and the core drilling during 2013 proved its continuity between the Laxey Level and the surface, an up-dip distance of nearly 400 feet.
During the development of the Sonneman Level during 2012-2013 several massive sulfide mineralized zones were mined through. Detailed rib sampling along some of these zones yielded the following results:
Highlights from 2013-2014 Rib-Sampling Program
• DMEA Zones 1/2/3; 130 ft. (39.62m) @ 16.76% Zinc (“Zn”), 4.11 ounces per ton (“o.p.t.”) (140.91 grams per tonne (“g/t”)) Silver (“Ag”), 0.089 o.p.t. (3.08 g/t Gold) (“Au”), 0.78% Copper (“Cu”) and 0.38% Lead (“Pb”)
• Muck Bay #4 Zone; 23 ft. (7.01m) @ 14.69% Zn, 7.18 o.p.t. (246.17 g/t) Ag, 0.34% Cu and 0.65% Pb
• Laxey Zone; 40 ft. (12.19m) @ 16.44% Zn, 13.97 o.p.t. (478.97 g/t) Ag, 0.020 o.p.t. (0.68 g/t) Au, 0.70% Cu and 0.86% Pb
(Results previously reported in the Company`s annual / quarterly reports; news releases; and the May 2019 independent technical report titled, “National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the South Mountain Project Owyhee County, Idaho, USA.” 1.00 meter (m) is equal to 3.28 feet (ft). One gram per tonne (g/t) is equal to 0.032 ounces per ton (oz/t, or o.p.t.).
Qualified Person - The technical information in this Form 10K has been reviewed and approved by Larry D. Kornze, Retired, P. Eng., Qualified Person, and Director of Thunder Mountain Gold Inc., and a “Qualified Person” as defined by National Instrument 43-101 standards.
This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of the SEC`s Industry Guide 7. There are currently no permits required for conducting exploration in accordance with the Company`s current board approved exploration plan.
Trout Creek Project, Lander County, Nevada
The Trout Creek project is a highly prospective gold exploration target located along the western flank of the Shoshone Mountain Range in the Reese River Valley in Lander County, Nevada. The claim package consists of 78 unpatented mining claims (approximately 1560 acres) that are situated along a recognizable structural zone in the Eureka-Battle Mountain mineralized gold trend. Because the project is surrounded by Newmont Mining`s land package, Thunder Mountain struck a joint venture agreement with Newmont Mining on some of their adjoining mineral rights sections and aliquot parcels from 2011 thru 2016. On October 27, 2016 the Company terminated the exploration agreement with Newmont Mining Corporation to concentrate their efforts on the South Mountain Project. The Company retained the 78-claim package by paying annual fees to BLM of $12,090 and Lander County $940 fees.
The Project is located approximately 155 air miles northeast of Reno, Nevada, or approximately 20 miles south of Battle Mountain, Nevada, in Sections 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 27; T.29N.; R.44E. Mount Diablo Baseline & Meridian, Lander County, Nevada. Latitude: 40 23’ 36” North, Longitude: 117 00’ 58” West. The property is generally accessible year-round by traveling south from Battle Mountain Nevada on state highway 305, which is paved.
The Trout Creek target is anchored by a regional gravity anomaly on a well-defined northwest-southeast trending break in the alluvial fill thickness and underlying bedrock. Previous geophysical work in the 1980s revealed an airborne magnetic anomaly associated with the same structure, and this was further verified and outlined in 2008 by Company personnel, with consultation from Jim Wright - Wright Geophysics using a ground magnetometer. The target is covered by alluvial fan deposits of generally unknown thickness, shed from the adjacent Shoshone Range, a fault block mountain range composed of Paleozoic sediments of both upper and lower plate rocks of the Roberts Mountains thrust.
An extensive data package on the area was made available to Thunder Mountain Gold by Newmont during the joint exploration agreement period (2011-2016) that significantly enhanced the target area. This, along with fieldwork consisting of mapping and sampling the altered and mineralized structures that can be followed through the Shoshone Range. Of importance is that these structures align with the Cortez-Pipeline deposits and the Phoenix deposit (part of the Eureka-Battle Mountain-Getchell Trend).
In addition to the geologic fieldwork, Wright Geophysics conducted a ground gravity survey and CSMAT over the pediment target area and this provided insight into the gravel-bedrock contact as well as defining the favorable structural setting within the buried bedrock. An untested drill target was identified under the gravel pediment along
these structures, and the geophysics showed that the bedrock was within 500 feet of the surface, which is reasonable depth for exploration drilling and potential mining if a significant mineralization is encountered.
The Company does not plan to conduct any work on the Trout Creek Property in 2021 because of it`s focus on completing the NI 43-101 PEA at their South Mountain Project.
There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, a notice of intent may be required with the Bureau of Land Management. This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of the SEC’s Industry Guide 7.
Competition
We are an exploration stage company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Employees
The Company employs three full-time officers. As part of the BeMetals agreement, the Company allowed these officers to work on the South Mountain Project on a consulting arrangement with BeMetals.
