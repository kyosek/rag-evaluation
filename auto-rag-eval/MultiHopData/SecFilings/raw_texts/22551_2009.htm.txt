ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our principal properties consist of proven and unproven crude oil and natural gas properties; mining claims on unproven precious metals properties; and a fee interest in an industrial minerals property.
OIL AND GAS
The following properties are operated by the Company and have been funded in part by the TVC OPUS 1 Drilling Program, L.P.:
Pleasant Valley: This property is located in Ventura County, California, in the Oxnard Oil Field where we are in the early stages of developing and producing heavy oil from the Upper Vaca Tar Formation. The California State Department of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources has published estimates that the Upper Vaca Tar has over 400 million barrels of original oil in place (OOIP), of which we and our partners control about 128 million barrels of OOIP attributable to Pleasant Valley as estimated by an independent reserves engineering firm in October 2009. During 2007, we drilled a total of seven horizontal wells and installed temporary production facilities; and in 2008, we commenced cyclic steaming operations. During 2009, production was curtailed periodically to accommodate installation of larger diameter flow lines, production manifolds, and artificial lift equipment on three of the seven wells; and to test steam injection parameters on individual wells. Smaller diameter tubing was also installed in all seven wells to achieve better steam distribution.
Our plans for 2010 include the drilling of a horizontal injector well that will be paired with an existing horizontal producing well to test Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage (SAGD) technology for future deployment to fully develop and produce the Upper Vaca Tar. We also plan this year to convert a vertical well to a water disposal well to eliminate the cost of offsite water disposal once regulatory approval of our application is received.
Temblor Valley West/South Belridge Field: The South Belridge Properties are located in Kern County, California, west of Bakersfield, and include a total of 56 wells; six producing, one active injection well, and 49 idle wells. Five wells were drilled in 2007, and these wells extended the known oil-bearing formations to the west by over a half mile. Oil production on the Property comes from the Etchegoin Formation. Attempts in prior years to increase production by cyclic steaming of the Lower Diatomite Formation and a pilot waterflood of the Etchegoin Formation proved unsuccessful. We are currently evaluating other options for these Properties, including possible divestiture.
Temblor Valley East/Edison Field: This property is located in Kern County, California, east of Bakersfield and consists of the Shield and Arms Lease which includes two producing wells, one injection well, and three idle wells. The two producing wells were completed in the Olcese Formation and are produced by beam pump. We are currently evaluating other options for this Property, including possible divestiture.
Moffat Ranch: This gas field is located in the southern area of the “California Gas Country” in Madera County in central California. The gas field consists of one producing well and three idle wells. In late 2007, Tri-Valley drilled the deepest wellbore penetration in the field to below 10,000 feet to evaluate more than 14 potential producing horizons. Two of these potential gas zones were evaluated for productive potential in 2007, and one was successfully tested at over one million cubic feet per day. In 2008, attempts to restore the three idle wells to production were unsuccessful. We have plans to rework one of our idle wells in the second quarter of 2010.
Ekho: The Ekho No. 1 exploratory well, located north of Bakersfield in Kern County, California, was originally drilled by the Company to 19,088 feet in 2000 and encountered hydrocarbons in tight formations in the lower zones of the well. In 2005, we hydraulically fractured the Vedder Zone between 18,018 and 18,525 feet, injecting approximately 5,000 barrels of fluid which carried approximately 118,000 pounds of bauxite propping material. While successful mechanically, the fracturing operation did not result in producing hydrocarbons at commercial rates from the Vedder Zone. This well still has multiple targets which can be evaluated in the future, and we will continue to look for new technologies that could allow the Vedder Zone to produce commercially.
Sunrise Natural Gas Project: This project is located just north of Bakersfield, California, in the City of Delano and consists of one vertical well and one horizontal well that were drilled by the Company in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and which encountered “tight” natural gas in the McClure Shale at approximately 8,200 feet. We believe the McClure Shale may hold up to three trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the mapped area of closure. In 2005, we hydraulically fractured 1,000 feet of the 3,000 foot horizontal portion of a well bore in the tight McClure Shale utilizing gelled diesel that carried in approximately 138,000 pounds of sand. Again, while mechanically successful like the Ekho Project, the fracturing operation did not result in the well producing hydrocarbons from the McClure Shale at commercial rates. We will continue to review all available technologies to bring the Sunrise Natural Gas Project potential to commercial realization given the volume of natural gas in place in the tight reservoir.
In addition, Tri-Valley currently operates the following properties:
Rio Vista Field: The Rio Vista Field is located in Solano County, in northern California, and we operate four producing gas wells and two idle wells on two separate leases in this field. These two separate leases are the Hanson and the Webb Tract.
Dutch Slough Field: The Dutch Slough Field is located in Contra Costa County in northern California, where we operate one producing gas well and two idle wells on the Martin-Severin Lease in this field.
Edison Field (Race Track Hill Area): The Edison Field Property is located east of Bakersfield, California, and contains seven idle wells that offset a successful cyclic steaming operation in the Santa Margarita Formation. We have obtained 29 individual well drilling permits for this property and plan to reactivate production on this lease in 2010 with cyclic steaming operations in the second quarter of the year. We also plan to drill up to 20 new wells beginning in the third quarter of 2010. This property, when fully developed, has the potential to produce approximately 3.7 million barrels of oil for Tri-Valley’s interest, based upon an independent engineering report completed in January 2010.
Proved Reserves
We have retained the services of Mr. Leland B. Cecil, P.E., an independent petroleum engineer based in Bakersfield, California, and AJM Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to estimate the Company’s net share of Proved and Prospective Reserves at December 31, 2009. Proved Reserve estimates are classified as either Developed or Undeveloped Reserves. Prospective Reserves are differentiated as Probable Reserves and Possible Reserves. The estimates were prepared according to the guidelines established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“the SEC”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for valuation of crude oil and natural gas reserves.
Proved Reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are use for the estimation. Projects to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the projects within a reasonable time. Proved Reserves are further classified as either Developed or Undeveloped. Proved Developed Reserves are Proved Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved Undeveloped Reserves are Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Prospective Reserves are differentiated according to reservoir characteristics and exhibited recovery from efforts analogous to the subject properties. Probable Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Proved Reserves but which, together with Proved Reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to Proved Reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Likewise, Probable Reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Finally, Possible Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable Reserves. Possible Reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to Probable Reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. Possible Reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for Probable Reserves.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.
Our estimated future net recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, were as follows:

Economics for determined reserves in 2009 were formulated from market conditions that existed during the twelve months of the year. Product sale prices were calculated from applicable prices posted on the first day of the calendar months. Operating expenses were normalized for a twelve month moving average. No consideration was given to potential future inflation of either product sale prices or costs relative to future operation. The present value of projected future net income was calculated at an annual discount rate of 10%. On this basis, future net revenue to be derived from our Proved Developed and Undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves was $44.2 million at December 31, 2009.
Using year-end 2008 crude oil and natural gas prices and prevailing levels of lease operating expenses, the estimated present value of the future net revenue to be derived from our proved developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, was $1.7 million at December 31, 2008, and $12.3 million at December 31, 2007. The precipitous drop in crude oil reported reserves from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 was due to the
collapse of crude oil prices in the second half of 2008. This resulted in the proved producing reserves on our producing oil wells at the time to be written down to zero in the reserve report.
On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Release No. 33-8995 amending its oil and natural gas reporting requirements for oil and natural gas producing companies. The effective date of the new accounting and disclosure requirements is for annual reports filed for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. Among other things Release No. 33-8995:
·
Revises a number of definitions relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves to make them consistent with the Petroleum Resource Management System, which includes certain non-traditional resources in proved reserves.
·
Permits the use of new technologies for determining proved oil and natural gas reserves.
·
Requires the use of average prices for the trailing twelve-month period in the estimation of oil and natural gas reserve quantities and for companies using the full cost method of accounting, in computing the Ceiling Limitation, in place of a single day price as of the end of the fiscal year.
·
Permits the disclosure in filings with the SEC of probable and possible reserves and reserves sensitivity to changes in prices.
·
Requires additional disclosures (outside of the financial statements) regarding the status of undeveloped reserves and changes in status of these from period to period.
·
Requires a discussion of the internal controls in place to assure objectivity in the reserve estimation process and disclosure of the technical qualifications of the technical person having primarily responsibility for preparing the reserve estimates.
Companies are not permitted to use the new SEC requirements for fiscal years ending prior to December 31, 2009. We have evaluated the effect that adoption of the final rule will have on our financial statements and oil and natural gas reserve estimates and disclosures. Based on a review by our independent petroleum engineer, we believe that, if the new requirements had been in effect for our fiscal 2008, our reported natural gas and crude oil reserves would have been substantially higher than those reported under the currently applied SEC standards. Notably, the use of trailing twelve month average prices instead of year end prices would have dramatically increased the value of our reserves. In fiscal 2008, the prices we received for oil production varied from a high of $123.13 per barrel to a low of $26.15 per barrel, with the year end price on which reserves were calculated being $30.13 per barrel.

MINERALS
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Select Resources Corporation, Inc., holds and maintains two precious metal properties and an industrial minerals property in the State of Alaska. The Richardson and Shorty Creek precious metal properties are exploration stage gold properties which require additional capital to fully evaluate their gold and minerals potential. There is no assurance that a commercially-viable mineral deposit exists on either of these precious metal properties. Current economic conditions point towards continued strength for precious metal prices, and we plan to maintain a strong focus on these properties.
Our industrial minerals property, the Admiral Calder Quarry (“Calder”), contains over 25 million tons of high grade minable resource in place according to our independent engineering estimates and was partially developed and produced for a short time by the previous owner. Select acquired Calder in 2005 but has neither mined nor sold any product from the property.
Shorty Creek: In January 2005, we acquired the Shorty Creek property (“Shorty”) which is located in the Tolovana District about 60 miles northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska, along the paved, all-weather Elliot Highway that is the principal route used to access the North Slope petroleum production areas. Shorty has been described by a state geologist of Alaska as perhaps the best drill-ready gold exploration project in the state; and it directly offsets, and is on trend with, International Tower Hill’s ongoing exploration drilling program at its Livengood Gold Project which has so far defined 12.5 million ounces of gold (indicated and inferred).
Shorty Creek is a gold or possible polymetalic exploration project where we have conducted previous campaigns of exploration work that included geochemical sampling and drilling which have identified anomalous concentrations of gold, copper, molybdenum, and their pathfinder elements.
In 2005 we carried out geophysical and satellite interpretation programs over a large portion of Shorty Creek and a multi-element soil auger geochemical program extending over one of four distinctive aeromagnetic anomalies, covering an area approximately of one mile, resulting in the identification of five precious metal and base metal anomalies. This same year we acquired mineral rights to 178 State of Alaska mining claims through staking and lease arrangements from Gold Range Ltd., covering approximately 17 square miles. In 2009, additional property was acquired through contractors, essentially doubling Shorty’s property position to about 40 square miles, and was based on geophysics and third-party gold geochemistry.
Also in 2009, we acquired regional geochemistry data from the State of Alaska and an interpretation of that data by the University of Alaska which significantly enhanced the potential of Shorty Creek. The State’s geochemistry data was collected over a 1,000 square mile area that includes Shorty Creek. From this data, the University determined that the highest two-and-one-quarter percent (2.25%) concentrations of precious and base metals are clustered in a 45 square mile area and about eighty-five percent (85%) of this cluster lies within the boundaries of the Shorty Creek prospect.
To date, we have not identified proven or probable mineral reserves on Shorty Creek. Based on archived data, including the State of Alaska geochemistry data and the University of Alaska study, significant mineralization has been identified on the property; and if determined to be of adequate size, quality, and spatial distribution, the final extent of this mineralization could prove to be economic in the future. Further exploration is required before a final evaluation as to the economic and technical feasibility can be determined. To that end, we have contracted Avalon Development Corporation to prepare an NI 43-101 (Canadian form) report for Shorty Creek which should be completed in the second quarter of 2010 and continue to pursue options for funding additional exploration work on the property.
The following table sets forth the information regarding the acreage position of the Shorty Creek claim block as of December 31, 2009:

Richardson: The Richardson Property (“Richardson”) is located in the Richardson District, one of the most prospective and underexplored gold exploration districts in east-central Alaska. Our claims are located near the all-weather paved Richardson Highway, about seventy miles southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, and just south of the nearby Trans-Alaska Pipeline corridor that provides access to our claims from the north. We acquired the bulk of the Richardson property in 1987, and it covers 29,640 acres of land, all of which is owned by the State of Alaska.
The Richardson Project is an early-stage gold exploration project with past placer production and pilot-size lode gold production. Geophysical and geochemical signatures are consistent with intrusion-related gold systems. Nine highly prospective zones have been identified in previous exploration programs carried out by the Company and previous owners.
In late 2005, we initiated geophysical and satellite interpretation programs over the entire Richardson Property and a multi-element soil auger geochemical program, extending along approximately 4.5-miles of the Richardson Lineament that appears to extend 12 to 15 miles in length. The survey found six precious metal and other element anomalies. We also conducted 3,050 feet of diamond drilling in the Democrat Mine area which indicated gold and silver mineralization.
To date, we have no proven or probable mineral reserves on Richardson and have contracted with Avalon Development Corporation to produce an NI 43-101 report (Canadian form) that will be prepared in 2010 after completion of a similar report for Shorty Creek.

Industrial Minerals: Our industrial minerals project is the Admiral Calder calcium carbonate quarry (“Calder”) located in Alaska on the northwest end of Prince of Wales Island, approximately 150 air miles south of Juneau and 88 air miles northwest of Ketchikan. Independent estimates conclude that Calder may hold in excess of 25 million tons of high chemical grade, high brightness, and high whiteness calcium carbonate resource in place. By some authorities, Calder has the potential to be “a world class producer of calcium carbonate for several markets” (Harben and Lobdell, Peter Harben, Inc. 2005).
Select paid $3.0 million in 2005 to acquire Calder from Sealaska Corporation, which had invested approximately $20 million to partially delineate and develop the mineral deposit, including installations of mining materials handling equipment, marine loading facilities, and other infrastructure on the property. The quarry covers only 15 acres, but the entire property covers 572 acres of patented mining ground and includes all operating permits and tideland leases. Less than 10% of the acreage has been explored, and geologic mapping suggests substantially more resources exist on the property. The property has been in a “care and maintenance” mode since 2005 while we pursued additional capital, potential partners, and calcium carbonate product customers that would facilitate restarting quarry operations. Improved global economic conditions in the future should stimulate demand for calcium carbonate which is a key ingredient in over 1,200 products including paper and paints. Industrial minerals projects such as Calder must be competitive with other producers in terms of quality, volume, and CIF pricing to gain customers. Calder’s seaside location and marine loading facilities offer a distinct competitive advantage.
In 2009, Select continued negotiations with prospective buyers for calcium carbonate who had obtained product quality tests from outside parties. These tests confirmed the extremely high quality of the calcium carbonate in the size range of over ten microns and also better quantified the reduced whiteness and brightness for the two micron size fraction. In 2010, we are pursuing options to monetize Calder, including: 1) redevelopment of the quarry; 2) outright sale or lease; 3) joint venture; or a combination of these three options.
