We receive rent from tenants who have vacated but are still obligated under their lease terms, which results in economic occupancy ranging from 83% to 100% at December 31, 2005, for each of these centers.
(b)
In connection with the purchase of several investment properties, we, from time to time, receive payments under master lease agreements covering space vacant at the time of acquisition. The payments will be made to us for a period ranging from one to two years from the date of acquisition of the property or until the vacant space is leased and tenants begin paying rent. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") require us to treat these payments as a reduction to the purchase price of the investment properties upon receipt of the payment, rather than as rental income. As of December 31, 2005, we had three investment properties, Woodfield Commons, located in Schaumburg, Illinois, Orland Park Place I & II, located in Orland Park, Illinois and Greentree Center, located in Caledonia, Wisconsin subject to master lease agreements.
(c)
These properties are owned through joint ventures. See footnote 3 to the financial statements for further information regarding our joint ventures.
