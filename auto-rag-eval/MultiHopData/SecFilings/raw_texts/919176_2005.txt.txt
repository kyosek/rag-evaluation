Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The Company markets its products under the tradename of DAKOTACARE. Its products include group managed health care products, such as HMO products, and cafeteria plan administration and workers compensation managed care services. The Company's subsidiary, DAS, provides managed care and claims administration services for self-insured employer groups. The Company's subsidiary, DIL, accepts reinsurance risk on certain of DAS's self-funded and insured customers' life and stop-loss insurance policies. The Company is currently in process of dissolving DIL. As clients of DIL renew coverage for their stop-loss, their risk sharing agreements with DIL are being cancelled. All contracts currently in force which include DIL as a risk bearer, will end no later than January 1, 2006. Typically, there is a "runout" period for existing claims to enter the system, but the amounts are estimated in a claims payable account. It is expected that DIL will dissolve in 2006. The Company and its DAS subsidiary market their products through a network of independent insurance agents throughout South Dakota.
The Company contracts with over 98% of the physicians in the state of South Dakota, 100% of the hospitals in the state of South Dakota, and many other health care providers to provide medical services to its enrollees. At June 30, 2005, the Company's HMO medical care enrollment was approximately 29,900, while its DAS subsidiary had medical care enrollment of approximately 71,400. The Company also offers ancillary products and the resulting exclusive enrollment under the HMO was approximately 1,600, while its DAS subsidiary had combined ancillary product exclusive enrollment of approximately 6,200. The resulting total population served by the Company through any of its products resulted in approximately 109,100 members at June 30, 2005.

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005 AND JUNE 30, 2004
General The Company's net income was $1,597,689 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $1,720,645 for the three months ended June 30, 2004, which represents a decrease of $122,956, or 7.1%. The resulting decrease in net income was primarily due to the increase in total operating expenses resulting from increased claims expense to a greater amount than the increase in revenues. Total revenues increased $1,288,715 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004, while total operating expenses increased $1,508,189 for the same comparable periods. The provision for income taxes decreased $88,294 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004.
Revenues Total revenues increased $1,288,715, or 5.9%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. The revenues from the net premiums generated by the HMO segment increased $1,411,359, or 7.2%. This increase is attributable to a increase in the premiums earned per enrollee of 10.2%, but was partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in the number of enrollment months for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Revenues from the TPA fees decreased by $2,961, or 0.2%, due to a decrease in enrollment months of approximately 2.0% and was partially offset by an increase of fees generated per employee and additional services provided for the groups.
Investment income increased $140,151 or 164.4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Average yield on investments for the HMO, which comprises the majority of the investment income, increased 119.7%, while average invested assets increased 18.8%. Yields increased due to rising rates in our repurchase agreements and the further diversification into other long and short term investments which earn higher rates than the money funds. No equity positions were added to the portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the reinsurance segment of $299,029, or 77.5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This decrease is a result of the non-renewal of the risk sharing agreements with certain stop-loss clients in the effort to dissolve the subsidiary in the future.
Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased $1,508,189, or 7.8%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This was due to an increase in claims incurred, personnel expenses, and professional fee expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commissions and occupancy expenses.
Net claims expense generated by the HMO segment increased $1,628,009, or 10.7%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Average claims expense per enrollee increased 13.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004, while the number of enrollment months decreased 2.7%. Personnel expense increased $180,992, or 11.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This is due primarily to annual pay increases of approximately 5%, which were effective as of June 1, 2005. During the second quarter various executive officers were promoted and a new executive position was created and filled by a new employee. The personnel expense for the three months ended June 30, 2005 also includes an accrual for estimated bonuses, which attributed approximately 5% of the difference when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. Professional fees increased $72,135, or 34.8%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004, due primarily to the increase in fees due to legal, accounting and consulting costs associated with the Company's going private transaction. Commissions decreased $132,784, or 15.9%, for the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004. The commissions earned in the HMO and TPA lines of business increased slightly. The HMO segment's commissions were 3.1% and 3.2% of net premiums, for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The TPA segment's commissions were 2.6% and 2.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reinsurance segment's commissions decreased $146,295 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 when compared to June 30, 2004, primarily due to the decreasing activity while groups are terminating their coverage at renewals. Occupancy expense decreased $31,011, or 16.7%, due to decreases in depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004.
Income Taxes Income tax expense or benefit should represent 35.0% of income, but fluctuates each period due to adjustments for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and permanent tax differences. For the three months ended June 30, 2005, the income tax provision represented 32.9% of the income before taxes and minority interest. The changes in the components of the deferred tax assets accounted for the provision to vary as a percentage. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is also effected by the income or losses incurred by a subsidiary which has no prior cumulative taxable income from which to recover the taxes. Even though the subsidiary files within the consolidated tax return, cumulative losses are nondeductible due to an agreement signed with the government of the foreign subsidiary, which prohibits the deductions until income is produced by the subsidiary. A significant portion of the Company's valuation allowance was reversed in 2004 and the Company anticipates that future income tax expense will be close to the expected 35% effective tax rate.
COMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005 AND JUNE 30, 2004
General The Company's net income was $1,825,607 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $3,568,232 for the six months ended June 30, 2004, which represents a decrease of $1,742,625, or 48.8%. The resulting decrease in net income was primarily due to the increase in total operating expenses to a greater amount than the increase in revenues. Total revenues increased $1,707,713 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004, while total operating expenses increased $3,371,598 for the comparable periods. The provision for income taxes increased $82,871 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004.
Revenues Total revenues increased $1,707,713, or 3.8%, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. The revenues from the net premiums generated by the HMO segment increased $1,857,914, or 4.6%. This increase is attributable to a increase in the premiums earned per enrollee of 9.7%, but was partially offset by a 4.6% decrease in the number of enrollment months for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Revenues from the TPA fees increased by $79,610, or 2.9%, due to an increase in fees generated per employee and additional services provided for the groups. This was partially offset by the decrease in membership months for medical coverage member months of approximately 2.1%. Investment income increased $206,926 or 114.7%, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Average yield on investments for the HMO, which comprises the majority of the investment income, increased 74.3%, while average invested assets increased 20.9%. Yields increased due to rising rates in our repurchase agreements and the further diversification into other long and short term investments which earn higher rates than the money funds. No equity positions were added to the portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the Reinsurance segment of $491,921, or 72.2%, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This decrease is a result of the non-renewal of the risk sharing agreements with certain stop-loss clients in the effort to dissolve the subsidiary in the future.
Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased $3,371,598, or 8.5%, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This was due to an increase in claims incurred, personnel expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commissions, advertising, and occupancy expenses.
Net claims expense generated by the HMO segment increased $3,716,379, or 11.8%. Average claims expense per enrollee increased 17.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004, while the number of enrollment months decreased 4.6%. Personnel expense increased $254,380, or 8.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. This is due primarily to annual pay increases of approximately 5%. Since salary reviews and increases have occurred each June 1 at approximately 5% per year, each year's year-to-date amounts are consistently higher by 5%. Also, a bonus and related benefits accrual totaling $119,500 has been accrued at June 30, 2005, compared to $0 for June 30, 2004. Other General and administrative expenses increased $145,883, or 20.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Licenses and fee costs increased $100,004, or 71.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004.
Additional technology has continued to be purchased to enhance the overall medical management and information systems related to the development of the internal information sharing and processing. Recruitment, promotions and education expenses increase a collective $68,801 from a minimal amount when compared to the same period of the prior year. The Company has increased the internal education process to strive for developing personnel to the best of their ability. The Company has also been more active in recruiting local and national talent for staffing needs. Travel and meeting expenses increased $23,585, or 83.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, when compared to June 30, 2004. Additional travel and meetings have been required in Connection with the Company's going-private transaction. Also, the Company is focused on increasing TPA revenues, which can be marketing both within and outside the State of South Dakota. The increases in the various accounts has been partially offset by the decrease in insurance expense for the six months ended June 30, 2005, when compared to June 30, 2004. The amount of decrease is $110,162 or 37.1%. The main factor involved was the lower renewal rates received, which resulted from a year of no claims and the fact that the subsidiary Carewest was dissolved in the fourth quarter of 2004. Commissions decreased $161,296, or 9.7%, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004. It is comprised of a $182,988 decrease from the reinsurance segment, with the difference of $21,692 accounted for in the HMO and TPA segments. As described earlier, the Company is in process of terminating the operations of its reinsurance segment and is not renewing groups covered. This has led to declined revenues and the related commission expense. The HMO segment's commissions were 3.3% and 3.4% of net premiums, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The TPA segment's commissions as a percentage of ASO Fees and stop-loss commissions were 4.6% and 4.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Occupancy expense decreased $69,142, or 16.6%, due to decreases in depreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004. Advertising costs decreased by $77,751 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004. Although the overall 2005 advertising budget increased, the spending and timing of the advertising is dependent on the advertising agency's decisions for specific placements of ads. Management expects that the overall fees for the fiscal year will increase despite the decrease for the first six months.
Income Taxes Income tax expense or benefit should represent 35.0% of income, but fluctuates each period due to adjustments for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and permanent tax differences. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the income tax provision represented 36.3% of the income before taxes and minority interest. The changes in the components of the deferred tax assets accounted for the provision to vary as a percentage. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is also effected by the income or losses incurred by a subsidiary which has no prior cumulative taxable income from which to recover the taxes. Even though the subsidiary files within the consolidated tax return, cumulative losses are nondeductible due to an agreement signed with the government of the foreign subsidiary, which prohibits the deductions until income is produced by the subsidiary. A significant portion of the Company's valuation allowance was reversed in 2004 and the Company anticipates that future income tax expense will be close to a 35% effective tax rate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's principal sources of cash have been premium and fee revenue, collection of premiums in advance of the claims costs associated with them, and an agreement with participating physicians in which a percentage of fees for services is withheld for cash flows of the Company. The Company in the past has had borrowings from banks and affiliated companies, but currently does not need to borrow for liquidity purposes.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $967,652 to $3,460,761 for the six months ended June 30, 2005, as compared to June 30, 2004. Cash provided by operations was mainly attributed to net income, the decrease in deferred income taxes and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and contingency reserves payable. The increases in cash were partially offset by decreases in cash due to the increase in receivables and prepaids and other assets, and the decrease in unearned premiums. The decrease in deferred income taxes resulted from the change in deferred items expected to be realized and the net change from the prior year. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses from the prior year end relate to fluctuations that occur throughout the year. Contingency reserve payables increased from the continued withholding of 15% of physicians' claims expenses. No contingency reserves payments have been made in 2005. Receivables increased since December 31, 2004, and were due to normal business fluctuations in the accounts. Prepaids and other assets increased since the prior year end due to the payment of insurance premiums in January for which coverage extends through September, 2005. The decrease in unearned premiums and administration fees and accounts payable and accrued expenses from the prior year end relate to fluctuations that occur throughout the year.
Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $6,127,606 to $7,398,646 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to June 30, 2004. The investment of funds to the South Dakota State Medical Association as a real estate mortgage investment in the amount of $3,490,000 and the investment of short term treasuries in the amount of $3,999,000 composed the majority of the use of funds. The use of funds was reduced by the maturation of approximately $371,000 of long term bonds and the maturation of $100,000 of certificates of deposit in excess of those purchased. Equipment purchases also increased the use of funds by approximately $378,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2005.
The Company is not contractually obligated to pay out the contingency reserves withheld. No dividends have been declared or paid for the six months ended June 30, 2005. Future dividend payments are dependent on operations and liquidity of the Company. The Company believes that cash flows generated by operations, withholding of contingency reserves payable, cash on hand, and short-term investment balances will be sufficient to fund operations, pay out the projected contingency reserves payable, and pay dividends on the common stock. Even though cash flows may provide for the payment of dividends and contingency reserves, the Board of Directors determines the amounts to be paid, subject to approval from the South Dakota Division of Insurance. Risk based capital requirements, budgeted cash expenditures and a number of other factors may influence the Board's decision for these payments.
The Company has approved a going-private transaction in which, among other things, the Company will effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock and pay cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Company expects to pay approximate $5.2 million to complete the reverse stock split transaction and expects to do so without any outside financing. The Company does not expect this transaction to effect its ability to satisfy is operating cash requirements.
INFLATION
A substantial portion of the Company's operating expenses consist of health care costs, which, in the general economy, have been rising at a rate greater than that of the overall Consumer Price Index. The Company believes that its cost control measures and risk sharing arrangements reduce the effect of inflation on such costs. Historically, market conditions and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates have permitted the Company to offset a portion or all of the impact of inflation on the cost of health care benefits through premium increases. If the Company was not able to continue to increase premiums, a material adverse impact on the Company's operations could result. Inflation has not had a material effect on the remainder of the Company's operating expenses.
TRENDS, EVENTS, OR UNCERTAINTIES
In recent years, there has been a trend by clients to switch to plans with higher employee cost-sharing levels in order to maintain lower premiums. As a provider of cost effective managed care plans for medium and small employers, the Company believes it is delivering products and services that address current health care reform issues. The Company will continue to evaluate its business strategy as necessary to maximize its ability to adapt to the changing health care marketplace.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to its 2004 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Estimates are used extensively in determining the claims liability at the date of the balance sheet. The information used to determine the liability is historical data, current enrollment levels and other trends as they may apply. The liability is then adjusted to a number which represents management's best estimate at that time. The actual liability may change continuously for 18 months, but becomes more determinable as the length of time increases from the balance sheet date. There were no material changes made to the Company's critical accounting estimates or assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of those estimates and assumptions.
