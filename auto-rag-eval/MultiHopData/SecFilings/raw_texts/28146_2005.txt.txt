OVERVIEW
In late January 2005, the Company refocused its efforts to skin care formulations and sales. On July 1, 2005, the Company purchased CRI, Inc. and BRI, Inc., related companies providing both skin care formulation consulting and a newly started contract manufacturing business. The Company believes that the vertical capabilities added by this acquisition will be beneficial to the Company as it expands beyond its historical base.
In January 2006, the Company was granted U.S. Patent Number 6,984,391 for its Compositions and Method for Delivery of Skin Cosmeceuticals, which also applies to a new acne treatment system. The Company believes that this unique emulsion system has significant advantages over the widely used surfactant emulsions employed by most skin care formulators and manufacturers, and will seek licensing opportunities whenever possible.
In November 2003, the Company was granted a patent on its new oxygenation technology that provides a method for delivering oxygen into the skin and tissue at depths considered medically therapeutic. This unique technology utilizes topical applications, eliminating reliance on the blood steam. Preliminary research was conducted at the University of Massachusetts and Florida Atlantic University and the process to obtain FDA approval was initiated. Management plans to research additional medical applications if and when Hydron obtains FDA approval.
The Company raised $1.1 million in December 2003 in a non-brokered private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act to fund the initial research and initiate the lengthy FDA approval process. As research results begin to quantify the broad applications of this technology and the FDA hurdles are passed, management anticipates that Hydron will attract key strategic partners and new investment money will become available. Management also expects that product development will accelerate in medical areas such as wound and burn treatment, and skin care applications such as scar reduction, acne, and diaper rash treatment, oral health, etc.
In 2002 the Company virtually eliminated sales made through television retailers, having terminated the exclusive relationship with HSN in late 2001, and as revenues derived from resales by QVC to prior customers declined. Management expects that in 2005 and beyond, an increasing portion of the Company's skin care sales will be generated from direct marketing utilizing direct response mail, the Company's catalog and web site, and licensing arrangements. Management also expects that the Company will generate an increasing portion of its revenues from sales made through private label partners and will look for other opportunities to sell the Company's products through similar arrangements. Management anticipates introducing new cosmetic products based on its oxygenation technology, which it believes will open doors for new distribution. However, the types and timing of the introduction of new cosmetic products will depend upon the results of further clinical testing.
In August 2004, Hydron Technologies, Inc. (Hydron), as general partner, formed Hydron Royalty Partners, LLLP (Partners) a Limited Liability Limited Partnership for the purpose of funding existing royalty obligations and a portion of future royalty obligations in consideration of sharing future royalty income that may arise from Hydron's agreement with Valera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Valera). Partners has completed a non-brokered private placement of Limited Partnership Interest to ten accredited investors including Hydron's Chairman, Richard Banakus and a Hydron Director, Ronald J. Saul. Each limited partner invested $30,000 or an aggregate of $300,000 for a 49.999% interest in Partners. The establishment of Partners allowed Hydron to meet its current and future royalty obligations and retain the possibility of a significant royalty income stream opportunity.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2005 VERSUS 2004
Total net sales for 2005 were $1,462,639, an increase of $277,225 or 23% from net sales of $1,185,416 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Catalog Sales net sales for 2005 were $679,901, a decrease of $139,134 or 17% from sales of $819,035 for 2004. Private Label and Contract Manufacturing net sales for 2005 were $667,514, an increase of $438,273 or 191% from sales of $229,241 for 2004. Professional sales consist of dental products sold to dental labs for use in manufacturing dentures. Net sales of dental products for 2005 were $13,868, a decrease of $4,654 or 25% from sales of $18,522 in 2004. Shipping and handling revenues for 2005 were $97,815, a decrease of $20,802 or 17% from shipping and handling revenues of $118,617 in 2004.
Catalog Sales decreased as the Company transferred its customer care center and upgraded the order taking systems and pick/pack operation in an effort to reduce operational costs. Additionally, the Company began work on the new website, which launched at the end of October of this year. During 2005 the Company went two months without being able to take orders on the Internet, which management feels may have reduced some of the anticipated sales. Private Label Manufacturing sales increased due to the acquisition of Clinical Results, Inc. on July 1, 2005. Clinical Results is in the early stages of its manufacturing facility and has helped contribute to the overall revenue.
Cost of sales was $731,083 for 2005, an increase of $205,766 or 39% from cost of sales of $525,317 for 2004. Cost of sales was 50% of total sales in 2005 compared to 44% in 2004. The increase in the cost of sales percentage reflects the impact of private label sales and an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment. Cost of sales for private label sales was in direct proportion to the sales level. The Company monitors its inventory levels closely and writes-down any inventory in excess of a one-year supply. Cost of sales include charges of $100,853 in 2005 to adjust inventories to a one-year supply valued at the lower of cost or realizable value on a FIFO basis. Similar charges for 2004 were $59,412. Cost increases are not material to catalog sales and the private label contracts provide for a pass through of any cost increases incurred in that segment. Shipping and handling costs for 2005 were $123,823, a decrease of $6,545 or 5% from shipping and handling costs of $130,368 for the same period in 2004. This decrease reflects the 17% decline in catalog sales plus savings realized by performing more of the shipping and handling tasks in house.
The Company's overall gross profit margin decreased to 50% of net sales for 2005 versus 56% for 2004. This reflects the costs discussed above, less the relative mix of higher margin catalog sales versus lower margin private label sales.
Royalty expenses in 2005 were $36,211 and $36,331 in 2004. An aggregate of $29,512 was accrued and unpaid as of December 31, 2005. This amount is adequate to cover any royalties that are payable through December 2005.
Research and development ("R&D") expenses reflect the Company's efforts to identify new product opportunities, obtain regulatory approval, develop and package the products for commercial sale, perform appropriate efficacy and safety tests, and conduct consumer panel studies and focus groups. R&D expenses were $55,037 in 2005, a decrease of $224,928 or 80% from R&D expenses of $279,965 in 2004. This decrease was due principally to the Company eliminating the use of outside FDA consultants in association with its oxygenation technology during 2005 versus 2004. The amount of annual R&D expenses will vary year to year depending on the Company's research requirements.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in 2005 were $1,358,867, representing an increase of $174,544 or 15% from SG&A expenses of $1,184,323 in 2004. Advertising and promotional expenses in 2005 were $80,729, an increase of $19,098 or 31% from advertising and promotional expenses of $61,631 in 2004. This increase is due to new advertising initiatives taken by the Company to increase sales. Sales commissions in 2005 were $968, a decrease of $10,322 or 91% from sales commissions of $11,290 in 2004. The decreased sales commissions reflect that sales are now handled by non-commissioned sales representatives. Professional expenses (legal and audit) were $166,032 in 2005, an increase of $42,581 or 34% from the $123,451 incurred in 2004. The increase in professional fees involved costs associated with the acquisition of CRI in 2005 offset by increases from a registration statement filed in July and the proxy statement for the shareholders meeting held November 15, 2004. Payroll expense was $462,973 in 2005, an increase of $21,164 or 5% from $441,809 in 2004. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Clinical Results, Inc. on July 1, 2005 which includes new management, office support, the moving of manufacturing and shipping in house, severance expense and operating two offices for two months. Moving expenses were $26,899 in 2005, an increase of $26,899 from $0 in 2004.This increase was due to the relocation of the Company's operations to the Clinical Results, Inc. manufacturing facility. Bad debts in 2005 were $40,560, an increase of $40,560 from $0 in 2004. This increase is due to the write off of certain receivables deemed uncollectible. All other expenses were $580,706 for 2005, an increase of $33,596 or 6% from $547,110 in 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $59,090 for 2005, an increase of $25,173 or 74% from $33,917 in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the amortization of the intangible of the purchase of CRI.
Net interest (expense) was ($29,730) in 2005 compared to net interest income of $3,749 in 2004. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the interest on the loan payable and related amortization of debt discount.
Minority interest in net loss in 2005 was $35,328 compare to $14,809 in 2004. This minority interest is created from a consolidated limited liability partnership, Hydron Royalty Partners, LLLP, established by the Company in August 2004 (see Limited Liability Partnership, Item 1. Business).
The Company had a net loss of $772,051, representing a decrease of $83,828 or 10% from the net loss of $855,879 for 2004, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company anticipates that present working capital balances and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next three months and maybe longer based on management decisions and order flow. Beyond that point, it may be necessary to sell selected assets, or obtain an infusion of capital. The Company's independent accountants issued a "going concern" opinion since the Company has incurred significant losses over the past five years and generates a negative cash flow on a monthly basis. The Company's working capital deficit was approximately ($188,416) at December 31, 2005, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $36,281. Cash used by operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $527,282 and $18,012 was used in investing activities. This was offset by proceeds from financing activities of $241,896.
The Company completed a non-brokered private placement of 1,750,000 Units at $.20 per Unit ($350,000) on December 10, 2002 to several accredited investors. Each Unit is comprised of one share of Common Stock and one three-year option to buy one additional common share at $.20.
On October 24, 2005 the Company received proceeds of $112,500 through the partial exercise of certain warrants relating to a previous private placement of its securities in December 2002. These funds were received from three individuals including two individuals who are (i) the Chairman of the Board and Interim President, and (ii) a second director of the Company.
On October 24, 2005, the Board of Directors of Hydron Technologies, Inc., a New York corporation (the "Company"), adopted a resolution authorizing the extension of options of the exercise period for certain options to purchase common stock (the "Options") granted in connection with a private placement of securities by the Company from December 9, 2005 to December 9, 2007 (the "New Expiration Date") in consideration of the agreement of certain holders to immediately exercise a portion of the Options and purchase the underlying common stock. The shares underlying the original Options were registered by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The shares of common stock underlying the Options totaled 1,750,000 shares or approximately 13.4% of the total outstanding shares of the Company.
Richard Banakus, the acting Chairman and a director, and Ronald J. Saul, a director of the Company, together with his spouse, Antonette G. Saul, are among the holders of the Options. Mr. Banakus assigned for nominal consideration certain of his Options exercisable for 250,000 shares to Mr. Saul and effective October 27, 2005 exercised Options representing an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock in consideration of the extension of the exercise period to the New Expiration Date for Options representing an aggregate of 750,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Saul exercised Options effective October 28, 2005, representing an aggregate of 250,000 shares and had Options representing an aggregate of 125,000 extended to the New Expiration Date. In addition, certain other holders of Options exercised Options representing an aggregate of 62,500 shares and had the exercise period for Options representing an aggregate of 62,500 shares extended to the New Expiration Date bringing the total number of shares represented by the new Options (the "New Options") exercisable at any time prior to the New Expiration Date to 937,500 or approximately 7.6% of the total outstanding shares.
Each party receiving New Options is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company issued the New Options without registration under the Securities Act in reliance on the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D and Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
The Company received no proceeds for the issuance of the New Options other than proceeds from the exercise of Options pursuant to the agreement of holders of Options to exercise certain Options and proceeds the Company may receive upon exercise of the New Options. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the exercise of the Options and the New Options for general working capital purposes.
On November 14, 2003, the Company completed a non-brokered private placement of 2,210,000 Units at $.50 per Unit ($1,105,000) to accredited investors. Each Unit is comprised of one share of Common Stock and one five-year warrant to buy one additional common share at $1.00. As of December 31, 2005, all 2,210,000 warrants are outstanding.
The Company registered these outstanding shares and the 4,481,500 underlying shares of outstanding warrants/options with the Securities and Exchange Commission effective July 22, 2004. The warrants/options are a future source of capital for the Company and could generate up to $3,106,270 if they are exercised.
The Company does not have any material debt other than the loan payable of $150,000 borrowed from three investors on May 2005 (see Note 11), and two capital leases for equipment purchases of $73,224. Effective August 5, 2005, the Company relocated its offices to St Petersburg, Fl. There are no capital expenditures under construction and no long-term commitments other than royalty payments under an agreement with Valera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Company does not have any lines of credit. There are no purchase order commitments that exceed 90 days.
The Company's independent accountants issued a "going concern" opinion since the Company has incurred significant losses over the past five years and generates a negative cash flow on a monthly basis. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon increasing sales, managing operating expenses and obtaining additional equity financing.
Management's plan includes implementing one or more of the following elements:
o Emphasize Catalog sales, including sales made over the Internet, since these sales have higher profit margins.
o Evaluate the possibilities of increasing direct marketing and direct response television exposure to build brand awareness and revenues.
o Team with third parties to build the advertising and promotion of the Hydron(R) brand, as the Company does not have the financial resources to sustain a national advertising campaign to support distribution of its production into retail stores.
o Develop and market new product lines based on the Company's proprietary technologies.
o Continue to reduce overhead and operating costs.
o Obtaining an infusion of capital that will sustain the Company's operation until the newly established licensing arrangements can produce positive cash flow.
There can be no assurances that management's plan will be successful and the Company's actual results could differ materially. No estimate has been made to the financial statements to account for the possibility that the plan may be unsuccessful.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision to SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), and superseding APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, including obtaining employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in increased compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations.
SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," was issued in May 2005 and replaces APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle in most instances and is required to be applied to all accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are significant in preparation of our financial statements.
ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS
The Company records product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Catalog sales are sold on a cash basis with a 30-day guarantee. Returns have been less than $10,000 annually for the last five years. A provision is made at the time sales are recognized for the estimated cost of product warranties. Private label sales are sold on account and are collected in 30 to 45 days. If there is a production or packaging problem, the Company would correct the problem and replace the product sold. To minimize that possibility, the Company inspects all production batches before they are packaged to insure quality, efficacy, and consistency.
INVENTORY VALUATION
Shifting sales from one item in our product line to another or minimum production requirements may create a situation where inventory levels of specific items may exceed the annual sales of that item. This can create inventory levels in excess of net realizable value. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and, where necessary, records provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either estimated forecast of product demand or historical usage of the product. If sales do not materialize as planned or decline below historic levels, management increases the reserve for excess (quantities in excess of one year's sales) and obsolete inventory. This would reduce earnings and cash flows.
Packaging changes are planned far in advance in order to limit the impact of out-dated or obsolete components. Private label customers are required to prepay the cost of packaging materials in order to take advantage of volume discounts and protect the Company from any sudden packaging changes.
ITEM 3.
