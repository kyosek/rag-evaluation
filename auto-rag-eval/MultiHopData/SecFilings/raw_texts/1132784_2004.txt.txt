ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
OIL AND GAS ASSETS
Our oil and gas activities have focused on the acquisition of unevaluated oil and gas properties and the drilling of exploratory wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana. In addition, exploration projects are underway in Texas and Europe.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (LEITER FIELD). Effective September 30, 2002, we entered into a lease acquisition and drilling agreement with Pioneer Oil, a Montana limited liability company ("Pioneer"), which entitled us to earn a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in leases covering 15,657 acres in the Powder River Basin, near Leiter, Wyoming. The project area is 20 to 30 miles west of the main north-south CBM fairway in Campbell County, Wyoming, and is approximately 9 miles west of the nearest established CBM production. Most of our acreage is positioned along roads and pipelines. There is 20-inch gas transmission line crossing our leased property, and U.S. Highway 14 runs through the project area and provides year-round access.
Ten producible coal seams have been identified throughout the lease area, which range from 10 feet to 35 feet in thickness and with depths of 600 to 2,500 feet below the surface. The primary targets are coal beds in the Fort Union Formation. Drilling depths range from 1,700 to 2,600 feet. The Fort Union Formation is expected to have about 130 feet of aggregate coal separated into 8 to 10 widely spaced beds. The coals are widespread and have a nearly continuous distribution. The successful implementation of multi-seam well completion technology and cost effective produced water management in accordance with existing established practices and requirements will greatly enhance results. Mud logs from the five existing wells on this property indicate the presence of gas in these coal seams. The mud log gas shows are consistent with other Fort Union coals in the western portion of the Powder River Basin. Based on historical production from other similar areas within this basin, which are producing gas from the same Fort Union Formation coals in approximately 11,000 active wells, we are optimistic that economically recoverable amounts of gas will be present here. However, we do not yet have any production tests from these wells on this property that substantiate the amount of gas, and we recognize that analogies drawn from available data from other wells or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects.
We have started a continuous drilling program into the potential productive seams and intend to maintain and develop the Leiter area as long as it produces marketable quantities of gas. We have determined that the initial target seams will be the Cook, Wall, and Pawnee seams at depths of 1,700 to 1,800 feet. These zones have exhibited the highest consistent gas shows in the area and comprise 35 to 40 feet of total coal across an interval of approximately 100 feet. Depending on pricing and water disposal capacity, an additional 70 to 80 feet of shallower prospective coal could be accessed through future perforations or by drilling additional wells to accelerate gas production.
To acquire the leases covering this acreage, we were required to pay and did pay $100,000 by January 31, 2003. We were required to pay $1,650,000 by October 1, 2003, deposit the estimated costs to drill and complete 30 pilot wells into an escrow account by October 1, 2003, and drill at least 25 pilot wells by March 1, 2004. The agreement also provided for the acquisition of a 100% interest in 5 natural gas wells, for $500,000, by October 1, 2003. Pioneer extended the obligations due October 1, 2003 to October 31, 2003, to allow for negotiation of a new agreement.
On December 22, 2003, we purchased Pioneer's position for $1,000,000 cash and 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.40 per share. By purchasing Pioneer's position, we are now the lessee under the leases and the owner of the 5 natural gas wells. These wells were drilled in late 2001, have been equipped with downhole production pumps, and one coal zone is partially dewatered. We expect to commence production from these 5 completed wells and several additional wells during the first calendar quarter of 2005. We do not have any estimates as to reserves attributed to these wells.
In October 2004, we acquired an additional 360 acres of oil and gas leases in the area adjacent to the existing lease holdings from the lessors for $150,000. We are now obligated to drill a total of 125 wells on the leased acreage by December 31, 2005 under the terms of an amended lease. If we fail to meet the 125-well drilling
commitment and are unable to negotiate a different outcome, we will retain our interest in only the 80 acres surrounding each well drilled as of December 31, 2005 and all remaining acreage will be forfeited.
In summary, through March 5, 2005, we purchased five existing non-producing natural gas wells, drilled 44 new wells and set seven-inch production casing in those wells, completed downhole work in most wells, installed gathering system and infrastructure to several wells, and commenced location surveying, permit procedures, and obtained surface use agreement approval for an additional portion of these leases.
On November 2, 2004, Dolphin executed a Coal Bed Methane Participation Agreement with Horizon Gas, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Horizon"). Horizon Gas, Inc. is also the general partner of two U.S. limited liability limited partnerships, Horizon Natural Gas, LP (Fund LP) and Horizon Natural Gas Investment LP (Investment LP). Another entity, Horizon Funds GmbH in Cologne, Germany coordinates the marketing in Germany and is in charge of handling the fund management and investor relations in Germany. The agreement is intended to provide funding for future projects in an area of mutual interest in the Powder River Basin located in Wyoming. Under the terms of the agreement, Horizon is given the right to participate, subject to funding, in an initial drilling program on identified oil and gas leases and a subsequent drilling program on currently unidentified oil and gas leases. Horizon will bear 90% of the costs to drill, complete, and connect each well in which it elects to participate in return for a 67.5% share of Dolphin's working interest in such wells. As of March 9, 2005, we do not know whether Horizon will participate.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (BUFFALO RUN, PIPELINE RIDGE, HORSE HILL AND DUTCH CREEK). In January 2004, we acquired an operating interest in 61 non-producing CBM wells and approximately 12,000 gross acres in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming (the "Continental acreage") from DAR, LLC, in consideration for 3,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock, valued at $1.80 per share, $163,655, and a note for $2,600,000 in future payments, which bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The original note called for $1,000,000 in principal to be paid on January 14, 2005 and the remaining $1,600,000 in principal to be paid on June 24, 2005. On January 14, 2005, we agreed with DAR, LLC that the payments due on January 14, 2005 and June 24, 2005 would be deferred. In return for $100,000 in consideration for such deferral, which was paid on January 21, 2005, we paid DAR, LLC $500,000 in accrued interest and principal on March 3, 2005, and will now pay $1,600,000 in principal on August 19, 2005 and all remaining accrued interest and principal on January 13, 2006.
In March 2004, we acquired the remaining 35% working interest in the Buffalo Run project for $592,464. In April 2004, we acquired the remaining 50% working interest in the Dutch Creek project for $300,000 and 360,000 restricted shares of our common stock, valued at $2.63 per share. As a result of these acquisitions, we have a 100% working interest in the Buffalo Run and Dutch Creek projects.
This property is located approximately 12 miles southeast of Sheridan, Wyoming, and is divided into four CBM exploration projects: Buffalo Run, Pipeline Ridge, Horse Hill, and Dutch Creek. The project area contains up to eight separate coals, ranging in depth from 150 feet to 1,800 feet. Coal thickness ranges from 20 feet to 70 feet, generally thinning with depth. We estimate that full development of this project area would include the drilling of up to 280 wells, with up to four coal zone completions per well.
The four projects are in the early implementation stages with 101 wells drilled to various depths as of March 4, 2005. Of these 67 have been completed and approximately three-fourths of those exhibit shut-in gas pressures at the wellhead while the remaining wells have all had significant gas shows during drilling and completion operations. While these outcomes indicate that these wells will be productive, only a portion of these wells has been stimulated and placed on production. Contracts for electrical power supply have been executed with two utilities, Powder River Energy and Montana Dakota Utilities, and construction is nearly complete in the Pipeline Ridge area. A gas gathering agreement for pipeline access was executed to serve the Pipeline Ridge area, and the associated compression facility is expected to be operational approximately March 31, 2005. The gathering infrastructure has been completed in the Pipeline Ridge area, and 31 production wells have been connected and are awaiting the compressor.
We propose to accomplish water disposal in these areas without surface discharge through re-injection, use of high volume evaporators, and off-channel storage ponds. Injectivity tests have been performed to confirm that certain water sands will accommodate a significant volume of water injection. This method of water disposal has
been implemented in several CBM projects, and has been approved by the regulatory authorities for injection wells on our projects.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (BEAVER CREEK). In April 2004, we acquired various working interests in approximately 27,000 net acres adjacent to, and in the vicinity of, the Leiter and Continental acreage. The acquisition price for these new interests was $739,550. This project is also in the early implementation stage with 23 wells drilled to various depths as of March 4, 2005. Of these, 7 have been completed, but are not yet connected to a gathering system. We are developing plans to include these 23 wells in expanded production pilot projects, which are then expected to be followed by full development of the related areas.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (GLASGOW AND WEST RECLUSE). In June 2004, we entered into a letter of intent to acquire approximately 4,400 net acres of oil and gas leases in Campbell and Converse Counties. Under the terms of the agreement, we committed to pay 100% of the cost to drill 12 wells on the acreage, to earn a 50% interest in those wells along with a 50% working interest in 9 existing wells, 7 of which have been completed. We paid the seller $100,000 and obtained an option to acquire, for an additional $1,900,000, a 90% working interest in the entire leasehold acreage including all wells on the property. On September 30, 2004, having drilled 16 wells on the acquired acreage and completed our drilling obligation, we exercised our option to acquire the additional working interest in the wells and a 90% working interest in the leasehold acreage in the prospects, and paid approximately $1,886,000 for these interests after closing adjustments. As of March 4, 2005, a total of 40 wells have been drilled on the acreage, 37 of which have been completed. Of these wells, 17 were producing gas at various levels of production as they continue to dewater.
OUTSOURCED WYOMING OPERATOR. We executed a contract with Continental Industries, LC, an affiliate of DAR, LLC, to act as contract operator on our Wyoming Powder River Basin leases. Continental, a privately-held exploration and production company based in Casper, Wyoming, was among the first CBM participants in the Powder River Basin and has extensive CBM experience. Since 1999, Continental has implemented 10 CBM projects with over 340 wells. We are compensating Continental under the terms and provisions of a contract operator agreement with normal industry standard rates for personnel and expenses.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - MONTANA. On August 5, 2003, we entered into a Lease Option and Acquisition Agreement with Quaneco, L.L.C. ("Quaneco"), a privately-held oil and gas company operating primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. Under the terms of the agreement, we had an option to acquire up to 50% of Quaneco's 50% working interest in certain oil and gas leases covering approximately 214,000 gross acres in the Powder River Basin area of Montana. In 2003 and 2004, we made payments totaling $3,387,500, thereby acquiring a 12.5% working interest. On September 1, 2005, we determined not to increase our working interest position beyond our existing 12.5% and no further payments are due under the agreement.
The primary geologic target associated in the acreage is natural gas from shallow coal beds located at depths of 200 feet to 2,500 feet. Multiple coal seams are present in this prospect area, with a total coal thickness of approximately 100 feet. There are several surface structures and faults in the prospect area that were mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Montana Bureau of Mines. We believe that these structural features are expected to enhance the CBM gas production. Data used in defining the prospect area was taken from these agencies, as well as information from abandoned deeper oil and gas wells drilled in the area. CBM gas production has been established approximately 6 miles south of the area where cumulative production to date is about 20 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
This acreage is divided into two projects: the Kirby prospect and the Castle Rock prospect. Galaxy is currently participating in the first phase of a planned exploration for the Kirby Area. Operations are underway for an initial 18 well pilot and field facilities construction have begun. A second pilot project is scheduled to begin this year in the Castle Rock project. Negotiations are underway for construction of gas sales pipeline projects to both of these areas.
PICEANCE BASIN - COLORADO. On March 2, 2005, Dolphin deposited $7,000,000 in escrow as a condition precedent to an agreement to acquire an initial 58-1/3% working interest in 4,000 net undeveloped mineral acres in the Piceance Basin in Colorado. The terms of the acquisition are set forth in a Lease Acquisition and Development Agreement with Apollo Energy LLC and ATEC Energy Ventures, LLC, the Sellers. The Sellers were not willing to
enter into the Agreement with Dolphin without having some agreement regarding the remaining 41-2/3% working interest in the subject properties. Since our management and advisers had previously decided that our maximum commitment should not exceed that provided in the Agreement, it was necessary to find a third party to take the remaining working interest, and Marc A. Bruner, a related party (see Item 13.), was willing to provide a guaranteed payment of $2,000,000 to the Sellers and enter into an agreement with the Sellers to acquire a 16-1/3% working interest for such $2,000,000 with the option to acquire up to all of the then remaining 25% working interest in the subject properties by investing an additional $3,000,000. If Mr. Bruner invests the entire $5,000,000, his total working interest in the properties will be 41-2/3%. Mr. Bruner and Dolphin entered into a Participation Agreement to address certain rights and obligations as between them, pertaining to their acquisition agreements with the Sellers. Marc A. Bruner is a significant shareholder of Galaxy Energy Corporation, Chairman of Galaxy's Advisory Committee, and the father of Marc E. Bruner, the president and a director of Galaxy.
Under the Participation Agreement, Marc A. Bruner has the right, but not the obligation to deposit up to an additional $25,000,000 into escrow on or before August 1, 2005, while Dolphin has the right, but not the obligation, to deposit up to an additional $3,000,000 into escrow on or before December 1, 2005. Dolphin and Mr. Bruner have agreed that their respective ownership interests shall be based upon the amounts deposited into escrow and used to acquire the leases. Therefore, if both Dolphin and Mr. Bruner contribute their maximum amounts, their ownership interests in the leases will be Dolphin 25% and Bruner 75%.
Under the acquisition agreements with the Sellers, Dolphin and Mr. Bruner are obligated to drill one well by November 1, 2005 and 9 additional wells by August 22, 2006. If they should fail to drill any of the 9 wells, they are obligated to pay Sellers $500,000 for each well as liquidated damages or they are to reassign to Sellers any of the acreage covered by the leases that remains undrilled.
Dolphin and Mr. Bruner have agreed that each shall be responsible for its/his respective share of the cost of operations in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, with such share based on the ownership interest at the time the cost is incurred.
Dolphin and Mr. Bruner have also agreed that for the first 36 months of operations under the operating agreement, Bruner shall assign all of his rights and obligations as operator, such that Dolphin shall be the contract operator or sub-operator under the operating agreement, and that Dolphin shall be entitled to a management fee of 10% of its costs as operator.
Sellers will reserve in the assignment of the leases either a reserved production payment or a reserved overriding royalty interest, each equal to the difference between 20% and existing burdens, but never less than 2%. At project payout, Sellers are vested with an undivided 12 1/2% of our interest in the leases.
EAST TEXAS. We have paid-up leases covering approximately 2,780 acres in the vicinity of the Trawick Field, located in Rusk and Nacogdoches Counties, Texas. Leases covering approximately 1,118 acres are for a three-year term expiring in late 2005 and early 2006, while the leases covering the remaining approximately 1,662 acres are for a five-year term expiring in 2007.
All of the leases were originally held by Harbor Petroleum, LLC or Florida Energy, Inc. on behalf of Dolphin, but have been assigned to Dolphin. Both Harbor Petroleum, LLC and Florida Energy, Inc. are related parties. See "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." In March 2004, Dolphin paid Florida Energy a bonus of $50,000 for identifying this lease play.
In 2005, we propose to drill a vertical wellbore through the deepest potential Travis Peak sandstone in the first specific prospect area we are targeting.
JIU VALLEY - ROMANIA. Pannonian International has a concession agreement covering 21,538 gross acres for a term of 30 years in the Jiu Valley Coal Basin, Romania. Of this area, only 13,715 acres that are underlain by total coalbed thicknesses greater than 5 meters are considered to be prospective for coalbed methane production at this time. This acreage contains up to 18 coal seams with a cumulative thickness up to 170 feet at depths of 985 to 3,280 feet. The main target seam averages 22 meters in thickness in the concession area. The concession from the Romanian government was issued October 22, 2002. During the first five years of the concession, the concession
holder is required to expend a specified amount for exploratory work. If that specified amount is not spent, the concession holder must pay that amount to the Romanian government. If no payment is made, the concession is cancelled. Pannonian's minimum exploration expenditure commitments are as follows: o $252,000 by October 21, 2005 o $182,000 by October 21, 2006 o $182,000 by October 21, 2007
Pannonian has satisfied its requirements through November 30, 2004.
Pannonian proposes to drill two wells in 2005, as Pannonian management believes that it has two drill sites in close proximity to where earlier wells have blown out methane. These drill sites are approximately 1.5 miles from a 20-inch gas trunk pipeline, and is approximately the same distance from an electrical generation plant that uses both natural gas and coal as fuel. Pannonian estimates that it would cost approximately $475,000 to test and complete each well as a producing well.
Pannonian has applied for a concession on an additional 120,000 acres in Romania and has identified further European license areas for which it is in the application process.
NEUES BERGLAND - GERMANY. In December 2003, the 149,435-acre Neues Bergland Exploration Permit was granted for a three-year term to Pannonian International (50%) and two co-permittees (each with 25%). Both of the co-permittees are privately-held oil and gas companies that are not affiliated with us. Under the terms of the permit, we and our co-permittees have the exclusive right to explore for natural resources within the permit area, subject to the obtaining the approval from third-party landowners. Permit holders must pay field taxes by May 31 of each year for the previous calendar year. Permit holders can deduct from field taxes those expenditures incurred by the permit holder that were necessary to obtain geophysical, geochemical, petrological or reservoir data, such as geophysical work with processing, drilling operations, reprocessing work, and fracturing with the goal of transforming a non-producing into a producing reservoir. The field taxes for 2003 and 2004 have been paid.
The permit requires the drilling of an initial exploration test borehole during 2005. The estimated cost of phase one of this work program, which consists of building the drillsite, drilling and testing the first exploration test borehole, evaluating the borehole with a long-term flow-test program, evaluating the test results, and re-evaluating the economic, environmental, regulatory, and technical issues is $2,200,000. Our current plan is to proceed with phase one only if we can obtain the necessary funding through a farm-out arrangement. The costs incurred in connection with phase one would offset all of the field taxes for 2005.
The initial drill site is approximately two miles from a local gas distribution grid (8" pipeline) and about 7 miles from a 38", 1000 pounds per square inch, international trunk pipeline.
PRODUCTIVE GAS WELLS
The following summarizes our productive and shut-in gas wells as of November 30, 2004. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Shut-in wells are wells that are capable of production but are currently not producing. Gross wells are the total number of wells in which we have a working interest. Net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in the gross wells.

OIL AND GAS ACREAGE
The following table sets forth the undeveloped and developed leasehold acreage, by area, held by us as of November 30, 2004. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Developed acres are acres, which are spaced or assignable to productive wells. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which we have a working interest. Net acreage is obtained by multiplying gross acreage by our working interest percentage in the properties. The table does not include acreage in which we have a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which we have not yet received leasehold assignments.

PRESENT ACTIVITIES
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (GLASGOW AND WEST RECLUSE). Eight of the 15 new wells in the Glasgow area that commenced dewatering in early November 2004 started producing gas very quickly, and production rates have continued to increase. As of March 4, 2005, the remaining 7 wells which are completed as lower zone Wyodak producers continue to dewater.
Nine wells are producing gas to the sales pipeline in the West Recluse area. Construction of the gathering system and required infrastructure required to hook the 15 additional completed wells into the sales pipeline is expected to be completed by March 31, 2005. All of the new wells will begin dewatering before the end of April 2005.
As of March 4, 2005, gas production from these two areas was approximately 600 mcf per day. Gas production levels are expected to increase as dewatering operations continue.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (PIPELINE RIDGE). As of March 4, 2005, 31 production wells and 5 water disposal wells have been drilled and completed in this area southeast of Sheridan, Wyoming. Five additional wells
have been started with only surface casing in place. Although winter operating conditions have slowed work in this area, gathering system and infrastructure facilities have been completed to all of these new wells over the last few months. Six of these wells have commenced testing and dewatering operations, and all remaining wells are expected to do the same before the end of March 2005. Installation of a compressor station to handle gas sales into the adjacent Bighorn pipeline is nearing completion.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (LEITER FIELD). As of March 4, 2005, these two areas contained 49 completed wells. Construction of gathering systems and field facilities for both areas are in various stages of completion. The first 3wells in the Leiter area have begun testing and dewatering. All other production wells are expected to begin testing and dewatering before the end of June 2005.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - WYOMING (BUFFALO RUN, BEAVER CREEK, HORSE HILL AND DUTCH CREEK). As of March 4, 2005, these 4 areas now contain 38 completed wells and 45 additional wells in various stages of completion. Negotiations are underway for the necessary pipeline extension to access 60 of these wells, which will then allow the construction of gathering system infrastructure and the drilling of additional new wells in 2005 to develop multiple deeper coal zones. We are also developing plans to include 23 previously drilled wells in expanded pilot projects, which are then expected to be followed by full development of the related properties.
POWDER RIVER BASIN - MONTANA. In the southern Montana portion of the Powder River Basin, Galaxy is participating in the first phase of a planned exploration for the Kirby Area. Operations are underway on an initial eighteen well pilot program. Sixteen of these wells have been drilled and field facilities construction has begun. A second pilot project is scheduled to begin this year in the Castle Rock area of southern Montana. Negotiations are underway for construction of gas sales pipeline projects to both of these areas.
The following table summarizes the status of completed wells as of March 4, 2005:
