Item 2. Properties
Turkey
General. As of December 31, 2014, we held interests in 19 onshore and offshore exploration licenses and 20 onshore production leases covering a total of approximately 1.8 million gross acres (approximately 1.1 million net acres) in Turkey. We acquired our interests in Turkey through acquisitions, as well as through farm-in agreements with existing third-party license holders and through applications submitted to the Turkish General Directorate for Petroleum Affairs (the “GDPA”), the agency responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas activities under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Turkey.
The following map shows our interests in Turkey:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2014, we had total net proved reserves of 14,406 Mbbl of oil and 16,254 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 11,432 Mbbl of oil and 23,794 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 12,028 Mbbl of oil and 76,739 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey.
Equipment Yards. As of December 31, 2014, we leased equipment yards in Muratli, Diyarbakir and Tekirdag and owned equipment yards at Selmo and Edirne.
Commercial Terms. Turkey’s fiscal regime for oil and natural gas licenses is presently comprised of royalties and income tax. The royalty rate is 12.5% and the corporate income tax rate is 20%. Our revenue from the Selmo oil field is subject to an additional 10% royalty, which is offset by the amount of exploration expense that TEMI and DMLP, the owners of our interest in the Selmo oil field, incur in Turkey. If those exploration expenses do not equal or exceed the amount of this additional 10% royalty, we would owe the difference. Dividends repatriated from Turkey would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 15% unless reduced by a tax treaty. There is also an 18% value added tax. However, for exploration licenses, no value added tax is assessed on drilling, completion, workover, seismic and geologic activities.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Turkey for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in three stages: permit, license and lease. Under a permit, the government grants the non-exclusive right to conduct a geological investigation over an area. The size of the area and the term of the permit are subject to the discretion of the GDPA. A new petroleum law was passed by the Turkish government in May 2013, amending some of the processes related to licensing and operations in Turkey. The regulations concerning implementation were passed by the Turkish government in January 2014. The existing licenses and future licensing processes are currently in a transition phase from the old petroleum law to the new petroleum law. The new law provides that operators have the option to maintain their licenses under the old petroleum law for the duration of the existing terms of a license or to convert their licenses to the new petroleum law prior to the expiration of the license. Further details regarding the timing for conversion are awaiting confirmation from the GDPA.
The GDPA awards a license after it approves the applicant’s work program, which may include obligations such as geological and geophysical work, seismic reprocessing and interpretation and contingent shooting of seismic and drilling of wells. A license grants exclusive rights over an area for the exploration for and production of petroleum.
Licensing Under the Old Petroleum Law. A license has a term of four years and requires drilling activities by the third year, but this obligation may be deferred into the fourth year by posting a bond. A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments. A final three-year term may be granted as an appraisal period for any oil or natural gas discovery registered in the previous terms. No single company may own more than an aggregate of 100% of eight licenses within a district. Rentals are due annually based on the size of the license.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder may apply to convert the area, not to exceed 25,000 hectares (approximately 62,000 acres), to a lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years and may be extended for two further terms of 10 years each. Annual rentals are due based on the size of the lease. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease.
Licensing Under the New Petroleum Law. A license has a term of five years and requires the license holder to post a bond equal to 2% of the cost of the work commitments to secure the fulfillment of the work commitments. Licenses shall be based on map sections of scale equal to 1/50,000 (approximately 148,000 acres) or 1/25,000 (approximately 37,000 acres). A license is eligible for two separate two-year extensions by fulfilling prior work commitments and subscribing to additional work commitments, including the drilling of at least one well in each separate extension period, and providing a bond to secure fulfillment of the additional work commitments. A final two-year term may be granted to appraise a petroleum discovery made during the prior terms. An additional six-month extension may be granted during any of the foregoing terms in order to complete the drilling or testing of a well.
Once a discovery is made, the license holder may apply to convert part of the license area, covering the prospective petroleum field, to a production lease. Under a lease, the lessee may produce oil and natural gas. The term of a lease is for 20 years and may be extended for two further terms of 10 years each. The production lease holder is typically able to apply for a new exploration license covering the area of the original exploration license, minus the area of the newly-granted production lease.
The expiration dates reported on our exploration licenses and production leases below are subject to various extensions available under the old petroleum law and the new petroleum law. Those portions of exploration licenses with production are available during any term for conversion to a production lease with a term of 20 years plus two further 10 year extensions if production is maintained. We have applied to the GDPA to convert some of our qualifying acreage into the new petroleum law regulations. This will be a gradual process, but we anticipate that conversion into the new petroleum law will provide for the renewal of the exploration license terms for qualifying acreage.

Bulgaria
General. As of December 31, 2014, we held interests in one onshore exploration permit and one onshore production concession in Bulgaria. We acquired all of our Bulgarian interests through the purchase of Direct Bulgaria in February 2011. In January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in the Republic of Bulgaria. The legislation also had the effect of preventing conventional drilling and completion activities. In June 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament amended the legislation to clarify that conventional drilling and completion activities were not intended to be affected by the law. As long as this legislation remains in effect, our unconventional natural gas exploration, development and production activities in Bulgaria will be significantly constrained. The following map shows our interests in Bulgaria at December 31, 2014:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2014, there were no economic reserves associated with our properties in Bulgaria.
Commercial Terms. Bulgaria’s petroleum laws provide a framework for investment and operation that allows foreign investors to retain the proceeds from the sale of petroleum production. The fiscal regime is comprised of royalties and income tax.
The royalty ranges from 2.5% to 30%, based on an “R factor” which is particular to each production concession agreement, but is typically calculated by dividing the total cumulative revenues from a production concession by the total cumulative costs incurred for that production concession.
The production concession holder pays Bulgarian corporate income tax, which is assessed at a rate of 10%. All costs incurred in connection with exploration, development and production operations are deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
Resident companies which remit dividends outside of Bulgaria are subject to a dividend withholding tax between 10% to 15%, depending on the proportion of the capital owned by the recipient. No customs duty is payable on the export of petroleum, nor is customs duty payable on the import of material necessary to conduct petroleum operations. There is also a 20% value added tax. Oil is priced at market while natural gas is tied to a bundle pricing based in part on the import price and in part on the domestic price.
Licensing Regime. The licensing process in Bulgaria for oil and natural gas concessions occurs in two stages: exploration permit and then production concession.
Under an exploration permit, the government grants exploration rights for a term of up to five years to conduct seismic and other exploratory activities, including drilling. The recipient of an exploration permit commits to a work program and posts a bank guarantee in the amount of the estimated cost for the program. The area covered by an onshore exploration permit may be as large as 5,000 square kilometers. The exploration permit may be extended for up to two additional two-year terms, subject to fulfillment of minimum work programs, and may be extended for an additional one-year term in order to appraise potential geologic discoveries. Interests under an exploration permit are transferable, subject to government approval. The permit holder is required to pay an annual area fee equal to 40 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $25 at December 31, 2014) per square kilometer, or 40 Bulgarian Lev (approximately $25 at December 31, 2014) per square kilometer in the event the permit term is extended.
Upon the registration of a commercial discovery, an exploration permit holder may apply for a production concession. The production concession size corresponds to the area of the commercial discovery. The duration of a production concession is 35 years and may be extended by a further 15 years subject to the terms and conditions of the production concession agreement. Interests under a production concession are transferable, subject to government approval. No bonus is paid to the government by the company upon conversion to a production concession.
Koynare. We own a 100% working interest, subject to a 3.02% overriding royalty interest and KDL’s 50% farm-in interest, in the Koynare production concession covering approximately 163,000 acres. The Koynare Concession Area contains the Deventci-R1 well, where we discovered a reservoir in the Jurassic-aged Ozirovo formation at a depth of approximately 13,800 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic and commercial discovery. In November 2011, we commenced drilling the Deventci-R2 appraisal well on the Koynare Concession Area, which we suspended following the enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. During the second half of 2013, we resumed drilling the Deventci-R2 directional well on our Koynare Concession Area. In January 2014, we reached target depth of 14,100 feet on the Deventci-R2 well, and conducted a long-term test on the well during the second quarter of 2014 with an initial production test of approximately 2.0 Mmcf/d of natural gas with condensates. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received approval from the Bulgarian government to acidize the well. We conducted initial stimulation in December 2014 to enhance its productivity and are currently evaluating the results of the stimulation.
Stefenetz. In November 2011, we initiated the application process for a production concession covering approximately 395,000 acres over the southern portion of our former A-Lovech exploration permit. The Stefenetz Concession Area is estimated to contain over 300,000 prospective acres for Etropole shale at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet, which the Bulgarian government has certified as a geologic discovery. During 2012, we initiated an environmental impact assessment, which the Bulgarian government must approve prior to granting the production concession.
In September 2011, we entered into an agreement with Esrey pursuant to which Esrey funded the drilling of an exploration well on the Stefenetz Concession Area to core and test the Etropole shale formation. This well, the Peshtene-R11, reached total depth in late November 2011, from which we collected more than 900 feet of core. We suspended drilling and completion of the Peshtene-R11 well following enactment of the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation. We and Esrey are evaluating the core data and developing a conventional completion program for the Peshtene-R11 well. If we obtain a production concession over the Stefenetz Concession Area, Esrey would fund up to an additional $12.5 million in exchange for a 50% working interest in the production concession. The remaining 50% working interest in the production concession would be split equally between us and KDL.
Aglen. We have applied to relinquish the Aglen exploration permit, which covers approximately 1,700 acres within the boundaries of the former A-Lovech exploration permit and lies within the boundary of the Stefenetz Concession Area. Due to the Bulgarian government’s January 2012 legislation, a force majeure event was recognized by the government. As of March 1, 2015, we were still negotiating the relinquishment of this license.
Albania
General. We own 100% of the interests in three onshore oil fields and one gas concession consisting of one onshore gas field and one exploration license, all in Albania. Stream commenced operations in Albania in November 2007, taking over the operation of wells, associated equipment and facilities from Albpetrol, the state owned oil company in Albania. Subsequent to the acquisition of Stream, we have been operating in Albania under the name TransAtlantic Albania Ltd. The following map shows our interests in Albania at December 31, 2014:
Reserves. As of December 31, 2014, we had total net proved reserves of 14,259 Mbbl of oil and 8,249 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 10,014 Mbbl of oil and 19,963 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 7,152 Mbbl of oil and 31,518 Mmcf of natural gas in Albania.
Commercial Terms. In August 2007, Stream entered into Instruments of Transfer to join four License Agreements between Agjencia Kombëtare e Burimeve Natyrore, the Albanian National Agency of Natural Resources (“AKBN”), and Albpetrol and entered into four Petroleum Agreements with Albpetrol, which together give us the right to access and develop three onshore oil fields and one onshore gas field. The four License Agreements each have a 25-year term, with unlimited five-year renewal options. These fields contain approximately 600 existing wells, of which approximately 250 are producing, with the remainder shut-in predominantly due to failures of production equipment as a result of insufficient capital investment by Albpetrol.
We are required to submit annual work programs and budgets to Albpetrol each year, including the nature and amount of capital expenditures, which is required to be consistent with the plans of development (“PODs”) for the fields approved by AKBN. Significant deviations from the PODs are subject to the approval of AKBN and Albpetrol.
Pursuant to the terms of the Petroleum Agreements, we pay a 2% to 7.2% gross over-riding royalty to Albpetrol, which may be paid in kind or cash. In addition, we are required to pay a royalty to Albpetrol based on the amount of pre-existing production (“PEP”) from the wells taken over by Stream. The PEP royalty is calculated on a well by well basis and is initially equal to 65% to 70% of the PEP preceding the takeover of the well by Stream. The PEP royalty declines at a rate of 10% per year for the oil fields and 5% per year for Delvina.
In 2008, a new 10% mineral tax was enacted by the Albanian Ministry of Finance. The new mineral tax is equal to 10% of gross sales after deducting any PEP royalties paid. Under the Petroleum Agreements, any new financial burdens (including new mineral taxes) are to be neutralized by amendments to the Petroleum Agreements. We are working with officials from Albpetrol and AKBN to finalize amendments to the Petroleum Agreements to neutralize the 10% mineral tax. As of December 31, 2014, we had $10.9 million of tax payments awaiting neutralization.
Ballsh-Hekal. The Ballsh-Hekal field was discovered in 1966 and produces oil from fractured carbonates of Cretaceous-Paleocene age. The oil contains sulphur. The field is developed with an average well spacing of approximately 4 hectares/well (10 acres/well). We believe that a significant number of these wells did not penetrate the entire hydrocarbon column.
We have taken over 23 wells (of which 13 are producing) from Albpetrol in the Ballsh-Hekal field. We believe that a significant number of these wells did not penetrate the entire hydrocarbon column. Albpetrol still operates approximately 60 wells in the field. We have the right to take over the remaining wells at our option. During 2014, our net production, before mineral taxes, was 86 Bbl/d of oil from the field.
Cakran-Mollaj. The Cakran-Mollaj field was discovered in 1977 and is currently producing from fractured carbonates of Cretaceous-Paleocene age. This is the deepest of our fields in Albania at 2,650 to 3,700 meters. The field is developed with an average well spacing of approximately 16 hectares/well (40 acres/well). We took over 70 wells (of which approximately 30 are producing) from Albpetrol. We believe that a significant number of these wells did not penetrate the entire hydrocarbon column.
During 2014, our net production, before mineral taxes, was approximately 307 Bbl/d of oil from this field. We are working on improving the reliability of surface equipment in this field prior to reactivating and recompleting additional wells.
Gorisht-Kocul. Discovered in 1965, the Gorisht-Kocul field is a heavy oil field that produces from fractured carbonates of Cretaceous-Paleocene age. Well depths range from 400 to 1,250 meters, and the oil contains sulphur. The field is fully developed with an average well spacing of approximately 2 hectares/well (5 acres/well). We believe that a significant number of these wells did not penetrate the entire hydrocarbon column.
We took over all 295 wells (of which approximately half are producing) in the Gorisht-Kocul field from Albpetrol. From During 2014, our net production from this field, before mineral taxes, was 449 Bbl/d of oil. We are in the process of conducting two waterflood projects in this reservoir, which have mitigated the natural pressure and production decline in portions of this field. We intend to workover and reactivate existing wells in 2015 with modern rod pumps and progressive cavity pumps.
Delvina Concession. We own the Delvina Concession, which is comprised of the partially developed Delvina field and the Delvina exploration block.
Delvina Field. The Delvina natural gas field was discovered in 1987 and produces natural gas and natural gas liquids from reservoirs at a depth of 2,800 to 3,500 meters from fractured carbonates of Cretaceous- Paleocene age. The Delvina natural gas field is connected to potential markets by an existing pipeline, but needs additional downstream capacity.
The field has two previously producing vertical wells, the Delvina D4 and D12 wells. During the workover of the Delvina D12 well in 2013, after successful stimulation and flow tests, Stream encountered an obstruction in the completion string that could not be removed through solvent injection and is planning workover procedures. We plan to bring the Delvina D4 well back online following workover of the Delvina D12 well. In April 2014, Stream spud the D34H1 well in the Delvina field, reaching a depth of approximately 750 meters before temporarily abandoning drilling due to a lack of funds. Drilling operations on the D34H1 well are expected to resume during the first half of 2015.
Delvina Block. Under the Delvina License Agreement and Petroleum Agreement, we have the right to develop approximately 60,000 acres adjacent to the Delvina natural gas field, referred to as the Delvina Block. The Delvina Block offers significant growth potential.
Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following table summarizes our net proved, probable and possible reserves at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
Value of Proved Reserves
The following table shows our estimated future net revenue, PV-10 and Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2014:
(1)
The PV-10 value of the estimated future net revenue is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10, while not a financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure as defined under U.S. GAAP. The Standardized Measure represents the PV-10 after giving effect to income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of our PV-10 to our Standardized Measure:
Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
At December 31, 2014, our estimated proved reserves were 32,749 Mboe, an increase of 20,528 Mboe, or 168.0%, compared to 12,221 Mboe at December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Stream, the continued success of our horizontal drilling campaigns in the Selmo oil field and the Thrace Basin and the successful appraisal of the Bahar oil field. The Albanian assets of Stream constituted 15,634 Mboe or 76.2% of the increase. Of these proved reserves, 88.9% are in the proved developed category and are part of the producing oil assets in Albania. The increase in proved reserves was partially offset by sales volumes of 1,883 Mboe in 2014, consisting of 1,339 Mbbls of oil and 3,262 Mmcf of natural gas.
At December 31, 2014, we recorded an increase in proved reserves of 5,208 Mboe through extensions and discoveries. These increases were due to the following factors: (i) horizontal drilling in Selmo, which resulted in the conversion of 2,234 Mboe from probable or possible reserves to proved reserves due to successful wells in the previously under-drilled southeast portion of the field and confirming that oil still remains at, or below, the current oil-water contact; (ii) the addition of 467 Mboe in the Thrace Basin as a result of the Gurgen discovery and successful Sogucak test in the Kuzey Emirali-1 well; (iii) the addition of 2,243 Mboe due to successful appraisal wells on the Bahar structure and (iv) the addition of 264 Mbbls in the Arpatepe oil field as a result of the Arpatepe-7 appraisal well success which extended the field to the southeast.
At December 31, 2014, we recorded an increase in proved reserves due to technical revisions of 1,254 Mbbl and 1,668 Mmcf (1,532 Mboe total). The revision in oil of 1,254 Mbbls was an increase from December 31, 2013, in which we recorded a loss of 436 Mbbls, and was mostly attributable to well performance in Selmo. Prior to initiating the horizontal well campaign in Selmo in 2013, drilling had been halted due to poor vertical well performance. This resulted in negative revisions to estimates for 2013. By contrast, the horizontal wells drilled in late 2013 and throughout 2014 have performed better than original estimates and thus resulted in positive technical revisions. The revision in gas of 1,668 Mmcf was a decrease from December 31, 2013, in which we recorded 3,436 Mmcf in technical revisions and was mostly attributable to a decrease in activity in the Thrace Basin, where we did not introduce any new technology to the gas fields. In 2013, we successfully fracture stimulated the Mezardere formation for the first time. This led to an aggressive recompletion program as we fine-tuned our stimulation methodology which, in turn, greatly increased many behind pipe reserves. The performance of these fracture stimulated wells versus the unstimulated type curves allowed for positive reserve revisions. The estimated undiscounted capital costs associated with our proved reserves is $357.8 million.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2014, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 10,400 Mboe, an increase of 4,796 Mboe, or 85.6%, compared to 5,604 Mboe at December 31, 2013. Of this increase in proved undeveloped reserves, 1,734 Mboe was from the acquisition of Stream, 1,834 Mboe was from extensions and discoveries from horizontal drilling in Selmo and 1,228 Mboe was from extensions and discoveries in the Molla field and the Thrace Basin in Turkey. All of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 will be developed within five years of the date the reserve was first disclosed as a proved undeveloped reserve. The estimated undiscounted capital costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves is $266.6 million.
Probable Reserves
Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves.
Possible Reserves
Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See “-Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law.”
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.
Internal Controls
Management has established, and is responsible for, a number of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls consist of documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. We also retain outside independent engineering firms to prepare estimates of our proved, probable and possible reserves. We work closely with this firm, and management is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical data to it. Management has tested the processes and controls regarding our reserves estimates for 2014. Senior management reviews and approves our reserves estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. In addition, our audit committee serves as our reserves committee and is composed of three outside directors, all of whom have experience in the review of energy company reserves evaluations. The audit committee reviews the final reserves estimate and also meets with representatives from the outside engineering firm to discuss their process and findings.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves under U.S. Law
In the United States, we are required to disclose proved reserves, and we are permitted to disclose probable and possible reserves, using the standards contained in Rule 4-10(a) of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves in Turkey presented as of December 31, 2014 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our external engineers for Turkey. The technical person at DeGolyer and MacNaughton that is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates in Turkey is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University. He has over 32 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves in Albania presented as of December 31, 2014 have been prepared by Deloitte LLP, our external engineers for Albania. The technical person at Deloitte LLP that is primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves estimates in Albania has a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Calgary. He has over 20 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir engineering and reserves determination.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with DeGolyer and MacNaughton and Deloitte LLP to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to them for the preparation of their reserves estimates. Our chief reservoir engineer has over 42 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Colorado School of Mines and a Masters of Business Administration degree from the University of Phoenix. He is a Registered Professional Engineer in the state of Colorado, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are projections based on a process involving an independent third-party engineering firm’s collection of all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking in nature. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC, such as constant oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses and future capital costs. We also make assumptions relating to availability of funds and timing of capital expenditures for development of our proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves. These reports should not be construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is also dependent on geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data, we cannot ensure that the reserves will ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See “Supplemental Information -Supplemental oil and natural gas reserves information (unaudited)” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved, probable and possible reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a detailed evaluation of our Selmo, Arpatepe, Bakuk, Molla and Thrace Basin properties in Turkey and our West Koynare field in Bulgaria. DeGolyer and MacNaughton determined that their estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about whether proved reserves are economically producible from a given date forward, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of SEC Regulation S-X.
