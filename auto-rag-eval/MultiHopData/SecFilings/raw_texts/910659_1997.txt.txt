ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Productive Wells and Drilling Activity
The following table summarizes the Company's developed acreage and productive wells at December 31, 1997. "Gross" refers to the total acres or wells in which the Company has a working interest, and "net" refers to gross acres or wells multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by the Company.
Developed Acreage /(1)/ Gross Net ------- ------- United States 3,880 1,565 Colombia/(2)/ 3,706 585 ------- ------- 7,586 2,150 ======= =======

In the above table, a productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a dry well. A dry well is an exploratory or a development well found to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in commercial quantities. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil and gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An exploratory well is any well that is not a development well.
Undeveloped Acreage
The Company's undeveloped acreage in Colombia is held pursuant to concession agreements with the Colombian government. The Company expects to relinquish all undeveloped acreage associated with the La Fragua and Yuruyaco concessions during 1998. No further relinquishments are required for the Santana concession until the expiration of the concession agreement in 2015. See "-- Significant Properties."
The Company does not have an undeveloped acreage position in the United States because of the costs of maintaining such a position. Oil and gas leases in the United States generally can be acquired by the Company for specific prospects on reasonable terms either directly or through farmout arrangements.
The following table shows the undeveloped acreage held by the Company in Colombia at December 31, 1997. Undeveloped acreage is acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.

Title to Properties
The Company has not performed a title examination for offshore U.S. leases in federal waters because title emanates from the United States government. Title examinations also are not performed in Colombia, where mineral title emanates from the national government. The Company believes that it generally has satisfactory title to all of its oil and gas properties. The Company's working interests are subject to customary royalty and overriding royalty interests generally created in connection with their acquisition, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens and minor liens, encumbrances, easements and restrictions. The Company believes
that none of such burdens materially detracts from the value of such properties or its interest therein or will materially interfere with the use of the properties in the operation of the Company's business.
Federal Leases
The Company conducts a portion of its operations on federal oil and gas leases and therefore must comply with numerous additional regulatory restrictions, including certain nondiscrimination statutes. Certain of the Company's operations on federal leases must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits or approvals issued by various federal agencies. Pursuant to certain federal leases, approval of certain operations must be obtained from one or more government agencies prior to the commencement of such operation. Federal leases are subject to extensive regulation. See "Item 1. Business -- Regulation."
Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows
See Supplementary Information Related to Oil and Gas Producing Activities in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information with respect to the Company's reserves and future net cash flows.
The Company will file with the Department of Energy (the "DOE") a statement with respect to the Company's estimate of proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 1997, that is not the same as that included in the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 1997, as set forth in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" elsewhere herein. The information filed with the DOE includes the estimated proved reserves of the properties of which the Company is the operator, whereas the estimated proved reserves contained in Item 8 hereof include only the Company's percentage share of the estimated proved reserves of all properties in which the Company has an interest.

Significant Properties
Colombia. -------- The Company's Colombian properties consist of four concessions, all of which are located in the Putumayo Basin in southwestern Colombia along the eastern front of the eastern cordillera of the Andes Mountains. The Company has a 45% working interest in each of the concessions, which is subject to various reversionary interests in favor of Ecopetrol as described below. Argosy, as operator of the properties, carries out the program of operations for the four concessions. The program is determined, with consideration of the obligations contained in the concession agreements, by an operating committee comprised of two representatives from each of Argosy and Neo. The Santana concession, which now consists of approximately 52,000 acres and contains 14 producing wells, has been in effect since 1987 and is the focus of the Company's exploration and development activities.
The Aporte Putumayo concession, which consists of approximately 77,000 acres and contains three shut-in wells, has been in effect since 1972. The La Fragua concession consists of approximately 32,000 acres and has been in effect since 1992. The Yuruyaco concession was acquired in 1995 and consists of approximately 39,000 acres. The Company has filed with Ecopetrol applications for formal relinquishment of the Aporte Putumayo, La Fragua and Yuruyaco concessions. Such formal relinquishments are expected to occur during 1998.
The Santana, La Fragua and Yuruyaco concessions are contiguous, while the Aporte Putumayo concession is approximately 50 kilometers to the southwest of the Santana concession.
Production from the concessions is sold pursuant to sales contracts with Ecopetrol. Although sales prices vary between concessions, the contracts generally provide that 25% of the sales proceeds will be paid in Colombian pesos. As a result of certain currency restrictions, pesos resulting from these payments must generally remain in Colombia and are used by the Company to pay local expenses.
Neo's pretax income from Colombian sources, as defined under Colombian law, is subject to Colombian income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% (37.5% prior to 1996), although a "presumptive" minimum income tax based on net assets, as defined under Colombian law, may apply in years of little or no net income. Neo's income after Colombian income taxes is subject to a Colombian remittance tax that accrues at a rate of 10% (7% for 1998 and thereafter). Payment of the remittance tax may be deferred under certain circumstances if Neo reinvests such income in Colombia. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein.
The Colombian government also imposes a production tax which averaged approximately $1.29 per barrel during 1997 and was equal to 7% of the oil price in effect through December 1997 for three of the four fields in the Santana concession. For these three fields the production tax has been eliminated for 1998 and thereafter. For the remaining field, the Miraflor field, the production tax is effective through 2000 at 7%, 5.5%, 4% and 2.5% of the oil price for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. Any new discoveries declared commercial by Ecopetrol will be exempt from the production tax.
Santana Concession. The Santana concession is subject to a "risk-sharing" ------------------ contract pursuant to which Ecopetrol has the option to participate on the basis of a 30% working interest in exploration activities in the concession. If a commercial field is discovered, Ecopetrol's working interest increases to 50% and the costs theretofore incurred and attributable to the 20% working interest differential will be recouped by the co-owners from Ecopetrol's share of production on a well by well basis. The risk-sharing contract provides that, when 7 million barrels of cumulative production from the concession have been attained, Ecopetrol's revenue interest and share of operating costs increases to 65% but it remains obligated for only 50% of capital expenditures. In June 1996, the 7 million barrel threshold was reached. At that time, the Company's revenue interest in the concession declined from 18% to 12.6% and its share of operating expenses declined from 22.5% to 15.75%.
The Santana concession is divided by the Caqueta River. Two fields located south of the river, the Toroyaco and Linda fields, were declared commercial by Ecopetrol and commenced production in 1992. There are currently four producing wells in the Toroyaco field and five producing wells in the Linda field. During 1995, a 3-D seismic survey covering the Toroyaco and Linda fields was completed. Based on this survey, one development well was drilled in each field during 1996 and one additional development well was drilled in the Linda field in 1997. No further drilling is anticipated for these fields.
The Company and its co-owner ("Co-owners") constructed a 42-kilometer pipeline (the "Uchupayaco Pipeline") which was completed and commenced operations during 1994 to transport oil production from the Toroyaco and Linda fields to the Trans-Andean Pipeline owned by Ecopetrol, through which the Company's production is transported to the port of Tumaco on the Pacific coast of Colombia.
Two additional fields, the Mary and Miraflor fields, were discovered north of the Caqueta River and were declared commercial by Ecopetrol during 1993. Except for oil produced during production tests of wells located in these fields, the production was shutin until the first quarter of 1995 when construction of a pipeline was completed and commercial production began. With the completion of this pipeline, the Co-owners have direct pipeline access from all four fields to the Pacific coast port of Tumaco. There are currently four producing wells in the Mary field and one producing well in the Miraflor field. A 3-D seismic survey was completed over the Mary and Miraflor fields during early 1997. This survey confirms the presence of several prospects and leads previously identified from two-dimensional seismic data. The most promising prospect, Mary West, appears to be an extension of the Mary field. The drilling of an exploratory well on this prospect has been deferred pending environmental permits and appropriate financing. The survey also confirmed that additional development drilling is not required for the Miraflor field.
The Co-owners have fulfilled all the initial exploration obligations required by the Santana risk-sharing contract. The contract requires that the Co-owners submit a work program for approval by Ecopetrol for one additional contract year. The current work program contemplates the recompletion of certain existing wells and the construction of a micro-refinery to produce diesel fuel for the Company's operations.
In 1993, the Co-owners relinquished 50% of the original Santana concession area in accordance with the terms of the contract. In July 1995, an additional 25% of the original contract area was relinquished. A final relinquishment was made in 1997 such that all remaining contract areas except for those areas within five kilometers of a commercial field were relinquished.
Production from the Santana concession has been sold to Ecopetrol pursuant to a sales contract that became effective February 1, 1997, and was extended through December 31, 1998. Prices under the contract are determined differently depending on whether (in the discretion of Ecopetrol) the produced crude is exported. If the crude is exported, the price received by the Company is the export price less specified handling and commercialization charges and subject to an adjustment (specified in the contract) for the quality of the produced crude as compared with the overall pipeline blend at the point of export (the "Pipeline Blend Adjustment"). If the crude is not exported, the price received by the Company is the previous month's average posted price for Cano Limon crude less specified handling and transportation charges and subject to (i) the Pipeline Blend Adjustment and (ii) a deduction of $0.56 per barrel for the quality of the overall pipeline
blend at the point of sale as compared with the quality of Cano Limon crude (the "Cano Limon Adjustment"). In 1997, Ecopetrol exported the crude each month and the sales price averaged $17.39 per barrel.
At December 31, 1997, the date as of which the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows applicable to the Company's proved oil and gas reserves was prepared, Ecopetrol was exporting the crude oil. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the standardized measure applicable to the Company's Colombian reserves, the Company used the export price of $14.30 per barrel (which does not include the Cano Limon adjustment). If Ecopetrol had not been exporting the crude oil at December 31, 1997, the price used for determining the standardized measure applicable to the Company's Colombian reserves at December 31, 1997, would have been approximately $14.80 per barrel.
La Fragua Concession. The La Fragua concession is subject to an "association" -------------------- contract whereunder the Co-owners fulfill all exploration obligations without Ecopetrol's participation until a field is declared commercial, as described above. The association contract also provides that Ecopetrol's working interest increases on a sliding scale from 50% to 70% as cumulative production from the concession increases from 60 million barrels to 150 million barrels.
The Co-owners have completed their seismic obligations for the first two years of the La Fragua concession and were obligated to acquire additional seismic data for the third year. The Co-owners determined, however, that it was not technically justified to explore this concession further and, accordingly, requested and received from Ecopetrol a change of commitment that would allow the Co-owners to substitute certain exploratory expenditures within the Santana concession for the remaining seismic commitment on the La Fragua concession. The indigenous people of the new commitment area, however, objected to the proposed exploratory work and the Co-owners were not able to comply with the new commitment. The Co-owners requested and Ecopetrol has agreed to allow the Co- owners to surrender the concession without further expenditure. Formal relinquishment is expected in 1998.
Yuruyaco Concession. The Yuruyaco concession, acquired by the Company in -------------------- September 1995, is an "association" contract whereunder the Company and its co- owner fulfill all exploration obligations without Ecopetrol's participation until a field is declared commercial by Ecopetrol. At such time, Ecopetrol will earn a 50% share in the commercial field and must reimburse its 50% share of successful exploratory wells, seismic and stratigraphic wells, dry step-out exploratory wells and development wells and facilities through its 50% share of production. The contract also provides that Ecopetrol's working interest will be 50% up to 60 million barrels. For production in excess of 60 million barrels, Ecopetrol's interest would increase from 50% to 75%, based on a measure of profitability as defined in the contract.
Seismic obligations for the first two years of the Yuruyaco concession have also been satisfied with the completion of a 2-D seismic program in January 1997. The interpretation of this seismic data failed to establish any significant prospects and, accordingly, the Co-owners decided to surrender the concession rather than proceeding into the third contract year. The Co-owners have filed an application for formal relinquishment which is expected in 1998.
Aporte Putumayo Concession. The discoveries on the Aporte Putumayo concession -------------------------- were not declared commercial by Ecopetrol and the properties were operated by Argosy and Neo without participation by Ecopetrol. There are no remaining exploration obligations under this contract. Ecopetrol has accepted the Co- owner's request for relinquishment, which is pending the completion of abandonment and restoration operations.
United States. ------------- The Company's oil and gas properties in the United States are located in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana at Main Pass 41 and Breton Sound 31 fields. Both of these properties are operated by the Company.
Main Pass Block 41 is a federal lease located approximately 25 miles east of Venice, Louisiana, in 50 feet of water. There are currently five productive wells in the field. The field's 1997 production averaged 79 barrels of oil per day and 799 MCF per day, net to the Company's interest, from six completions in four sands between 6,000 and 7,500 feet. The Company owns a 35% interest in this field. Main Pass Block 41 represents approximately 71% of the Company's total net U.S. proved reserves at January 1, 1998.
Breton Sound Block 31 is located 20 miles offshore Louisiana in 16 feet of water. The field is approximately 55 miles southeast of New Orleans on state leases. During 1997, seven wells averaged 130 barrels of oil per day and 66 MCF of gas per day, net to the Company's interest, from two sands completed between 5,500 feet and 6,500 feet. The
Company's interests in the leases comprising the field vary from 41% to 67%. Breton Sound Block 31 field represents approximately 29% of the Company's total net proved U.S. reserves at January 1, 1998.
The interpretation of 3-D seismic data in 1996 identified two deep and several shallow prospects in the Breton Sound Block 31 field. The Company is continuing its efforts to secure an industry partner to farm-in to the Company's acreage by drilling one or more exploratory wells that would test the deep prospects. As for the shallow prospects, the Company anticipates that it will drill at least one exploratory well once suitable financing has been secured.
The Company leases corporate office space in Dallas, Texas containing approximately 5,100 square feet pursuant to a lease which expires in January 1999. The annual lease payments for these offices are $77,000.
