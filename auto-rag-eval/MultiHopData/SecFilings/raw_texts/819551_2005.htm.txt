Additional Interests

At December 31, 2005, the Company owned Vacation Ownership Interests in a resort in South Africa, four right-to-use Vacation Ownership Interests in a resort in Mexico and one to two Vacation Ownership Interests in each of a number of additional resorts, all of which it holds for resale.
Land
In June 2005, the Company acquired approximately 2.1 acres of land in Puerto Peñasco (“Rocky Point”), Mexico. The Company intends to develop the land into a resort featuring up to 73 units or 3,796 Vacation Ownership Interests.
The Company, together with James Bruno Enterprises LLC (“Bruno”), formed ILX-Bruno in August 2005 to purchase and develop three parcels approximating 22 acres of land in Sedona, Arizona from the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. The Company holds a 92% interest in ILX-Bruno. In October 2005, ILX-Bruno completed the acquisition of two parcels of the land. In February 2006, ILX-Bruno entered into a real estate contract to purchase the third parcel of land with a closing scheduled for June 30, 2006. ILX-Bruno is currently evaluating the development opportunities but anticipates constructing additional timeshare units on at least a portion of the land.
Operating Strategies
The Company’s operating strategy seeks to emphasize the following characteristics, which management believes provide ILX with certain competitive advantages within the vacation ownership industry.
Flexible Vacation Ownership Interest Purchase Options. The Company believes the flexibility associated with its inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests provides a uniquely appealing opportunity for ILX owners. Unlike many of the Company’s competitors, substantially all of the Company’s inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests at the ILX resorts are intended to be used on dates specified from time to time by the ILX owner within a broad range of available dates and not fixed at the time of purchase. Purchasers of a Vacation Ownership Interest in the Company’s proprietary branded Premiere Vacation Club are entitled to use their Vacation Ownership Interest at a single resort in Premiere Vacation Club or may split up their Vacation Ownership Interest according to the owner’s needs and preferences at one or more of any number of participating resorts, as well as thousands of other resorts through the domestic and international exchange programs in which ILX owners participate. In addition, Vacation Ownership Interests at Varsity Clubs may be purchased for highly desirable single-day uses, a collection of single days (such as designated days during an entire football or other sports season) or other packages suited to meet each ILX owner’s preferences.
Customer Satisfaction. The Company believes that its inventory of highly desirable resorts with extensive amenities, combined with flexible purchase options have resulted in a high level of customer satisfaction. Each of the ILX resorts is located in an area with unique tourist attractions and most offer food, beverage and other amenities comparable to full-service commercial lodging facilities, with discounted prices extended to ILX owners at the facilities it operates. As a result, the Company believes ILX owners generally have a high level of satisfaction, resulting in additional purchases and increased goodwill. The Company capitalizes upon this by directing a portion of its marketing efforts towards increasing sales of Vacation Ownership Interests to ILX owners.
Enhanced Amenities. Each of the ILX resorts (except the Los Abrigados Lodge, which does not offer Vacation Ownership Interests and does not have a restaurant, the Premiere Vacation Club at the Roundhouse Resort and the Bell Rock Inn) has at least one full-service restaurant and other food and beverage facilities in addition to a range of other amenities typically found at high quality resorts. Many resorts offering Vacation Ownership Interests have none or only limited restaurant and other food and beverage facilities. As a result, management believes ILX owners appreciate the ability to enjoy traditional full-service commercial hotel amenities and also maintain the option to use more economical in-room facilities. See “The Resorts.”
Demonstrated Ability to Acquire and Develop Properties. The Company has historically been successful at acquiring resorts in settings of natural beauty at relatively low costs. The Company’s acquisition strategy is to identify underutilized or distressed properties in locations with high tourist appeal and access to major metropolitan centers. Thereafter, the Company’s redevelopment efforts are primarily targeted at improving the amenities and appointments of such properties. The Company has successfully developed its prototype Varsity Clubs of America resort, VCA-South Bend, and a second Varsity Clubs facility, VCA-Tucson. Future Varsity Clubs will be designed and constructed in accordance with the VCA-South Bend prototype, with appropriate modifications and improvements. The Company believes that its acquisition and development strategies have resulted in a portfolio of desirable properties with a relatively low cost of product as a percentage of sales.
Convenient Access Resorts. The Company’s CARs are typically located within a two-hour drive of an ILX owner’s principal residence, which accommodates a demand for more frequent and convenient “short-stay” vacations without the costs and difficulties of air travel. This proximity also facilitates marketing of the Company’s Premiere Vacation Club, which permits members to divide their Vacation Ownership Interest into shorter stays at the various properties included in Premiere Vacation Club (including the VCAs) or exchange their entire interest during any year through an exchange network. In addition to the use of their Vacation Ownership Interest, owners who have purchased from ILX are also entitled to day-use of the offered amenities and discounted food, beverage and other services at their individual ILX resort or, in the case of Premiere Vacation Club members, at ILX resorts included in Premiere Vacation Club, with some exceptions, thereby facilitating use and enhancing the benefits of ownership by ILX owners.
Standard Design, Lower Construction and Operating Costs of Varsity Clubs. The Company’s Varsity Clubs concept is based upon its VCA-South Bend prototype. While each Varsity Club may have aspects uniquely tailored to its targeted customer base, the Company believes that its standard architectural and interior designs for Varsity Clubs will significantly reduce associated development and construction costs. Standardization will also allow the Company to develop new Varsity Clubs and integrate new resorts in response to demand. The Company anticipates that new Varsity Clubs can be constructed within one year from acquisition of the underlying real property.
Premium Locations. The Company believes that the variety and natural beauty of the surroundings for its CARs enhance their attraction to customers. Substantially all of the ILX resorts are located in the western United States, in part because of the numerous locations in that region which are attractive to tourists and convenient to major metropolitan areas. The vast majority of the Company’s inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests qualify as
“red time,” the highest demand classification for purposes of participation in exchange networks such as II and RCI. The Company intends to develop additional Premiere Vacation Club resorts in other western United States sites that offer natural settings or other attractions to entice tourists to visit such locations.
Integrated In-House Operations. Substantially all of the Company’s marketing, sales, development, property management, and financing operations are conducted internally, except certain minimal marketing functions and processing of customer payments and certain collection activities related to promissory notes given by ILX owners as partial payment for a Vacation Ownership Interest (“Customer Notes”). In addition, the Company operates all of the ILX resorts on a centralized basis, with operating and maintenance costs paid from ILX owners’ dues as well as hotel rental revenues. The Company believes that its internal capabilities result in greater control and consistency of all phases of its operations that may result in lower overall costs than generally associated with outsourcing such operations. Such integration also facilitates the Company’s Premiere Vacation Club and the ILX resorts’ qualification in the II and RCI exchange networks, among others.
Directed Marketing. The Company’s marketing strategy with respect to its Premiere Vacation Club is to target potential customers who have a demonstrated interest in the location of its ILX resorts or a likelihood of frequent travel. The Company’s marketing activities primarily offer travel-related inducements (such as discounted or complimentary vacations at nearby ILX resorts or at non-affiliated hotels in popular destinations in the western United States and Mexico or discounted or complimentary area activities to visitors to its resort destinations). By offering travel-related inducements, the Company believes it is better able to identify customers who like to travel, which results in a higher percentage of sales per contact than other promotions. In addition, the Company developed its proprietary Varsity Clubs of America concept to capitalize upon affinity marketing strategies. The Company believes that a high-quality “city club” experience combined with the traditional benefits associated with Vacation Ownership Interests, such as the opportunity to participate in exchange networks, will appeal to consumers in the local markets of each Varsity Clubs. Further, the Varsity Clubs concept is intended to take advantage of a marketing base of alumni, sports enthusiasts, parents of students, corporate sponsors and others affiliated with each university next to which a Varsity Clubs will be developed. The Company believes that these marketing strategies permit it to take advantage of existing affinities, resulting in a higher rate of closings per customer contacts.
Premiere Vacation Club
Sales of Vacation Ownership Interests in Premiere Vacation Club commenced in June 1998. Purchasers are offered deeded membership interests that provide rights to accommodations which may be used each use year in their entirety at one time or may be divided into shorter stays at one or a variety of the Company’s resorts or may be exchanged through a participating exchange network. The Company’s Premiere Vacation Club emphasizes CARs (i) that facilitate short-stay vacations with relatively low cost and time associated with travel to the ILX resort, (ii) located near settings of natural beauty, (iii) with high quality amenities and resort services and (iv) that facilitate flexible use options. The Company believes that its proprietary branded Premiere Vacation Club will capitalize upon affinity marketing strategies and increase the goodwill associated with the ILX resorts. In addition, membership interests in Premiere Vacation Club are marketed at an average higher gross sales price than sales of Vacation Ownership Interests in a single ILX resort. The Company also markets membership interests in its Premiere Vacation Club to existing ILX owners, thereby expanding its sales volume without increasing its sales and marketing costs in the same proportion as generally associated with sales to first-time buyers.
Initially, the Company’s Premiere Vacation Club inventory consisted of Vacation Ownership Interests in the ILX resorts. New resorts are expected to be added through the Company’s pursuit of selected acquisition opportunities, as occurred with the addition of the 1,500 one-week 25-year right-to-use Vacation Ownership Interests in Sea of Cortez Premiere Vacation Club in San Carlos, Mexico, the 988 Vacation Ownership Interests in Rancho Mañana Resort, 1,898 Vacation Ownership Interests in the Carriage House in Las Vegas and 153 Vacation Ownership Interests in Scottsdale Camelback Resort. By marketing its inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests through Premiere Vacation Club, the Company believes it has greater flexibility with respect to potential acquisition opportunities than generally associated with the sale of Vacation Ownership Interests in a single vacation resort, to the extent that small or remote resorts which may be inefficient to market as a single location resort may enhance the consumer appeal of a membership interest in Premiere Vacation Club. With its existing and planned resorts in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico, the Company is seeking to build a critical mass of CARs within driving distance of the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan markets. The Company may develop additional networks of CARs proximate to other major metropolitan areas in the western United States. Further capitalizing on the flexibility of Premiere Vacation Club, the Company has an agreement with Scottsdale Camelback Resort whereby Premiere Vacation Club members may utilize the resort’s facilities on a day-use basis, thereby enhancing the benefits of ownership in Premiere Vacation Club.
Varsity Clubs of America
The Company may in the future pursue the expansion of its proprietary branded Varsity Clubs concept. The Company would focus on development of additional Varsity Clubs near prominent colleges and universities in the western United States, or elsewhere, located in areas with a significant base of existing tourism and access to major population centers. The Company created a Varsity Clubs wing which recognizes UNLV at the Carriage House,
which is approximately one mile from campus. The Varsity Clubs of America concept is primarily intended to offer residents in major population centers a “city club” experience with day-use privileges regularly available, as well as the opportunity to exchange their Vacation Ownership Interest through the exchange networks in which ILX owners participate. The Varsity Clubs concept also seeks to maximize the appeal of such urban timeshare resorts by strategically locating each of them proximate to one or more prominent colleges and universities with nationally recognized athletic, cultural and other events. Large universities host a variety of sporting, recreational, academic and cultural events that create a substantial and relatively constant influx of participants, attendees and spectators. The Varsity Clubs concept is designed to address the specific needs of these individuals and entities by creating specialty vacation ownership resorts that have a flexible ownership structure, enabling the purchase of anything from a single day, a collection of single days (such as an entire football or other sports’ season) or a traditional one-week period. Each Varsity Clubs facility operates as a hotel to the extent of unsold or unused vacation ownership inventory.
The prototype VCA-South Bend facility is an all-suite, 62-unit lodging facility that features amenities such as The Stadium (a sports-themed atrium lounge serving a variety of food and beverages and featuring a theater-wall television), a private Member’s Lounge, exercise facilities, a swimming pool and whirlpool spa, complete business services and other facilities popular with the target market of likely purchasers. The prototype Varsity Clubs facility is based on a four-acre configuration expandable to as many as 90 units, without the need to acquire additional real property, and can be built in smaller configurations if warranted by a particular market or if dictated by the availability of land.
The first Varsity Clubs facility is located three miles from the University of Notre Dame and Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana, and approximately 90 miles from Chicago, Illinois. Customers purchase deed and title to a floating period’s use of a unit and unlimited day-use privileges at the common areas of the property. Purchasers may also receive the right-to-use the facility on specified dates, such as dates of home football games, for which they pay a premium. To date, VCA-South Bend has been able to compete favorably for commercial guests because of its superior facilities and amenities relative to other lodging accommodations in the area.
The second Varsity Clubs facility is located in Tucson, Arizona, less than three miles from the University of Arizona. This second Varsity Clubs offers 60 suites, or 3,120 one-week intervals. VCA-Tucson was designed in accordance with the VCA-South Bend prototype, with certain modifications made to improve efficiency and incorporate local design themes. The Company chose Tucson as a site for its Varsity Clubs concept because of its status as a year-round destination location, a large residential population base of approximately 900,000 and the proximity to the University of Arizona, which has a current alumni base in excess of 200,000 people. The Company believes that all of these factors increase the appeal of VCA-Tucson to prospective buyers as well as provide increased trading power for purchasers of Vacation Ownership Interests in the resort for purposes of participation in exchange networks. The VCA-Tucson on-site sales office offers customers Premiere Vacation Club Vacation Ownership Interests. Premiere Vacation Club Interests provide the buyer with local city club privileges, access to all resorts in Premiere Vacation Club, including VCA-Tucson and VCA-South Bend, as well as a variety of additional benefits.
The Company would consider development of additional Varsity Clubs facilities that meet its specified criteria. Management believes there exist numerous sites in the western United States, or elsewhere, that are attractive for the development of additional Varsity Clubs. The Company believes that Varsity Clubs brand name recognition would be enhanced with the offering of additional facilities. Varsity Clubs expansion efforts would likely be primarily focused on metropolitan areas in the western United States, each located near one or more large universities, but the Company will assess other potential opportunities as they arise. Ideally, the Company would seek to place additional Varsity Clubs near universities that are located in or convenient to popular tourist destination locations in or near large metropolitan areas.
Sales and Marketing
Marketing is the process by which the Company attracts potential customers to visit and tour an ILX resort or attend a sales presentation. Sales is the process by which the Company seeks to sell a Vacation Ownership Interest to a potential customer once he or she arrives for a tour at an ILX resort or attends a sales presentation. The Company believes it has the marketing and sales infrastructure necessary to sell Vacation Ownership Interests on a competitive basis. All of the Company’s sales and the majority of the Company’s marketing functions are currently performed in-house and the Company invests significant resources in attracting, training and seeking to retain its sales and marketing employees. The Company believes this strategy provides it with greater control over these critical functions, resulting in greater consistency of customer relations and improved customer satisfaction. In addition, management believes that its practice of hiring employees to staff the majority of its sales and marketing functions, as opposed to using independent contractors as has been the industry norm, results in a higher retention rate among its sales force and provides a pool of experienced staff from which to draw upon as the Company’s business expands. The Company expends substantial resources identifying, attracting and training its sales and marketing personnel and offers a full package of employment benefits to its sales and marketing personnel. Management believes that consistency and high quality in its sales and marketing operations is crucial to its success.
The Company believes that the package of benefits offered to its sales and marketing employees, including an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, is uncommon in the vacation ownership industry and, as a result, attracts high quality personnel and provides an incentive for their performance.
Marketing. The Company’s marketing activities are devoted primarily toward (i) hotel guests at the ILX resorts, (ii) II and RCI exchange program participants staying at the ILX resorts, (iii) off-premise contacts with visitors to the local surroundings of the ILX resorts and in the metropolitan areas within driving distances of the ILX resorts (iv) telemarketing, direct mail, electronic and other contact with residents of metropolitan areas within driving distance of the ILX resorts (v) its existing customer base and (vi) referrals from existing owners. The Company’s marketing strategy seeks to target prospective buyers who respond favorably to travel-related inducements because the Company believes such consumers are more likely to travel and therefore have a greater likelihood of purchasing a Vacation Ownership Interest. The Company identifies potential purchasers through internally developed marketing techniques, and sells Vacation Ownership Interests through its five sales offices located at ILX resorts. For its sales offices, the Company primarily targets customers who live within driving distance of the ILX resort or who are vacationing at or near the ILX resort. This practice allows the Company to invite potential purchasers to experience the ILX resorts and avoid the more expensive marketing costs of subsidized airfare and lodging which have been associated with the vacation ownership industry. In addition, the Company believes that its marketing strategy results in a higher percentage of sales per prospective customer contacts than other approaches because its targeted customer base has a demonstrated interest in the locale of an ILX resort and/or a greater likelihood to take vacations. The Company also targets local residents to its VCA-Tucson and Rancho Mañana sales offices by offering these prospective customers travel incentives in exchange for their attendance at the sales presentation. The Company believes that prospective customers who respond to such travel offers have strong sales potential because of the attractiveness of the convenient access of the ILX resorts to their homes, and because of their interest in travel. The Company also directs its marketing efforts to current ILX owners. Marketing costs to existing owners are generally lower than costs associated with first time buyers.
Similar to branding techniques utilized by some of its competitors, the Company also seeks to capitalize upon affinity marketing concepts in attracting prospective buyers to its Varsity Clubs concept by seeking to develop a branded “city club” experience for flexible use by local residents. In addition, marketing of Varsity Clubs seeks to focus on alumni, parents of university students and other persons or entities who have a preexisting affiliation with or other attraction to the local university. All of the Company’s marketing activities emphasize the convenience of the ILX resorts, coupled with the opportunity to participate in exchange networks, as well as the quality and breadth of amenities available at each of the ILX resorts.
Sales. The Company actively sells its inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests primarily through a sales staff of approximately 170 employees at December 31, 2005, including approximately 80 sales agents at ILX’s sales offices. Prospective first-time purchasers at sales offices located at an ILX resort participate in a tour of the facilities as well as its related amenities, guided by a salesperson. At the conclusion of the tour, the terms of making a purchase, including financing alternatives, are explained to the customer. Approximately 20% of the Company’s sales have historically been made on a cash basis. However, for those customers seeking financing, the Company conducts credit pre-approval research. The Company’s point-of-sale credit pre-approval process typically includes a review of the customer’s credit history, and may include verification of employment. The Company waits until expiration of the applicable statutory waiting period, generally from three to seven days, prior to recognizing a sale as complete.
In addition to generating sales to first-time buyers, the Company’s sales force seeks to generate sales of additional Vacation Ownership Interests or Upgrades to ILX owners. Sales to ILX owners generally have lower marketing costs associated with them as these buyers tend to be more familiar with the nature of purchasing a Vacation Ownership Interest and the amenities offered at the ILX resorts. Sales to ILX owners accounted for 19.3% of Vacation Ownership Interest sales by the Company during 2005. During 2004 and 2003, sales to ILX owners accounted for 16.9% and 17.5% of the Company’s total sales, respectively.
Prior to June 1998, the Company’s inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests had historically consisted of a one-week interval that could be used on an annual or an alternate-year basis in a specified ILX resort during a specified range of dates. ILX owners could also participate in exchange networks such as II and RCI. Commencing in June 1998, the Company began offering deeded membership interests in its Premiere Vacation Club, which permit a member to stay at one or more of the participating ILX resorts for up to one week on an annual or alternate-year basis. Premiere Vacation Club members may divide their stays into shorter vacations at any time between a specified period of time, enjoy unlimited day-use and discounted goods and services at certain ILX resorts, as well as a variety of other benefits. The Company believes that the variety and flexibility of use options associated with its inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests are uniquely attractive to customers.
Customer Financing
The Company currently provides financing for approximately 80% of its Vacation Ownership Interest sales. On financed sales, the Company receives at least 10% of the aggregate sales price of Vacation Ownership Interests as a down payment. The Company typically makes financing for the remainder available to the buyer for a term of
seven years at a fixed rate of interest, which is currently approximately 14.9% to 17.9% per annum. The Company also offers reduced rates of interest on shorter financing terms and with larger down payment requirements. At December 31, 2005, the Company had a portfolio of retained Customer Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $38.5 million, of which $28.9 million were serviced by one outside vendor and had a weighted average yield of 14.5% per annum, which compared favorably to the Company’s weighted average cost of borrowings for such Customer Notes of 8.75% per annum.
The Company believes that providing available financing is essential to the successful sales and marketing of its Vacation Ownership Interest inventory. However, the Company seeks to minimize the risks associated with its financing activities by emphasizing the credit pre-approval process. In addition, the Company expends significant resources negotiating alternative repayment programs for past due accounts, so as to minimize its actual losses. Collection activities with respect to Customer Notes that the Company has hypothecated are managed internally and serviced by a third party on behalf of the lenders and the Company. In addition, the Company utilizes third party collection agencies for difficult accounts.
Prior to 1995, the Company sold the majority of its Customer Notes and retained the small remaining portion, most of which were hypothecated. Since 1995, the Company has increased the amount of Customer Notes that it retains, most of which it hypothecates, and, as a result, at December 31, 2005, the Company retained Customer Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $38.5 million as compared to $7.9 million at December 31, 1995.
Although the terms of each Customer Note vary, typically such notes are deemed past due when a scheduled payment is 30 days or more past due. In addition, a delinquency occurs when an account becomes more than 90 days past due. The Company seeks to avoid defaults by working closely with the lender and its collection agent with respect to ILX owners who become delinquent. The first collection contact typically occurs within 16 to 30 days of a payment’s due date.
At December 31, 2005, the Company had an agreement with a financial institution for a commitment of $30.0 million under which the Company may sell certain of its Customer Notes. The agreement provides for sales on a recourse basis with a purchase rate of prime plus 2.75%. Customer Notes may be sold at discounts or premiums to the principal amount in order to yield the purchase rate, with the premium held back by the financial institution as additional collateral. At December 31, 2005, $25.7 million of the $30.0 million commitment was available to the Company. The Company also has a financing commitment in the aggregate amount of $30.0 million, pursuant to which the Company may hypothecate Customer Notes that are pledged to the lender as collateral. This borrowing bears interest at prime plus 1.5%, has a draw period through 2007, and a maturity date of 2012. At December 31, 2005, $11.4 million was available to the Company under this commitment. The Company currently reserves approximately 4.5% of gross sales (including cash sales) as an allowance for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the aggregate amount of these reserves was $4.8 million, $3.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively. During 2003 and 2005, the Company’s provision for doubtful accounts exceeded actual write-offs by $1.7 million and $0.7 million respectively. In 2004, the Company’s actual write-offs exceeded the provision for doubtful accounts by $1.5 million. The Company generally writes off receivables only at such time as it accepts back a deed to the underlying property and determines the remainder uncollectible or as beneficial for income tax purposes. In 2004, the Company wrote off receivables for which it had not exhausted collection efforts and had not accepted a deed back to the underlying property, thereby accelerating such write offs. Future collections on such notes, if any, will be reported as increases to the allowance in the year collected. The timing of such write-offs is neither indicative of the date delinquency commenced nor of the date the likelihood of noncollectibility was determined. To the extent that the Company’s losses as a result of bad debt exceed its corresponding reserves, its financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Other Operations
Resort Operations. The Company also receives revenues from (i) the rental of its unsold or unused inventory of units at the ILX resorts, (ii) the sale of food, beverages and other amenities at such resorts and (iii) the management and operation of the ILX resorts and for the operating portion of homeowners’ dues paid by owners of Vacation Ownership Interests. During 2005, the Company received $19.1 million in net revenues from these operations, consisting of $12.4 million in room rental and vacation interval owner dues revenue, $4.5 million in food and beverage revenue and $2.2 million in other revenue. Of these amounts, Los Abrigados contributed $9.5 million, or 49.6% of the Company’s total resort operations revenues in 2005. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Historically, the Company’s resort operation activities have generated a less significant portion of the Company’s net profits than its core business of sales of Vacation Ownership Interests. Revenues from resort operations typically vary significantly from one ILX resort to another. In addition, changes in revenue received from these operations have not typically correlated with fluctuations in the Company’s revenues from sales of Vacation Ownership Interests. Management expects this trend to continue in the future as resort occupancy by owners of Vacation Ownership Interests, who pay a lower rate through their dues than the rate charged traditional resort guests, increases; the Company acquires or builds new resorts that are in different phases of the sales life cycle and therefore have different use patterns between vacation owners and resort guests than the existing portfolio of resorts; and
because future resorts may have different rate structures, reflective of their location and amenities, than existing resorts. The Company believes that its resort management activities directly complement the Company’s efforts with respect to the marketing and sales of Vacation Ownership Interests.
Sedona Spa. The Company’s operations include the sale of personal care products. The personal care products are marketed under its proprietary brand name “Sedona Spa.” Sedona Spa products have, and continue to be, utilized at the ILX resorts as in-room amenities and are also offered for retail sale in the resort gift shops and at the Sedona Spa at Los Abrigados. Sedona Spa products are also used by the Company as promotion incentives to potential purchasers who attend the Company’s sales tours and presentations. The Company uses direct mail and electronic mail to market Sedona Spa products to resort customers and tour participants who have previously used the products. The Company anticipates continuing to utilize Sedona Spa products for in-room amenities, promotional incentives and in its retail outlets, as well as continuing to expand marketing efforts outside the Company.
Land Sales. Since l993, the Company has also received revenues from the sale of primarily unimproved real property. These operations originated as a result of the Company’s acquisition of its wholly owned subsidiary, Genesis Investment Group, Inc. (“Genesis”), in November 1993. The sale of real property is not a core business function for the Company and, as such, the Company has not historically and does not intend in the future to devote a material portion of its resources to these operations. Typically, the Company has sold these assets as subdivided lots or large unimproved parcels. The Company intends to sell substantially all of the remaining assets during the next twenty-four months, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to sell these assets at attractive prices, if at all, during this time. Following the sale of these assets, management does not expect to regularly engage in the sale of real property.
In April 2005, the Company sold its leasehold interest in a 44-acre parcel located proximate to the Las Vegas airport, UNLV and the “Strip” in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company acquired the 50-year leasehold interest in July 2001 and sold it to Streets Las Vegas, LLC for $18.0 million. A detailed explanation of the transaction can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Resale Operations. The Company owns and operates Timeshare Resale Brokers, Inc. (“TRBI”), an Arizona company engaged in the resale of Vacation Ownership Interests on behalf of consumers and others, for which it earns a commission upon sale. The operation is based in Sedona, Arizona. To date, the operations of TRBI have not been material to the Company.
Participation in Exchange Networks
The Company believes that consumers are more likely to purchase from its inventory of Vacation Ownership Interests as a result of the Company’s participation in the Vacation Ownership Interest exchange networks operated by II and RCI, the leading exchange network operators. In the “2003 Ragatz Associates Resort Timesharing in the United States Report,” exchange opportunity was cited by purchasers of interval interests as one of the most significant factors in their motivation to purchase an interest. Membership in II or RCI allows ILX owners to exchange in a particular year their occupancy right in the unit in which they own a Vacation Ownership Interest for an occupancy right at the same time or a different time in another participating resort, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. A participating ILX owner may exchange his or her Vacation Ownership Interest for an occupancy right in another participating resort by listing the Vacation Ownership Interest as available with the exchange network operator and by requesting occupancy at another participating resort, indicating the particular resort or geographic area to which the owner desires to travel, the size of the unit desired and the period during which occupancy is desired. The exchange network assigns a rating to each listed Vacation Ownership Interest, based upon a number of factors, including the location and size of the unit, the quality of the resort and the period of the year during which the Vacation Ownership Interest is available, and attempts to satisfy the exchange request by providing an occupancy right in another Vacation Ownership Interest with a similar rating. The high rating of and demand for the ILX resorts enhance the exchange opportunities available to ILX owners. If II or RCI is unable to meet the member’s initial request, the network operator may suggest alternative resorts, based on availability. ILX also offers purchasers enrollment in a cruise exchange program in which the customer may exchange his or her Vacation Ownership Interest for or receive discounts on cruises worldwide. Exchanges and discounts through this program are offered on a variety of cruise lines to a broad selection of destinations. In addition, ILX’s Centralized Owner Services Department has established arrangements with additional resorts and smaller exchange networks through which it offers exchange opportunities and discounted vacation getaways to ILX owners. The Company believes that its direct participation in the exchange process, coupled with these additional services, provides ILX with a competitive advantage and tends to increase customer satisfaction.
Competition
ILX’s Vacation Ownership Interest plans compete both with other Vacation Ownership Interest plans as well as hotels, motels, condominium developments and second homes. ILX considers the direct competitors of individual resorts to also include alternative accommodations, including hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and small vacation ownership operators located within the immediate geographic vicinity of such resort. This is particularly
true with respect to its CARs that tend to attract purchasers whose decision to buy a Vacation Ownership Interest is likely to be influenced by the convenience of the resort to their principal residence.
The Vacation Ownership Interest industry consists of a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators. In addition, some of the world’s most widely-recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies sell vacation ownership interests under their brand names, including Marriott Ownership Resorts, The Walt Disney Company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., Cendant Corporation, and their subsidiaries and affiliates. In addition, other publicly traded companies such as, Silverleaf Resorts, Inc. and Bluegreen Corporation currently compete or may compete in the future with the Company. Furthermore, significant competition exists in other markets in which the Company currently operates or is developing vacation ownership resorts. Many entities with which the Company competes have significantly greater access to financial, sales and marketing and other resources than those of the Company and may be able to grow at a more rapid rate or more profitably as a result. In recent years there has been significant consolidation in the industry and in addition several entities have encountered challenges, resulting in their attempt to reorganize through either consolidation or bankruptcy. Management anticipates competition to increase in the future as a result of consolidation in the vacation ownership industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete with such companies.
Governmental Regulation
General. The Company’s marketing and sales activities and other resort operations are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government and the states in which the Company’s resorts are located and in which its Vacation Ownership Interests are marketed and sold. Federal legislation to which the Company is or may be subject includes the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1968 and 1991. Many states have adopted legislation as well as specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of Vacation Ownership Interests. The laws of most states, including Arizona, require a designated state authority to approve a detailed offering statement describing the Company and all material aspects of the resort and sale of Vacation Ownership Interests at such resort. In addition, the laws of most states in which the Company sells Vacation Ownership Interests grant the purchaser of a Vacation Ownership Interest the right to rescind a contract of purchase at any time within a statutory rescission period. Furthermore, most states have other laws which regulate the Company’s activities, such as real estate licensure laws, travel sales licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and labor laws. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations to which it is currently subject.
Environmental Matters. Under applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate, remediate and remove hazardous or toxic substances at such property, and may be held liable for property damage and for investigation, remediation and removal costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws typically impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The costs associated with compliance with such regulations may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on such property, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow against such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at such disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Finally, the owner or operator of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. In connection with its ownership and operation of its properties, the Company may be potentially liable for such costs.
The Company does not always conduct Phase I environmental assessments at the ILX resorts, properties under development and properties subject to acquisition. Because many of the Company’s resorts are typically found in remote locations, it does not consider the risks of environmental liabilities significant enough to warrant the performance of Phase I assessments at such locations. Failure to obtain such reports may result in the Company acquiring or developing unusable property or assuming certain liabilities which could have been avoided if the Company had the information typically discovered in a Phase I report. However, when appropriate, the Company has in the past and will in the future obtain Phase I, or more elaborate, reports. To date, the Company has obtained environmental reports with respect to four of the ILX resorts. In addition, the Company does conduct significant in-house due diligence prior to the acquisition of any real property interests. To date, the Company’s investigations of its properties have not revealed any environmental liability that the Company believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business, assets, financial condition or results of operations, nor is the Company aware of any such material environmental liability.
The Company believes that its properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. The Company has not been notified by any governmental authority or any third party, and is not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of its present properties.
Other Regulations. Under various state and federal laws governing housing and places of public accommodation, the Company is required to meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although management believes that the Company’s resorts are substantially in compliance with present requirements of such laws, the Company may incur additional costs of compliance in connection with the development of new resorts, or conversion or renovation of ILX resorts. Future legislation may impose additional requirements on owners with respect to access by disabled persons. The aggregate costs associated with compliance with such regulations are not currently known, and, while such costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company, such costs could be substantial. Limitations or restrictions on the completion of certain renovations may limit application of the Company’s growth strategy in certain instances or reduce profit margins on the Company’s operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 840 employees, of which approximately 530 were employed on a full-time basis. The Company believes relations with its employees are good and none of its employees are represented by labor unions. The Company has adopted an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the benefit of its employees.
Insurance
The Company carries comprehensive liability, business interruption, title, fire and storm insurance with respect to the ILX resorts, with policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties, which the Company believes are adequate. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses caused by floods, acts of terrorism, or acts of war) that are not generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, the Company could lose its capital invested in a resort, as well as the anticipated future revenues from such resort and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Corporate Headquarters
The Company leases 10,455 square feet for its corporate offices in Phoenix, Arizona, under a lease that expires on January 31, 2010.
