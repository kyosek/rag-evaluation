ITEM 2. Properties.
Description of our Mineral Property Interests
Our properties are located in Argentina and Peru and all are in the exploration stage. These properties are without known reserves and the proposed plan of exploration detailed below is exploratory in nature. The individual properties are described below.
Atena Property
On December 12, 2007, we entered into an assignment agreement with Proyectos Mineros S.A. (“PMSA”) (formerly Recursos Maricunga S.A.) to acquire PMSA’s right to explore and an option (the “Atena Option”) to purchase certain mineral rights on properties known as the Atena Gold Project (“Atena”) located in the Salta Province of Argentina (the “Atena Property”). The Atena Property consists of an aggregate 3,676 hectares. PMSA acquired its right to explore and the Atena Option to purchase the mineral rights to these properties from Rio Tinto Mining & Exploration Ltd., Argentine Branch.
The mineral rights on the Atena Property consist of mining claims referred to in Argentina as “minas” which remain valid so long as the annual fee referred to as “canon minero” is paid.
Pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement, we have issued to PMSA 1,500,000 shares of our common stock and paid PMSA $60,000. We will acquire 100% of this Atena Option if we incur a minimum of an additional $3,500,000 in work commitment expenditures on the Atena Property (the “Atena Expenditures”) and issue 6,000,000 shares of our common stock to PMSA in accordance with the following schedule:
·
$500,000 in Atena Expenditures, plus an additional issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock on or before March 15, 2009;
·
an additional $1,000,000 payment in Atena Expenditures, plus a further issuance of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock on or before March 15, 2010; and
·
a final $2,000,000 payment in Atena Expenditures on or before March 15, 2011.
As of March 15, 2009, we had not issued the 2,000,000 shares of our common stock nor incurred $500,000 in Atena Expenditures as required under the Assignment Agreement in order to be able to exercise the Atena Option. PMSA agreed to waive the obligation that we incur $500,000 in Atena Expenditures by March 15, 2009 contingent upon our issuance to PMSA of the 2,000,000 shares of our common stock as required under the Assignment Agreement by March 31, 2009.
We will acquire 100% of the Atena Option once we have completed our commitments under the Atena Expenditures and issued shares of our common stock to PMSA, as set forth above, on or before March 15, 2011. Following the completion of this acquisition and payment of the consideration set forth above, we will grant to PMSA a 1% net smelter returns royalty. The Atena Option grants us the exclusive possession of the properties for mineral exploration, together with the right to purchase the minerals rights to these properties upon exercise of the Atena Option.

Recent Exploration Work and Proposed Exploration Program
A Phase 1 exploration program was completed on the Atena Property in February 2008. During this phase, field geologists collected composite samples approximately every 50 metres along the entire-36 kilometre vein system on the project area. The samples were sent to ALS Chemex, the South American division of the ALS Laboratory Group, for analysis. Results of these samples indicated an anomalous area of approximately five kilometres by three kilometres, which is the subject of follow-up exploration in a Phase 2 program. The Phase 2 program comprises of trenching and detailed sampling, as well as detailed geological mapping. These activities are expected to outline the shape and tenor of pay shoots which can then be tested in the subsurface by diamond drilling in a Phase 3 program. While the project area lies at 3900m above sea level in the altiplano or puna of northwest Argentina, fieldwork can be conducted all year-round. The Phase 2 program has commenced and a trenching contract has been granted to a Salta-based operator to undertake the work. Phase 2 is expected to be completed by March 2009, after which the Phase 3 drilling program is anticipated to commence.
Our anticipated exploration expenses at the Atena Project for the next twelve months are as follows:
Amira, Amira Norte and Esparta II Properties
Effective March 17, 2008, we entered into an assignment agreement, dated March 17, 2008, with PMSA, whereby PMSA assigned to us PMSA’s right to explore and an option (the “Amira-Esparta Option”) to purchase a 90% interest in the mineral rights of three mining properties referred to as “Amira”, “Amira Norte” and “Esparta II”, located in the Province of Salta, Argentina (the “Amira-Esparta Properties”). Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with PMSA, PMSA has assigned to us all of PMSA’s rights and obligations under an option agreement by and between PMSA and the registered titleholder to the Amira-Esparta Properties, Ms. Silvia Rene Rodriguez, in consideration of our recognizing to PMSA a 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Amira-Esparta Properties. The mineral rights underlying the Amira-Esparta Properties consist of manifestations of discovery (referred to as
- 26 -
“manifestciones de descubrimientos”), which are a form of mineral title that allows the conversion of exploration concessions (referred to as “cateos”) to mining claims (referred to as “minas”). The manifestations of discovery are used as a basis for location of mining claims, but do not have a definite area until the claims are proposed. Within a period following designation of a manifestation of discovery, the claimant may do further exploration, if necessary, to determine the size and shape of the ore body. All of these forms of mineral title require the payment of an annual fee referred to as “canon minero.” In order for us to keep our interest in good standing and to exercise the Amira-Esparta Option, we must make the following payments to Ms. Rodriguez, as set forth in the underlying option agreement:
·
$75,000 on or before January 19, 2009;
·
an additional payment of $150,000 on or before January 19, 2010;
·
an additional payment of $200,000 on or before January 19, 2011; and
·
a final payment of $1,000,000 on or before January 19, 2012, which shall also be the final payment required and such payment will cause the Amira-Esparta Option to have been automatically exercised.
As of January 19, 2009, we had not paid Ms. Rodriguez the $75,000 payment required in order to be able to exercise the Amira-Esparta Option. Ms. Rodriguez has agreed to modify the payment terms for this payment. As a result of this modification to the payment terms, we are now required to pay Ms. Rodriguez $25,000 on or before April 1, 2009 and $50,000 on or before June 19, 2009 in order to satisfy this obligation.
Geology and Mineralization
The Atena project is located within the Sierra de Taca Taca range approximately 15 kilometers from the Taca Taca porphyry deposit. The Sierra de Taca Taca range is mostly underlain by granodiorites of the Taca Taca Formation of Ordovician age with early Permian rhyolite and andesite volcanic and volcaniclastics dominating the western portions of the range.
Oligocene subvolcanic porphyry intrusions commonly intrude these older units. Some of these are associated with hydrothermal porphyry-style mineralization such as is found at Taca Taca. In addition, quartenary basaltic centers, such as Mt Aracar which covers the western margin of the Atena project area, as well as rhyolite domes are also observed within the district.
The project area itself is largely underlain by biotite monzogranite with common enclaves of mafic-rich granodiorite porphyry. These rocks have been extensively intruded by pink aplite and pegmatite sills which give large outcrop areas a banded/bedded appearance. The granitoids are also cut by meter-wide lamprophyre dikes which are assumed to be tertiary in age.
Across the project area there are numerous vein sets and discrete lode zones that consist of multiple anastomozing lodes and link structures. The lode zones form in Northward-trending principle shears, northwest secondary shears, and northeast tension veins, and form a brittle shear array with a sinistral strike-slip component and as yet uncertain dip-slip component. There is a distinctive gray clay-chlorite-carbonate alteration in the partly sheared rock between the branches of the lodes that makes that area recessive relative to unaltered granitoids.
The lodes have a variety of components the proportions of which vary according to lode thickness and orientation. The components are:
·
sheared host rock with hematite-clay-chlorite alteration typical of the granite and fine silica-hematite alteration in the aplite and lamprophyre;
·
brown iron-manganese-magnesium-calcium carbonate that forms a matrix, patches, veins and breccia fill in the shear zones. The most common form in the shear lodes is a banded rock with altered host rock lenses and infill carbonate that is massive and crystalline. There is also a breccia with the same components and veins with comb-textured coarse carbonate crystals;
- 27 -
·
clear microcrystalline quartz veins and pods lying in the shear zones and dominating them locally. Variations on this quartz are: a gray shear textured overprint with very fine-grained sulfides; a mustard green overprint due to scorodite generally in breccia zones in the quartz and interpreted as oxidised arsenic-sulfides. This is not to be confused with silver-green sericite alteration of feldspars in the granitoids near the shear zones;
The main set of northward-trending shears are dominated by shear , silica-hematite, carbonate and quartz, the northwest lodes are shears with some silica-hematite and minor carbonate and the northeast lodes are dominantly quartz vein.
In some pits along the northward-trending lodes malachite stain and orange-yellow jarosite-limonite boxworks after sulfides have been observed. This staining generally coincides with segments of these lodes which contain noticeable, but not dominant, quartz infill. There are also oxides after carbonate in such lodes but it is dominantly black-brown manganese oxide-limonite. In the quartz dominated northeast-trending lodes, there are distinct domains with green scorodite stain and local jarosite-limonite stain. These tend to be associated with the sheared or brecciated part of the microcrystalline quartz where there is recognizable gray sulfidic shears or infill in the quartz as well. Since the sulfide/sulfate/oxide points tend to have the best grade in the existing sample set it is inferred that sulfides in the quartz-bearing part of the lodes define shoots that have the better chance of gold mineralization.
Certain metal associations have been recognized from the results of the sampling programs, in particular those of Au-Ag-Bi-Pb and Cu-Ag-As. The former association is typical of shallow and the latter of intermediate level hydrothermal mineralization related to intermediate (e.g,, dacitic magma). This is consistent with the spatial association of the biotite lamprophyre dikes in the same structures as the lode and the common alteration types associated with dike and lode. It is therefore possible, but not essential, that there is porphyry Cu-Mo-Au mineralisation in the deeper part of this system. So far, apart from the relationships already noted, there is no direct evidence for related porphyry mineralisation like that at Taca Taca. However, at Taca Taca there are quartz-sulfide lodes similar to those at Atena that lie in northward-trending shears that overprint the more widespread fracture and veinlet controlled Cu-Mo-Au mineralization.
Proposed Exploration Program
The Amira-Esparta Properties located in the province of Salta, Argentina, are located in close proximity to our interests discussed above under the subheading “Atena Property” and together these properties form a part of a mining project referred to as the “Atena Project.” The location and scope of our exploration program activities on the Atena Property will be extended to also include the Amira-Esparta Properties.
Location and Access
The Atena Project covers an area of some 9,281 hectares in the "puna" (altiplano) of Salta Province in northwestern Argentina approximately 350km from the provincial capital. The project lies at 3,700 meters above sea level. Access to the property is by provincial roads from the town of Tolar Grande to Taca Taca.

Previous Exploration History
The veins at the Atena Project were first discovered in the mid 1950s by a prospector from Salta who opened up a few trenches and pits on Cu-oxide showings on some of the quartz veins.
The vein system was then rediscovered by RTZ Mining & Exploration Argentina Branch (“RTZ”) during their porphyry and epithermal gold exploration campaign in the northwestern portion of Argentina in 2003. RTZ undertook three campaigns over the Atena property, starting with a reconnaissance sampling program of the veins (26 samples) which was followed-up by a further 152 grab samples. In addition, some 118 samples were taken from a number of shallow trenches. Grab samples by RTZ returned up to 8.9g/t Au.
When RTZ decided to get out of epithermal gold exploration, the exploration-with-option-to-purchase rights over Atena Property were acquired by Proyectos Mineros, a privately-owned Argentine exploration company. Proyectos Mineros subsequently acquired the additional property comprising the Aetna Project and these properties interest and agreements with all the underlying rights and obligations that have been assigned to us.

Cerro Amarillo Property
On January 8, 2008, we entered into an assignment agreement with PMSA to acquire PMSA’s right to explore and option (the “Cero Amarillo Option”) to purchase certain mineral rights on properties known as the Cerro Amarillo Property located in the Departamento Malargue, Province of Mendoza, Argentina (the “Cerro Amarillo Property”). The Cerro Amarillo Property consists of an aggregate 14,221.7 hectares.
The mineral rights underlying the Cerro Amarillo Property consist of manifestations of discovery (referred to as “manifestciones de descubrimientos”), which are a form of mineral title that allows the conversion of exploration concessions (referred to as “cateos”) to mining claims (referred to as “minas”). The manifestations of discovery are used as a basis for location of mining claims, but do not have a definite area until the claims are proposed. Within a period following designation of a manifestation of discovery, the claimant may do further exploration, if necessary, to determine the size and shape of the ore body. All of these forms of mineral title require the payment of an annual fee referred to as “canon minero.”
Pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement, we issued to PMSA 300,000 shares of our common stock and paid PMSA $10,000 in July 2008. We will acquire 100% of the Cerro Amarillo Option if we incur a minimum of $450,000 in work commitment expenditures on this property (the “Cerro Amarillo Expenditures”) and issue 2,100,000 shares of our common stock to PMSA in accordance with the following schedule:
·
$200,000 in Cerro Amarillo Expenditures, plus a further issuance of 300,000 shares of our common stock on or before January 8, 2009;
·
an additional $250,000 payment of Cerro Amarillo Expenditures, plus a further issuance of 600,000 shares of our common stock on or before January 8, 2010;
·
an additional issuance of 600,000 shares of our common stock on or before January 8, 2011; and
·
a final issuance of 600,000 shares of our common stock on or before January 8, 2012.
As of January 8, 2009, we had not issued the 300,000 shares of our common stock nor incurred $200,000 in Cerro Amarillo Expenditures as required under the assignment agreement in order to be able to exercise the Cerro Amarillo Option. PMSA agreed to waive the obligation that we incur $200,000 in Cerro Amarillo Expenditures by January 8, 2009, contingent upon our issuance to PMSA of the 300,000 shares of our common stock as required under the Assignment Agreement by March 31, 2009.
If we exercise the Cerro Amarillo Option to acquire 100% of the Cerro Amarillo Property, then we must issue an additional 3,000,000 shares of our common stock to PMSA. The Cerro Amarillo Option is subject to a 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Cerro Amarillo Property in favor of the underlying titleholder. The Cerro Amarillo Option contains certain work expenditure obligations, which are intended to be satisfied by the Cerro Amarillo Expenditures.
Location and Access
The Cerro Amarillo Property is situated in the southern Mendoza Province of Argentina near the ski resort of Las Leñas. The Cerro Amarillo Property consists of approximately 14,222 hectares and is located at a latitude of 35° 16’ 25” S and a longitude of 70° 09’ 22” approximately 25 kilometers due east of the Chilean border. This property lies at an elevation of about 3,400 meters above sea level in the foothills of the Cordillera. Access is a few minutes by helicopter or a four hour ride on horseback from the Las Leñas resort, situated 15 kilometers to the northeast.

Previous Exploration History
The Cerro Amarillo Property was discovered by Minera Aguilar (St. Joe Minerals) in 1970 as part of an exploration program to follow-up on stream geochemistry. Work carried out on the Cerro Amarillo Property since its discovery is as follows:
·
-1973 St. Joe Minerals undertook geological mapping, surface geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveying (27km of Induced Polarization or IP) of the Cerro Amarillo colour anomaly.
·
- 1995 Solitario carried out further rock geochemistry and additional geological reconnaissance.
·
- 1996 Phelps Dodge undertook thin section petrography, reconnaissance mapping, and limited rock chip sampling of the Cajon Grande anomaly.

·
- 2007 Latin American Minerals held an option on the property but conducted little work during their tenure.
Geology and Mineralization
Cerro Amarillo is located at the southern end of the highly productive Late Miocene - Pliocene magmatic arc that hosts the El Teniente and Los Bronces porphyry giants in Chile. It forms part of a cluster of intrusions of different age and composition associated with a 60 kilometer long north to northeast-trending, arcuate thrust fault known as the Las Leñas fault. This fault is considered to have formed in Permian to Triassic times and to have been reactivated under a compressive regime during the Miocene. The intrusions include large, six kilometer by four kilometer, barren bodies of equigranular granodiorite as well as smaller stocks of mostly tonalitic porhyry with which the two known porphyry occurrences as well as the several colour anomalies are associated.
Cerro Amarillo Occurrence
Our mapping demonstrated that the Cerro Amarillo prospect contains a classical porphyry system that includes stockwork-, disseminated-, skarn-, breccia- and vein-styles of mineralization. The system is centered on a quartz rich dioritic porphyry plug approximately 300 meter in diameter. The plug is enclosed within a 600 by 900 meter shell of hydrothermal breccia. This system intrudes a sequence of Permo-Triassic dacitic volcanics, Jurassic calcareous sediments and younger andesitic volcanics. There are distinct unconformities between each of the three formations. All of the formations have shallow westerly dips. The alteration system is zoned in a similar way to many classical porphyry deposits . The core porphyry is overprinted by strong magnetite-quartz-biotite "potassic" alteration. The enclosing breccia is overprinted by strong sericite-quartz-pyrite "phyllic" alteration. Adjacent calcareous sediments have developed skarn alteration out to a radius of several hundred metres. Volcanics and some sediments outside the skarn have developed extensive albite-pyrite alteration mineralization styles at Cerro Amarillo are also zoned. The central porphyry plug contains abundant "A" type quartz-magnetite stockworks. Chalcopyrite occurs in the stockworks and disseminated in the altered intrusive. Fresh sulphides are visible at surface. Consequently, the supergene zone is likely to be thin and poorly developed. However, within the surrounding hydrothermal breccia zone, deep weathering and abundant pyrite may result in an excellent supergene trap for copper and gold leached from the central porphyry and the breccia itself. The skarns occur in an almost perfect ring at the intersection between vertical cylinder of breccia and the shallow dipping calcareous sediments. At the current level of erosion, almost the entire ring is exposed at surface. Garnet skarns are most abundant with lesser amounts of epidote, sulphide, hematite and magnetite. Sparse peripheral veins containing barite, hematite, galena and sphalerite occur out to a radius of approximately one kilometer from the centre of the system. Previous samples have appeared to suggest these veins may contain high gold grades, but their volume is limited. Ground magnetics and alteration patterns suggest that there is potential for the system to enlarge with depth.
- 32 -
Cajon Grande Occurrence
Cajon Grande contains a centre of porphyry style mineralization with an intense stockwork of magnetite-actinolite-garnet veins and a small amount of skarn. However, Cu-Au mineralization is weakly developed. A series of peripheral siderite-barite-base metal veins may contain high silver or gold values, but they are too small and widely spaced to be of economic interest. However, a 50 meter wide zone of hydrothermal breccia with open space filling provides us with a significant target.
Colour Anamalies (Alteration Zones)
The C2 anomaly covers a one kilometer diameter diatreme breccia that cuts through the same stratigraphy as Cerro Amarillo. The pipe may be a feeder vent for some of the Jurassic andesite volcanics. The breccias and surrounding sediments are only weakly altered. Only traces of copper mineralization have been observed within the pipe.
The Dead Cow anomaly is probably part of a porphyry style mineralization system. The area includes a variety of porphyries tuffs and sediments. The rocks are affected by phyllic and albite alteration and minor skarn alteration. No significant mineralization was observed in the visited parts, but some sparse magnetite stockworks near the western margin warrant further investigation. The skarn volume is too small to be of interest and the phyllic/albite altered rocks appear un-mineralized.
Recent Exploration Work and Proposed Exploration Program
The Cerro Amarillo Property is untested property that has drill targets indicated by geophysics, as well as a number of other unexplored prospective areas. Although a number of drill targets have been outlined by previous work, recent exploration work involved additional exploration by detailed mapping and sampling on the whole of the Cerro Amarillo Property, as well as the region with a view to identifying additional drill targets before undertaking a first stage drill program. In addition, some ten kilometer of access road will be constructed in anticipation of the drill program.
With respect to the timeframe, fieldwork can be conducted for approximately nine months of each year at the Cerro Amarillo Property, which lies in a snow belt. Because of the onset of the austral winter and the occurrence of significant snow, the drilling can only commence in the spring and summer seasons.
In February 2008, we commenced exploration on the Cerro Amarillo Property in Mendoza, Argentina. The Phase 1 program, designed to further identify trench and drill targets, comprises detailed mapping and sampling together with ground magnetic surveying. We have established a camp on the Cerro Amarillo Property from which exploration activities will be conducted. An international geological consultant, supported by local geologists and field technicians, leads this project, which was completed in eight weeks.
The detailed mapping confirmed that the Cerro Amarillo Property occurrences contain a classical porphyry-style mineralized system that includes stockwork, disseminated, breccias, skarn, and vein-types of mineralization. These types of mineralization are zoned with a central porphyry plug containing vein stockworks together with disseminated mineralization This plug is surrounded by mineralized hydrothermal breccias (shattered rock) with abundant pyrite that may result in an excellent supergene trap for leached copper and gold. Skarn replacement mineralization occurs in almost a perfect ring at the intersection of the vertical cylinder of breccias and the shallow-dipping calcareous sedimentary sequence. At the current level of erosion, almost the entire ring is exposed. Sparse peripheral veins occur out to a radius of approximately one kilometer. The unique level of exposure of this system could potentially allow the core stockwork-disseminated mineralization, the supergene breccias, and the skarns to be extracted in a single open-pit with a very low stripping ratio.
The second phase is expected to commence in either September of October of 2009 upon granting of a permit for the construction of a drill road up to the prospect. In addition to building the access road, an exploration camp will be established on the property and the first 1000 meters of a 3000 meter drill program will be carried out to test the drill targets on the Cerro Amarillo Property. The remaining 2000 meters of drilling is expected to be completed in early in 2010.

Our anticipated exploration expenses at the Cerro Amarillo Project for the next twelve months are as follows:
Peruvian Gold Sands Property
On September 29, 2008 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a Mineral Right Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Temasek Investments Inc. (“Temasek”), a company incorporated under the laws of Panama in relation to the Peru property. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we acquired four separate options from Temasek, each providing for the acquisition of a twenty-five percent interest in certain mineral rights in Peru described in Annex 1 of the Option Agreement (the “Mineral Rights”) pursuant to which we could potentially acquire one hundred percent of the Mineral Rights. The Mineral Rights are owned by Compañía Minera Marañón S.A.C. (“Minera Marañón”). Bacon Hill Invest Inc. (“Bacon Hill”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Panama and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek, owns 999 shares of the 1,000 shares of Minera Marañón that are issued and outstanding. Temasek owns the single remaining share of Minera Marañón. The acquisition of each twenty-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights will occur through the transfer to us of twenty-five percent of the outstanding shares of Bacon Hill.
- 34 -
A description of the Mineral Rights is set forth below:
We may exercise the initial twenty-five percent option, which provided for the acquisition of a twenty-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after fulfilling the following conditions:
· payment of $375,000 to Temasek upon execution of the Option Agreement;
· issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek within five business days from the Effective Date; and
· payment of an additional $375,000 to Temasek within ninety days of the Effective Date.
Since the execution of the Option Agreement, we have paid a total of $750,000 and issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement and completed the acquisition of the initial twenty-five percent option, which provided for the acquisition of a twenty-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights.
- 35 -
We may exercise the second twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a fifty percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after fulfilling the following conditions within six months of the Effective Date:
·
payment of an additional $1,250,000 to Temasek, and
·
issuance of 2,000,000 additional shares of our common stock to Temasek.
We may exercise the third twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a seventy-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after fulfilling the following conditions within twelve months of the Effective Date:
·
payment of an additional $3,000,000 to Temasek, and
·
issuance of 2,000,000 additional shares of our common stock to Temasek.
We may exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after fulfilling the following conditions within eighteen months of the Effective Date:
·
payment of an additional $5,000,000 to Temasek, and
·
issuance of 4,000,000 additional shares of our common stock to Temasek.
Upon our acquisition of a 100% interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek will hold its single share of Minera Marañón in trust for our sole benefit and shall hold the share strictly in accordance with our instructions.
Upon our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek is entitled to an annual 2.5% net returns royalty related to the Mineral Rights. However, if we pay Temasek $2,000,000 within ninety days of our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek will only be entitled to an annual 1.0% net returns royalty related to the Mineral Rights.
If we exercise the second twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a fifty percent interest in the Mineral Rights, and we fail to acquire a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, we and Temasek will form a joint venture in which we will be wholly responsible for developing a feasible mining project and all necessary facilities and Temasek shall retain a carried free interest in the mining rights. If we do not develop a feasible mining project within three years of the Effective Date, we will be responsible pay Temasek an advance minimum mining royalty of $500,000 per year, which will be deducted from Temasek’s net return royalty on the Mineral Rights.
Location and Access
The Gold Sands Project in Peru is our principal project. It comprises an area of 38200 ha (382 kilometer) along the interface of the Andean chain and the Amazon foreland basin in Northeastern Peru. We have established land positions in two out of the three alluvial camps that exist in this area (the Alegría, Condorcanqui, and Manseriche Alluvial Camps). Of these, the Manseriche Camp is the largest. These camps straddle the boundary of the Loreto (eastern) and Amazonas (western) departments of Northeastern Peru approximately 350 kilometers from the regional center of Iquitos (population 400,000) which lies on the Amazon River. Both Iquitos to the east, as well as Tarapoto to the south are served with daily flights from Lima. The project area can be reached from either of these towns by charter flights while supplies and heavy equipment can be barged in from either Yurimaguas (on the Rio Huallaga) or Iquitos, or trucked in from Bagua on a fair weather road to the village of Saramiriza located in the center of the Manseriche Alluvial Camp along the southwestern bank of the Rio Marañón, roughly in the center of the project area. We are establishing a logistics and administration base in the village of Saramiriza located in the center of the Manseriche field on the southeastern bank of the Rio Marañón.

Previous Exploration History
A description of the work carried out on the property which comprises the Mineral Rights since its discovery is as follows:
·
1940s - A German company operated a 10 meter dragline some 10 kilometers downstream from Saramiriza at Puerto Elisa. This company left as a consequence of World War II.
·
1979-80 - Cia Panasa exploited the El Banco Island, 14 kilometers northwest from Saramiriza. Heavy earth moving equipment was used with positive results.
·
- A group of Canadians operated a small suction dredge south of Saramiriza near the oil pipeline. They retired for technical and judicial reasons resulting from their proximity to the pipeline.
·
- Mutiferros SA, a Brazilian company, introduced four suction dredges, but discovered that suction dredges were inappropriate.
·
1990-92 - Cia Monica de Iquitos drilled off a 1000 ha lease and proved-up grades of some 300mg/m3 to a depth of 32 meters. They were unable to finance the project, and the lease was abandoned. This lease was subsequently picked-up by Lomas del Marañón SA in 1995.
·
- Matsag Minerals, a company controlled by Glencor of Switzerland, acquired a number of leases near Puerto Elisa covering a large abandoned meander where the river had straightened its course subsequent to 1954. They installed a three foot bucket line dredge which was intended as a bulk sampling tool, although no drilling was done. These leases were subsequently acquired by Lomas del Marañón.
·
1995-97 - Lomas del Marañón installed a good camp and operated a floating backhoe/ washing plant which was operated despite a poorly designed treatment plant of sluices which gave low recoveries.
·
- IHC Meerwede of Holland undertakes preliminary metallurgical test work and engineering studies.
·
1999-2000 - Brazilian private interests, under the technical direction of an experienced and well regarded alluvial engineer Peter Rich, established viability and attempted to get the project financed in Canada. Due to the low gold price at the time, as well as the conservative approach adopted by major mining companies, the project failed to get traction.

2007-08 - Temasek Investments Inc, reacting to recommendations originally made by Peter Rich, consolidated the project area by staking additional ground in the Alegria, Condorcanqui, and Manseriche Alluvial Camps.
Geology and Mineralization
Peru annually produces some six million ounces of gold. Of this, nearly fifty percent is derived from Peru's largest gold mine, Yanacocha (Newmont), and close to ten percent comes from the alluvial workings in the Madre de Dios river system. Alluvial production in Peru has recently risen from about 200000 oz Au in 1991 to over 500000 oz Au in 2005.
Although Peru has numerous small alluvial gold occurrences, there are only four major alluvial gold fields: Marañón-Santiago, Iquitos, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios. Large scale alluvial gold deposits tend to form in environments associated with convergent plate boundaries, particularly at the interface between fold belts and foreland basins. In addition, a necessary requirement for the development of such gold deposits is a metaliferous (gold-rich) hinterland and a river system that can transfer gold from the zone of production in the upper reaches of

the drainage basin, along the main trunk of the river system (zone of transfer) to the zone of deposition, usually where the river profile flattens-out at the limit between the highlands and alluvial plains.
In the case of the Manseriche Alluvial Camp, the Marañón and Santiago rivers rise from peak elevations of 2900 meters and 3500 meters respectively, and travel a distance of some 900 kilometers before converging at the Manseriche Gorge which lies at an elevation of 170 m asl. From there, the Marañón (and later the Amazon) must travel another 4000 kilometers before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. With respect to a metalliferous hinterland, the Marañón-Santiago drainage basin is home to some of the largest gold deposits and gold mining operations in the world. These include Newmont's Yanacocha (40 m oz Au), Goldfield's Cerro Corona (which currently produce 350000 oz Au per annum), and Aurelian's Fruta del Norte deposit (14 m oz Au).
While the geology of the project area has no effect on the gold mineralization other than the morphological control of the Rio Marañón, it is the sequence of geological events which has importance in the formation of the "gold sands" in the Manseriche Camp.
The age of most of the gold mineralization in the highlands of the Marañón-Santiago river system is tertiary, and specifically Miocene. However, Eocene-aged tectonism resulted in the formation of the eastern foothills of the Andes which effectively formed a barrier directing all erosion from the hinterland towards a basin on the western side of the Manseriche Gorge. Glacial erosion of the gold deposits in the hinterland resulted in tills and moraines which were subsequently concentrated in glacio-fluvial deposits by melting ice and intense rains in interglacial periods of which a number have been identified in Peru. These sediments were retained by the eastern fold belt of anticlines.
What may have been a key event was the Pajacuas thrust event during the Pliocene Era, which led to the breaching of the closed basin and the subsequent formation of the Manseriche Gorge. This released the gold-rich glacio-fluvial sediments to be reconcentrated and deposited in the Rio Marañón flood plain east of the Gorge.
The sequence of constant erosion, glacio-fluvial concentration, fluvial transport, collection in an intermediate (or series of intermediate) basin(s), and final alluvial concentration in the Rio Marañón flood plain, provided the mixing and concentration which accounts for the regular gold values in the sands and gravels as indicated by the Cia Monica de Iquitos report.
Monica de Iquitos Report
Between 1990 -1992, Cia Monica de Iquitos undertook significant explorations efforts on their lease south of Saramiriza, and on ground which now forms part of the Constitution Mining controlled property. Monica adopted a professional approach to the exploration program and identified paleochannels from aerial photos and satellite images.
Subsequently, a 1000 ha area was drilled by six inch Churn drills on 100 meter by 100 meter centers to a depth of 18 meters, where a fairly constant thin clay layer separating an upper sequence of gravels form a lower sequence. Of the 500 holes drilled, five were drilled to 32 meters without reaching bedrock.
This work was then checked by a Russian government consulting company, Sojuzkarta, which used a ten inch rotary helicoid drill to check holes down to 18 meters. In addition, they took bulk samples by backhoe. Their drill results as well as those from the collection of 85 m3 bulk samples were used to estimate a grade of 295 mg/m3 using a finess of 850 for correction to pure gold. This number is considered to be an underestimate as recovery was done utilizing 12 m X 0.7m sluices with jute carpets which would not have been effective for the recovery of fine gold.
The study also indicated that grades tended to increase with depth, particularly within the lower sequence of gravels. Furthermore, the drill logs suggested that gold grades are constant laterally, with vertical variation being related to high or low energy gravels and sands, as well as the age of the sequences (upper versus lower).
Additional studies have shown that much of the gold tends to be considerably fine in size, indicating the possibility of increased recovery (and therefore grade) with appropriate recovery techniques (i.e., jigs and bowl concentrators).

Proposed Exploration Program
An exploration base camp is being set up in the town of Saramiriza, which is located in the center of the Manseriche alluvial camp on the western bank of the Marañón.
A seismic survey will be conducted along selected lines across the Marañón gravels in order to define the gravel-bedrock contact. This information is needed to plan a drilling program and to assist with locating drill collar positions. The selection of seismic lines will made on the basis of interpretation of aerial photos and satellite images, as well as from reconnaissance-scale mapping of sedimentary features. Scout drilling utilizing churn drills will be undertaken on favorable areas, and anomalous zones will be followed up with reverse circulation drilling in order to fully develop resources and reserves. These activities are expected to be carried out over the next twelve months.
Bulk samples collected by backhoe and/or excavator will be required for metallurgical testing as well as to confirm drill results. At the same time, mine development planning, process design, and other engineering studies will be conducted with a view to completing a feasibility study within an 18 month period. Permitting work will be initiated as early in the exploration and development cycle as possible, so that trial or pilot dredging can be started as soon as feasibility has been established.
Anticipated costs for the next twelve months are as follows:
