SUMMARY OF PROPERTIES

(4)Included in GLA, Annualized Base Rent and Anchor Store Tenants is 96,000 square feet of related tenants at The Marketplace at Arundel Mills which is open for business.
Diversified Tenant Base
Because our properties contain various retail formats under one roof, we believe that our tenant base represents one of the more diversified mixes of retailers in the industry. Despite the size of our properties, we have an average of 167 tenants per property and no tenant represents more than 3.4% of 2002 base rent. We further believe that the overall financial stability of our tenant base is strong given the diversity of our retailers and the large number of manufacturer outlet tenants. Our universe of tenants continues to expand.
