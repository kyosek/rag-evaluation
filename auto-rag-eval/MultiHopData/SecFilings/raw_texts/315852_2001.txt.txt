ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
On December 31, 2001, the Company held working interests in 9,719 gross (4,743 net) productive wells and royalty interests in an additional 215 wells. Including its 50% share of Great Lakes' reserves, its properties contained, net to its interest, estimated proved reserves of 389 Bcf of gas and 21 million barrels of oil and NGL or a total of 513 Bcfe.
PROVED RESERVES
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves over the past five years.
(a) Oil and NGL are converted to mcfe at a rate of 6 (m)cf per barrel.
At year-end 2001, the Company engaged the following independent petroleum consultants to evaluate its reserves: H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. (Southwest), DeGolyer and MacNaughton (Southwest and Gulf Coast), and Wright and Company, Inc. (Appalachia). These engineers were employed primarily based on their geographic expertise as well as their history in engineering certain properties. At December 31, 2001, these consultants collectively evaluated approximately 82% of the proved reserves set forth above. The remainder were evaluated by the internal engineering staff. All estimates of oil and gas reserves are subject to significant uncertainty.
The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues, excluding open hedging contracts, from proved reserves, the Present Value of those revenues and the realized prices over the past five years (in millions).
Future net revenues represent future revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and operating expenses). Such calculations, prepared in accordance with SFAS No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities," are based on costs and prices in effect at December 31, 2001. Average product prices (average of the last three days NYMEX) at December 31, 2001 were $17.59 per barrel of oil, $12.38 per barrel for natural gas liquids, and $2.70 per mcf of gas using benchmark NYMEX prices of $20.38 per barrel and $2.63 per Mmbtu. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or that
prices and costs will remain constant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. No estimates of reserves have been filed with or included in reports to another federal authority or agency since year-end.
SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES
The Company's proved reserves at December 31, 2001 were concentrated in three regions, Southwest, Gulf Coast and Appalachia. The Southwest is divided into the Permian and Midcontinent divisions. The Appalachian properties represent the Company's 50% ownership in Great Lakes. At year-end, the Company's properties included working interests in 9,719 gross (4,743 net) productive oil and gas wells and royalty interests in 215 additional wells. The Company also held interests in 558,862 gross (284,028 net) undeveloped acres. The following table sets forth summary information with respect to estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2001.
SOUTHWEST REGION
The Southwest region has production and field operations located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the East Texas Basin (the Permian division) as well as in the Texas Panhandle and the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma (the Midcontinent division.) This region represents 41% of total reserve value and 40% of its total reserve volume. Proved reserves totaled 206 Bcfe, of which 60% was gas. The Southwest's daily production volume of 64.6 Mmcfe per day represents approximately 42% of total daily production.
At December 2001, the Southwest region properties had a development inventory of 176 proven recompletions and 120 proven drilling locations. Acreage owned by the Southwest region at December 31, 2001 included 269,242 gross (191,813 net) developed acres and 128,372 gross (107,821 net) undeveloped acres. During 2001, 42 development wells (27.4 net) were drilled, of which 38 (24.2 net) were productive. One exploratory well (one net) was drilled which was productive.
Permian. The Permian division's total proved reserves at December 31, 2001 contained 147 Bcfe, down 16% compared to year-end 2000. This change was due 90% to lower commodity prices year-over-year and 10% to poor well performance. These reserves represented 29% by volume and 28% by value of total proved reserves and were 53% oil and NGL. In the fourth quarter of 2001, net production averaged 3,612 barrels of oil and NGLs and 23.9 Mmcf of gas per day, or 45.6 Mmcfe per day in total. On an annual basis, production increased 1% to 47.6 Mmcfe per day. Producing wells total 1,347 (1,046 net), of which the Company operates approximately 90%. At December 31, 2001, the Permian division had a development inventory of 148 proven recompletions and 108 proven drilling locations. Acreage owned by the Permian division at December 31, 2001 included 68,922 gross (64,673 net) developed acres and 113,561 gross (96,890 net) undeveloped acres. In 2001, $24.9 million of capital funded the drilling of 21 development wells (14.4 net), 18 (12.2 net) were productive and one exploratory well (one net) which was productive. During the year, the division achieved an 86% drilling success rate.
In East Texas, the Permian division participated in the drilling of two gross (0.4 net) horizontal wells in the James Lime formation, a fractured carbonate. Both wells were successfully completed for combined initial rates of 13 (3.5 net) Mmcfe per day. Also in East Texas, the Company drilled its first Bossier sand test (the Linder #1). The well was unsuccessful in the Bossier formation at depths ranging from 11,500 to 12,500 feet. However, the Linder #1 was successfully
recompleted uphole in the Travis Peak formation yielding rates of 3.0 (2.5 net) Mmcfe per day. To date, Range has accumulated an acreage position in East Texas totaling 34,600 (11,000 net) acres in the horizontal James Lime play and 31, 600 (21,400 net) acres in the Bossier sand play. Further Bossier drilling has been deferred, pending the results of a thorough technical review; however the Company plans to continue drilling in the Travis Peak formation. At year-end 2001, acreage in East Texas was impaired by $825,000 to reflect the lack of success in the Bossier sand. (See Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations.)
In West Texas, the Permian division had disappointing drilling results in 2001 at the Powell Ranch in Glasscock County, Texas. Between 1997, when Range acquired the property, and year-end 2000, Range drilled 11 seismically identified locations with six successes for a 55% success rate. Of the five wells drilled at Powell Ranch in 2001, three were dry and two were productive. Current total net production from the field is 9.5 Mmcfe per day.
In other West Texas drilling, 5 gross (5 net) wells successfully drilled in 2001 in the Sterling Field of West Texas. Three of these wells expanded the productive limits of this field on its eastern edge. Current total net production from this field approximates 11.0 Mmcfe per day.
Midcontinent. In the Midcontinent division, total proved reserves at December 31, 2001 were 58.8 Bcfe, about the same as a year earlier. In 2001, production climbed 14% to an average of 17.0 Mmcfe per day. December 2001 production reached 19.9 Mmcfe per day as the result of successful drilling, recompletion and workover activities. During 2001, $17.8 million of capital was spent to drill 21 (13.0 net) development wells and to recomplete 10 (6.9 net) wells. Twenty (12.0 net) of the development wells proved successful, resulting in a 92% success rate.
In the Texas Panhandle, 6 (5.9 net) wells were drilled. As of December 2001, four of the wells were producing 4.5 Mmcfe per day net to Range, one of the wells was being completed and one was abandoned as a dry hole. The most significant completion in the Texas Panhandle was the Pioneer #1, which targeted the Upper Morrow sands, and is producing 4 (3.2 net) Mmcfe per day. The offsetting Pioneer #2 is currently being completed in the Upper and Lower Morrow sands. The Saturn #1, which was the only dry hole in the area, was abandoned due to lack of reservoir quality sand in the Upper Morrow.
In four trends in the Anadarko Basin, including the Sooner, Watonga Chickasha, Granite Wash and Northwest Shelf, 15 (7.8 net) wells were drilled in 2001. The only dry hole in the area was the Dalton #1, which was abandoned due to a pipe failure but later successfully redrilled. Notable in this area was the Gemini #1, which was completed in the Granite Wash and is producing in excess of 1.5 Mmcfe (1.1 net) per day. The division plans to drill at least two offsets to the Gemini #1 in 2002. In addition, a significant workover was performed on the Greene #1, which increased production to 1.8 Mmcfe per day (1.4 net). An offset to the Greene #1 is currently being drilled. The 340 (199 net) producing wells in the Midcontinent are 92% operated.
GULF COAST REGION
The Gulf Coast region represents 24% of total reserve value and 19% of total reserve volumes of the Company. Proved reserves totaled 95.7 Bcfe, down 13% from 110 Bcfe at year-end 2000. In 2001, the region only partially replaced the reserves lost through property dispositions of 2.6 Bcfe and the production of 20 Bcfe. Gulf Coast reserves are 88% natural gas. Properties are located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The region's wells are characterized by high initial rates and relatively short reserve lives. Production by the region represented 36% of the Company's total average daily production. Major onshore fields include Alta Mesa in Brooks County, Texas, which produces from depths of 6,000 to 7,000 in the Frio and Vicksburg formations, and Oakvale, in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi, which produces at depths ranging from 15,000 to 16,500 feet in the Sligo and Hosston formations. Offshore properties include interests in 50 platforms in water depths ranging from 20 to 210 feet, none of which are operated. The Gulf Coast's development inventory includes 47 recompletions and 16 drilling locations on 155,020 gross (43,277 net) developed acres and 93,388 gross (22,245 net) undeveloped acres. At year-end 2001, the Company impaired acreage by $4.3 million and proved properties by $33.8 million in the Gulf Coast region. (See Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations.)
In 2001, the region spent $23.1 million to drill 13 (4.2 net) wells, recomplete 10 (4.1 net) others and to upgrade facilities. In addition, the division participated in the abandonment of one platform and reduced its overall plugging and abandonment exposure through assignment of its Chandeleur 37 facility and a property trade at West Delta 30. In the fourth
quarter of 2001, net production averaged 782 barrels of oil and 48.6 Mmcf of gas per day or 53.3 Mmcfe per day in total. On an annual basis, production declined 4% to 55.5 Mmcfe per day due to the natural decline of mature properties. In total, the onshore properties include 56 wells (40 net), of which 77% are operated. These operated onshore properties represent 8.5% of the Company's pre-tax present value of the Gulf Coast properties at December 31, 2001. During 2001, 13 development wells (4.2 net) were drilled, of which 11 (2.7 net) were productive. Two exploratory wells (0.3 net) were drilled, of which both were productive.
A total of $5.1 million was spent at the Matagorda Island 519 offshore gas field, which is operated by BP Amoco. The Company has a 17% working interest in the field's seven wells, which produce from as deep as 16,800 feet in the lower Miocene sands. While the field is non-operated, the Company assigns technical and operational staff to study and monitor it given its significance. The field contributed 6% (3.3 Bcfe) of the Company's production in 2001. In 2000, the 519 L-3 well was drilled and turned to sales in December. In 2001, the 519 L-4 well was drilled and turned to sales in September. The initial flow rates from both wells were disappointing. To address this problem, an additional interval was opened to production in the L-3 well in September of 2001, increasing the well's rate from 5.0 to 35.0 Mmcfe per day, for a net increase to Range of 3.8 Mmcfe per day. A similar operation is currently in progress in the L-4 well. No additional drilling activity is forecast for Matagorda Island 519 in 2002. The operator has historically significantly overspent its authorized expenditures for capital projects and has consistently encountered numerous delays in completion of those projects. Largely as a result, the Company impaired Matagorda Island 519 by $8.1 million at year-end 2001. (See Management's Discussion - Results of Operations.) Other offshore activity included drilling one well each at West Cameron 206, West Cameron 192, East Cameron 33 and Mobile 864. The four wells are currently producing at a combined rate of 28.1 (5.3 net) Mmcfe per day.
Onshore, Range was active in the Hartburg play in Orange County, Texas and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, where five wells were drilled and one is in progress. These wells targeted Frio sands at depths of approximately 9,000 feet. The Stephenson #1, #2 and #3 as well as the Stark #2 are all online producing at a combined rate of 20.2 (2.0 net) Mmcfe per day. The one disappointment was the Lawton #1, which was abandoned after the target sands proved wet. Currently the Stephenson #4 is completing. In the Oakvale field in Mississippi, Range completed the Polk 36-3 #1 and drilled and completed the 31-7 #1 in 2001. Both wells have been fracture stimulated and are online at a combined rate of 5.5 (3.4 net) Mmcfe per day.
APPALACHIAN REGION
Through its 50% interest in Great Lakes Energy Partners L.L.C., the Company's Appalachian region represents 212 Bcfe of proved reserves, or 41% by volume and 35% by value of total proved reserves. The Appalachian Region has an interest in 8,128 gross (3,567 net) wells and 4,600 miles of gas gathering lines. Great Lakes sells its gas on a negotiated basis. Effective July 1, 2001, Great Lakes began selling its gas to several different companies, including First Energy. At December 31, 2001, Great Lakes had a development inventory of 51 proven recompletions and 1,468 proven drilling locations.
Acreage owned by the Appalachian region at December 31, 2001 included 730,142 gross (343,019 net) developed acres and 334,102 gross (153,962 net) undeveloped acres. During 2001, 209 development wells (86.8 net) were drilled, of which 207 (86.0 net) were productive. Five exploratory wells (1.5 net) were drilled, of which three (0.6 net) were productive. At December 31, 2001, Great Lakes operated 99% of the wells. The reserves are 86% gas and produce principally from the upper-Devonian, Medina, Clinton, Knox and Oriskany formations at depths ranging from 2,500 to 7,000 feet. In the fourth quarter of 2001, net daily production averaged 28,915 Mmcf of gas and 869 barrels of oil per day or a total of 34,128 mcfe per day. The region's properties, with 1,468 (663 net) proven projects at year-end, are located in the Appalachian and, to a minor degree, the Michigan
Basins of the northeastern United States. After initial flush production, these properties are characterized by gradual decline rates, on average, producing from 10-35 years.
In 2001, $22 million in capital expenditures funded the drilling of 193.0 (84.8 net) shallow development wells, 16 (5.7 net) medium depth wells, and five (2.5 net) deep exploitation wells. In addition, capital was expended on 11 (4.2 net) recompletions as well as the purchase of 1,021 miles of 2-D and 3-D seismic data and 48,750 acres of leasehold. Out of 209 development wells drilled, 207 were successful. Three of the five exploration wells were also successful, indicating an overall 98% success rate. Production during the year averaged 32.6 Mmcfe/day net, a 4% increase. Year-end proved reserves decreased approximately 12% to 211.6 Bcfe primarily as a result of lower pricing.
During 2001 exploration prospects at Great Lakes consisted of activity in the Knox Unconformity, Huntersville-Oriskany, and Trenton Black River plays. The largest effort (14 gross/12.1 net) was directed to the Knox play in Ohio. Great Lakes significantly increased its use of 3D seismic for the Knox Unconformity play in Ohio shooting or acquiring over 30 square miles of data in three separate project areas. Each of these 3D shoots yielded new discovery wells with additional drilling opportunities. Great Lakes shot a moderate amount of 2D seismic and drilled 3 gross (2 net) wells in the Huntersville/Oriskany play in Pennsylvania. While all three wells were completed, initial production rates are below expectations. In the Trenton Black River play, Great Lakes acquired leases on over 125,000 gross acres in four major prospect areas, and has plans for seismic and drilling in 2002. While Great Lakes successfully established land positions in this play, our initial drilling results were unsuccessful on all three gross (0.6 net) wells drilled in 2001.
Five major geologic plays comprise Great Lakes' exploration and development portfolio. The two major development plays, consisting primarily of shallow low-risk, lower impact wells include the Clinton Medina and Upper Devonian Sandstone plays. Production from these shallower blanket-type, tight-sand formations is characteristically long-lived with estimated ultimate production anywhere from 150-750 Mmcf per well. The three exploration plays, consisting of medium to deep wells with higher-risk and higher potential impact, include the Knox Unconformity play, the Huntersville/Oriskany Sandstone play and the Trenton Black River play. Wells drilled in the Knox Unconformity are characterized by a relatively short well life of 10 years or less and have reserves in the 250 Mmcf to 1 Bcf range. Production from the deeper and more structurally complex formations such as the Oriskany is in the 500 Mmcf to 3 Bcf range with a 15-25 year well life or greater. Recent discoveries in the fault-related Trenton Black River play indicate per well recoveries in the 500 Mmcf to 5 Bcf range, particularly in the deeper structures of the play.
Management of Great Lakes is directed by a committee comprised of three representatives from each of the Company and FirstEnergy. Disagreements that cannot be resolved by the committee may be resolved through arbitration.
PRODUCTION
The following table sets forth total company production information for the preceding five years (in thousands, except average sales price and operating cost data).
(a) Oil and NGL are converted to mcfe at a rate of 6 mcf per barrel.
(b) Includes severance and production taxes.
(c) Average sales prices are net of hedging, which increased average oil prices in 2001 by $2.21 and decreased average gas prices by $0.25, respectively. In 2000, average sales prices are net of hedging, which reduced average oil and gas prices in 2000 by $4.85 and $0.81, respectively.
(d) Average mcfe prices excluding hedging were $2.34, $3.90, and $3.87, in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

DRILLING RESULTS
The following table summarizes drilling activities for the past three years.
REAL PROPERTY
The Company leases approximately 59,000 square feet of office space in Texas and Oklahoma under standard office lease arrangements that expire at various dates through March 2006. All facilities are believed adequate to meet the Company's current needs and existing space could be expanded or additional space could be leased if required.
In March 2000, a tornado struck the Company's headquarters in Fort Worth. The Company temporarily relocated to 801 Cherry Street in Fort Worth. In January 2001, the Company entered into a five-year lease for approximately 26,000 square feet of office space located at 777 Main Street in Fort Worth, and moved in April 2001. The annual lease payments on this office space will average $500,000 for the term of the lease.
The Company owns various vehicles and other equipment that is used in its field operations. Such equipment is believed to be in good repair and, while such equipment is important to its operations, it can be readily replaced as necessary.
ITEM 3.
