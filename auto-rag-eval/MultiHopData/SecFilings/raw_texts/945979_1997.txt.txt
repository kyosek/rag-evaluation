Item 2. PROPERTIES
The Energy Complex is located at the Mobile facility on property leased by Kimberly-Clark Tissue to Mobile Energy in accordance with the terms of the Direct Lease and the Supplementary Lease. The Energy Complex is comprised of three power boilers (commonly referred to as the "Number 5 Power Boiler," the "Number 6 Power Boiler," and the "Number 7 Power Boiler"), two recovery boilers (commonly referred to as the "Number 7 Recovery Boiler" and the "Number 8 Recovery Boiler"), three turbine generators, two black liquor evaporator sets, and associated feedwater systems, air emissions controls, and other auxiliary systems. These facilities are located in two separate power houses, known as the north power house and the south power house, on approximately 11 acres leased from Kimberly-Clark Tissue at the Mobile Facility. All of the liquor processing,
I-56
substantially all of the power processing and most of the steam processing conducted at the Mobile Facility occur at the north power house. The major components of the north power house were constructed in 1984 and 1985, and an addition to the north power house facilities was completed in 1994. The major components of the south power house were constructed between 1960 and 1963. The combined facilities currently are designed to produce approximately 111 MW (gross) of electricity and approximately 2,100,000 lbs/hr of steam. In addition, the Energy Complex currently is designed to process up to approximately 6,350,000 lbs/day of virgin dry black liquor solids.
In 1996, Mobile Energy completed its maintenance and storage warehouse facility and moved all the remaining spare parts purchased from Scott/Kimberly Clark through the Acquisition into this newly constructed facility. The facility has 21,902 square feet of space comprised of a 3,392 square foot mechanic shop, 15,637 square feet of storage facility, and 2,873 square feet of office space
Although a majority of the components of the Energy Complex have an operating history ranging from 10 to 30 years, certain components (including a recovery boiler and an evaporator train that were completed in early 1994) have a limited operating history. Moreover, although most of the personnel currently employed by Southern Energy to operate the Energy Complex were employed by Scott to operate the Energy Complex prior to the acquisition, the Energy Complex has been owned by Mobile Energy or its affiliates and has been operated as an independent business, and Southern Energy has employed the Energy Complex personnel and has dealt with the unions that represent many of such personnel, only since December 1994. In general, as with any sophisticated energy and recovery plant, operation of the Energy Complex involves many risks, including, among other things, the risk of equipment breakdown, failure or explosion. For example, recovery boilers such as those used at the Energy Complex may explode under certain circumstances, such as if the smelt at the bottom of the boilers comes into contact with water. The possibility also exists that the Energy Complex will perform below expected levels of output or efficiency, or that labor disputes or other events such as fires, hurricanes, floods, droughts, changes in law or acts of eminent domain will disrupt or disable Mobile Energy's operations. The occurrence of any such events could significantly increase the expenses of operating the Energy Complex, and have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Mobile Energy. While Mobile Energy will maintain insurance to protect against certain of these operating risks, the proceeds of such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the Energy Complex's lost revenues or increased expenses.
Mortgage
Mobile Energy and the IDB, as mortgagors, have entered into a Leasehold Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents, Issues and Profits and Security Agreement and Fixture Filing dated as of August 1, 1995 (including any amendments thereto, the "Mortgage") and have granted to the Collateral Agent, as mortgagee, for the benefit of the Senior Secured Parties mortgages and security interests in all real property interests (including fee interests, easement interests and leasehold interests, if any) of Mobile Energy to the Energy Complex and the Easement Deeds and all fixtures, equipment and improvements thereon and personal property now owned or hereafter acquired.
Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, if any event of default under the Intercreditor Agreement (a "Trigger Event") has occurred and is continuing and, except in the case of any such Trigger Event that shall have resulted from a Bankruptcy Event in respect of Mobile Energy or Holdings, the Collateral Agent shall have received from the requisite senior creditors the notice required by the Intercreditor Agreement, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Collateral Agent may exercise any right, power or remedy permitted to it under the Mortgage and under certain other security documents or by law, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent may, personally or by its agents, to the maximum extent permitted by law, do any or all of the following:
(a) without assuming liability for the performance of any of Mobile Energy's obligations, enter and take possession of the mortgaged property or any part thereof, exclude Mobile Energy and all persons claiming under Mobile Energy whose claims are junior to the Mortgage wholly or partly therefrom, and use, operate, manage and control the same either in the name of Mobile Energy or otherwise as the Collateral Agent shall deem best, and upon such entry, from time to time at the expense of Mobile Energy, make all such repairs, replacements, alterations, additions or improvements to the mortgaged property or any part thereof as the Collateral Agent may deem proper and, whether or not the Collateral Agent has so entered and taken
I-57
possession of the mortgaged property or any part thereof, collect and receive all the rents and apply the same, to the extent permitted by law, to the payment of all expenses that the Collateral Agent may be authorized to make under the Mortgage, the remainder to be applied to the payment of the obligations secured by the Mortgage until the same shall have been repaid in full; if the Collateral Agent demands or attempts to take possession of the mortgaged property or any portion thereof in the proper exercise of any rights hereunder, Mobile Energy shall promptly turn over and deliver complete possession thereof to the Collateral Agent;
(b) with or without entry: (i) subject to applicable law, sell all or any part of the mortgaged property for cash at an auction or foreclosure sale held at such place or places and time and upon such notice and, otherwise in such manner as may be required by law, or in the absence of any such requirement, as the Collateral Agent (acting in accordance with an opinion of counsel upon which the Collateral Agent may conclusively rely) may deem appropriate, and from time to time adjourn any such sale by announcement at the time and place specified for such sale or for such adjourned sale without further notice, except as may be required by law; (ii) proceed to protect and enforce its rights under the Mortgage, by suit for specific performance of any covenant contained in the Mortgage or in certain other security documents or in aid of the execution of any power granted in the Mortgage or in the other security documents, or for the foreclosure of the Mortgage (as a mortgage or otherwise) and the sale for cash of the mortgaged property under the judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, or for the enforcement of any other right as the Collateral Agent (acting in accordance with an opinion of counsel upon which the Collateral Agent may conclusively rely) shall deem most effectual for such purpose; provided, however, that in the event of a sale, by foreclosure or otherwise, of less than all of the mortgaged property, the Mortgage shall continue as a lien on, and security interest in, the remaining portion of the mortgaged property, and the Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to sell upon credit unless the Collateral Agent shall have expressly consented in writing to a sale upon credit; or (iii) exercise any or all of the remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code; and
(c) if a Trigger Event shall have occurred and be continuing and, except in the case of any such Trigger Event that shall have resulted from a Bankruptcy Event in respect of Mobile Energy or Holdings, the Collateral Agent shall have received notice from the requisite senior creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Collateral Agent shall have declared the obligations secured by the Mortgage to be immediately due and payable, or upon the actual or threatened waste to any part of the mortgaged property, the Collateral Agent, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver of the mortgaged property, without notice or demand, and without regard to the adequacy of the security for the obligations secured by the Mortgage or the solvency of Mobile Energy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Trigger Event shall have occurred and be continuing, and the Collateral Agent shall have received notice from the requisite senior creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement and in the event of threatened waste to any part of the mortgaged property (but not actual waste), the Collateral Agent shall provide notice to Mobile Energy of its intent to appoint a receiver and shall permit Mobile Energy a reasonable period of time to eliminate such threatened waste prior to the appointment of said receiver.
Proceeds from the exercise of remedies will be applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
Security Agreement
Mobile Energy has entered into the Security Agreement dated as of August 1, 1995 (including any amendments thereto the "Security Agreement") with the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Senior Secured Parties providing for the granting of a security interest in all of Mobile Energy's personal property interests including, but not limited to, all contract rights, all equipment, receivables, insurance proceeds (other than those paid under third-party liability insurance), eminent domain proceeds, rights pursuant to any governmental approval (to the extent permitted by applicable law), patents and trademarks, and certain accounts. The Security Agreement does not provide for the granting of a security interest in Mobile Energy's rights under the Mill Owner Maintenance Reserve Account and monies on deposit therein.
Pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement, the Collateral Agent may,
I-58
upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event and satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, take possession of all of the foregoing capital, which also secures the Working Capital Facility.
Proceeds from the exercise of remedies will be applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Tax-Exempt Bonds
In December 1983, the IDB issued tax-exempt bonds (the "1983 Tax-Exempt Bonds") to finance the construction of the Number 7 Power Boiler and certain auxiliary systems, which are "solid waste disposal facilities" as such term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Solid Waste Disposal Facilities"). In December 1984, the IDB issued tax-exempt bonds (the "1984 Tax-Exempt Bonds") to refund the 1983 Tax-Exempt Bonds. The Solid Waste Disposal Facilities are located on the land on which the north power house is situated, which is owned by Kimberly-Clark Tissue and leased by Kimberly-Clark Tissue to the IDB pursuant to the Scott-IDB Lease and leased back to Kimberly-Clark Tissue pursuant to the IDB-Scott Sublease. The IDB held, and continues to hold, title to the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities. In December 1984, the IDB leased the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities to Scott pursuant to the IDB-Scott Sublease (so named because the lease of the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities to Scott was made pursuant to the same agreement by which the real property on which the north power house is situated was subleased by the IDB to Scott). Pursuant to a Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 12, 1994 between Scott and Holdings (the "Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement"), Scott assigned to Holdings all of Scott's right, title and interest in and to the IDB-Scott Sublease and the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities, and Holdings assumed all of Scott's obligations arising after the Acquisition Closing Date under the IDB-Scott Sublease (although Scott remained liable to the IDB under the IDB-Scott Sublease). Holdings subsequently assigned to Mobile Energy all of Holdings' rights and obligations under the IDB-Scott Sublease.
In August 1995, the Tax-Exempt Bonds were issued by the IDB under an Amended and Restated Trust Indenture dated as of August 1, 1995 (the "Tax-Exempt Indenture") between the IDB and First Union National Bank of Georgia, as trustee (the "Tax-Exempt Trustee"). The proceeds of the offering of the Tax-Exempt Bonds were used to refund the 1984 Tax-Exempt Bonds.
Concurrently with the issuance of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the IDB released Scott from liability under the IDB-Scott Sublease and the IDB and Mobile Energy entered into an Amended and Restated Lease and Agreement with respect to the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities (the "IDB Lease Agreement"). The IDB Lease Agreement grants Mobile Energy the right to purchase the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities for $10 upon the expiration thereof. Mobile Energy's obligations under the IDB Lease Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings (the "IDB Lease Agreement Guaranty").
Also in August 1995, Mobile Energy, the IDB, the Tax-Exempt Trustee and the Collateral Agent entered into the Recognition, Cooperation and Consent Agreement dated as of August 1, 1995 (the "Tax-Exempt Bonds Recognition Agreement") pursuant to which the IDB will, among other things, (i) consent to the assignment and grant of a security interest by Mobile Energy pursuant to certain security documents in all of Mobile Energy's rights in the Energy Complex and the IDB Lease Agreement, (ii) in the event of a filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against Kimberly-Clark Tissue under Chapter 7 or 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the election by Kimberly-Clark Tissue to reject the Scott-IDB Lease, upon the written request of Mobile Energy and at Mobile Energy's expense, exercise its rights under Section 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code to retain its rights under the Scott-IDB Lease (including, without limitation, rights relating to the amount of timing of payment of rent and other amounts payable by it thereunder and any right of use, possession, quiet enjoyment, subletting, assignment or hypothecation) that are in or appurtenant to the real property covered thereby for the balance of the term of the Scott-IDB Lease and for any renewal or extension thereof to the extent that such rights are enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law, and (iii) if, for any reason (other than following Mobile Energy's payment in full of the Tax-Exempt Bonds and the exercise by Mobile Energy of its purchase option under the IDB Lease Agreement), the IDB fails or is otherwise unable to continue to have the right to sublease Lot 9 to Mobile Energy pursuant to the IDB Lease Agreement (whether by bankruptcy court order that Section 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code is not applicable or otherwise), or upon any termination of the IDB Lease Agreement, upon the written request of Mobile Energy and at Mobile Energy's expense, lease the Solid Waste Disposal Facilities to Mobile Energy directly pursuant to a separate lease (with Mobile Energy agreeing to make the same rental payments to the IDB as Mobile Energy would have otherwise been obligated to make under the IDB Lease Agreement).
I-59
The Mixed-Use Bonds
In December 1984, the IDB issued a total of $172,000,000 in aggregate principle amount of taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bonds due December 1, 2019 (the "Mixed-Use Bonds") to finance the acquisition of certain facilities at the Energy Complex (the "Energy Complex Equipment") and at the Pulp Mill. The IDB holds title to the financed facilities (including the Energy Complex Equipment) and leases them to Kimberly-Clark Tissue pursuant to a Facilities Lease and Agreement dated as of December 1, 1984 (as amended, the "Facilities Lease and Agreement"). The Energy Complex Equipment is located on the land on which the north power house is situated. The term of the Facilities Lease and Agreement is coextensive with the term of the Mixed-Use Bonds. Kimberly-Clark Tissue's rent payment obligations under the Facilities Lease and Agreement are calculated to pay all principal and interest on the Mixed-Use Bonds. Kimberly-Clark Tissue has an option to purchase the Energy Complex Equipment at the end of the lease term for $10. The Mixed-Use Bonds are secured by a security interest in all of the IDB's right, title and interest in and to the Facilities Lease and Agreement and all revenues accruing to the IDB thereunder. The Mixed-Use Bonds finance facilities that are not entitled to tax-exempt treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. However, the financing of these facilities (as well as the facilities purchased with the Environmental Bonds and the 1994 Bonds (each as defined below)) by the IDB were structured in order to entitle such facilities to exemption from sales and property taxation. The Mixed-Use Bonds are held by Three Rivers Timber Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Tissue (the "Scott Subsidiary").
Pursuant to a Sublease and Assignment Agreement dated as of December 12, 1994 (the "Sublease and Assignment Agreement"), Scott, in return for a lump-sum payment by Holdings to Scott on the Acquisition Closing Date, (i) subleased to Holdings the Energy Complex Equipment and (ii) assigned to Holdings its right to purchase the Energy Complex Equipment from the IDB at the expiration of the Facilities Lease and Agreement. Scott and Holdings also agreed to indemnify each other for certain losses that may be incurred in connection with the Mixed-Use Bonds, the Energy Complex Equipment or the Sublease and Assignment Agreement. The Scott Subsidiary, the holder of the Mixed-Use Bonds, has delivered to Holdings an agreement (the "Estoppel and Nondisturbance Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, the Scott Subsidiary has agreed (i) to look solely to rent paid by Kimberly-Clark Tissue under the Facilities Lease and Agreement for payments due in respect of the Mixed-Use Bonds and not to seek to recover any such amounts from Holdings or any successor as sublessee or owner of the Energy Complex Equipment, (ii) at no time to seek to take possession of, impose a lien on, or interfere with the use or possession of the Energy Complex Equipment and (iii) not to sell the Mixed-Use Bonds without Holdings' prior written consent. Holdings assigned to Mobile Energy all of Holdings' rights to sublease and to purchase the Energy Complex Equipment and all of its rights under the Estoppel and Nondisturbance Agreement.
In order to secure Mobile Energy's right to acquire the Energy Complex Equipment upon the expiration of the Facilities Lease and Agreement, Kimberly-Clark Tissue has granted to Mobile Energy a security interest in all of Kimberly-Clark Tissue's right, title and interest in the Energy Complex Equipment and in the Facilities Lease and Agreement as it relates to the Energy Complex Equipment. In addition, in August 1995 Mobile Energy, the IDB, AmSouth Bank of Alabama, the Collateral Agent and the Scott Subsidiary entered into the Recognition, Cooperation and Consent Agreement (the "Mixed-Use Bonds Recognition Agreement") pursuant to which the IDB has agreed (with the consent of the Scott Subsidiary and the trustee under the indenture for the Mixed-Use Bonds) that in the event that the Facilities Lease and Agreement is rejected by Kimberly-Clark Tissue or otherwise terminated for any reason it will either (i) lease the Energy Complex Equipment directly to Mobile Energy for nominal consideration pursuant to a new facilities lease and agreement for a term equal to the term of the Facilities Lease and Agreement (with an option of Mobile Energy to purchase the Energy Complex Equipment at the end of the lease term for $10) or (ii) sell the Energy Complex Equipment to Mobile Energy for nominal consideration.
The Environmental Bonds
Between 1973 and 1980, the IDB issued four series of 30-year bonds having an aggregate principal amount of $24,000,000 (the "Environmental Bonds") to finance the purchase of certain pollution control equipment at the Energy Complex (the "Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment") and the Mills. Title to the
I-60
pollution control equipment is held by the IDB but the equipment is subject to sale to Kimberly-Clark Tissue pursuant to two Construction, Financing and Installment Sale Agreements (as supplemented, the "Installment Sale Agreements"). The Installment Sale Agreements give Kimberly-Clark Tissue sole use and exclusive possession of the pollution control equipment and provide that Kimberly-Clark Tissue is purchasing the equipment through fixed installment payments that, in sum, equal the principal and interest due on the applicable Environmental Bonds. When the applicable bonds have been fully redeemed, the IDB is to transfer to Kimberly-Clark Tissue title to the applicable equipment. The bonds of each series are secured by the money payable by Kimberly-Clark Tissue to the IDB under the corresponding Installment Sale Agreement.
A substantial portion of the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment financed with the Environmental Bonds is no longer in operation.
Pursuant to two separate Lease and Assignment Agreements, each dated as of December 12, 1994 (collectively, the "Lease and Assignment Agreements"), Scott, in return for a lump-sum payment, (i) leased to Holdings the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment and (ii) assigned to Holdings its right and interest in and to the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment arising under the Installment Sale Agreements, including its right to receive instruments of conveyance from the IDB pursuant to the Installment Sale Agreements, and Holdings assumed certain obligations of Scott under the Installment Sale Agreements. Scott and Holdings also agreed to indemnify each other for certain losses that may be incurred in connection with the Environmental Bonds, the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment and the Lease and Assignment Agreements. Holdings subsequently assigned to Mobile Energy all of Holdings' rights and obligations under the Lease and Assignment Agreements.
In order to secure Mobile Energy's rights to become the owner of the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment at the end of the terms of the respective Installment Sale Agreements, Kimberly-Clark Tissue has granted to Mobile Energy a security interest in all of Kimberly-Clark Tissue's rights in the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment and in the Installment Sale Agreements as it relates to the Energy Complex Pollution Control Equipment.
The 1994 Bonds
The construction of the Number 8 Recovery Boiler and related facilities (the "Number 8 Recovery Boiler Facilities"), which began operation in 1994, was financed by Scott and the IDB through the issuance of $117,000,000 principal amount of Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (Scott Paper Recovery Boiler Project) 1994 Series A (the "1994 Bonds") due December 1, 2014. The structure of the 1994 Bonds transaction is similar to that for the Mixed-Use Bonds. The IDB holds title to the Number 8 Recovery Boiler Facilities and, prior to the Acquisition, leased it to Scott pursuant to a Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement dated as of December 1, 1994 (the "Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement"). The 1994 Bonds were purchased by the Scott Subsidiary. The Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement gives Kimberly-Clark Tissue the right to purchase the Number 8 Recovery Boiler Facilities at the expiration of the lease term for $10 (or earlier upon the payment of $10 plus an amount equal to all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable or to be payable with respect to all outstanding 1994 Bonds).
Pursuant to a Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of December 12, 1994, between Scott and Holdings (the "1994 Bond Agreement"), Scott assigned to Holdings, with the consent of the Scott Subsidiary, all of its right, title and interest in the Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement and the Number 8 Recovery Boiler Facilities (including the right to purchase the Number 8 Recovery Boiler Facilities as provided in the Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement). In connection with the assignment of the Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement to Holdings, Scott caused the Scott Subsidiary to transfer the 1994 Bonds to Holdings pursuant to the Bond Transfer Instrument. Holdings subsequently assigned the 1994 Bonds and all of its rights under the 1994 Bond Agreement to Mobile Energy. Therefore, Mobile Energy is currently the holder of the 1994 Bonds and the de facto obligor thereunder (by virtue of its obligation to make payments under the Recovery Boiler Lease and Agreement to cover debt service obligations on the 1994 Bonds). The 1994 Bonds have been pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Agreement. The Collateral Agent is the trustee with respect to the 1994 Bonds. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent is authorized to make payments under the Lease and Agreement by debiting certain Intercreditor Agreement accounts. Payments made to Mobile Energy as the holder of the 1994 Bonds will be made immediately following
I-61
payments by Mobile Energy under the Lease and Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that when Mobile Energy receives such payments on the 1994 Bonds, such monies will be credited to the account or accounts that were debited by the Collateral Agent (to the extent of any such debit) in order to pay Mobile Energy's obligations under the Lease and Agreement.
Item 3.
