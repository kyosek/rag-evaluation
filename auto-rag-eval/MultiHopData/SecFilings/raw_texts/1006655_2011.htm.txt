Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues
In December 2008, the SEC adopted new rules related to modernizing reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies (the “Modernization Requirements”), which became effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. The Modernization Requirements require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Another significant provision of the new rules is a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and estimates of reserves quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available.
Estimated future net revenues discounted at 10% or PV-10 is a financial measure that is not recognized by GAAP. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies, and that it is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. Further, analysts and investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies’ reserves. We also use this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our Company. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure as defined under GAAP, and reconciled herein.
Proved Reserves Fiscal Year Ended 2011
Our proved reserves at June 30, 2011, denominated in equivalent barrels using a six Mcf of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, totaled 13,848 MBOE. Approximately 39% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 61% were classified as proved undeveloped. Classified by product, 84% of our proved reserves were crude oil, 5% were natural gas liquids, and 11% were natural gas. Our proved reserves as of June 30, 2011 were estimated by our independent petroleum engineers, W.D. Von Gonten & Co. (“Von Gonten”), DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”), and Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. (“Keeling”). Von Gonten and Keeling were engaged for our Texas and Oklahoma properties, respectively, due to their particular expertise in the geographic and geologic areas covered by their reports. D&M was selected for our properties in the Delhi Field due to their expertise in CO2-EOR projects and to ensure consistency with the Operator who has utilized D&M for their reserves estimates in the Delhi Field. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in letters from each of those firms, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2011. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional unaudited reserve information is provided. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $90.09 per barrel of crude oil and $4.21 per MMbtu of natural gas. The price of natural gas liquids utilized was based on the historical price received versus the NYMEX basis oil price. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.

Proved Reserves Fiscal Year Ended 2010
Our proved reserves at June 30, 2010, denominated in equivalent barrels using a six Mcf of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, totaled 12,418 MBOE. Approximately 9% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 91% were classified as proved undeveloped. Classified by product, 83% of our proved reserves were crude oil, 8% were natural gas liquids, and 9% were natural gas. Our proved reserves as of June 30, 2010 were estimated by our independent petroleum consultants, W.D. Von Gonten & Co. (“Von Gonten”), DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”), and Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. (“Keeling”). Von Gonten and Keeling were engaged for our Texas and Oklahoma properties, respectively, due to their particular expertise in the geographic and geologic areas covered by their reports. D&M was selected for our properties in the Delhi Field due to their expertise in CO2-EOR projects and to ensure consistency with the Operator who has utilized D&M for their reserves estimates in the Delhi Field.

The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2010. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional reserve information is provided. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $76.45 per barrel of crude oil and $4.09 per MMbtu of natural gas. The price of natural gas liquids utilized was based on the historical price received versus the NYMEX basis oil price. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.
June 30, 2010
Proved Reserves Fiscal Year Ended 2009
Our proved reserves at June 30, 2009, denominated in equivalent barrels using a six Mcf of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, totaled 3,060 MBOE. Approximately 14% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 86% were classified as proved undeveloped. Classified by product, 35% of our proved reserves were natural gas, 34% were natural gas liquids, and 31% were crude oil. Our proved reserves as of June 30, 2009 were estimated by our independent petroleum consultants W.D. Von Gonten & Co. (“Von Gonten”), and were entirely from our properties in Texas.
The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2009. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional reserve information is provided. The NYMEX spot prices used to calculate estimated revenues were $69.89 per barrel of crude oil and $3.885 per MMbtu of natural gas as of June 30, 2009. The price of natural gas liquids utilized was based on the historical price received versus the NYMEX basis oil price. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis, in order to reflect prices actually received at the wellhead. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.
June 30, 2009
Changes in Proved Reserves
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, total proved reserves increased 1,430 MBOE from 12,418 MBOE at June 30, 2010 to 13,848 MBOE at June 30, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to upward revisions in both our Delhi and Giddings Fields, partially offset by sales in place of reserves in the Giddings Field. The upward revision of 1,570 MBO in proved oil reserves in the Delhi Field is due primarily to a more than two year acceleration in the projected reversion date of our 24% working interest resulting based on performance to date. The upward revision of 331 MBOE in Giddings is primarily due to re-categorizing probable reserves into the proved category due to drilling results during the year, partially offset by highgrading our portfolio and performance of certain wells. Sales in place of 522 MBOE in the Giddings Field are primarily due to the industry drilling joint venture we entered into early in the year. We also restored 61 MBO of proved reserves in South Texas due to positive test and production results during the year and added 130 MBOE of proved reserves in our Haskell county, Oklahoma gas shale property, net of a downward revision due to a de-emphasis of the Wagoner County properties. The additions and revisions in our properties were offset by production of 116 MBOE.
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, total proved reserves increased 9,358 MBOE from 3,060 MBOE at June 30, 2009 to 12,418 MBOE at June 30, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to 9,418 MBbls of proved oil reserves we added to our properties in the Delhi Field, based on approximately $300 million of development capital spent by the Operator since project inception, the start-up of CO2 injection operations during fiscal year 2010, and an oil production response during fiscal year 2010. The additions in our properties in the Delhi Field along with extensions in Giddings and Oklahoma of 126 MBOE, were offset by production of 126 MBOE and negative revisions of 61 MBOE primarily related to the transfer of four well locations in the Lopez Field in South Texas from the proved classification to probable on June 30, 2010.

2011 and 2010 Reserves Pricing Sensitivities
In addition to the proved reserves determined using SEC pricing, our independent engineers prepared estimates of our year-end proved reserves using two alternative commodity price assumptions. The following tables summarizes our total proved reserves as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 under each of the three assumptions:
(1) The Spot price case is based on the NYMEX spot crude oil, natural gas liquid, and natural gas price as of June 30, 2011. For oil and natural gas liquids, the NYMEX posted price of $95.42 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the NYMEX spot price of $4.28 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) The Forward curve case is based on the five year applicable monthly forward closing prices on the NYMEX for oil and natural gas as of June 30, 2011. For oil and natural gas liquids, the price was based on a crude oil price which increased from $95.42 per Bbl to $101.59 per Bbl during the first five years and then held constant during the remaining life of the reserves, adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the price was based on a natural gas price which increased from $4.28 per MMBtu to $5.88 per MMBtu during the first five years and then held constant over the remaining life of the properties, adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(1) The Spot price case is based on the NYMEX spot crude oil, natural gas liquid, and natural gas price as of June 30, 2010. For oil and natural gas liquids, the NYMEX posted price of $75.63 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the NYMEX spot price of $4.53 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) The Forward curve case is based on the five year applicable monthly forward closing prices on the NYMEX for oil and natural gas as of June 30, 2010. For oil and natural gas liquids, the price was based on a crude oil price which increased from $75.63 per Bbl to $84.43 per Bbl during the first five years and then held constant during the remaining life of the reserves, adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the price was based on a natural gas price which increased from $4.53 per MMBtu to $6.07 per MMBtu during the first five years and then held constant over the remaining life of the properties, adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
Probable Reserves Fiscal Year Ended 2011 and 2010
The Modernization Requirements also permitted the disclosure of probable reserves. Probable reserves are additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, in sum with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The various reserve categories have different risks associated with them. Proved reserves are more likely to be produced than probable reserves. Because of these risks, the different reserve categories should not be considered to be directly additive.
June 30, 2011
June 30, 2010
In addition to the probable reserves determined using SEC pricing, our independent engineers prepared estimates of our year-end probable reserves using two alternative commodity price assumptions. The following tables summarizes our total probable reserves as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 under each of the three assumptions:
(1) The Spot price case is based on the NYMEX spot crude oil, natural gas liquid, and natural gas price as of June 30, 2011. For oil and natural gas liquids, the NYMEX posted price of $95.42 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the NYMEX spot price of $4.28 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) The Forward curve case is based on the five year applicable monthly forward closing prices on the NYMEX for oil and natural gas as of June 30, 2011. For oil and natural gas liquids, the price was based on a crude oil price which increased from $95.42 per Bbl to $101.59 per Bbl during the first five years and then held constant during the remaining life of the reserves, adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the price was based on a natural gas price which increased from $4.28 per MMBtu to $5.88 per MMBtu during the first five years and then held constant over the remaining life of the properties, adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(1) The Spot price case is based on the NYMEX spot crude oil, natural gas liquid, and natural gas price as of June 30, 2010. For oil and natural gas liquids, the NYMEX posted price of $75.63 per barrel was adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. For natural gas, the NYMEX spot price of $4.53 per MMBtu was adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons and
Our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Operations and to be in compliance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. We provide each engineering firm with property interests, production, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Vice President of Operations and our Chief Executive Officer to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to our third party engineering firm. The scope and results of our third party engineering firms’ procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A letter which identifies the professional qualifications of each of the independent engineering firms who prepared the reserve reports are also filed as exhibits to this Annual report on Form 10-K.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2011 were 8,503 MBOE. Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2011 totaled approximately $39.0 million. The 2,796 MBOE decrease in proved undeveloped reserves from 11,299 MBOE as of June 30, 2010 is primarily attributable to reclassification of 2,760 MBbls of proved oil reserves attributable to our properties in the Delhi Field to the proved developed category, partially offset by a 333 MBOE upward revision of probable undeveloped reserves to proved undeveloped reserves in the Giddings Field and the 50 MBO upward revision in Lopez Field proved undeveloped reserves. None of our proved undeveloped locations remain undeveloped for five years from the date of initial recognition as proved undeveloped reserves.
Sales Volumes, Average Sales Prices and Average Production Costs
The following table shows the Company’s sales volumes and average sales prices received for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas for the periods indicated:
Average production costs, including production taxes, per unit of production (using a six to one conversion ratio of Mcf’s to barrels) were approximately $12, $13 and $11 per BOE for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas sales volumes, net to our interest, for the year ended June 30, 2011 decreased 7% to 116,437 BOE, compared to 125,515 BOE for the year ended June 30, 2010. Our sales volumes for the year ended June 30, 2011 included 44,141 Bbls of oil from Delhi compared to 6,333 Bbls of oil during the previous fiscal year and 71,010 BOE from our properties in the Giddings Field in Texas compared to 119,182 BOE during the previous fiscal year.
First EOR oil production at Delhi began in the last two weeks of March 2010. Our interests in the Delhi Field consist of more than 79% of our total proved reserves as of June 30, 2011. The average sales price per barrel of crude oil at Delhi was $101.79 for the year ended June 30, 2011, with no associated production costs.
Production from our properties in the Giddings Field decreased 40% from 119,182 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 2010 to 71,280 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Production of natural gas from our properties in the Giddings Field increased 43%, while production of crude oil and NGLs decreased 37% compared to the year ended June 30, 2010. Our interests in the Giddings Field consist of 20% of our total proved reserves as of June 30, 2011. The average sales price per BOE at Giddings was $42.78 for the year ended June 30, 2011 . The associated production costs in Giddings for the year ended June 30, 2011 (not including ad valorem and production taxes) were $18.29 per BOE.
The decrease in volumes from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 were attributable to the natural production decline of our properties in the Giddings Field, which decreased 11% from 133,863 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 2009 to 119,182 BOE during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth our drilling activity. In 2011, we drilled and completed 3 gross and 0.6 net wells in the Giddings Field. One gross and net well drilled in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, in 2010 was plugged and abandoned during 2011 as a dry hole.
Present Activities
At year end, we were not actively drilling any wells. Three wells in Oklahoma that were drilled in 2010 and production tested to flare were shut-in as of June 30, 2011 waiting on pipeline connections and, in one case, a workover to repair a mechanical issue, thus all three wells are neither productive or plugged and abandoned. Pressure maintenance through re-injection of produced water is occurring on one of our leases in the Lopez Field. Enhanced oil recovery through CO2 injection is occurring in the Delhi Field.

Delivery Commitments
As of June 30, 2011, we had no delivery commitments.
Productive Wells and Developed Acreage
Our developed acreage at June 30, 2011 totaled 5,362 net acres in the Giddings Field, consisting of a 100% working interest in ten producing wells and a 20% BPO WI in three producing wells, 100 net acres in Haskell County, OK with one 100% WI producing well, 153 net acres in Wagoner County, OK with one 100% WI nonproducing shut-in well and 446 acres in Webb County, Texas with one 100% WI producing well. We also own mineral and overriding royalty interests aggregating 7.4% in our CO2-EOR project in the Delhi Field. Our proved reserves at Delhi are 45% proved developed, but we do not recognize net acres in the EOR project at Delhi prior to reversion of our working interest.
Our developed acreage at June 30, 2010 totaled 5,040 net acres in the Giddings Field, consisting of a 100% working interest in nine producing and one developed non-producing gross and net wells, and 153 net acres in Wagoner County, OK with one nonproducing shut-in well. We also own mineral and overriding royalty interests aggregating 7.4% in our CO2-EOR project in the Delhi Field. Our proved reserves at Delhi are 7% proved developed, but we did not recognize net acres at Delhi prior to reversion of our working interest.
Our developed acreage at June 30, 2009 totaled 5,040 net acres in the Giddings Field, consisting of a 100% working interest in ten gross and net producing wells.
Undeveloped Acreage
As of June 30, 2011, we held approximately 34,131 gross and 17,815 net undeveloped acres in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions of the United States, as follows:
* Includes from the surface of the Earth to the top of the Massive Anhydride, less and except the Delhi Holt Bryant CO2 and Mengel Units. With respect to the Delhi Holt Bryant Unit, currently being redeveloped using CO2-EOR operations within this same acreage, we currently own royalty interests aggregating approximately 7.4%. Separately, we own a 23.9% reversionary working interest (19% net revenue interest) that will revert to us, as, if and when payout occurs, as defined. We are not the operator of the Delhi CO2-EOR project.
Our net undeveloped acreage that is subject to expiration over the next three years, if not renewed or extended by option, (consisting of our acreage in the Giddings Field, Woodford, and South Texas) is approximately 3,431 acres in fiscal 2012, 9,965 acres in fiscal 2013, and 1,154 acres in 2014.
