Description of our Mineral Property Interests
The Peru Property
Our property interests located in Peru are in the exploration stage. These properties are without known reserves and the proposed plan of exploration detailed below is exploratory in nature. These properties are described below.
We entered into a Mineral Right Option Agreement with Temasek Investments Inc. (“Temasek”), a company incorporated under the laws of Panama, on September 29, 2008 (the “Effective Date”), as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1, dated May 12, 2009 (“Amendment No. 1”) and Amendment No. 2, dated October 29, 2009 (“Amendment No. 2”) (collectively, the “Option Agreement”), in order to acquire four separate options from Temasek, each providing for the acquisition of a twenty-five percent interest in certain mineral rights (the “Mineral Rights”) in certain properties in Peru, potentially resulting in the Company's acquisition of one hundred percent of the Mineral Rights upon exercise of all four options. The Mineral Rights are currently owned by Compañía Minera Marañón S.A.C. (“Minera Marañón”). Bacon Hill Invest Inc. (“Bacon Hill”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Panama, owns 999 shares of the 1,000 shares of Minera Marañón that are issued and outstanding. Temasek owns the single remaining share of Minera Marañón. The acquisition of each twenty-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights will occur through the transfer by Temasek to us of twenty-five percent of the outstanding shares of Bacon Hill upon exercise of each option.
- 17 -
A description of the Mineral Rights is set forth below:
- 18 -
We exercised the initial twenty-five percent option, which provided for the acquisition of a twenty-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights, by paying Temasek a total of $750,000 and issuing 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek, on or about October 23, 2008 in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement.
We exercised the second twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of an aggregate of a fifty percent interest in the Mineral Rights, by paying Temasek an additional $750,000 and issuing an additional 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek, on or about November 2, 2009 in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement.
- 19 -
Under the terms of the Option Agreement, we may exercise the third twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a seventy-five percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after we have fulfilled the following conditions:
·
Exercise of the second twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a fifty percent interest in the Mineral Rights, within 13 months from the Effective Date (October 29, 2009) or as soon as practicable thereafter, (which event occurred November 2, 2009);
·
Issuance of an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek, or to an assignee as indicated by Temasek, within 13 months as from the Effective Date (October 29, 2009) or as soon as practicable thereafter (which shares were issued in November 2009); and
·
Payment of an additional $3,000,000 to Temasek on or before March 31, 2010.
We will require additional financing in order to be able to exercise the third twenty-five percent option. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing the necessary funding to exercise the third twenty-five percent option. Provided we are successful in securing additional financing, we intend to exercise the third twenty-five percent option on or before March 31, 2010. In the event that we are unable to secure additional financing in order to be able to exercise the third twenty-five percent option in the time frame set forth above or secure an extension for payment, our ownership interest in the Mineral Rights may be limited to our current fifty percent interest.
We may exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option, resulting in our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, after fulfilling the following conditions within eighteen months of the Effective Date (March 29, 2010):
·
Payment of an additional $5,000,000 to Temasek, and
·
Issuance of an additional 4,000,000 additional shares of our common stock to Temasek.
We will require additional financing in order to be able to exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing the necessary funding to exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option. Provided we are successful in securing additional financing, we intend to exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option within eighteen months of March 29, 2010. In the event that we have exercised the third twenty-five percent option, but are unable to secure sufficient financing in order to be able to exercise the fourth twenty-five percent option in the time frame set forth above, our ownership interest in the Mineral Rights may be limited to a seventy-five percent interest, provided we have completed the exercise of the third twenty-five percent option.
If we are able to fulfill the conditions set forth above, resulting in our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek will hold its single share of Minera Marañón in trust for our sole benefit and hold the share strictly in accordance with our instructions.
In the event that we are able to acquire a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek would then be entitled to an annual 2.5% net returns royalty related to the Mineral Rights. However, if we pay Temasek $2,000,000 within ninety days of our acquisition of a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek will only be entitled to an annual 1.0% net returns royalty related to the Mineral Rights.
- 20 -
If we fail to exercise the third twenty-five percent option, resulting in our continuing to hold our current fifty percent interest in the Mineral Rights but failing to acquire a one hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, the Option Agreement provides that we and Temasek will form a joint venture for the purpose of placing the Peru Property into commercial production. In the event that we enter into a joint venture agreement with Temasek, our responsibilities under the joint venture would include developing a feasible mining project and all necessary facilities and Temasek shall retain a carried free interest in the mining rights. If we enter into a joint venture with Temasek, but do not develop a feasible mining project within three years of the Effective Date (September 29, 2011), we will be required to pay Temasek an advance minimum mining royalty of $500,000 per year, which will be deducted from Temasek’s net return royalty on the Mineral Rights.
Expansion of Peru Property
On January 25, 2010 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a Mineral Rights Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Temasek. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we acquired three separate options from Temasek, each providing for the acquisition of an approximately one-third interest in certain mineral rights (the “Mineral Rights”), in certain properties in Peru (the “Peru Property”) that abut the other property interests we already have in Peru described above. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, the exercise of all three options would result in our acquisition of one hundred percent of the Mineral Rights. The Mineral Rights are currently owned by Minera Saramiriza S.A.C. (“Minera Saramiriza”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Peru. Woodburn Investments, Inc. (“Woodburn”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek, owns 999 shares of the 1,000 shares of Minera Saramiriza that are issued and outstanding. Temasek owns the single remaining share of Woodburn. Our acquisition of each thirty-three percent interest in the Mineral Rights is structured to occur through the transfer to us of thirty-three percent of the outstanding shares of Woodburn upon the exercise of each of the three options.
A description of the Mineral Rights is set forth below:
We may exercise the initial option to acquire a thirty-three percent interest in the Mineral Rights by fulfilling the following conditions:
·
Issuance of 500,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek within thirty (30) days from the Effective Date (issued March 19, 2010);
·
Payment of $250,000 to Temasek within twelve months of the Effective Date; and
·
Issuance of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek or its designee within twelve months of the Effective Date.
We may exercise the second option to acquire the second, thirty-three percent interest in the Mineral Rights, resulting in the acquisition of a sixty-six percent interest in the Mineral Rights, by fulfilling the following conditions:
·
Exercise of the initial option to acquire a thirty-three percent interest in the Mineral Rights;
·
Payment of an additional $1,000,000 to Temasek within twenty-four months of the Effective Date; and
·
Issuance of an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek or its designee within twenty-four months from the Effective Date.
- 21 -
We may exercise the third option to acquire the final, thirty-four percent interest in the Mineral Rights, resulting in the acquisition of a one-hundred percent interest in the Mineral Rights, by fulfilling the following conditions:
·
Exercise of the first and second options to acquire an aggregate sixty-six percent interest in the Mineral Rights;
·
Payment of an additional $2,000,000 to Temasek within thirty-six months of the Effective Date; and
·
Issuance of an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to Temasek or its designee within thirty-six months from the Effective Date.
Upon our acquisition of a 100% interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek is entitled to an annual 2.5% net returns royalty. However, if we pay Temasek an additional $2,000,000 within ninety (90) days of its acquisition of a 100% interest in the Mineral Rights, Temasek will only be entitled to an annual 1.0% net returns royalty from us.
If we exercise the second, thirty-three percent option, resulting in the acquisition of a sixty-six percent interest in the Mineral Rights, but fail to exercise the final option and fail to acquire a 100% interest in the Mineral Rights, we and Temasek will form a joint venture in which we will be wholly responsible for developing a feasible mining project and all necessary facilities and Temasek shall retain a carried free interest in the mining rights. If we do not develop a feasible mining project within three years of the Effective Date, we will be required to pay Temasek an advance minimum mining royalty of $500,000 per year, which will be deducted from Temasek's net return royalty.
Exploration Program
Shortly after our acquisition of the Peru property in September 2008, we commenced the initial stages of our exploration and development program and have carried out the following activities to date:
·
Completed an initial social base line study to document all surface rights owners and people resident in the project area;
·
Implemented a community relations program to inform local communities of the project and what potential opportunities that may exist for community involvement in the implementation phases of the development program;
·
Submitted a Declaración de Impacto Ambiental to the Ministry of Mines and Energy in Peru and received approval to start the exploration;
·
Completed the field work for the Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental semidetallado which, if approved by the Peruvian Ministry of Mines & Energy, will allow us to undertake extensive drilling and bulk sampling programs;
·
Acquired churn drilling equipment for further evaluation and development of resources;
·
Set-up an operational base in the project area in the town of Saramiriza;
·
Contracted various consulting firms and experienced and knowledgeable individuals with specific skills in the exploration of alluvial deposits to assist us with the exploration and development of the Peru property; and
·
Commissioned and subsequently received a preliminary master plan which indicated the size and scope of our projected operations and areas where more information is required.
- 22 -
The principle objective of our planned exploration and development program is to bring a dredge and appropriately matched floating plant onto the property to assist us in conducting trial mining tests which requires that we undertake the following actions:
·
Drill an area on the property where known mineralization exists at closely-spaced centers in accordance with mining industry standards;
·
Extend the resource though a wider-spaced program of reconnaissance drilling so as to indicate the potential size of the deposit;
·
Perform additional geotechnical and metallurgical studies to complement existing information in order to prepare the optimum processing route to be adopted in the exploitation phase; and
·
Prepare scoping, prefeasibility, and full feasibility studies.
An exploration base and a field laboratory have been set up in the town of Saramiriza and we are currently reviewing the on-going exploration program given the experience gained in the last year of operating in this difficult terrain.
In the first quarter of 2009, a Churn drill and ancillary equipment were purchased in the United States and shipped to Peru. The equipment cost approximately $85,000 and we acquired such funds through the issuance of securities in private equity offerings. After the process of importation and transport to site, the initial phase of the drilling program on the project commenced in late July 2009. Drilling capabilities were increased by the purchase of a second-hand Bangka drilling rig at a cost of $15,000. Two addditional Bangka drill are being manufactured for delivery in April 2010.
Gold bearing gravels were intersected in virtually all of the twenty seven (27) holes drilled to date with the better mineralized horizons returning values in the 60 to 200 mg/m3 range (generally, grades in excess of 60 mg/m3 are considered economically viable) with reconnaissance holes up to 15 km apart indicating the widespread distribution of gold throughout the Marañón basin.
Concurrent with the drilling, pitting has been carried out at locations where significant gold mineralization was encountered in drilling. Pitting on the same site as one of the Bangka holes gave comparable gold values for the bulk sample from the pit and the Bangka drill sample, 213 mg/m3 and 208 mg/m3 respectively, indicating that Bangka drilling appears to be an effective evaluation method. In addition, river bank gravel outcrops and artisanal mine workings have been channel sampled and sedimentological studies have been carried out. Again, virtually all samples taken in these programs have contained some level of gold. Channel sampling of exposures in artisanal workings in paleo channels indicate average grades in the range of 120 to 350 mg/m3 with local accumulations of gold up to 550 mg/m3.
We believe that additional drilling is required to better quantify the boundaries of the alluvial gold mineralization and identify concentrations associated with paleo channels. We caution that the drill results previously reported do not in any way indicate the presence of a commercially viable mineral deposit. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the properties underlying our mineral property interests in Perú and a great deal of further exploration is required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of future exploration is determined.
Detailed processing of the heavy mineral concentrates from the samples indicates a relationship between gold values and magnetite content, the two minerals being deposited together in “alluvial traps” (paleo channels) within the Marañón’s immense braided river system. The association of the gold with magnetic minerals provides a potential means of locating concentrations of mineralization. During the first quarter of 2010, we completed ground magnetic surveys over areas where mineralized gravels have been identified in order to obtain a “magnetic fingerprint”. Based on these results, we are planning an aggressive three month drill program at an estimated cost of US$300,000 As a further aid in understanding the sedimentological history of the Marañón river system and identifying target areas, we are obtaining Palsar Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. This radar based satellite technology penetrates vegetation cover and is superior to multispectral satellite imagery in providing detailed surface morphology, essential when interpreting paleo river systems.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we retained the services of an internationally recognized alluvial expert to direct and monitor the on-going exploration program, review results and ensure procedures conform to industry standards.
- 23 -
We have developed and outline above the initial stages of an extensive plan of exploration with the principal objective of determining whether minerals that exists on the property are of sufficient quantity to support commercial production. We have commenced our planned exploration program, but must secure additional financing in the near future in order to be able to sustain any drilling activity or we will be forced to cease our exploration and development program.
In addition to the foregoing, we intend to carry out the geophysical evaluation of the property and plan to continue drilling and test pitting for a period of at least 18 months. If we are unable to secure additional financing in the near future, we will be unable to sustain any drilling activity and be forced to cease our exploration and development program. Our plans currently anticipate that an additional two hundred (200) holes will be drilled to a depth of 50m at 100m centers in the area of known mineralization, with a view toward developing a reserve. The objective of this drilling is to define resources of sufficient size to sustain a fleet of high capacity dredges and floating plants in the future. Bulk samples collected by excavating small pits and shafts will be required for metallurgical testing as well as to confirm drill results. At the same time, mine development planning, process design, and other engineering studies will be conducted with a view to completing a feasibility study within a twenty-four month period. Permitting is anticipated to be initiated as early in the exploration and development cycle as possible, so that trial or pilot dredging can be started as soon as feasibility has been established.
Our current cash on hand is insufficient to complete any of the activities set forth in our planned exploration program. If we are unable to secure additional financing in the near future, we will be forced to cease our exploration and development program. Provided that we are able to secure additional financing, we anticipate that we will incur the following costs for the next twelve months:
Location and Access
At this time, the Gold Sands Project in Peru is our principal project. It comprises an area of 46,100 ha (461 square kilometers) along the interface of the Andean chain and the Amazon foreland basin in northeastern Peru. We have established land positions in two out of the three alluvial camps that exist in this area (the Alegría, Condorcanqui, and Manseriche Alluvial Camps). Of these, the Manseriche Camp is the largest. These camps straddle the boundary of the Loreto (eastern) and Amazonas (western) departments of Northeastern Peru approximately 350 kilometers from the regional center of Iquitos (population 400,000) which lies on the Amazon River. Both Iquitos to the east, as well as Tarapoto to the south are served with daily flights from Lima. The project area can be reached from either of these towns by charter flights while supplies and heavy equipment can be barged in from either Yurimaguas (on the Rio Huallaga) or Iquitos, or trucked in from Bagua on a fair weather road to the village of Saramiriza located in the center of the Manseriche Alluvial Camp along the southwestern bank of the Rio Marañón, roughly in the center of the project area. We have established a logistics and administration base and field laboratory in the village of Saramiriza located in the center of the Manseriche field on the southeastern bank of the Rio Marañón.

Previous Exploration History
A description of the work carried out on the property which comprises the Mineral Rights since its discovery is as follows:
Geology and Mineralization
According to reports of the Ministry of Mines & Energy (MEM), Peru annually produces some six million ounces of gold. Of this, nearly fifty percent is derived from Peru’s largest gold mine, Yanacocha (Newmont), and close to ten percent comes from the alluvial workings in the Madre de Dios river system. Alluvial production in Peru has recently risen from about 200000 oz Au in 1991 to over 500000 oz Au in 2005.
- 27 -
Although Peru has numerous small alluvial gold occurrences, it is generally agreed that there are only four major alluvial gold fields: Marañón-Santiago, Iquitos, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios. Large scale alluvial gold deposits tend to form in environments associated with convergent plate boundaries, particularly at the interface between fold belts and foreland basins. In addition, a necessary requirement for the development of such gold deposits is a metaliferous (gold-rich) hinterland and a river system that can transfer gold from the zone of production in the upper reaches of the drainage basin, along the main trunk of the river system (zone of transfer) to the zone of deposition, usually where the river profile flattens-out at the limit between the highlands and alluvial plains.
In the case of the Manseriche Alluvial Camp, the Marañón and Santiago rivers rise from peak elevations of 2900 meters and 3500 meters respectively, and travel a distance of some 900 kilometers before converging at the Manseriche Gorge which lies at an elevation of 170 m asl. From there, the Marañón (and later the Amazon) must travel another 4000 kilometers before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. With respect to a metalliferous hinterland, the Marañón-Santiago drainage basin is home to some of the largest gold deposits and gold mining operations in the world. These include Newmont’s Yanacocha (40 m oz Au), Goldfield’s Cerro Corona (which currently produce 350000 oz Au per annum), and Aurelian’s Fruta del Norte deposit (14 m oz Au).
While the geology of the project area has no effect on the gold mineralization other than the morphological control of the Rio Marañón, it is the sequence of geological events which has importance in the formation of the “gold sands” in the Manseriche Camp.
The age of most of the gold mineralization in the highlands of the Marañón-Santiago river system is tertiary, and specifically Miocene. However, Eocene-aged tectonism resulted in the formation of the eastern foothills of the Andes which effectively formed a barrier directing all erosion from the hinterland towards a basin on the western side of the Manseriche Gorge. Glacial erosion of the gold deposits in the hinterland resulted in tills and moraines which were subsequently concentrated in glacio-fluvial deposits by melting ice and intense rains in interglacial periods of which a number have been identified in Peru. These sediments were retained by the eastern fold belt of anticlines.
What may have been a key event was the Pajacuas thrust event during the Pliocene Era, which led to the breaching of the closed basin and the subsequent formation of the Manseriche Gorge. This released the gold-rich glacio-fluvial sediments to be reconcentrated and deposited in the Rio Marañón flood plain east of the Gorge.
The sequence of constant erosion, glacio-fluvial concentration, fluvial transport, collection in an intermediate (or series of intermediate) basin(s), and final alluvial concentration in the Rio Marañón flood plain, provided the mixing and concentration which accounts for the regular gold values in the sands and gravels as indicated by the report compiled by Cia Monica de Iquitos.
Termination of Assignment Agreements for Argentinean Properties
On December 12, 2007, we entered into an assignment agreement with Proyectos Mineros S.A. (“PMSA”) (formerly Recursos Maricunga S.A.) to acquire PMSA’s right to explore and an option to purchase certain mineral rights on properties known as the Atena Gold Project located in the Salta Province of Argentina (the “Atena Property”). Effective March 17, 2008, we entered into an assignment agreement with PMSA, whereby PMSA assigned to us PMSA’s right to explore and an option to purchase a 90% interest in the mineral rights of three mining properties referred to as “Amira”, “Amira Norte” and “Esparta II”, located in the Province of Salta, Argentina (the “Amira-Esparta Properties”). On January 8, 2008, we entered into an assignment agreement with PMSA to acquire PMSA’s right to explore and option to purchase certain mineral rights on properties known as the Cerro Amarillo Property located in the Departamento Malargue, Province of Mendoza, Argentina (the “Cerro Amarillo Property”). We collectively refer to the Atena, Amira-Esparta and Cerro Amarillo Properties as the “Argentinean Properties.”
In light of the current economic environment, our management, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, determined that it was necessary to reassess the Company’s current direction and proposed plans for exploration. In connection with this review, we announced that we were suspending our exploration program on the Argentinean Properties for at least the remainder of 2009 and would allocate our resources exclusively to pursue the exploration and development of our property interests in northeastern Peru.
- 28 -
We continued to monitor the current economic environment globally and within Argentina and noted an increasing trend toward instability within Argentina. Rising and excessive inflation rates in Argentina significantly increased the costs of our proposed operations in Argentina beyond our initial expectations. After further evaluation, we noted that Argentinean governmental bodies were pursing policies and regulations which would have adversely impacted our planned operations in Argentina. The existence of a working capital deficiency added support to our conclusion that it is presently not the best allocation of our resources to conduct exploration activities in two different countries. For the foregoing reasons, we determined it to be in our best interest to seek to dispose of our interests in the Argentinean Properties as soon as practicable so as to prevent any default on any of these underlying option agreements.
We reviewed our available alternatives and canvassed a number of qualified parties in an attempt to dispose of our interests in the Argentinean properties for value. As a result of our inability to locate an interested party to enter into a transaction to dispose of our interests in the Argentinean Properties for value, we determined to terminate each of the assignment agreements under which we held the option to acquire the mineral and mining rights underlying these Argentinean properties. We determined that terminating these assignment agreements at this time was in our best interests in order to avoid incurring any additional obligations under each of the respective assignment agreements. In November 2009, we sent each of the notice of termination letters. The termination of the assignment agreement relating to Atena and Amira-Esparta Properties was effective immediately and the termination date of the assignment agreement relating to the Cerro Amarillo Property was effective thirty days following the date of the termination notice.
As a result of our termination of each of the assignment agreements under which we held the option to acquire the mineral and mining rights underlying properties located in the Salta and Mendoza provinces of Argentina, our rights under these agreements reverted back to the assignor and we are not be entitled to recover any of the consideration we have paid, which is an aggregate of 4,100,000 shares of our common stock and $70,000 in cash. Proyectos Mineros S.A. (“PMSA”) (formerly Recursos Maricunga S.A.) is the assignor for each of the properties located in the Salta and Mendoza provinces of Argentina. Dr. Willem Fuchter, who served as our Chief Executive Officer and member of our board of directors from January 10, 2008 until his resignation from both positions on September 25, 2009, is the president and director of PMSA and holds a 50% ownership interest in the voting securities of PMSA.
Letter of Intent
On December 2, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent with Seabridge Gold Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Seabridge”), to acquire all of Seabridge’s interests in certain mining claims and leasehold interests for exploration properties located in Nevada. The properties subject to the contemplated transaction comprise interests in 2,141 claims in Nevada covering more than 30 exploration projects with known gold occurrences. Most of the claims are situated in Nevada's prolific Walker Lane gold belt. Closing of the transaction, which was anticipated to occur on or about January 31, 2010, is subject to satisfactory completion of both parties’ due diligence, regulatory approval and the execution of a binding definitive agreement.
On February 24, 2010, we extended the letter of intent we entered into with Seabridge in recognition that final documentation and legal due diligence for the transaction has not yet been completed. The parties are negotiating the final terms of a definitive agreement. The terms of the definitive agreement being negotiated between the parties contemplates that closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur on or about May 15, 2010. Closing of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions and contingences, including the following:
Based on the letter of intent, the purchase price for the exploration properties is anticipated to consist of three elements: (1) staged cash payments totaling $3,000,000; (2) a $1,000,000 million convertible debenture; and (3) 3,000,000 shares of our common stock.
The letter of intent and the subsequent extension contemplates that $3,000,000 in cash would be payable as follows: $200,000 payable immediately upon execution of the letter of intent; $800,000 payable upon the closing of the sale of the exploration properties; $1,000,000 payable on April 30, 2010 and the final $1,000,000 would be payable pursuant to the terms of a secured promissory note due on the first anniversary of the closing, of the transaction, with accrued interest at 8% per year.
- 29 -
The letter of intent contemplates that the $1,000,000, two-year secured convertible debenture would be due on the second anniversary of the closing of the transaction and would accrue interest at 8% per year, payable quarterly. The debenture would be redeemable by us at any time prior to maturity upon payment of $1,250,000. If not redeemed, the debenture and any accrued interest are convertible by Seabridge into common shares of our common stock at $1.00 per share. Our obligations as contemplated under the promissory note and the debenture would be secured by the exploration properties purchased in the transaction.
The letter of intent contemplates that 3,000,000 shares of our common stock would be issued in two separate tranches. The first tranche, consisting of 1,000,000 shares, would be issued on the closing of the sale of the properties. The second tranche, consisting of 2,000,000 shares, would be issued, but held in escrow until the third anniversary of the closing or until confirmation that the properties host a measured and indicated gold resource of 1 million ounces or more, whichever occurs first.
Closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to now occur on or about May 15, 2010, is subject to a number of conditions and contingences, including the following:
·
the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement on terms acceptable to both parties;
·
the approval of the parties’ respective board of directors; and
·
receipt of all necessary third party consents, approval and waivers.
We are in the process of negotiating towards the successful completion of the proposed acquisition, but we can give you no assurance that these and other conditions will ever be satisfied to allow us to complete the proposed acquisition.
