Item 2 - Properties
Our properties consist primarily of oil and gas wells and our ownership in leasehold acreage, both developed and undeveloped. At December 31, 2010, we had interests in 6,789 gross (1,020.7 net) oil and gas wells and owned leasehold interests in approximately 1 million gross (535,000 net) undeveloped acres.
Reserves
See “Glossary of Terms” for current definitions of terms related to oil and gas reserves.
The following table sets forth our estimated quantities of proved reserves as of December 31, 2010, all of which are located within the United States.
(a) None of our oil and gas reserves are derived from non-traditional sources.
(b) Oil reserves include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
(c) Natural gas reserves have been converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
The present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves, before deductions for estimated future income taxes and asset retirement obligations, discounted at 10% (“PV-10 Value”), totaled $992 million at December 31, 2010. The commodity prices used to estimate proved reserves and their related PV-10 Value at December 31, 2010 were based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period from January 2010 through December 2010. The benchmark averages for 2010 were $79.43 per barrel of oil and NGL and $4.38 per MMBtu of natural gas. These benchmark average prices were further adjusted for quality, energy content, transportation fees and other price differentials specific to our properties, resulting in an average adjusted price of $72.36 per barrel of oil and NGL and $5.44 per Mcf of natural gas over the remaining life of our proved reserves. Operating costs were not escalated.
PV-10 Value is not a generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) financial measure, but we believe it is useful as a supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements. To compute our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2010, we began with the PV-10 Value of our proved reserves and deducted the present value of estimated future income taxes of $276.9 million and net abandonment costs of $30.4 million, discounted at 10%. At December 31, 2010, our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows totaled $684.4 million. While the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, the present value of proved reserves is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies and can be used within the industry and by securities analysts to evaluate proved reserves on a more comparable basis.
The following table summarizes certain information as of December 31, 2010 regarding our estimated proved reserves in each of our principal producing areas.
(a) Oil reserves include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
(b) Natural gas reserves have been converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf to one barrel of oil.
The following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2010.
Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries in 2010 added 23,193 MBOE of proved reserves, replacing 425% of our 2010 production. These additions resulted primarily from our Andrews County drilling program in the Permian Basin and our Austin Chalk drilling program in the Giddings Area. Of the total reserve additions, proved developed reserves accounted for 8,759 MBOE, while the remaining 14,434 MBOE were proved undeveloped reserves.
Revisions. Net upward revisions of 2,282 MBOE consisted of upward revisions of 6,005 MBOE related to pricing and downward revisions of 3,723 MBOE related to performance. Upward revisions of 6,005 MBOE were attributable to the effects of higher product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves. Most of the downward performance revisions resulted from the reclassification of 2,009 MBOE of Permian Basin reserves from proved undeveloped to probable (see discussion below concerning changes in proved undeveloped reserves).
Purchases and sales of minerals-in-place. In June 2010, we acquired from a group of private investors an undivided 14% working interest in 36 Wolfberry operated wells in Andrews County, Texas resulting in an increase of 349 MBOE. Also in June 2010, we sold our interests in 22 operated and 76 non-operated producing wells in North Louisiana resulting in a decrease of 2,937 MBOE.
The following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2010.
We added 14,434 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries related to Permian Basin and Giddings Area drilling locations, including 4,592 MBOE of upgrades from probable to proved undeveloped. Downward revisions of 2,027 MBOE resulted primarily from the reclassification of 2,009 MBOE of Permian Basin reserves from undeveloped to probable in accordance with SEC standards that require proved undeveloped reserves to be developed within five years from their date or origin. We also converted 865 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2009 to proved developed reserves during 2010 at a cost of approximately $17.2 million. We expect to develop approximately 77% of our proved undeveloped reserves in 2011 at a cost of approximately $223.2 million.
Alternative Pricing Cases
In addition to the estimated proved reserves disclosed above in accordance with the commodities pricing required by the new reserves rule (referred to as the “SEC Case”), the following table compares certain information regarding our SEC proved reserves to a Futures Pricing Case.
(a) Oil reserves include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
(b) Natural gas has been converted to oil equivalents at the rate of six Mcf to one barrel of oil.
Futures Pricing Case. The Futures Pricing Case discloses our estimated proved reserves using future market-based commodities prices instead of the average historical prices used in the SEC Case. Under the Futures Pricing Case, we used futures prices, as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) on December 31, 2010, as benchmark prices for 2011 through 2015, and continued to use the 2015 futures price for all subsequent years. These benchmark prices were further adjusted for quality, energy content, transportation fees and other price differentials specific to our properties, resulting in an average adjusted price of $84.57 per barrel of oil and NGL and $6.75 per Mcf of natural gas over the remaining life of the proved reserves.
Reserve Estimation Procedures
Overview
We have established a system of internal controls over our reserve estimation process, which we believe provides us reasonable assurance that reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with SEC and FASB standards. These controls include oversight by trained technical personnel employed by us and by the use of qualified independent petroleum engineers to evaluate our proved reserves on an annual basis. Substantially all of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2010 were derived from engineering evaluation reports prepared by Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. (“Williamson”) and Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”). Of our total SEC Case estimated proved reserves, Williamson evaluated 62.7% and Ryder Scott evaluated 36.9% on a BOE basis.

Technology Used to Establish Proved Reserves
Under current SEC standards, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, we employ technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technological data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Generally, oil and gas reserves are estimated using, as appropriate, one or more of these available methods: production decline curve analysis, analogy to similar reservoirs or volumetric calculations. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history are estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and technological data to assess the reservoir continuity. In some instances, particularly in connection with exploratory discoveries, analogous performance data is not available, requiring us to rely primarily on volumetric calculations to determine reserve quantities. Volumetric calculations are primarily based on data derived from geologic-based seismic interpretation, open-hole logs and completion flow data. When using production decline curve analysis or analogy to estimate proved reserves, we limit our estimates to the quantities of oil and gas derived through volumetric calculations.
More than 98% of our additions to proved reserves in 2010 were derived from wells drilled in the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area. A significant amount of technological data is available in these areas, which allows us to estimate with reasonable certainty the proved reserves and production decline rates attributable to most of our reserve additions through analogy to historical performance from wells in the same reservoirs. None of our additions to proved reserves for 2010 were estimated solely on volumetric calculations.
Processes and Controls
Mr. Gasser and his engineering staff maintain a reserves database covering substantially all of our oil and gas properties utilizing AriesTM, a widely-used reserves and economics software package licensed by a unit of Halliburton Company. Some of our properties are not evaluated since they are individually and collectively insignificant to our total proved reserves and related PV-10 Value. Our engineering staff assimilates all technological and operational data necessary to evaluate our reserves and updates the reserves database throughout the year. Technological data is described above under “Technologies Used to Establish Proved Reserves.” Operational data includes ownership interests, product prices, operating expenses and future development costs.
Using the most appropriate method available, Mr. Gasser applies his professional judgment, based on his training and experience, to project a production profile for each evaluated property. Mr. Gasser consults with other engineers and geoscientists within our company as needed to validate the accuracy and completeness of his estimates and to determine if any of the technological data upon which his estimates were based are incorrect or outdated.
The engineering staff consults with our accounting department to validate the accuracy and completeness of certain operational data maintained in the reserves database, including ownership interests, average commodity prices, price differentials, and operating costs.
Although we believe that the estimates of reserves prepared by our engineering staff have been prepared in accordance with professional engineering standards consistent with SEC and FASB guidelines, we engage independent petroleum engineering consultants to prepare annual evaluations of our estimated reserves. After Mr. Gasser and our engineering staff have made an internal evaluation of our estimated reserves, we provide copies of the AriesTM reserves database to Ryder Scott as it relates to properties owned by Southwest Royalties, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to Williamson as it relates to properties owned by CWEI and Warrior Gas Company, another of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition, we provide to the consultants for their analysis all pertinent data needed to properly evaluate our reserves. The services provided by Williamson and Ryder Scott are not audits of our reserves but instead consist of complete engineering evaluations of the respective properties. For more information about the evaluations performed by Williamson and Ryder Scott, see copies of their respective reports filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K.
Both Williamson and Ryder Scott use the AriesTM reserves database which we provide to them as a starting point for their evaluations. This process reduces the risk of errors that can result from data input and also results in significant cost savings to us. The petroleum engineering consultants generally rely on the technical and operational data provided to them without independent verification; however, in the course of their evaluation, if any issue comes to their attention that questions the validity or sufficiency of that data, the consultants will not rely on the questionable data until they have resolved the issue to their satisfaction. The consultants analyze each production decline curve to determine if they agree with our interpretation of the underlying technical data. If they arrive at a different conclusion, the consultants revise the estimates in the database to reflect their own interpretations.
After Williamson and Ryder Scott complete their respective evaluations, they return a modified AriesTM reserves database to our engineering staff for review. Mr. Gasser identifies all material variances between our initial estimates and those of the consultants and discusses the variances with Williamson or Ryder Scott, as applicable, in order to resolve the discrepancies. If any variances relate to inaccurate or incomplete data, corrected or additional data is provided to the consultants and the related estimates are revised. When variances are caused solely by judgment differences between Mr. Gasser and the consultants, we accept the estimates of the consultants.
The final reserve estimates are then analyzed by our financial accounting group under the direction of Michael L. Pollard, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The group reconciles changes in reserve estimates during the year by source, consisting of changes due to extensions and discoveries, purchases/sales of mineral-in-place, revisions of previous estimates, and production. Revisions of previous estimates are further analyzed by changes related to pricing and changes related to performance. All material fluctuations in reserve quantities identified through this analysis are discussed with Mr. Gasser. Although unlikely, if an error in the estimated reserves is discovered through this review process, Mr. Gasser will submit the facts related to the error to the appropriate consultant for correction prior to the public release of the reserve estimates.
Other Information Concerning our Proved Reserves
The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data, the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows and PV-10 Value are based on various assumptions and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.
Since January 1, 2009, we have not filed an estimate of our net proved oil and gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the SEC.
Delivery Commitments
As of December 31, 2010, we had no commitments to provide fixed and determinable quantities of oil or natural gas in the near future under contracts or agreements, other than through customary marketing arrangements which require us to nominate estimated volumes of natural gas production for sale during periods of one month or less.
