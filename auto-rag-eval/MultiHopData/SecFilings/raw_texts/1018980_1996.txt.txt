PERMIAN BASIN. At January 1, 1997, 53.5% of the Company's proved reserves were concentrated in the Permian Basin, an approximately 70-county region in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. The Company's production comes from well known formations such as the Spraberry, Canyon, Ellenberger and Devonian. The majority of the Company's producing intervals in the Permian Basin range from 4,500 feet to 9,500 feet in depth.
The Company has several exploratory projects in the Permian Basin based primarily on 3-D seismic surveys. The most significant include:
EDWARDS/MCELROY RANCH PROSPECT, ECTOR AND CRANE COUNTIES, TEXAS. Costilla has identified 81 drilling locations on the Company's 14,623 gross (7,165 net) acres in this prospect based on an approximate 80-square mile 3-D seismic project. Through December 31, 1996, the Company drilled 15 wells on this prospect, of which 14 were successful resulting in three separate field discoveries. In addition, these wells have confirmed the Strawn and Wolfcamp trends which were identified by the seismic project undertaken jointly with Texaco Exploration and Production Inc. ("Texaco"). The Company plans to drill 20 wells in this trend in 1997, two of which were in progress at December 31, 1996. The Company's working interest in this prospect is approximately 49%.
Costilla and Texaco are also evaluating the development of a Queen Sand field identified from the Edwards/McElroy Ranch seismic program. The six producing wells at December 31, 1996 were producing an aggregate of approximately 50 Bbls of oil per day. A pilot waterflood has been commenced and is being evaluated for additional development. The drilling of one additional Queen Sand well is anticipated in 1997.
MACGYVER-GREEN ACRES PROSPECT, HOWARD COUNTY, TEXAS. The Company has identified 53 locations in this prospect based on information derived from approximately 30 square miles of 3-D seismic data that the Company acquired on the area in 1994. The Talbot Fuller well was the first well drilled by the Company on this prospect and was completed in the Canyon Lime formation at 8,600 feet in August 1994. From completion to December 31, 1996, the well produced 72 MBbls of oil and 287 Mmcf of gas, and averaged 54 Bbls of oil per day and 625 Mcf of gas per day during December 1996. Of the 24 wells which have been drilled on this prospect, 20 are productive. The
Company intends to drill 20 additional wells during 1997 on its 10,041 gross (7,229 net) acres. The Company's working interest in this prospect averages approximately 72%.
The following two 3-D programs currently being undertaken by the Company in the Permian Basin are expected to provide additional drilling locations:
WILSON RANCH 3-D PROJECT, PECOS COUNTY, TEXAS. The Wilson Ranch is located in northeastern Pecos County, approximately 10 miles west of the Yates field. In 1996 the Company completed an approximate 17-square mile seismic survey on the project. The project presents several potential exploration targets, including the Queen, San Andres, Wolfcamp, Devonian and Ellenberger formations, found at depths ranging from 1,600 to 8,000 feet. The Company has purchased a lease covering 3,750 gross acres on this 50,000 acre ranch. After acquiring the lease, the Company sold a portion of its interest in the lease to a major oil company, which left the Company with an approximately 53% working interest. The Company believes that there is significant potential in this area.
DAVAN UNIT 3-D PROJECT, STONEWALL COUNTY, TEXAS. The Company has completed another 3-D seismic project to further develop the Company-operated Davan Unit. The project involves a 3-D seismic evaluation of approximately 4,380 gross acres adjacent to a Company-operated waterflood which has produced in excess of three Mmbbls of oil. The Company plans to drill four wells on this project during 1997. The Company's working interest in this project is 100%.
An example of the Company's current exploitation efforts in the Permian Basin is:
WORLD FIELD, CROCKETT COUNTY, TEXAS. This field was acquired in the 1996 Acquisition. It produces from the Grayburg formation at an average depth of 2550 feet. Discovered in 1926, it is one of the oldest and most prolific shallow fields in the Permian Basin. Costilla owns a 100% working interest in 4,380 acres containing 87 existing wells. At the time of acquisition, the field was producing approximately 480 Bbls of oil per day and 53,400 Bbls of water per day. In December, 1996 the Company initiated a polymer treatment program to reduce water production and increase oil cut. Thirteen treatments have been completed as of February 1997 resulting in oil production improving to approximately 650 Bbls of oil per day and water production dropping to approximately 43,500 Bbls of water per day. Additionally, some submersible pumps have been replaced by progressing cavity pumps which are expected to be significantly less costly to operate. A fieldwide study is underway to identify additional workover candidates as well as additional locations for development drilling.
GULF COAST. At January 1, 1997, 22.6% of the Company's proved reserves were concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, on shore. The Company's production in this region primarily comes from known formations such as Frio, Yegua, Austin Chalk and Wilcox.
The Company plans to use its expertise in aggressively developing 3-D opportunities on the extensive acreage position it holds in the region. Examples of such exploration projects in progress include:
SEALY PROSPECT, AUSTIN COUNTY, TEXAS. The Sealy Field was acquired in the 1995 Acquisition and currently consists of 10,982 gross and net acres. The Wilcox formation in this field has produced over 66 Bcf of gas and there are subsurface indications of the presence of several fault blocks that lie untested. The Company's working interest in this prospect is 100%. The Company has acquired additional acreage in this prospect and plans to initiate a 3-D survey in 1997.
SOUTHWEST SPEAKS, LAVACA COUNTY, TEXAS. This project was also acquired in the 1995 Acquisition and currently consists of 9,062 gross and net acres. Multiple producing horizons from shallow depths to below 14,000 feet have produced over 122 Bcf of gas from this highly faulted field. A well has been completed in the Rainbow Wilcox sand on acreage adjoining Costilla's lease. A well, in which Costilla holds a 10% interest as a result of a farmout, is
being completed on Costilla's lease. The Company has commenced a 3-D survey in the Speaks area in the first quarter of 1997. The Company's working interest in this prospect is 100%.
BORCHERS FIELD, LAVACA COUNTY, TEXAS. This field was acquired by the Company in the 1996 Acquisition. The property is on trend with the Speaks project and is also a highly faulted field providing opportunity for further development. The Company's lease in the Borchers field area has produced over 21 Bcf of gas from two Wilcox sands. Costilla has a 100% working interest in this field consisting of 1,322 gross and net acres.
Examples of exploitation activities in this region include:
PERSONVILLE, LIMESTONE COUNTY, TEXAS. When this lease was acquired in the 1995 Acquisition, it was producing 70 Mcf per day from one well. In the last half of 1996, the Company completed two 11,000 foot Cotton Valley wells which were collectively producing approximately 4.5 Mmcf per day in December 1996. A third well was completed in January 1997. The Company plans 14 additional wells in this area. The Company is the operator and owns approximately 29% working interest in this 1,026 gross acre (298 net acre) lease.
AUSTIN CHALK, BRAZOS, BURLESON, FAYETTE AND LEE COUNTIES, TEXAS. Costilla acquired the majority of the working interest in nine gross Austin Chalk wells in the 1995 Acquisition and an additional 80 gross Austin Chalk wells were included in the 1996 Acquisition. By mid-December 1996 the Company had worked over six wells via refracing and/or opening additional pay zones. Production has improved from 137 BOE per day to 325 BOE per day on those wells. Additional increases in production are expected as frac loads are recovered. Completion of the first two of seven planned horizontal wells in the Austin Chalk are the Patterson "G" 1-H, producing 326 barrels of oil and 727,000 cubic feet of gas per day, and Mais-Kachtik 1-H, producing 364 barrels of oil and 952,000 cubic feet of gas per day. Costilla has 30,414 gross (20,985 net) acres in the Austin Chalk area, and its working interest in this area averages approximately 69%.
ROCKY MOUNTAIN. At January 1, 1997, 13.7% of the Company's proved reserves were concentrated in the Rocky Mountain region, which includes Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah.
The Company has a number of opportunities in the Rocky Mountain region involving 3-D seismic surveys, exploratory drilling and exploitation activities. Examples of each of these opportunities are:
OUTLOOK FIELD, SHERIDAN COUNTY, MONTANA. The Company undertook its first Rocky Mountain 3-D seismic survey in the Outlook area to further develop the field. Three drilling locations were identified from the data of which the first well has been drilled and completed as a producer. Additional development is anticipated. Costilla has 5,169 gross (1,292 net) acres in the Outlook prospect, and its working interest is approximately 25%.
WATTENBERG FIELD, WELD COUNTY, COLORADO. The Company operates 70 wells in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin in northeast Colorado. During January, 1997 the Company initiated an 11 well development program of which 7 wells have been completed at March 20, 1997, with initial producing rates averaging 55 BOEPD per well. An estimated 20 additional locations are drillable. The Company owns an approximate 72% average working interest in 6,255 gross (4,479 net) acres.
MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company utilizes an active marketing program for a portion of its crude oil production in order to enhance the net price it receives. The Company sells its crude oil production from operated properties in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, at the lease level to an oil transportation company for the posted price, plus an agreed upon bonus, with a corresponding agreement to repurchase this production at its delivery point (typically, Cushing, Oklahoma) for a price equal to the then posted price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil less an agreed upon deduction for transportation and quality differentials, if any between the repurchased crude oil and West Texas
Intermediate crude oil. The Company then employs a broker to resell its crude oil to end users (such as refineries) on a month-to-month basis. The lease level sales and repurchase contracts are typically of six months durations. With respect to its other operated oil production (primarily located in Texas), the Company employs a similar price enhancement strategy, although the repurchase feature is absent. Instead, the lease level purchaser resells the crude oil to end users at the delivery point for the account of the Company. While these arrangements have the effect of increasing the net price the Company receives for its crude oil, such arrangements do not have the effect of limiting the Company's exposure to movements in crude oil prices. The Company markets its gas production at the lease level pursuant to month-to-month contracts. For the year ended December 31, 1996, one oil purchaser accounted for 11.2% of the Company's 1996 consolidated revenue. The Company does not anticipate any difficulty if it should have to replace any of the purchasers of its crude oil and natural gas.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company typically employs a strategy of purchasing put options on a portion of its anticipated oil and gas production. This strategy is designed to protect the Company from significant downward movements in commodity prices while preserving the benefit of rising prices. The Company does not establish hedges in excess of its anticipated production. The Company's current position with regard to its 1997 commodity hedges is as follows:
OIL SALES. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had purchased put options on 6,536 barrels of oil per day for the calendar months June 1997 through October 1997 providing a floor price of $17.00 per barrel. Additionally, the Company had purchased put options on 2,500 Bbls of oil per day for 1997 which provide a floor price of $16.00 per barrel and sold call options on 2,500 barrels of oil per day for 1997 at $20.65 per barrel. These put options provide downside protection on approximately 70% of the Company's estimated 1997 oil production.
GAS SALES. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had put options which provide a floor price of $1.65 per Mmbtu (approximately $1.82 per Mcf) for 150,000 Mmbtu's per month of its gas production through October 1997. In February 1997, the Company purchased put options which establish a floor price of $1.85 per Mmbtu (approximately $2.04 per Mcf) for 300,000 Mmbtu's per month of its gas production for the period April 1997 through October 1997. The put options currently in place represent approximately 25% of the Company's estimated gas production for 1997.
OIL AND GAS RESERVES
The Company's estimated total proved and proved developed reserves of oil and gas as of January 1, 1997 were as follows:
JANUARY 1, 1997 -------------------------- OIL GAS (MBBLS) (MMCF) MBOE ------- ------- ------ Proved developed producing . . . . 13,894 82,861 27,704 Proved developed non- producing. . . . . . . . . . . . 124 7,162 1,318 Proved undeveloped . . . . . . . . 2,982 30,249 8,023 ------ ------- ------ Total proved . . . . . . . . . . 17,000 120,272 37,045 ------ ------- ------ ------ ------- ------
The future net cash flows from the Company's estimated proved reserves as of January 1, 1997 were as follows:
JANUARY 1, 1997 --------------- (in thousands) Future net cash flows before income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $538,343 Future net cash flows before income taxes, discounted at 10% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $311,803
The reserve estimates at January 1, 1997 were prepared by Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc.
The reserve data set forth herein present estimates only. In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of the future net revenues therefrom are based upon an number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the subject properties, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices and future operating costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. All such estimates are to some degree speculative, and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net revenues expected therefrom, prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. The Company therefore emphasizes that the actual production, revenues, severance and excise taxes, development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will likely vary from such estimates, and such variances could be material.
Estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations, which may be substantial, in the estimated reserves.
In accordance with applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), the estimated discounted future net revenues from estimated proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate unless such prices or costs are contractually determined at such date. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net revenues also will be affected by factors such as actual production, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers, changes in governmental regulations or taxation and the impact of inflation on costs.
PRODUCTION VOLUMES, PRICES AND COSTS
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company's production volumes, average sales price and costs for the periods presented:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, -------------------------- 1996 1995 1994 ------ ------ ------ Production: Oil (MBbls). . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,726 950 330 Gas (Mmcf) . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,205 4,806 1,600 MBOE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,260 1,751 597

- --------------------- (1) Production costs per BOE in 1996 and 1995 were unusually high as a result of relatively high workover expenses with respect to properties acquired in the 1995 Acquisition and the 1996 Acquisition which did not produce related production improvements until subsequent periods. Additionally, the Company's 1995 production costs were adversely affected by expenses incurred in connection with plugging wells to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
The Company drilled, or participated in the drilling of, the following number of wells during the periods indicated. At December 31, 1996, the Company was in the process of drilling 7 gross (4.33 net) wells and was in the process of completing 8 gross (4.04 net) wells as producers which are not reflected in the following table.

ACREAGE
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company's developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage as of December 31, 1996. Acreage in which the Company's interest is limited to royalty, overriding royalty, mineral and similar interests is excluded.
OTHER ACTIVITIES
MOLDOVA CONCESSION AGREEMENT. In July 1995, the Republic of Moldova (located in Eastern Europe between Romania and the Ukraine) granted a Concession Agreement to Resource Development Company Limited, L.L.C. ("Redeco"), an entity not affiliated with the Company. The Company has paid Redeco $90,000 and agreed to bear the first $2.0 million of Concession expenses in return for a 50% interest in Redeco. After the initial $2.0 million expenditure, which was incurred in August 1996, the Company and the other member of Redeco are responsible for bearing 50.0% each of future expenses. To date, three wells, drilled by the government in the 1960s, have been reentered and two new wells have been completed by the Company in Moldova. The Company continues to evaluate the Concession for further development.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
The Company has obtained title opinions on substantially all of its producing properties and believes that it has satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. As is
customary in the oil and gas industry, the Company performs a minimal title investigation before acquiring undeveloped properties. A title opinion is obtained prior to the commencement of drilling operations on such properties. The Company's properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens which the Company believes do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties.
OPERATIONAL HAZARDS AND INSURANCE
The Company's operations are subject to the hazards and risks inherent in drilling and production and transportation of oil and gas, including fires, natural disasters, explosions, encountering formations with abnormal pressures, blowouts, cratering, pipeline ruptures, and spills, any of which can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of properties of the Company and others, and suspension of operations.
The Company maintains insurance of various types to cover its operations, including liability coverage and operator's extra expense coverage which provides for care, custody and control of all material wells drilled by the Company as operator. The Company believes that its insurance is adequate and customary for companies of a similar size engaged in operations similar to those of the Company, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The Company's general policy is to only engage drilling contractors who provide substantial insurance coverage and name the Company as an additional named insured. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, no assurances can be given that the Company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable.
