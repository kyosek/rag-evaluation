The ground lease runs through 2033 (inclusive of four five-year renewal options), and contains a buyout right beginning at the end of the term in 2013 and at the end of each five-year renewal term thereafter.

While the hotel does not currently face significant competition from its competitors, the City of Fort Worth has announced that it will heavily subsidize the construction of a new hotel to be managed by Omni to be built next to the convention center. We expect that hotel to become the Renaissance Worthington’s primary competitor in the market. The Omni is scheduled to open in 2009.

We also acquired a leasehold interest in a parcel of land with development rights to build a 320 to 350 room hotel. The expansion hotel, should we decide to build it, will be located on a 1 ½ acre parcel of developable land that is immediately adjacent to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel.

Our Hotel Management Agreements
We are a party to hotel management agreements with Marriott for seventeen of the twenty-one properties. The Vail Marriott Mountain Resort & Spa is managed by an affiliate of Vail Resorts and is under a long-term franchise agreement with Marriott; the Westin Atlanta North at Perimeter is managed by Noble Investment Group; the Conrad Chicago is managed by Conrad Hotels USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Hilton; and the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel is managed by Starwood.
Each hotel manager is responsible for (i) the hiring of certain executive level employees, subject to certain veto rights, (ii) training and supervising the managers and employees required to operate the properties and (iii) purchasing supplies, for which we generally will reimburse the manager. The manager provides centralized reservation systems, national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services. Each manager also prepares and implements annual operations budgets subject to our review and approval. Each of our management agreements limit our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee (i) is not a competitor of the manager, (ii) assumes the related management agreements and (iii) meets specified other conditions.
Term
The following table sets forth the agreement date, initial term and number of renewal terms under the respective hotel management agreements for each of our hotels. Generally, the term of the hotel management agreements generally renew automatically for a negotiated number of consecutive periods upon the expiration of the initial term unless the property manager gives notice to us of its election not to renew the hotel management agreement.
Amounts Payable under our Hotel Management Agreements
Under our current hotel management agreements, the property manager receives a base management fee and, if certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management fee. The base management fee is generally payable as a percentage of gross hotel revenues for each fiscal year. The incentive management fee is generally based on hotel operating profits and is typically equal to between 20% and 25% of hotel operating profits, but the fee only applies to that portion of hotel operating profits above a negotiated return on our invested capital. We refer to this excess of operating profits over a return on our invested capital as “available cash flow.”
The following table sets forth the base management fee and incentive management fee, generally due and payable each fiscal year, for each of our properties:
(1) As a percentage of gross revenues.
(2) Based on a percentage of hotel operating profits above a negotiated return on our investment capital as more fully described in the following footnotes.

(5) The base management fee will be equal to 3% of gross revenues for fiscal years 2006 through 2008, with up to 1% of gross revenues forfeited from 2006 to 2008 if DiamondRock does not achieve an 8.5% unlevered yield in 2006, 9.5% unlevered yield in 2007, or 10.75% unlevered yield in 2008.
(6) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of 10.75% of certain capital expenditures.
(7) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) the payment of certain loan procurement costs, (ii) 10.75% of certain capital expenditures, (iii) an agreed-upon return on certain expenditures and (iv) the value of certain amounts paid into a reserve account established for the replacement, renewal and addition of certain hotel goods. The owners priority expires in 2023.
(8) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) actual debt service and (ii) 15% of cumulative and compounding return on equity, which results with each sale.
(9) Calculated as 20% of net operating income before base management fees. There is no owner’s priority.
(10) The base management fee will be equal to 2.5% of gross revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and 3% for fiscal years thereafter.
(11) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits after a pre-set dollar amount of owner’s priority. Beginning in fiscal year 2011, the incentive management fee will be 103% of the prior year cash flow.
(12) The base management fee will be equal to 5.5% of gross revenues for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 and 6% for fiscal year 2015 and thereafter until the expiration of the agreement.

(13) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of 12% of the sum of (i) $38.8 million and (ii) the amount of certain capital expenditures, less 5% of the total real estate tax bill (for as long as the hotel is leased to a party other than the manager).
(14) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of 10.75% of the sum of (i) $73.7 million and (ii) the amount of certain capital expenditures.
(15) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) $8.4 million and (ii) 10.75% of certain capital expenditures.

(19) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of 10.75% of our acquisition costs plus certain capital expenditures. We estimate that the threshold will be approximately $9 million. The percentage of operating profits is 20% except from 2011 through 2025 when it is 25%.

(21) The incentive management fee is equal to the available cash flow for each fiscal year, subject to a cap of 20% of operating profit for such fiscal year. Commencing with the fiscal year 2002, the operating profit with respect to each fiscal year is reduced by an amount equal to 10.75% of all material capital expenditures funded by the TRS lessee; provided that the material capital expenditures are included in the calculation of the incentive management fee with respect to the fiscal year or fiscal years during which such expenditures occurred (on a pro rata basis).
(22) The base management fee will be equal to 6% of gross revenues for fiscal years 2008 through 2016 and 6.5% of gross revenues thereafter. In the event that the property’s operating profit is below certain thresholds in 2006 and 2007, the base management fee may be reduced by up to $100,000 per year. In addition, in the event that the hotel’s operating profit is above certain thresholds starting in 2008, the base management fee will be increased to 6.5% and if the hotel’s operating profit is above an additional threshold starting in 2012, the base management fee will be increased to 7.0%
(23) Calculated as a percentage of operating profits in excess of the sum of (i) $4.1 million and (ii) 12% of certain capital expenditures and pre-conversion expenses.

In addition, part of one of the parking garages adjacent to one of our hotels is subject to a ground lease agreement:
· A portion of the parking garage relating to the Renaissance Worthington is subject to three ground leases that cover, contiguously with each other, approximately one-fourth of the land on which the parking garage is constructed. Each of the ground leases has a term that runs through July 2067, inclusive of the three 15-year renewal options.
Finally, two of the golf courses adjacent to two of our hotels are subject to ground lease agreements:
· The golf course that is part of the Marriott Griffin Gate Resort is subject to a ground lease covering approximately 54 acres. The ground lease runs through 2033, inclusive of our renewal options. We have the right, beginning in 2013 and upon the expiration of any 5-year renewal term, to purchase the property covered by such ground lease for an amount ranging from $27,500 to $37,500 per acre, depending on which renewal term has expired. The ground lease also grants us the right to purchase the leased property upon a third party offer to purchase such property on the same terms and conditions as the third party offer. We are also the sub-sublessee under another minor ground lease of land adjacent to the golf course, with a term expiring in 2020.
· The golf course that is part of the Oak Brook Hills Marriott Resort is subject to a ground lease covering approximately 110 acres. The ground lease runs through 2045 including renewal options.
These ground leases generally require us to make rental payments (including a percentage of gross receipts as percentage rent with respect to the Courtyard Manhattan/Fifth Avenue ground lease) and payments for all, or in the case of the ground leases covering the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown extension and a portion of the Marriott Griffin Gate Resort golf course, our tenant’s share of, charges, costs, expenses, assessments and liabilities, including real property taxes and utilities. Furthermore, these ground leases generally require us to obtain and maintain insurance covering the subject property.
The following table reflects the annual base rents of our ground leases:
(1) These terms assume our exercise of all renewal options.
(2) Represents rent for the year ended December 31, 2006. Rent will increase annually by 5.5%.
(3) The ground lease term is 49 years. We have the right to renew the ground lease for an additional 49 year term on the same terms then applicable to the ground lease.
(4) The total annual rent includes the fixed rent noted in the table plus a percentage rent equal to 5% of gross receipts for each lease year, but only to the extent that 5% of gross receipts exceeds the minimum fixed rent in such lease year.
(5) We have the right to extend the term of this lease for two consecutive renewal terms of ten years each with rent at then market value.
(6) Total annual rent under the ground lease is capped at 2.5% of hotel gross revenues during the initial 30 years of the ground lease.
Subject to certain limitations, an assignment of the ground leases covering the Courtyard Manhattan/Fifth Avenue, a portion of the Marriott Griffin Gate Resort golf course and the Oak Brook Hills Marriott Resort golf course do not require the consent of the ground lessor. With respect to the ground leases covering the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown hotel and extension, Bethesda Marriott Suites and Westin Boston Waterfront, any proposed assignment of our leasehold interest as ground lessee under the ground lease requires the consent of the applicable ground lessor. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our ground lessee’s interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of the ground lessor, even if such transaction may be in the best interests of our stockholders.
Mortgage Debt
