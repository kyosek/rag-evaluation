Item 2. Risk Factors.
Risks Relating to Our Business :
WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES WHICH MAY CONTINUE, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.
We incurred net losses of $33,760 and $28,540 for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We had a an accumulated deficit of $62,300 at May 31, 2011and $28,540 for the year ended May 31, 2010. We cannot assure you that we can achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in the establishment of a business enterprise. There can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable. Revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon various factors, including whether we will be able to continue expansion of our revenue. We may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us.
OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUTURE FINANCING.
In their report dated January, 2012 our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the period ended May 31, 2010, were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of recurring losses from operations. We continue to experience net operating losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible. Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CONTINUING TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, THEN WE MAY HAVE TO SCALE BACK OR EVEN CEASE OUR ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS.
We have received no revenues from operations and have limited assets. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. Our company has a limited operating history and must be considered in the development stage. Our success is significantly dependent on a successful listing of concerns striving to be environmentally responsible and the converting of their free trial to fee-paying continued listings. Our operations will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. We may be unable to convince sufficient organizations to continue with us and as a result operate on a profitable basis. We are in the development stage and potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by enterprises in the development stage. If our business plan is not successful, and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company.
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH SUFFICIENT SALES AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES OR ENTER INTO AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO SELL, MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR SERVICES, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED.
We have limited experience as a company in the sale, marketing and distribution of our products and services. We depend almost entirely to demonstrate our ability to deliver value through customer trials and show enough internet hits on our listings websites resulting from links on our system. To achieve commercial success, we must develop sales and marketing capabilities and enter into and maintain successful arrangements with potential clients and prove our worth to them.
If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. If our current or future customers do not receive adequate responses, our ability to achieve our expected revenue growth rate will be harmed.
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE SERVICES OF MR. O’SHAUGHNESSY AND/OR MS. HODYNO OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS.
Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Mr. Brian O’Shaughnessy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rachael Hodyno, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Loss of the services of Ms. Hodyno and/or Mr. O’Shaughnessy could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. In order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully recruiting qualified personnel having experience in the internet service business. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find, attract and retain existing employees or that we will be able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms.
We experienced some delay due to the resignation of our former President and CEO and the appointment of Mr. O’Shaughnessy to replace him in November 2010. We are confident that Mr. O’Shaughnessy is now up to speed is firmly in control of the affairs of the corporation.
WE MAY IN THE FUTURE BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH ARE COSTLY TO DEFEND, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AWARDS, AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CERTAIN CONTENT OR USE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FUTURE.
We have not applied for any trademarks, though we intend to do so in the future. There is no guarantee that our applications, when made, will be accepted. Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights, our actions may be inadequate to protect any trademarks and other proprietary rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and other proprietary rights.
Internet, technology, media companies and patent holding companies often possess a significant number of patents. In addition, effective copyright and trademark protection may be unenforceable or limited. Further, many of these companies and other parties are actively developing or purchasing search, indexing, electronic commerce and other Internet-related technologies, as well as a variety of online business models and methods. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including, but not limited to, seeking patent protection. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of technologies and rights associated with online business are likely to continue to arise in the future.
As we expand our business and develop new technologies, products and services, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights such as patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other third party rights such as publicity and privacy rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or be prevented from using the rights, which could require us to change our business practices in the future and limit our ability to compete effectively. We may also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. The occurrence of any of these results could harm our brand and negatively impact our operating results.
IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN ADEQUATE REVENUES FROM INTERNET ADVERTISING, OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED
We plan to rely on revenues generated from listing fees, plus additional income from the sale of advertising and small commissions or referral fees from video production concerns. We are, in fact, totally an advertising vehicle. We must rely entirely on proving our worth initially as an advertising medium by exposing our clients and their products and services free of charge and then relying on our ability to deliver new customers at an affordable rate. It may well be that we will base future fee schedules on the number of exposures or “hits” that a particular listing receives. If we do not succeed in these efforts our business will be materially adversely affected.
Competition for Internet advertising and customers is intense and we expect that competition will continue to intensify. Barriers to entry are minimal, and competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. We will compete for a share of a customer’s advertising budget. Our business model depends, in part, upon our ability to deliver pertinent information about a wide variety of products and services. If we are unable to develop Internet listings that attract a loyal user base possessing demographic characteristics attractive to listing concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, if we fail to persuade new organizations to spend a portion of their budget on listing with us, our revenues could decline and our future operating results could be adversely affected.
COMPETITION FOR INTERNET RELATED PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN GAINING ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR WEBSITE.
Competition for Internet products and services is intense. Barriers to entry are minimal, and competitors can launch new Websites at a relatively low cost. Several companies offer competitive web-based trade communities and we expect that additional companies will offer competing web-based trade communities on a standalone or portfolio basis. Our competitors may develop Internet products or services that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance than, our vertical trade portal. If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE OUR BRAND RECOGNITION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.
To be successful, we must establish and strengthen the brand awareness of the Go Green brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand recognition is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our user and advertiser base. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the Internet market. We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, these efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands in a cost-effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock :
THERE IS PRESENTLY NO MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY FAILURE TO DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN A TRADING MARKET COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR SHARES AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO SELL YOUR SHARES.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock and a public market for our common stock may not develop upon completion of this offering. While we will attempt to have our common stock quoted on the OTCBB we will have to seek market-makers to provide quotations for the common stock and it is possible that no market-maker will want to provide such quotations. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our shares and make it difficult for you to sell your shares or recover any part of your investment in us. Even if a market for our common stock does develop, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating to our future operating performance and the profitability of our operations, factors such as variations in our interim financial results, or various, as yet unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.
Even if our common stock is quoted on the OTCBB under a symbol, that service provides a limited trading market. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our common stock, the ability of holders of our common stock to sell our common stock, or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our common stock.
IF YOU PURCHASE SHARES IN THIS OFFERING, YOU WILL EXPERIENCE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION.
The $0.02 per share offering price of the common stock being sold under this prospectus has been arbitrarily set. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings or net worth and it is not an indication of actual value. Accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution. You may also suffer additional dilution in the future from the sale of additional shares of common stock or other securities.
SHOULD OUR STOCK BECOME LISTED ON THE OTCBB OR IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT ON OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTCBB WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.
Companies trading on the OTCBB, as we seek to become, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) and must be current in their reports under Section 13 in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTCBB service. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the listings and down-graded. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. In addition, we may be unable to get re-listed on the OTCBB, which may have an adverse material effect on our Company.
OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE “PENNY STOCK” RULES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (the “SEC”) AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, MAKING TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK.
The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
·
that a broker or dealer approves a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks; and
·
that the broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.
In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:
·
obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and
·
make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
The broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth:
·
the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and
·
that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant.
EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH RECENTLY ENACTED CHANGES IN SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT RESOURCES, AND WE STILL MAY FAIL TO COMPLY.
As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company’s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, the public accounting firm auditing the company’s financial statements must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THE SECURITIES.
Until registered for resale, investors must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of time. Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”), which provides for an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act under certain conditions, requires, among other conditions, a one-year holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts) of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the registration requirements under the Securities Act. However, our securities currently are not eligible for the Rule 144 exemption. There can be no assurance that we will fulfill any reporting requirements in the future under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or disseminate to the public any current financial or other information concerning us, as is required by Rule 144 as part of the conditions of our availability.
WE MAY HAVE RESCISSION LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MARCH 6, 2011 THROUGH JUNE 1, 2011 INADVERTENT PUBLICATION OF AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE FORM S-1.
Although removed, from March 6, 2011 through June 1, 2011, our website inadvertently included language from our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on December 8, 2010, which was still pending review. It may be determined that such disclosure may have constituted a general solicitation under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result, we may be subject to contingent rescission liabilities from those investors who purchased shares in reliance on the Form S-1 filed on December 8, 2010. While we do not believe that any investor relied on such disclosure, we may have an obligation to make a rescission offer to those who invested in reliance on the Form S-1 filed on December 8, 2010. We may also be subject to regulatory liability for improperly allowing the publication of language from our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on December 8, 2010 on our website from March 6, 2011 through June 1, 2011. Although we believe the chances are remote, if rescission is required, we may continue to be liable for the original purchase price, plus interest, for a period of one year under Section 13 of the Securities Act of 1933.
