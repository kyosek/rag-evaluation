ITEM 2.
Properties.
The Company’s executive offices are located at 4500 College Boulevard, Suite 240, Leawood, Kansas 66211, where we rent approximately 5,000 sq. ft. of shared, supported office space at a cost of $850 per month on a short term basis. The Great South Land Minerals Limited office premises at level 3/65 Murray Street have been refurbished to accommodate a specialized data room for seismic and other technical information relating to exploration activities.
The Company does not directly own any real estate, but our wholly-owned subsidiary, Great South Land Minerals Limited, has rights under a leasehold granted by the Tasmanian government which is described in detail below.
Oil and natural gas properties
We conduct our oil and gas activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Great South Land Minerals Limited. Great South Land Minerals Limited has rights to an onshore petroleum license, Special Exploration License 13/98, in Tasmania, Australia, that the Great South Land Minerals Limited Board believes has prospects for economic exploitation of oil, hydrocarbon gases and helium. The Tasmanian Department of Industry, Energy and Resources granted Special Exploration License 13/98 to Great South Land Minerals Limited for an initial period of five years expiring on May 18, 2004, with the subsequent extension of the license for another five years to September 2009.
Special Exploration License 13/98 initially comprised 30,356 square kilometers and covered the whole Tasmania Basin or about half the State. When renewed on October 28, 2004, Special Exploration License 13/98 was decreased in size and now covers a reduced area of 15,035 square kilometers. The terms of the lease renewal require an exploration expenditure of AUD $21.5 million (USD $14.85 million) over five years.
Below is a map of Tasmania illustrating the area covered by Special Exploration License 13/98. The cross-hatched area highlighted in the center of the map is the area within Tasmania in which Special Exploration License 13/98 permits Great South Land Minerals Limited to conduct exploratory work to uncover potential petroleum reservoirs suitable for developing.

As a condition to the granting of the lease, the Department of Industry, Energy and Resources of Tasmania required Great South Land Minerals Limited to satisfy a specific schedule of expenditures and indicated that failure in any given year, as at October 1 each year, to perform at least 80% of the required expenditures for that year, would be grounds for terminating the leasehold. The schedule is set out below:
Table 3
Claimed Special Exploration License 13/98 Expenditure to meet the License conditions for the period
2004 (year 5) to 2009 (year 10) including expenditure from 1998 to 2003 brought forward*
*
Table 3 above represents the claimed AUD $36.8 million expenditure by Great South Land Minerals Limited which the directors believe meets the license conditions of Special Exploration License 13/98. The expenditure claimed and reported to Mineral Resources Tasmania is based on the contract’s September to October reporting year, conflicting with the December year end reporting period of Empire Energy Corporation International. In addition, the exploration and development expenditures disclosed in the Consolidated Financials and Notes thereto of Empire Energy Corporation International for the year ended 31, December 2008 were prepared using USA Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which is different to the definition of exploration expenditure of Special Exploration License 13/98. In December 2007, we sold drilling equipment and used the proceeds to eliminate a note payable and the resulting security interest on Great South Land Minerals. The purchase of this equipment in the amount of AUD $1,407,549 has been included in the claimed expenditures and will offset future expenditures to be claimed under this license.
In 2006 and again in 2007, the company received letters from the Minister of Infrastructure, Energy & Resources giving Great South Land Minerals Limited an opportunity to show cause why the Special Exploration License should not be revoked. Great South Land Minerals Limited has made submissions supporting its case to the Minister on both occasions and has no reason to believe that Special Exploration License 13/98 should be revoked. Should the Minister attempt to revoke the license, which is effectively a contract between the company and the Government, this action would be vigorously defended and damages caused as consequence of commercial destabilisation would be sought.
The Terrex Seismic trucks have completed 271 line kilometers of seismic onshore Tasmania from March 2007. In addition, a Competent Persons Report has been written to comply with our intended fund raising efforts, along with a geophysical assessment and compilation of the target structures. Together with our ongoing regional gravity survey, we believe this clearly demonstrates to the Government, our shareholders and the Tasmanian public, our commitment to fulfill all conditions precedent for a commercial discovery into production.
Great South Land Minerals Limited and its predecessor companies have spent substantial amounts on exploration activities. These activities have so far established the presence of two petroleum systems, the Larapintine Petroleum System and the Gondwana Petroleum System. In identifying these petroleum systems, Great South Land Minerals Limited has proved the presence of quality source world class source rocks, including the Tasmanite Oil Shale which is the richest oil and gas source rock and is used as the world standard for type 1 kerogen, that are thermally mature for the generation of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. This determination shows that hydrocarbons have been generated, expelled and migrated into potential reservoir units. Although recent seismic data has shown the potential for trapping mechanisms, the Company is undertaking additional gravity and seismic work to identify potential drill targets. Great South Land Minerals Limited continues its exploration activities with exploration drilling & stratigraphic coring activities being planned in strategic locations.
History of Great South Land Minerals Limited license area Special Exploration License13/98
Special Exploration License 13/1998 (Special Exploration License 13/98) was granted to Great South Land Minerals Limited on May 18, 1999. The license covered an area of 30,356 square kilometers and replaced three licenses held by Great South Land Minerals Limited. These licenses EL 1/88, EL 9/95 and EL 21/95 were originally held by Great South Land Minerals Limited’s predecessor companies.
Modern exploration in the Tasmanian Basin commenced when the Broken Hill Proprietary Company was awarded an exploration license on April 15, 1981, to explore for coal. Mobil Energy Australia subsequently farmed in and worked the license until April 15, 1984 at which time the license was relinquished.
In June 1984, the recent phase of oil and gas exploration commenced when Conga Oil Pty Ltd, the earliest predecessor of Great South Land Minerals Limited, acquired part of the D’Entrecasteaux Region of Southern Tasmania in order to verify old hydrocarbon seeps and drilling reports. Conga Oil continued to acquire exploration rights to a large part of Southern Tasmania. In 1988, Conga Oil’s initial license area covering 50 square kilometers was incorporated into a new permit which covered an area of 3500 square kilometers. Conga Oil continued to explore this area until 1995 when it formed Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd., a privately held Australian company, and assigned the permit to Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. After receiving two other licenses, Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd now held a total area of 13,200 square kilometers (32.6 million acres). All licenses expired in 2001. In March 1998 Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd changed from a private to a public company, Great South Land Minerals Limited, by way of a special resolution approved by shareholders. A new, enlarged exploration license, Special Exploration License 13/98 was formed from the three prior exploration licenses and Great South Land Minerals Limited continued to explore these areas until the permit officially expired on May 18, 2004. A description of the renewed leasehold, including disclosure relating to required expenditures to maintain rights under the Special Exploration License, is set out above.
Exploration in Special Exploration License 13/98
In its exploration for coal under the coal exploration lease, Mobil Energy Australia commenced drilling operations, preceded by a ground based magnetics survey, on October 2, 1983 resulting in five cored holes totaling 987.75 meters, 814.19 meters of which was cored. The drilling targeted two horizons in the Permian sequence:
•
Cygnet Coal Measures equivalents
•
Faulkner Group containing the Mersey Coal Measures equivalents
Sedimentological studies were also undertaken to enable, in conjunction with the additional stratigraphic information, an environmental map of the Permian to be drawn and to make recommendations on future drilling.
Conga Oil began work in 1984 and during the period to 1987 focused most of its work on undertaking reviews of the basin. During 1987, after a reported seepage was relocated and analyzed, the Company began a systematic exploration program in the region. Recognizing the need to map sub-dolerite structure, Conga Oil first attempted to extend the gravity and magnetics databases in the Tasmanian Basin. Although this helped in defining regional trends and lineations, the lack of subsurface control and the limitations of the methods themselves the usefulness of these techniques for the purpose of identifying potential hydrocarbon traps.
The work completed by Conga Oil established that:
•
oil had definitely been generated and that active seeps were observed in certain areas;
•
source rock studies of vitrinite reflectance and conodont alteration index confirmed that Ordovician carbonates exposed around the region were within the oil window;
•
Permian and younger rocks blanket most of the region and obscure distribution;
•
basin development began in the late Precambrian, was most active in the Cambrian, but continued up to Middle Devonian times.
After 1988, exploration continued in the newly incorporated and expanded area of Conga Oil’s license. Despite earlier discouraging seismic acquisition data results, due dominantly to the widespread coverage of dolerites onshore Tasmania, Conga Oil attempted to acquire additional seismic data both on the main island and North Bruny Island in the vicinity of Johnson’s seep and acquired additional data offshore in Storm Bay utilizing AGSO’s Rig seismic vessel. The seismic acquired was disappointing with data quality of the records very poor to the point that none of the sections were adequate for the purposes of identifying and mapping petroleum traps.
In 1992, Condor Oil took over responsibility for exploration and during this period up to and including 1994, produced several consultants’ reports. During 1994 the stratigraphic wells, Shittim #1 (1751m) and Gilgal #1 (50m), were drilled on Bruny Island.
During 1995, when Conga Oil incorporated Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd., Congo Oil gave Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. the role of exploration project manager and Condor Oil became an equity holder in Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. initiated collaborative studies with a number of individual consultants and agencies which added a considerable amount of data and improved the Company’s understanding of the basin. The Department of Mineral Resources undertook rock evaluation studies, honors students at the University of Tasmania provided basin studies, Shell Development Australia reprocessed some earlier seismic data, BHP provided analyses in oil geochemistry, the state Mines Department acquired gravity and seismic data, CSIRO provided analyses of seep studies and geochemistry and Eugene Domack completed studies on the maturation and depositional environment of the Tasmanite oil shale.
At the request of the Mines Department, Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. employed an independent consultant, Mr. Mulready, to assess the significance of the gas encountered at Shittim #l. Mr. Mulready concluded the hole had established that a seal, reservoir and gas were present and that the results encouraged further investigation of the depocentre located in central Tasmania. On the basis of this report, Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. then focused its exploration activities in this area of the basin. Concurrent with this work, Trent J. Woods, University of Tasmania, investigated the timing of potential hydrocarbon generation from Paleozoic sediments and the characterization of potential reservoirs of the Lower Parmeener Supergroup.
During late 1995, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation undertook a land-based seismic survey over parts of the basin. During 1996, a third stratigraphic well, Jericho #1 was pre-collared and drilled to a depth of 640m on Bruny Island.
The stratigraphic holes were located for the following reasons:
•
Onshore and offshore seismic existed in the area and needed velocity control, which was only obtainable by a downhole shot so that previous processing could be repeated with actual real velocities.
•
Historic records indicated that the area had numerous seeps of both oil and gas and that at least five shallow wildcat holes had been drilled but were depth limited because of previous technology.
•
Results of gravity and magnetics surveys indicated that North Bruny Island is located on a basement high with a good potential regional trap for oil and gas.
•
Modern geochemical oil exploration methods indicated that there were crude oil seeps in creeks and around old drill sites that warranted investigation.
•
A recent Mines Department hole on the neck of Bruny Island had discovered oil in loose sand at 30m depth.
All three holes recorded petroleum hydrocarbons in a gaseous state.
•
Shittim#l recorded tar with zeolites in the fractured dolerite and gas from 810 meters depth. The hole was drilled onto 1751 meters, reaching the unconformity.
•
Gilgal#l recorded gas at its total depth of 51 meters.
•
Jericho#l recorded gas from 15 meters to the bottom of the hole at 228 meters.
During 1996 Great South Land Minerals Pty Ltd. contracted Robert S. Young, previously Chief Petroleum Exploration Geologist for Getty Oil, to review the potential of oil and gas in the Tasmanian onshore Basin. The primary focus of Young’s review involved analyzing the work undertaken up to that date from a petroleum systems perspective. In this sense, he set about identifying whether the basic building blocks for the potential commercial production of hydrocarbons existed within the Tasmanian Basin.
Young concluded that:
•
With some 270 seeps and shows, which have been studied geochemically and have identified at least four mature oils, that it was very probable there are several possible hydrocarbon sources in the Tasmanian Basin. Geochemical comparisons of seeps show that the most likely source would be the Ordovician of the Gordon Group Limestones. Ratios of C27:C28:C29 Steranes are identical between seeps of the Bruny Island Johnson well and the Ordovician Gordon Limestone and the predominance of C27 Steranes and the abundant diasteranes in Tasmanian bitumens suggest a widespread algae- and clay- rich source rock.
•
Conodonts’ color indicates that much of the Gordon Limestone, particularly in central and southern Tasmania, is in the oil and gas windows. This limestone is expected to underlay Permian and Triassic sediments in much of the Tasmanian Basin. He also included the Permian Quamby Mudstone, “Freshwater Sequence” and Preolenna coal Measures as other potential source rocks. In all three rock units of which the total organic carbon may reach 25%, vitrinite reflectance data and fossil pollen colors show that these source rocks are within the oil window over large areas of the basin.
•
Reservoirs are very easily envisioned in the shallow marine Ordovician Limestones as palaeokarsts, reefal or fractural. Since limestones are considered source material, migration would be minimal. Additional potential reservoirs are within the Siluro-Devonian sandstones of the Eldon and Tiger Range Groups and within sandstones of the Permian Bundella Formation, Faulkner Group and Liffey Sandstone of the Lower Parmeener Super Group. Measured porosities in the Faulkner and Liffey are 13% and 12% respectively, while other Permian sandstones in the northern area of the license have porosities averaging 16% and horizontal permeabilities ranging up to 386 millidarcies.
•
Evaporites are most efficient seals mainly because they offer very little or no pore space; however, the long-term sealing properties of very fine grained, water wet porous rocks such as shales are also remarkably efficient in the absence of open fractures. This is due to the displacement pressure barrier effect created by capillary pressure between oil and water in rock pores. It is anticipated that the Ordovician Limestones reservoirs would be sealed by additional limestone within the Gordon Group or by the Turo Tillite above the unconformity. Good seals of shale and silts are found throughout the Permian-Triassic sedimentary sequence. The Jurassic dolerite sills also make excellent cap rock for the Permian-Triassic reservoirs.
•
Defining traps and structural features within the basin is very difficult to impossible without good reflection seismic records. To date, there has been very little reflection seismic data and most of the data is poor quality due to the extensive dolerite cover over a large part of the basinal sediments. Relatively good quality seismic data has been obtained in areas where the dolerite cover is thin or absent. The results of the seismic work on the TASGO project show that an improvement in data quality and penetration of recordings through the dolerite can be achieved and this will aid in better defining structural traps. The present gravity and magnetics, which have been extensively used to date, have been able to define regional structural elements of mostly Paleozoic Structures in the Permian, or younger, are probably going to be faulted, and of low relief.
•
Except in unusual circumstances, most untrapped oil in sedimentary basins originates from synclinal drainage areas that surround the trap itself. Thus, migration distances commonly range in tens rather than hundreds of miles, particularly on strongly structured or faulted basins.
During 1997, several reports on various aspects of the petroleum potential of the basin were produced. Four stratigraphic wells were planned and drilled. Lonnavale #1 was pre-collared and drilled to 557m; Hunterston #1 was pre-collared and drilled to 336m; Bridgewater #1 was pre-collared and drilled to 252m and Pelham was pre-collared and drilled to 503m.
During 2001, Great South Land Minerals Limited completed 660 line kilometers of regional seismic survey over part of the area of Special Exploration License 13/98. At the conclusion of the seismic program, Great South Land Minerals Limited submitted an environmental report to the Department of Primary Industry, Water and the Environment’s Threatened Species Unit. The preliminary results of the interpretation identified several potential anticlinal/domal traps. Two small anticlinal structures were identified in the Parmeener Supergroup beneath the Longford basin and one in the Tertiary infill of the Longford Basin. Six potential traps were recognized in the Central Highlands area where gently dipping anticlines in the Parmeener almost directly overlie and reflect more steeply dipping anticlines beneath the Devonian unconformity. These Devonian structures are probably mainly within the Wurawina Supergroup and contained within the Devonian fold-thrust belt. Based on these seismic results Great South Land Minerals Limited planned a 1075 line kilometer program designed to acquire further regional data, to define structures identified during the prior survey and to place lines close to wells that were drilled and pre-collared in 1997. This survey started in April 2006 and 152 line kilometers were acquired within the Central Highlands of Tasmania.
On May 10, 2002, Great South Land Minerals Limited entered into a joint venture agreement with OME Resources Australia Pty Ltd under which OME earned a joint venture interest in Special Exploration License 13/98 by conducting drilling and related work. Stage 1 of the work related to the expenditure of $1,000,000 to complete the deepening drilling/coring of Hunterston#1 well and other activities for a 5% interest in the license. A dispute between Great South Land Minerals Limited and OME arose as to valuation of work done by September 30, 2002, the result of which was the assignment to OME of all coal bed methane rights in the Special Exploration License 13/98 tenement in full satisfaction against any potential claims.
During 2002 and 2003 Great South Land Minerals Limited continued to work on the 2D seismic data acquired during 2001 and completed a report on an analysis of the Longford Sub-basin. Great South Land Minerals Limited also obtained approval to reenter and deepen (1700m) the stratigraphic well, Hunterston#1. The well was eventually terminated at a depth of 1324m, which was carried out as part of the OME joint venture. Hydrocarbon gas was noted at various depths while coring and analyses of gas samples confirmed the presence of Helium gas (>1.0%) from the formations below the Tasmania Basin.
