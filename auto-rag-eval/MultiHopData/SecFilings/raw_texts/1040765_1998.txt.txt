The average lease term of a tenant's lease is approximately 12 years. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant's share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for a building over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a submetered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. None of the tenants in the office segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenue. Below is a listing of the New York City Office Properties tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the New York City Office Properties revenues in 1998:

Retail
The Company owns 59 shopping center properties of which 56 are strip shopping centers primarily located in the Northeast and Midatlantic states, two are regional centers located in San Juan, Puerto Rico and one, the Green Acres Mall, is a super-regional center located in Nassau County, Long Island, New York. The Company's shopping centers are generally located on major regional highways in mature densely populated areas. The Company believes its shopping centers attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood marketplace because of their location on regional highways.
As of March 1, 1999, the occupancy rate of the retail properties was 93%. The following table sets forth the occupancy rate and the average annual base rent per square foot (excluding the Green Acres Mall) for the properties at the end of each of the past five years.
Average Annual Rentable Base Rent Year End Square Feet Occupancy Rate Per Square Foot -------- ----------- -------------- ---------------
1998 10,625,000 92% $ 10.53 1997 10,550,000 91% 9.78 1996 10,019,000 90% 9.09 1995 9,913,000 91% 8.68 1994 9,501,000 94% 8.05
The average annual base rent per square foot at December 31, 1998 for the Green Acres Mall was $12.92 in total and $32.24 for mall tenants only.
The Company's shopping center lease terms range from five years or less in some instances, for smaller tenant spaces to as long as thirty years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenant's sales and pass through to tenants the tenant's share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant's direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 2% of total shopping center revenues in 1998. None of the tenants in the Retail Segment accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenues.
Below is a listing of the Retail tenants which accounted for 2% or more of the Retail property rentals in 1998:

-------------------- (1) Excludes the 14th Street and Union Square Property currently leased to Bradlees- see below.
In June 1995, Bradlees filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Bradlees emerged from bankruptcy in January 1999 when its plan of reorganization was confirmed. The Company withdrew its objection to Bradlees' proposed plan of reorganization after obtaining Bradlees' agreement that its lease of the Company's 14th Street and Union Square property would terminate in March 2000. The lease was scheduled to expire in October 2019, and contained an option to renew for an additional ten years. In addition, the rent under the lease was increased by $1,100,000 per annum to $3,400,000 per annum from January 1999 to the March 2000 termination date. In connection with the foregoing, the Company paid $11,000,000 to Bradlees. The Company is considering various alternatives for the redevelopment of this site. The Company currently leases 15 other locations to Bradlees. Of these locations, the leases for 14 are fully guaranteed by Stop & Shop Companies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Ahold NV, a leading international food retailer, and one is guaranteed as to 70% of the rent.
The following table sets forth as of December 31, 1998 lease expirations for each of the next 10 years assuming that none of the tenants exercise their renewal options.
The Company's strip shopping centers are substantially leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvements stores, discount apparel stores, membership warehouse clubs and "category killers." Category killers are large stores which offer a complete selection of a category of items (e.g., toys, office supplies, etc.) at low prices, often in a warehouse format. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price.
The Company's two regional shopping centers located in Montehiedra and Caguas, Puerto Rico, (both of which are in the San Juan area) contain 1,014,000 square feet of which the Company owns 727,000 square feet. The centers are anchored by four major stores: Sears, Roebuck and Co., Kmart (one in each of the centers) and a Builders Square Home Improvement store.
The Green Acres Mall is a 1.6 million square foot super-regional enclosed shopping mall complex situated in Nassau County, Long Island, New York, approximately one mile east of the borough of Queens, New York. The Green Acres Mall is anchored by four major department stores: Sears, Roebuck and Co., J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Federated Department Stores, Inc. doing business as Stern's and as Macy's. The complex also includes The Plaza at Green Acres, a 188,000 square foot strip shopping center which is anchored by Kmart and Waldbaums.
Retail Properties The following table sets forth certain information for the Retail Properties as of December 31, 1998.
Cold Storage
The Company has a 60% interest in the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships that currently own 88 refrigerated warehouses with an aggregate of approximately 450 million cubic feet (excludes 13 additional warehouses containing approximately 80 million cubic feet managed by the Cold Storage Companies doing business as AmeriCold Logistics). The Cold Storage segment is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
On March 12, 1999, the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships sold all of the non-real estate assets of AmeriCold Logistics encompassing the operations of the cold storage business for approximately $48,000,000 to a new partnership owned 60% by Vornado Operating Company and 40% by Crescent Operating Inc. The new partnership leases the underlying cold storage warehouses used in this business from the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships which continue to own the real estate. The leases have a 15 year term with two-five year renewal options and provide for the payment of fixed base rent and percentage rent based on customer revenues. The new partnership is required to pay for all costs arising from the operation, maintenance and repair of the properties as well as property capital expenditures in excess of $5,000,000 annually. Fixed base rent and percentage rent for the initial lease year is projected to be approximately $151 million. The new partnership has the right to defer a portion of the rent for up to three years beginning on March 12, 1999 to the extent that available cash, as defined in the lease, is insufficient to pay such rent.
AmeriCold Logistics provides the frozen food industry with refrigerated warehousing and transportation management services. Refrigerated warehouses are comprised of production and distribution facilities. Production facilities typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors, located nearby. These customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in the facility until they are shipped to the next stage of production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide variety of customers' finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each distribution facility primarily services the surrounding regional market. AmeriCold Logistics' transportation management services include freight routing, dispatching, freight rate negotiation, backhaul coordination, freight bill auditing, network flow management, order consolidation and distribution channel assessment. AmeriCold Logistics' temperature-controlled logistics expertise and access to both frozen food warehouses and distribution channels enable its customers to respond quickly and efficiently to time-sensitive orders from distributors and retailers.
AmeriCold Logistics' customers consist primarily of national, regional and local frozen food manufacturers, distributors, retailers and food service organizations which include Con-Agra, Inc., Tyson Foods, H.J. Heinz & Co., McCain Foods, Pillsbury, Sara Lee, Phillip Morris, J.R. Simplot, Farmland Industries and Unilever.

Alexander's estimates that its capital expenditures for redevelopment projects at the above properties will include: (i) approximately $100,000,000 for the redevelopment of its Paramus property, (ii) approximately $30,000,000 to renovate the mall and $15,000,000 to renovate the Macy's store at its Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center and (iii) more than $300,000,000 to develop its Lexington Avenue site. While Alexander's anticipates that financing will be available after tenants have been obtained for these redevelopment projects, there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained, or if obtained, that such financings will be on terms that are acceptable to the Company. In addition, it is uncertain as to when these projects will commence.
