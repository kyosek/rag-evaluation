Item 2. Properties.
The following is a description of the Company's mineral properties.
Uranium Properties Acquisition
On February 27, 2009, the Company closed its transaction for the acquisition of a 100% interest in TUSA and under the closing terms, the Company issued to Tournigan Energy an interest-free promissory note, due August 31, 2009, for $325,327, which was the amount paid by Tournigan Energy for the then current year’s Federal mineral claim maintenance fees along with working capital adjustments on the closing date. In addition to this, the Company agreed to secure the release of, or reimburse Tournigan Energy for, the existing reclamation bonds on the properties in the amount of $930,000 less any applicable reclamation costs.
On August 21, 2009, Tournigan Energy extended the due date of the promissory note to December 15, 2009. Tournigan Energy also extended the repayment date of the first $530,000 of the reclamation bonds to December 15, 2009 and the repayment of the remaining $400,000, less the cost of the reclamation work, to September 30, 2010.
On December 14, 2009, Tournigan Energy agreed to reduce the promissory note to $100,000 with payment of this amount on December 15, 2009. This payment was made by Fischer-Watt and the promissory note was extinguished. In addition, the Company paid $100,000 as partial payment of the $530,000 installment of the reclamation bond due on that date with the balance of $430,000 to be paid from one half of subsequent equity share issues of Fischer-Watt until paid in full.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Following the completion of the required reclamation work on the properties over the course of 2010, Fischer-Watt made a further repayment to Tournigan Energy of $130,000 on December 22, 2010. Subsequently, on December 24, 2010, Fischer-Watt entered in to an amended agreement with Tournigan Energy whereby Tournigan Energy acknowledged that the remaining amount to be repaid to it by Fischer-Watt would be $600,000 and that this amount will be paid by Fischer-Watt from 50% of the proceeds of future equity financings until the balance is retired.
On July 13, 2011, the Company renegotiated its debt and property interests with Tournigan Energy concerning its uranium properties in the western United States. Tournigan Energy agreed to defer receipt of its debt and property interests by converting these Company liabilities to a two percent (2%) net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty interest on uranium properties within the Company’s current areas of work.
Under the terms of its existing agreement with Tournigan Energy, the Company had the following obligations:
a) $600,000 remained owing to Tournigan Energy, payable from fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds of future equity financings;
b) Tournigan Energy retained a 30% carried interest on the Company’s uranium properties in Wyoming, South Dakota and Arizona through to feasibility on any project on these properties;
c) After completion of feasibility on a project, Tournigan Energy could elect to convert its interest to a 30% contributory working interest in the project, or its interest would be diluted to a five percent (5%) net profits interest.
Under the renegotiated terms, Tournigan Energy agreed to:
a) Forgive the $600,000 payable by the Company;
b) Convert its interests in the Company’s properties to a two percent (2%) NSR royalty up to a maximum of $10,000,000;
At the time, Peter Bojtos was President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Fischer-Watt and declared his interest in this transaction since he is also a director of Tournigan Energy. He has abstained from voting on all matters in connection with this transaction.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Mineral Claims and Leases
The mineral holdings in TUSA are comprised of 907 federal lode claims covering 18,100 acres in Wyoming, South Dakota and Arizona, along with 3 State leases covering 879 acres in Wyoming. All the claims and leases are 100% controlled in TUSA and there are no further underlying agreements, payments or royalties other than statutory Federal, State and County fees and production royalties. Annual fees and minimum work requirements to hold these properties currently amount to approximately $127,000 if the Company chooses to hold all the current properties. The claims were staked by Sweetwater River Resources and Cowboy Explorations of Wyoming who were contracted by TUSA to perform geological services. All the claims and leases are registered in TUSA’s name
Wyoming
The Wyoming properties consist of 825 federal claims covering 16,500 acres and 3 State leases covering 879 acres distributed in five areas of prospective uranium bearing geology. Some of the properties are close to former producing uranium mines or in-situ recovery (“ISR”) operations. These areas are Cyclone Rim in Sweetwater County; South Pass in Sublette and Fremont Counties; Alkali Creek and Whiskey Peak in Fremont County; and Shirley Basin in Carbon County.
Uranium mineralization in Wyoming is chiefly found in “roll-fronts”. The roll-fronts are crescent-shaped deposits formed in saturated, permeable sandstones. Groundwater flows through these host rocks carrying dissolved uranium and other metals such as iron, molybdenum, vanadium and selenium. These metals precipitate when the groundwater flow crosses the interface from oxidized conditions into reducing conditions in the sandstone and thereby deposit in the crescent-shaped forms.
Cyclone Rim.
The largest exploration area in TUSA is in the Cyclone Rim covering 14,200 acres. The claims are located in the northwestern portion of the Great Divide Basin and are located in Township 26 North, Range 96 West and Township 25 North, Range 94 through 96 West. The property extends for 28 miles astride the “CR Trend” roll-front. The area is underlain by rock units of the Wasatch and the Battle Springs Formations, which host uranium mineralization in the eastern Great Divide Basin and at Crooks Gap/Green Mountain located approximately 30 miles west. The general area was explored in the early 1970’s by Union Carbide and Teton Exploration, and in the late 1970’s by Newmont Mining, Rocky Mountain Energy, Western Fuels and Ogle Petroleum. The current claim group was assembled between 2005 and 2008 and it covers an extensive length of potential roll-front mineralization from the UT claims in the west and along the CR trend for a further 25 miles of favorable uranium geology. The east end of these claims is approximately 8 miles west of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater uranium processing mill. That facility is presently on care and maintenance.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
The mineralization occurs as typical Wyoming sandstone hosted roll-front uranium deposits in the Eocene age Battle Springs Formation. The lithology ranges from coarse sands and gravels to yellow and green silty sands and green sandy clay. Thin interbeds of green clay are common. The host unit is underlain by a thick bed of hard, chocolate brown clay shale. The mineralization tends to favor clayey sands.
Alteration, typical of roll-front uranium deposits, consists of reddish oxidized sands in the barren interior, up-dip from the roll-front, to green and grey reduced sands at the outer, down-dip part of the roll-front. Pyrite grains in the barren interior are corroded, while in the roll-front and in the outer portions the grains are fresh. This can be an important clue for locating drill-hole positions relative to the roll-front.
The mineralization in this area ranges in depth from less than 100 feet to over 500 feet below the surface.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
In 2007, TUSA drilled 49 vertical mud rotary holes, each being of 6” diameter, on the UT claims to follow up on reports of uranium mineralization located in the area in historic drilling by Rocky Mountain Energy. Holes were drilled on 400 ft. spacings and uranium mineralization was encountered in 15 of the holes. Additionally, TUSA drilled five core holes in order to twin holes containing the most significant mineralization. From the down-hole radiometric readings it appears that the mineralization is in at least two shallow roll-fronts within about 200 feet below the surface. This could make a deposit in this area amenable to ISR.
The 15 holes that intersected significant uranium mineralization are reported below. The remaining 34 holes in this wide-spaced drill program did not encounter uranium mineralization of significance.
Note: The uranium grades are reported as % eU3O8 as determined by down-hole radiometric logging equipment. A number of the rotary holes that had the most significant intercepts were twinned with core holes, which were then sampled, analyzed and calibrated with the gamma log readings in order to increase the accuracy of the disequilibrium coefficient. This is a mathematical means of equating gamma log readings to actual % U3O8.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
In order to carry out an initial test of the 25 mile long CR trend, TUSA carried out a drill program in late 2007/early 2008 where it drilled 33 mud rotary holes and one core hole along nine widely spaced fences of drill-holes to provide cross-sectional information along the trend. Each fence was about 2.5 miles apart and vertical holes were drilled 200 ft. apart on each fence. These holes were designed to test for uranium mineralization along the 26-mile trace of the roll front. Significant uranium mineralization was found in 5 of the holes on three of the section lines. The mineralization was encountered at depths ranging from 50 feet to 750 feet below the surface with the mineralization plunging towards the east.
From these results it has been determined that uranium mineralization is present along a significant portion of the roll front trace. Furthermore, the mineralized intercepts appear to represent portions of a series of roll fronts stacked one on top of the other.
With this data Fischer-Watt’s independent geological consultant, W T Cohan & Associates, Inc., carried out an evaluation of the potential mineralized material that could be hosted within the Cyclone Rim property.
W T Cohan in their report noted that a significant portion of the extensive roll-front trend in this area of Wyoming extended over about 109 miles in a range of 6 to 26 miles east of Fischer-Watt’s property. To date there are three drilled out uranium deposits and one open pit mine in this portion of the roll-front. These deposits and historic mine production account for 29.8 million pounds of U3O8.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Fischer-Watt does not own nor control any of these deposits.
W T Cohan reported that this section of the roll-front therefore hosted 272,500 pounds of U3O8 per mile of the trend. On this basis Fischer-Watt’s property has the potential to host mineralization in the order of 7.75 million pounds of U3O8. However, W T Cohan points out that a large portion of the roll-front trend remains unexplored and as such “this potential is very likely too conservative”. By determining the yield factor for the length of roll-fronts at the published project sites W T Cohan arrives at an average yield of uranium mineralization at known deposits of 2.32 million pounds of U3O8 per mile over the 12.4 miles of roll-front found in the above listed projects.
W T Cohan states “The successful results of 450 foot spaced grid drilling in the western portion of the Fischer-Watt claims in the UT area and the three drill fences in the CRS area substantiates the probability of the existence of 10 million pounds of potential uranium mineralization. Furthermore, drilling in the eastern portion of the property revealed the presence of unusually thick host sandstones and continuous mineralization, indicating the presence of a major fluvial channel, and there remains 17 miles of untested roll-front on Fischer-Watt’s property. Therefore, there is the potential for the discovery an additional 10 to 30 million pounds of U3O8 in this portion of the property as well”. Therefore, W T Cohan states it “ascribes a mineralization potential of 10 to 40 million pounds of U3O8 to Fischer-Watt’s properties in the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming.”
The Alkali Creek and Whiskey Peak claims, totaling about 1,200 acres, lie about 8 miles north of the UT claims and are adjacent to claims held by Energy Metals Corporation. A reclaimed ISR operation that was operated by Ogle Petroleum is in the immediate vicinity. The Alkali Creek claims encompass historic close-spaced drilling patterns of Teton Energy and Newmont Mining.
Fischer-Watt’s properties currently have no reserves and there is no assurance that the projects will advance from their present exploration stage.
South Pass
The 36 claims and 2 leases covering about 800 acres at South Pass are located along the southeast flank of the Wind River Mountains in the Green River Basin. Exploration was carried out in this area in the late 1960s by Federal American Partners, Getty Oil and Gulf Resources. In general they identified widespread low-grade mineralization over portions of a 26 mile long roll-front. Two mineralized areas, known as the East Sage and the Brett, were identified at that time. These may be evaluated by Fischer-Watt for the possible application of ISR.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Shirley Basin
The Shirley Basin uranium district is located in the northeastern part of Carbon County, between Casper and Medicine Bow. Uranium was historically produced from four mines beginning in 1959. Utah Construction and Homestake operated underground mines and Petronomics developed two open pits. Deposits in the area are hosted in the Wind River Formations of Eocene age.
TUSA holds claims at the southern end of the Middle Shirley Basin Trend in an area of reported uranium mineralization. The MSB block of 21 claims cover an area of approximately 400 acres. No exploration has been carried out by TUSA to date.
South Dakota
In South Dakota, TUSA holds three claim blocks totaling 51 claims over 1,000 acres in an area approximately 8 miles north of the town of Edgemont in the southern Black Hills district. The area covered by these claim blocks were initially held by Union Carbide and the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of a larger block known as the Chord claims. The Chord property encompassed more than 40 small open pits as well as a few underground operations. These operations produced uranium intermittently from the early 1950’s till the late 60’s, supplying ore to a former mill at Edgemont.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
The three TUSA blocks are known as the Long, RC and DH claims and are located generally within the Long Mountain structural zone. This northeast trending fault zone, running through the area of the historic Chord claims, is approximately two miles wide, with uranium mineralization being hosted in four sandstone formations. Two of these are in the Cretaceous age Lakota Formations and two are in the overlying sandstone sequences.
The Long claims consist of 33 claims covering 650 acres that encompass a 3 mile long by 1 mile wide mineralized trend that includes pre-existing claims controlled by Strathmore Minerals. These cover the historic Viking, Virginia C and Ridge Runner deposits. The eastern portion of the Long claims surrounds the historic Long Mountain deposits, some of which are also covered by Strathmore claims. The US Forest Service has prepared a Draft Environment Assessment covering certain lands in the Craven Canyon and Long Mountain area, which proposes a "Mineral Withdrawal" to protect regional cultural and other resources on National Forest lands. This proposed action would "withdraw" some of our TUSA claims from mineral exploration and future development.
Approximately 1 mile east of the Long claims is the 8 claim RC claim block covering 150 acres. This area contains two areas of prospective uranium mineralization as well as the Hot Point mineralized area.
The 10 claim DH claim block covers about 200 acres in an area 1 mile south of the RC claims where in 1971 the US Geological Survey reported “widespread low grade mineralization”. Historic production was won from several small pits and at least two small underground operations where the reported average grade was 0.25% U3O8 and 0.30% vanadium oxide.
Arizona
TUSA holds 31 federal lode claims on approximately 600 acres in Mohave County , northern Arizona, in the area known as the Arizona Strip immediately south of the Utah border. Uranium mineralization in these areas is hosted in “collapse” breccia pipes caused by the collapse of overlying rock strata into solution cavity caverns in the underlying limestones. Uranium mineralization was later deposited in the breccia pipes, at specific favorable horizons, by the action of downward migrating ground waters carrying dissolved uranium. The deposits are relatively small horizontal tabular deposits, but are among the highest grade deposits in the United States.
The breccia pipes are about 300 feet in diameter on average and are recognized as a circular depression on the surface. There are a lot of these structures in northern Arizona and about 1% of them appear to be mineralized. TUSA’s non-contiguous 9 blocks of claims cover about 10 depressions.
TUSA has carried out extensive field work on about 80 of these depression areas in the form of geological mapping along with soil and rock geochemical sampling since geochemical surveys have been shown in the past to be effective in identifying associated uranium mineralization. Based on this work TUSA selected about 20 areas as high priority targets. Several of these targets were followed up with geophysical surveys in order to map out the vertical shape of the breccia pipes. Audio-frequency magnetotelluric surveys, using both natural source and controlled source, as well as limited seismic surveys were carried out on about 10 of the high priority targets. This was followed up with 11 holes being drilled into 4 targeted pipes for a total of 8,421 feet of drilling. Breccias were encountered in several of the holes and down-hole gamma surveys were carried out. The results are being evaluated to determine what follow-up programs should be planned.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
The TUSA properties currently have no reserves and there is no assurance that the projects will advance from their present exploration stage. All of the exploration on the properties to date has been carried out by Cowboy Explorations of Laramie, Wyoming, a qualified and experienced geological contractor with extensive local geological knowledge. Fischer-Watt’s independent consulting geologist on the Cyclone Rim properties is W.T.Cohan & Associates, Inc. of Grand Junction, Colorado. The properties have also been physically examined in the field by Fischer-Watt’s President, Mr. P. Bojtos P.Eng., who is a qualified geologist.

Item 3.
