3. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS - Upon a Change of Control Termination, Company shall provide Executive, in addition to any other rights or benefits to which Executive may be entitled by contract or under any policy or custom of Company, the following:
(a) For a term commencing with such termination and extending for three (3) years thereafter, Company shall pay Executive an annual compensation equal to Executive's highest compensation received in that calendar year included with the period commencing with the calendar year in which this Agreement is executed initially and extending to the calendar year in which termination occurs (annualized as necessary). For purposes of the foregoing, "compensation" shall be (i) salary without reduction for any contribution to (aa) cash or (ii) deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended [or successor provision] and (bb) any nonqualified deferred compensation plan, plus (ii) non-deferred incentive compensation (collectively "Compensation"), and shall be payable in equal installments with such frequency as Company customarily pays its payroll. For purposes of this paragraph (a), Executive's Compensation will be reduced, beginning with the first month following his re-employment with another employer, by fifty percent (50%) of the Form W-2 income, with the new employer. Executive shall have no obligation to mitigate his damages by seeking employment following his termination of employment with Company.
(b) An amount equal to forty percent (40%) of his Compensation, payable in one lump sum at the time of termination, to compensate Executive for all expenses incurred by him in connection with any search for a new job and/or any relocation. Executive shall have no duty to demonstrate his need for, or to account for the use of, the disbursement of same.
(c) Company shall provide, at its expense, for the continuation in full force and effect for a period ending upon the earlier to occur of Executive's death or three (3) years following the Change of Control Termination, all health, dental, life insurance and disability plans, programs and arrangements in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to such termination, provided that his continued participation is possible under the terms and provisions of such plans, programs and arrangements, and under the laws and regulations applicable thereto. If Executive's participation in any plan, program or arrangement is barred, Company shall use its best efforts to obtain and pay for, on Executive's behalf, individual insurance policies, plans, programs or arrangements which provide benefits equivalent to those which Executive is entitled to receive prior to the date of termination. However, Company may, at any time, deny Executive coverage under a health, dental, life insurance or disability plan, program or arrangement, to the extent such coverage is duplicate of coverage provided Executive by any subsequent employer. At the end of the period of coverage, to the extent permitted by the plans and programs, Executive shall have the option to have assigned to him, any assignable insurance policy owned by Company and relating specifically to him, including, without limitation, CNA-Continental Assurance Company policy #3348167, #3363137 and #3393056 if then in force and owned by Company. Executive's right to continuation of health and medical coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, shall commence at the end of the three (3) year period following the Change of Control Termination.
(d) Company shall provide, at its expense, for the continuation in full force and effect for a period ending upon the earlier to occur of Executive's death, retirement, or three (3) years following the Change of Control Termination, all pension, profit-sharing, savings, and nonqualified deferred compensation plan including the supplemental retirement income plan in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to such termination, provided that his continued participation is possible under the terms and provisions of such plans, programs and arrangements, and under the laws and regulations applicable thereto. If Executive's participation in any plan, program or arrangement is barred, Executive shall be entitled to receive, upon a Change of Control Termination, a lump sum payable annually equal to the annual contribution, payments, credits or allocations Company would have provided him, to his account or on his behalf under such plan, program or arrangement had his participation and eligibility continued for the three (3) year period following termination.
(e) Executive may exercise stock options issued to him pursuant to (i) the Drovers Bancshares Incentive Stock Option Plan as adopted by the Board of Directors on August 28, 1985 and as herein modified ("Stock Option Plan"), and (ii) Drovers Bancshares Corporation 1995 Stock Option Plan ("1995 Plan"). Such stock options shall be exercisable fully, and closing shall occur, within ninety (90) days of the Change of Control Termination whether or not:
(i) A period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of exercise, as required by Section 5, paragraph (c) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar provision under the 1995 Plan.
(ii) Any installment exercise terms as stipulated by the Stock Option Plan's administrative committee ("Committee") and any agreement issued under Section 5, paragraph (c) of the plan has been satisfied, or any similar stipulation under the 1995 Plan.
(iii) The Committee has extended the option period upon Executive's termination pursuant to Section 5, paragraph (f) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar Provision in the 1995 Plan. However, in no event shall Executive Exercise any stock option after the earlier of (i) ten (10) years from the date of grant, or (ii) the expiration of the option period as stipulated in an agreement issued under Section 5, paragraph (c) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar provision in the 1995 Plan, as applicable to said option(s).
The Committee shall authorize this acceleration of Executive's stock options under the Stock Option Plan by executing on the date of this Agreement the Stock Option Acceleration Authorization attached hereto as Exhibit A. A similar acceleration occurs under Section 8 of the 1995 Plan.
4. RIGHT TO HEARING. In the event Company believes that a Good Cause for termination of Executive's employment may exist, Company shall provide Executive with written notice of its intention to terminate for Good Cause and the facts upon which Company bases such belief, which notice shall be given at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed effective date for the termination. For such termination to be effective, Executive shall be provided with an opportunity within the said sixty (60) day period to be heard by the Board of Directors of Company. Thereafter, the Board may at its discretion elect to terminate Executive's employment by majority vote.
5. CONTINUANCE OF BENEFITS. If Executive has commenced receiving benefits hereunder, such benefits shall continue (subject however, to the specific terms and conditions applicable to each benefit as set forth herein), for the full term as provided in Section 3, above, notwithstanding that Executive subsequently dies, becomes permanently disabled, or retires at or after age sixty-five (65). Executive may, at any time and by written notice to Company in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, name one or more beneficiaries of any such benefits in the event of his death; provided, however, that upon Executive's death, the distribution of Executive's benefits under a qualified pension plan shall be made in accordance with the terms, including any beneficiary designation provision, of such plan. A designation of beneficiary under this Agreement shall be effective on the date actually received by Company. If Executive fails to designate a beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Executive, the benefits provided herein shall be paid:
(a) to his surviving spouse;
(b) if there is no surviving spouse, to his living descendants per stirpes; or
(c) if there is neither a surviving spouse nor descendants, to his duly appointed and qualified executor or personal representative.
6. NO LIMITATION UPON PAYMENTS - The parties believe that the benefits payable under Section 3, above, represent reasonable compensation for personal services and as such no portion thereof constitutes an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or successor provision). The parties acknowledge that, should any portion be so characterized, substantial adverse tax consequences would result to both the payor (no tax deduction) and to the payee (excise tax). Nonetheless, the parties intend that the amounts be paid in full as provided herein, notwithstanding any such characterization and tax consequence.
7. WITHHOLDING - Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.
8. SOURCE OF PAYMENT - All payments provided under this Agreement may be paid in cash from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be required to be established. Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatever in or to any investment which Company may make to fund its obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between Company and Executive or any other person.
9. RABBI TRUST - The Company is establishing contemporaneously herewith that rabbi trust attached hereto as Exhibit "C" ("Trust"), to which it is contributing an initial corpus of $100. In the event of a change of control as defined herein, the Company shall, in accordance with the terms of the Trust, contribute thereto the amount described in Section 1(e) thereof. Thereafter, amounts payable hereunder shall be paid first from the assets of such Trust and the income thereon. To the extent that the assets of the Trust and the income thereon are insufficient, Company shall pay Executive the amount due hereunder.
10. NONASSIGNABILITY - Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall, without Company's prior written consent, be subject to any sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind.
11. ATTACHMENT - Except as required by law, the right to receive payments under this Agreement shall not be subject to anticipation, sale, encumbrance, charge, levy, or similar process or assignment by operation of law.
12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS - This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any corporate or other successor of the Company which shall acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, acquisition, consolidation, purchase, or otherwise, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and shall otherwise inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing in the Agreement shall preclude Company from consolidating or merging into or with or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to another person, provided such other person shall assume this Agreement and all obligations of Company hereunder. Upon such a consolidation, merger, or transfer of assets and assumption, the term "Company" as used herein, shall mean such other person and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
13. WAIVERS NOT TO BE CONTINUED - Any waiver by a party or any breach of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or as a consent to any subsequent breach by the other party.
14.

15. ARBITRATION - Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration. Any such arbitration shall take place in York, Pennsylvania, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the written award rendered by a majority of the arbitrators may be entered in the Court having jurisdiction thereof. The written decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be valid, binding, final, and nonappealable.
16. MISCELLANEOUS -
(a) In the event that a party hereto wrongfully fails to perform its obligations hereunder as determined and evidenced by a final and nonappealable determination of a board of arbitration or court, as the case may be, such party shall thereupon be obligated to promptly pay and reimburse the other party hereto for its costs and expenses incurred (including attorney, accounting, actuary and other professional consultants) in enforcing its or his entitlements hereunder.

Exhibit 10(b)
AMENDED AND RESTATED THE DROVERS & MECHANICS BANK SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN FOR A. RICHARD PUGH
In consideration of your services with The Drovers & Mechanics Bank ("Employer"), Employer adopted The Drovers & Mechanics Bank Supplemental Pension Plan for A. Richard Pugh dated September 28,1994 ("Prior Plan") for the purpose of providing you and/or your beneficiary pension benefits ("Supplemental Pension") and death benefits ("Supplemental Death Benefit") in addition to the annual salary and the pension and welfare benefits to which you and/or your beneficiary may be entitled under pension and welfare benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Employer or its affiliate(s). Employer hereby amends and restates said Prior Plan as follows:
1. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings described below:
1.1 "Actual Retirement Date" means the first day of the month following your retirement.
1.2 "Annual Salary" means your average annual compensation, including non-deferred incentive pay, without reduction for (i) any contribution to cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or successor provision) or (ii) any nonqualified deferred compensation plan, as reported for those three (3) full calendar years included within the five (5) full calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year of your Actual Retirement Date, in which your annual compensation was the greatest.
1.3 "Early Retirement Date" means the first day of the month following your sixty-second (62nd) birthday.
1.4 "Normal Retirement Date" means the first day of the month following your sixty-fifth (65th) birthday.
1.5 "Pension Plan" means The Drovers & Mechanics Pension Plan, as in effect from time to time.
1.6 "Supplemental Pension" means the projected pension hereunder at your Normal Retirement Date which when added to your then primary social security amount and your then projected pension from the Pension Plan will yield an annual benefit equal to the "Target Percentage" of your Annual Salary. The Target Percentage at Normal Retirement Date is 65% and at any other time is adjusted from 65% by use of the actuarial assumptions, methods and computational techniques then utilized by the Pension Plan ("Adjusted Target Percentage").
1.7 "Supplemental Death Benefit" means the death benefit as defined in Section 3.
2. SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION
2.1 Normal Retirement. If you retire on your Normal Retirement Date, Employer shall pay to you a Supplemental Pension in the form of a ten year term certain and life payout, or as otherwise selected by you under Section 4 hereof.
2.2 Early or Late Retirement. Except as provided to the contrary in Section 5.2 below, if you retire or otherwise terminate Employment prior to attaining age 62, no benefits shall be payable under this Plan. If you retire after having attained age 62 and other than on your Normal Retirement Date, Employer shall pay you, commencing at your Actual Retirement Date, a Supplemental Pension calculated using your Adjusted Target Percentage.
2.3 Notice. In the event of an early retirement, you shall provide Employer at least six months advance written notice of your Actual Retirement Date.
3. SUPPLEMENTAL DEATH BENEFIT. If, upon your death prior to Actual Retirement Date, your surviving spouse is entitled to receive a death benefit under the Pension Plan, your spouse shall receive a Supplemental Death Benefit hereunder, which shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Plan substituting, however, the Adjusted Target Percentage for the percentage specified in the Pension Plan, with the result then reduced by the Pension Plan death benefit and the social security benefit, and payable in the same manner as the Pension Plan benefit.
4. PAYMENT OPTIONS. Insofar as the Pension Plan permits the making of elections as to the mode of payment of benefits, such election by you will likewise apply with respect to the manner of payment and the amount of the Supplemental Pension, using the actuarial equivalency rules specified in the Pension Plan for optional forms of benefits.
5. TRUST. The Employer is establishing contemporaneously herewith that trust attached hereto as Exhibit "A" ("Trust"), to which it is contributing an initial corpus of $100. In the event of a change of control as defined in that Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreement dated , 1995, by and between the parties hereto, the Employer shall, in accordance with the terms of the Trust, contribute thereto the amount described in Section 1(e) thereof. Thereafter, amounts payable hereunder shall be paid first from the assets of such Trust and the income thereon. To the extent that the assets of the Trust and the income thereon are insufficient, Employer shall pay Executive the amount due hereunder.
6. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. This Plan may be terminated, amended or modified by Employer, provided however:
6.1 No such amendment shall reduce the Supplemental Pension and/or the Supplemental Death Benefit which (a) has commenced prior to the effective date of such amendment, modification or termination or (b) would be payable if you had attained age 62 and had retired on the day immediately prior to such effective date, provided however, the benefit so determined shall not commence until you actually attain age 62 and if you die in the interim, the benefit shall be the death benefit determined in accordance with the provisions hereof.
6.2 In the event of a Change of Control, this Plan may not be amended to reduce the Supplemental Pension and/or the Supplemental Death Benefit and may not be terminated during the Employment Security Period and the benefits shall continue to accrue thereunder in accordance with the provisions of the Change of Control Agreement and hereof. The terms "Change of Control", "Employment Security Period" and "Change of Control Termination" shall have the meaning provided under the Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreement by and between Drovers Bancshares Corporation, Drovers & Mechanics Bank, and A. Richard Pugh, dated,______________, 1995. If you suffer a Change of Control Termination prior to attaining Early Retirement Date, you shall receive a Supplemental Pension commencing at Early Retirement Date based on your Adjusted Target Percentage and your Annual Salary as defined in Section 1.2 above determined as of the date of your Change of Control Termination rather than Actual Retirement Date. Benefits so calculated shall commence on your Early Retirement Date rather than your Actual Retirement Date.
7. MISCELLANEOUS
7.1 In the event that a party hereto wrongfully fails to perform its obligations hereunder as determined by a final and nonappealable determination of a board of arbitrator or court, such party shall thereupon be obligated to promptly pay and reimburse the other party hereto for its costs and expenses incurred (including attorney, accounting, actuary and other professional consultants) in enforcing its or his entitlements hereunder.
7.2 Nothing herein (a) shall be deemed to exclude you from any compensation, pension, stock option, incentive pay or other benefits to which you otherwise are or might become entitled to as an employee of Employer, or (b) shall be construed as conferring on you the right to continue in the employ of Employer.
7.3 Any amounts payable hereunder shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to you for the purposes of computing benefits to which you may be entitled under the Pension Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement of Employer for the benefit of its employees.
7.4 The rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding on you and your beneficiary and on the successor and assigns of Employer.
7.5 Employer shall be responsible for the general operation and administration of this Plan.
7.6 This Plan shall be unfunded and no provision shall at any time be made with respect to segregating any assets of Employer for payment of any benefits hereunder. No person will have any interest in any assets of Employer by reason of the right to receive a benefit hereunder. You, your surviving spouse, and any other beneficiary, will have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of Employer with respect to any rights hereunder.
7.7 The rights and interests hereunder shall not, unless with Employer's prior written consent, be subject to any sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind.
7.8 Except as required by law, the right to receive payments hereunder shall not be subject to anticipation, sale, encumbrance, charge, levy, or similar process or assignment by operation of law.
7.9 The headings of the sections of this Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.
7.10 This Plan shall be administered and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Employer has caused this Plan to be executed this_____________day of __________________, 1995.

(iv) a termination or material adverse modification to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which Executive participates without substitution of comparable benefits, except any such termination or modification that is applied generally to senior executive officers who had such benefits.
3. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS - Upon a Change of Control Termination, Company shall provide Executive, in addition to any other rights or benefits to which Executive may be entitled by contract or under any policy or custom of Company, the following:
(a) For a term commencing with such termination and extending for eighteen (18) months thereafter, Company shall pay Executive an annual compensation equal to Executive's highest compensation received in that calendar year included with the period commencing with the calendar year in which this Agreement is executed initially and extending to the calendar year in which termination occurs (annualized as necessary). For purposes of the foregoing, "compensation" shall be (i) salary without reduction for any contribution to (aa) cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended [or successor provision] and (bb) any nonqualified deferred compensation plan, plus (ii) non-deferred incentive compensation (collectively "Compensation"), and shall be payable in equal installments with such frequency as Company customarily pays its payroll. For purposes of this paragraph (a), Executive's Compensation will be reduced, beginning with the first month following his re-employment with another employer, by fifty percent (50%) of the Form W-2 income, with the new employer. Executive shall have no obligation to mitigate his or her damages by seeking employment following his or her termination of employment with Company.
(b) Company shall provide, at its expense, for the continuation in full force and effect for a period ending upon the earlier to occur of Executive's death or eighteen (18) months following the Change of Control Termination, all health, dental, life insurance and disability plans, programs and arrangements in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to such termination, provided that his or her continued participation is possible under the terms and provisions of such plans, programs and arrangements, and under the laws and regulations applicable thereto. If Executive's participation in any plan, program or arrangement is barred, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and pay for, on Executive's behalf, individual insurance policies, plans, programs or arrangements which provide benefits equivalent to those which Executive is entitled to receive prior to the date of termination. However, Company may, at any time, deny Executive coverage under a health, dental, life insurance or disability plan, program or arrangement, to the extent such coverage is duplicate of coverage provided Executive by any subsequent employer. At the end of the period of coverage, to the extent permitted by the plans and programs, Executive shall have the option to have assigned to him or her, any assignable insurance policy owned by Company and relating specifically to him or her. Executive's right to continuation of health and medical coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, shall commence at the end of the eighteen (18) month period following the Change of Control Termination.
(c) Company shall provide, at its expense, for the continuation in full force and effect for a period ending upon the earlier to occur of Executive's death, retirement, or eighteen (18) months following the Change of Control Termination, all pension, profit- sharing, savings, and nonqualified deferred compensation plan including the supplemental retirement income plan in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to such termination, provided that his or her continued participation is possible under the terms and provisions of such plans, programs and arrangements, and under the laws and regulations applicable thereto. If Executive's participation in any plan, program or arrangement is barred, Executive shall be entitled to receive, upon a Change of Control Termination, a lump sum payable annually equal to the annual contribution, payments, credits or allocations Company would have provided him or her, to his or her account or on his or her behalf under such plan, program or arrangement had his or her participation and eligibility continued for the eighteen (18) month period following termination.
(d) Executive may exercise stock options issued to him or her pursuant to (i) the Drovers Bancshares Incentive Stock Option Plan as adopted by the Board of Directors on August 28, 1985 and as herein modified ("Stock Option Plan"), and (ii) Drovers Bancshares Corporation 1995 Stock Option Plan ("1995 Plan"). Such stock options shall be exercisable fully, and closing shall occur, within ninety (90) days of the Change of Control Termination whether or not: (i) A period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of exercise, as required by Section 5, paragraph (c) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar provision under the 1995 Plan.
(ii) Any installment exercise terms as stipulated by the Stock Option Plan's administrative committee ("Committee") and any agreement issued under Section 5, paragraph (c) of the plan has been satisfied, or any similar stipulation under the 1995 Plan.
(iii) The Committee has extended the option period upon Executive's termination pursuant to Section 5, paragraph (f) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar provision in the 1995 Plan. However, in no event shall Executive exercise any stock option after the earlier of (i) ten (10) years from the date of grant, or (ii) the expiration of the option period as stipulated in an agreement issued under Section 5, paragraph (c) of the Stock Option Plan, or any similar provision in the 1995 Plan, as applicable to said option(s).
The Committee shall authorize this acceleration of Executive's stock options under the Stock Option Plan by executing on the date of this Agreement the Stock Option Acceleration Authorization attached hereto as Exhibit A. A similar acceleration occurs under Section 8 of the 1995 Plan.
4. RIGHT TO HEARING - In the event Company believes that a Good Cause for termination of Executive's employment may exist, Company shall provide Executive with written notice of its intention to terminate for Good Cause and the facts upon which Company bases such belief, which notice shall be given at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed effective date for the termination. For such termination to be effective, Executive shall be provided with an opportunity within the said sixty (60) day period to be heard by the Board of Directors of Company. Thereafter, the Board may at its discretion elect to terminate Executive's employment by majority vote.
5. CONTINUANCE OF BENEFITS - If Executive has commenced receiving benefits hereunder, such benefits shall continue (subject however, to the specific terms and conditions applicable to each benefit as set forth herein), for the full term as provided in Section 3, above, notwithstanding that Executive subsequently dies, becomes permanently disabled, or retires at or after age sixty-five (65). Executive may, at any time and by written notice to Company in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, name one or more beneficiaries of any such benefits in the event of his or her death; provided, however, that upon Executive's death, the distribution of Executive's benefits under a qualified pension plan shall be made in accordance with the terms, including any beneficiary designation provision, of such plan. A designation of beneficiary under this Agreement shall be effective on the date actually received by Company. If Executive fails to designate a beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Executive, the benefits provided herein shall be paid:
(a) to his or her surviving spouse;
(b) if there is no surviving spouse, to his or her living descendants per stirpes; or (c) if there is neither a surviving spouse nor descendants, to his or her duly appointed and qualified executor or personal representative. 6. NO LIMITATION UPON PAYMENTS - The parties believe that the benefits payable under Section 3, above, represent reasonable compensation for personal services and as such no portion thereof constitutes an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or successor provision). The parties acknowledge that, should any portion be so characterized, substantial adverse tax consequences would result to both the payor (no tax deduction) and to the payee (excise tax). Nonetheless, the parties intend that the amounts be paid in full as provided herein, notwithstanding any such characterization and tax consequence.
7. WITHHOLDING - Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.
8. SOURCE OF PAYMENT - All payments provided under this Agreement may be paid in cash from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be required to be established. Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatever in or to any investment which Company may make to fund its obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between Company and Executive or any other person.
9. RABBI TRUST - The Company has established a rabbi trust at Hershey Trust Company. In the event of a change of control as defined herein, the Company shall, in accordance with the terms of the Trust, contribute thereto the amount described in Section 1(e) thereof. Thereafter, amounts payable hereunder shall be paid first from the assets of such Trust and the income thereon. To the extent that the assets of the Trust and the income thereon are insufficient, Company shall pay Executive the amount due hereunder.
10. NONASSIGNABILITY - Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall, without Company's prior written consent, be subject to any sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind.
11. ATTACHMENT - Except as required by law, the right to receive payments under this Agreement shall not be subject to anticipation, sale, encumbrance, charge, levy, or similar process or assignment by operation of law.
12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS - This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any corporate or other successor of the Company which shall acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, acquisition, consolidation, purchase, or otherwise, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and shall otherwise inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Nothing in the Agreement shall preclude Company from consolidating or merging into or with or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to another person, provided such other person shall assume this Agreement and all obligations of Company hereunder. Upon such a consolidation, merger, or transfer of assets and assumption, the term "Company" as used herein, shall mean such other person and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
13. WAIVERS NOT TO BE CONTINUED - Any waiver by a party or any breach of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or as a consent to any subsequent breach by the other party.
14. NOTICES - All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid, to the following addresses or to such other address as either party may designate by like notice:
A. If to Executive, to: "Named Executive Vice President"
B. If to Company, to: Drovers Bancshares Corporation 30 South George Street York, PA 17401
and to such other or additional person or persons as either party shall have designated to the other party in writing by like notice.
15. ARBITRATION - Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration. Any such arbitration shall take place in York, Pennsylvania, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the written award rendered by a majority of the arbitrators may be entered in the Court having jurisdiction thereof. The written decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be valid, binding, final, and nonappealable.
16. MISCELLANEOUS -
(a) In the event that a party hereto wrongfully fails to perform its obligations hereunder as determined and evidenced by a final and nonappealable determination of a board of arbitration or court, as the case may be, such party shall thereupon be obligated to promptly pay and reimburse the other party hereto for its costs and expenses incurred (including attorney, accounting, actuary and other professional consultants) in enforcing its or his entitlements hereunder.
(b) Executive shall be under no obligation to execute a covenant against competition as a condition to receive any benefit otherwise payable hereunder.
(c) Upon request, Executive shall promptly provide Company with information regarding his subsequent employment as contemplated herein, including that described in Section 3 hereof.
(d) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements between the parties. No amendment, waiver or termination of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced. Any written amendment, waiver or termination hereof executed by Company and Executive shall be binding upon them and upon all other persons, without the necessity of securing the consent of any other person, and no person shall be deemed to be third-party beneficiary under this Agreement.
(e) This Agreement shall not limit or infringe upon the right of Company to terminate the employment of Executive at any time, nor upon the right of Executive to terminate his or her employment with Company, each subject however to the specific provisions hereof. (f) "Person" as used in this Agreement means a natural person, joint venture, corporation, sole proprietorship, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, association, non-profit organization or any other legal, cognizable entity.
(g) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
(h) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
(i) The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.
(j) This Agreement shall be governed and construed and the legal relationships of the parties determined in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania applicable to contracts executed and to be performed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(k) The obligation of Company hereunder shall be joint and several.
(l) In the event that a party hereto wrongfully fails to perform its obligations hereunder as determined by a final and nonappealable determination of a board of arbitrator or court, such party shall thereupon be obligated to promptly pay and reimburse the other party hereto for its costs and expenses incurred (including attorney, accounting, actuary and other professional consultants) in enforcing its or his entitlements hereunder.
This Agreement replaces that Change of Control Agreement entered into by and among them on August 31, 1998; therefore, that Agreement is hereby revoked.
