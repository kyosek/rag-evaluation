Oil and Gas Properties
Reserves
The estimated reserve amounts and future net revenues were determined by outside consulting petroleum engineers. The reserve tables presented below show total proved reserves and changes in proved reserves owned by Columbus for the three years ended November 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995.
PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ---------------------------
Proved Developed Producing Reserves
As of November 30, 1997, Columbus has approximately 1,042,000 barrels of proved developed producing oil and condensate in the United States most of which are attributable to primary recovery operations. Producing oil properties in North Dakota, Montana and Texas account for over 95% of the reserves in the proved developed producing category.
The gas producing properties owned by Columbus are located in Texas, North Dakota, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Montana and contain 12.2 billion cubic feet of proved developed producing gas reserves.
The reserves in this category can be materially affected positively or negatively by either currently prevailing or future prices because they determine the economic lives of the producing wells.
Proved Developed Non-Producing Reserves
The reserves in this category are located in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Montana and North Dakota. Generally, these are reserves behind the casing in existing wells with recompletion required before commencement of production or else are in wells being completed and/or completed but awaiting pipeline connections at year end.
Columbus' non-producing reserves equal 292,000 barrels of oil, or 16% of its total proved oil reserves, and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or 21% of its total proved natural gas reserves.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Columbus' proved undeveloped reserves were approximately 472,000 barrels and 2.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Almost all of the oil reserves in this category are in Montana, North Dakota and Texas. All of the proved undeveloped gas reserves are attributable to undrilled locations offsetting production in Webb, Zapata and Jim Hogg Counties, Texas, Montana and North Dakota.
These reserves are expected to either be developed during 1998 or in future when oil prices again stabilize at levels which will yield a satisfactory rate of return on investment when developed.
Standardized Measure
The schedule of Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (the "Standardized Measure") is presented below pursuant to the disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, "Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities" (SFAS- 69) for such information. Future cash flows are calculated using year-end oil and gas prices and operating expenses, and are discounted using a 10% discount factor.

The standardized measure is intended to provide a standard of comparable measurement of the Company's estimated proved oil and gas reserves based on economic and operating conditions existing as of November 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995. Pursuant to SFAS-69, the future oil and gas revenues are calculated by applying to the proved oil and gas reserves the oil and gas prices at November 30 of each year relating to such reserves. Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year end. Production and development costs are based upon costs at each year end. Future income taxes are computed by applying statutory tax rates as of year end with recognition of tax basis, net operating loss carryforwards,
depletion carryforwards, and investment tax credit carryforwards as of that date and relating to the proved properties. Discounted amounts are based on a 10% annual discount rate. Changes in the demand for oil and gas, price changes and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
Discounted future net cash flows before income taxes for U.S. reserves were $37,301,000 in 1997, $46,530,000 in 1996, and $24,163,000 in 1995. As required by SFAS-69, the future tax computation appearing in the above table does not consider the Company's annual interest expenses and general and administrative expenses nor future expenditures for intangible drilling costs. Because of these factors, the tax provisions are not truly representative of the expected lower future tax expense to the Company so long as it remains an active operating company.
The reserve and standardized measure tables prescribed by the SEC and presented above are prepared on the basis of a weighted average price for all properties as of each year end. At November 30, 1997 the U.S. crude oil price (including natural gas liquids) was $18.36 per barrel and the natural gas price was $2.50 per thousand cubic feet. The SEC requires that this computation utilize those year end prices and expenses which are then held constant, except for contractual escalations, over the life of the property.
The calculation of discounted future cash flows can be materially affected by being compelled to use only those prices that happen to be effective on November 30 each year (Columbus' fiscal year end) because of price volatility. Mandatory usage of prices which happen to prevail on a single date can have an inordinate influence on year-end reserves as well as on the resulting year to year change that a company reports for discounted future net cash flows determined using this standardized measure calculation. Management has long advocated using a weighted average of prices actually received throughout the year to make this standardized measure calculation less susceptible to the impact of wide monthly fluctuations in prices which have occurred so frequently in recent years. Even using weighted average annual prices still may or may not be very indicative of future cash flows because average prices may vary widely in future fiscal years. This most recent 1997 fiscal year is a good example of why an average price would be preferable in management's opinion as year end prices for natural gas and crude oil were significantly different from the average annual prices received.
Outside Consultant's Report
An outside consulting firm, Reed Ferrill & Associates, was retained for the purpose of preparing a report covering the reserves of the Company's properties and a future production forecast using constant prices as of November 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995. The reports on the reserves of the properties located in the
Berry Cox field in Texas were prepared by Huddleston & Co., Inc., another outside consulting firm. These reports are prepared each year as required by the Company's bank line of credit.
Production
Columbus' net oil and gas production for each of the past three fiscal years is shown on the following table:
Fiscal Year --------------------------------- 1997 1996 1995 ---- ---- ---- USA Oil-barrels 249,000 246,000 225,000 Gas-Mmcf 3,370 2,686 2,033

TOTAL Oil-barrels 249,000 246,000 236,000 Gas-Mmcf 3,370 2,686 2,479
During the fiscal year 1997, Columbus filed Form EIA23 with the Energy Information Agency which required disclosure of oil and natural gas reserve data for wells operated by Columbus. The reserve data reported was for calendar year 1996. This data was reported on a gross operated basis inclusive of royalty interest and, therefore, does not compare with Columbus' net reserves reported for 1996.
Average price and cost per unit of production for the past three fiscal years are as follows:
Fiscal Year --------------------------------- 1997 1996 1995 ---- ---- ----
Average sales price per barrel of oil USA $19.62 $19.42 $16.75 Canada (U.S.$)(1) - - 11.61 Total Company 19.62 19.42 16.48
Average sales price per Mcf of gas USA $ 2.65 $ 2.15 $ 1.71 Canada (U.S.$) - - 1.09 Total Company 2.65 2.15 1.60
Average production cost per equivalent barrel USA $ 3.83 $ 4.35 $ 4.16 Canada (U.S.$) - - 2.89 Total Company 3.83 4.35 3.99
Natural gas converted to oil at the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Production costs for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995 include production taxes.

Drilling Activities
The Company engages in exploratory and development drilling in association with third parties, typically other oil companies. Actual drilling operations are not conducted by the Company and are usually carried out by third party drilling contractors, but the Company may act as operator of the projects. The following table gives information regarding the Company's drilling activity in its last three fiscal years.

Current Activities
The Company continued a development program on its properties and expanded its exploration efforts during fiscal 1997. Expenditures by the Company reached a record $10,088,000 for development and exploration drilling primarily on its oil-oriented properties in the Williston Basin of Montana and natural gas prone areas east of Houston and in Webb and Zapata Counties near Laredo, Texas. However, the Austin Chalk trend of mid-Louisiana was a new province for Columbus' exploratory efforts and unfortunately, Columbus' share of the first well exceeded expected costs by over $1,500,000. Fortunately, exploratory and development activity in the onshore upper Gulf Coast area continued to be EGY's most successful core area from the standpoint of both crude oil and natural gas reserve and productivity additions.
A review of the more significant operations follow below and have been segregated into Columbus' primary areas of operations.
South Texas - Laredo Area - -------------------------
As the second most important source of lease level cash flow for the past several years, this area remains its most important as a source of operational income. The Company serves as operator of in excess of 100 natural gas wells in various fields from the southern city limits of Laredo to the B.R. Cox field in Jim Hogg, County, almost 80 miles to the south. Columbus owns working interests which range from 1% to 53% in the wells which it operates and less than 10% WI in those wells in which it does not operate.
At least one drilling rig was utilized continuously throughout the year to drill infill and extension locations that had been identified by a 3-D seismic program conducted in 1995 and 1996. This suggested there were numerous new fault blocks which had not been previously drained by offset wells in one or more Lobo sands that produce in the area and would require drilling 40 to 50 new locations in order to exploit those reserves. A development program was begun during 1996 with 12 wells drilled and was continued throughout 1997 with participation in 18 additional wells resulting in three (0.65 net) dry holes and 15 (1.74 net) successful gas wells. Two (0.11 net) wells were in progress at year end which have since been completed as gas wells.
In the B.R. Cox field, Columbus' working interest in the five remaining wells (two active) on the Ruben Gonzalez producing property was sold for a net of $750,000 effective as of October 1, 1997. No new recompletions into new gas zones in wells on the remaining leases were undertaken in 1997 by Columbus as it awaited pre-payment for expected costs on one planned project from the largest working interest owner who had been very slow paying its prior operating bills.
Sralla Road Field Area - Harris County, Texas - ---------------------------------------------
This operational area continues to be Columbus' primary source of field level cash flow and is expected to be reasonably important for a few more years. During fiscal 1997 one (0.78 net) operated gas well, the James-Fielder #1, was completed in the upthrown fault block of the West Jackson Sralla Road field and extended the productive limits of the gas cap by another mile southwest. It had a similar thickness to other Jackson sand wells in the field and has since produced at its state-assigned allowable of about 1,300 Mcfd. An offset well to the Fielder and Wiggins units, the Hargrove #2 (0.13 net), is a non-operated gas well that was completed shortly thereafter and has been selling its monthly allowable also. In addition, that same operator drilled two other gas cap wells in the same general area but where Columbus had no interest. They also extended the field's oil zone limits by one mile to the northeast of the Company's original Ferguson #1 discovery oil well. As the fiscal year closed, that extension oil well was being offset by EGY's 67%-owned Waitkus B #2 (0.67 net) which has subsequently been completed as a successful flowing oil well in January at about 50 BOPD.
About 20 miles southeast of the Sralla Road field, the Company participated in an exploratory test of a 2-D seismic anomaly in search of gas in the Frio 16 sand at 9,000 feet. It was located in a separate fault block which was adjacent to the old Anahuac field in Chambers County, Texas that produced several hundred million barrels of oil from uphole Frio sands over several decades. The Syphrett Heirs #1 wildcat resulted in a natural gas discovery in the Frio 16 sand after which a production unit of 480 acres in size was agreed upon. The Company initially owned about 37% WI which was subject to a 25% reduction after it fully recovered all of its costs of acreage plus drilling and completion costs of this initial well. Excellent log and gas shows in the mud were encountered so Columbus assumed operatorship, set casing and built a gathering system and a pipeline connection in advance of perforating only ten feet of a 40-foot gross interval of sand. The well was tested in early July at a daily rate of 4.6 million cubic feet of gas and 90 barrels of condensate through a 14/64ths choke with a flowing tubing pressure of 4,950 psig. The well has been restricted to about 120 million cubic feet per month but nevertheless payout occurred in November thereby reducing Columbus' working interest to 27.75%.
A similar interest is owned in an additional 600 acres of prospective acreage to the south and east of the discovery and will require its own exploratory test as it is a separate fault block. A well is expected to be commenced early in 1998 and may be drilled as deep as 11,000 feet to also test the underlying Vicksburg formation. A gas discovery was made in that zone about two miles east of the Syphrett fault block while a dry hole has been drilled to
that formation at a location closer to this southeast acreage block. The Frio 15 sand is considered prospective for oil production at a structurally higher position in the Syphrett well discovery fault block and could also be productive in the southeast block.
Williston Basin Area - --------------------
Most of 1997's efforts in this area were related to workovers, short radius lateral recompletions, 3-D seismic programs, plus drilling two new deep wells because crude oil prices stayed consistently above $17 per barrel throughout 1996 and 1997. This was further supported by futures swaps but unfortunately this practice was not repeated so crude prices (which have fallen dramatically thus far in fiscal 1998) have not been protected by swaps.
A 3-D seismic effort which included the Southeast Froid field had previously been conducted over several sections during the last quarter of 1996 which pinpointed the highest structural location at which to drill a 12,000 foot replacement oil well to the Red River formation in that field. It also gave indications that another structure existed west of that field so additional leases were acquired bringing the total leaseholds owned to over 2,000 acres with a 90% WI. Supplemental 3-D seismic coverage was undertaken in the spring of 1997 to further delineate that potential structure as well as follow up on other leads including a Tyler sand river bed channel which appeared to meander through the acreage around those deep Paleozoic highs.
During 1997's second quarter, the 90% WI-owned McCabe #1-X Red River zone replacement well was drilled and completed in 20 feet of porosity in that formation. It also encountered several shows of oil in other horizons uphole before production casing was set. After perforating, the 1-X well was initially tested on pump at the rate of 86 barrels of oil per day but also produced a like amount of water despite the fact this location was about 10 feet structurally higher than the initial McCabe #1 Red River discovery well which it replaced. The latter well was then recompleted as an oil discovery in the Winnepegosis formation at about 11,100 feet following removal of junk which plugged the casing at about 9,400 feet. It initially pumped oil at rates of 116 to 141 barrels per day and water of 51 to 85 barrels per day. While each of those two wells added materially to third quarter oil production, steadily increasing water cuts during the fourth quarter have reduced their contribution to this area's daily oil production.
Following completion of the second 3-D seismic program in late spring, an exploratory Red River test well location was staked on one of several small bumps on a fairly broad closure of almost a section in size. Therefore one or more potential locations on this broad structure might be exploited now that the initial test well, the McCabe Farms #1-4 wildcat, proved to be productive. No drill stem tests were taken in one well while drilling uphole formations but a possible gas zone was encountered in a porous zone in the Mission Canyon which
is behind pipe. Excellent porosity and oil shows were encountered in the Red River "C" formation, casing was set and the well was completed with 21 feet of perforations in an interval from 11,910 to 11,937. Through a 17/64ths inch choke, the 90% owned McCabe Farms #1-4 flowed oil on initial test at the rate of 135 barrels per day with a water cut of 30% and a flowing tubing pressure of 150 psi. Since this well was not finally completed until early December, it will be considered as a fiscal 1998 discovery although most of the costs were incurred as part of 1997 fiscal year capital expenditures.
Immediately following this completion the 69%-owned McCabe #3-2 exploratory well was drilled to the Tyler formation at a depth of 7,200 feet but it proved to be a dry hole. While the meandering river bed seismic feature was confirmed, the cut made by river had subsequently been filled in by shale and lime with only a very limited amount of sand present as opposed to the 100 foot that had been expected.
Two short radius laterals in Columbus' 100% owned Lien lease in the west Mondak field were undertaken in the Lien #1 and Lien #3 wells which were marginal Mission Canyon oil producers. The first effort involved drilling a 921 foot lateral out of the cased hole in the Lien #3 well at a depth of about 8,900 feet. Unfortunately, this lateral only encountered very limited fracturing. After much higher initial oil production rates, the well appears to have settled around 17 barrels of oil and 60 barrels of water per day. The Lien #1 lateral was next undertaken near the end of the fiscal year. A record horizontal hole of 1,550 feet was accomplished but again this lateral did not encounter a recognizable vertical fracture system. Thus far the Lien #1 appears not to be any more productive than the Lien #3 despite the longer lateral interval but there have been problems with the downhole pump so this is not yet a final appraisal of the well's productivity.
Oklahoma - Anadarko Basin - -------------------------
There were three (1.02 net) development Morrow sand oil wells completed in Beaver County, Oklahoma all of which had excellent appearance on electric logs but only resulted in marginal oil producers. This is primarily due to a combination of water cuts in excess of 50% plus unstable frac sand which has plugged perforations and reduced total fluid productivity to levels only a fraction of the initial swab rates seen following frac treatment.
Goudeau Prospect - Avoyelles & St. Landry Parishes, Louisiana - -------------------------------------------------------------
As previously reported in Form 10-K and various quarterly and interim special reports, Columbus has a 12.5% working interest in a three township Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) in mid-Louisiana covering 41,000 gross acres of leaseholds which overlie the geo- pressured, fractured Austin Chalk formation below 15,000 feet in depth. A good portion of this block was assembled by a co-venture group which included EGY and 75% was then sold to Belco Oil & Gas.
Terms included a modest profit on acreage plus an after payout carried 25% interest in a vertical well to be drilled from grass roots to 15,000 feet and included updip and downdip horizontal legs approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet in length. This deal was subsequently modified to permit the use of an existing mutually- owned abandoned but cased vertical hole from which to drill two laterals at no up front costs to Columbus or its co-venturers to be followed later by a no cost vertical hole portion to be drilled at a second location. The Morrow #23-1H's operations began in February with Belco choosing to drill a 3,000-foot north updip lateral first. Belco purposely elected to drill laterally below the base of the Austin Chalk for reasons not clear to, and despite the objections of, the co-venture group and this lateral resulted in a dry hole. As a consequence, Belco then drilled a piggyback lateral about 100 feet vertically higher in the prospective pay section which penetrated numerous shows and fractures throughout this 3,100-foot horizontal hole. Belco was disappointed with its production test from this updip lateral which over a 66-hour period averaged a high water cut of about 70% in addition to varying rates of crude oil and natural gas. The last few hours of test showed a total fluid rate of about 66 barrels per hour of which 21% was oil (over 12 BPH) and 600,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day.
Following that test, Belco proposed to move the drilling rig off of that location without drilling the obligatory 4,000-foot southerly direction downdip lateral. There was immediate strong objections to that proposal by the co-venturers which was eventually settled by Belco relinquishing all of its right, title and interest in the cased well bore, the new updip 3,000-foot lateral and the 1,960-acre spacing unit to the co-venturers who thereupon took over operations. Numerous problems were encountered while attempting to drill this downdip lateral not the least of which included encountering high bottom hole pressures which exceeded the maximum attainable weighting of the clear drilling fluid being used and was needed to maintain control over the well. As a result, only 1,300 feet of the proposed 4,000-foot southerly downdip lateral could be drilled and the well had to be killed with a conventional barite-weighted mud system after replacing the clear drilling fluid. This change created a severe lost circulation problem so that any further efforts to finish the entire 4,000-foot lateral were ceased. The co-venturers generally agreed to make another attempt to drill a new 4,000-foot downdip lateral from a new casing window after this 1,300-foot downdip lateral and the updip 3,100-foot lateral had been depleted.
Subsequently, numerous other problems were encountered during the completion operations. These included packer problems, inability to push the liner out to the full 1,300 feet length of the lateral, inexperienced crews, faulty or improperly serviced rental equipment from major service companies, several poor engineering consultant's decisions, drilling rig equipment failures, disputes amongst the co-venturers on procedures, etc. The final blow occurred when a roughneck dropped a five inch bolt in the hole which blocked the
top of the packer and contributed to several additional days of rig and rental equipment expenses. A "jerry-rigged" completion had to be designed which at least permitted the well to produce from the downdip lateral only. It is impossible to predict how this will finally affect eventual recovery from the lateral but well cost overruns to the 100% interest exceeded $2,000,000. Fortunately, Columbus only owns 55% WI of the completed well and drilling unit so that these significant cost overruns did not have to be entirely absorbed by it.
Finally, an initial potential of the 1,300-foot downdip lateral only resulted in the Morrow #23-1H producing for a 26-hour clean-up period followed by a 24-hour test period during which the well flowed 560 barrels of 41o API gravity oil, 831 Mcf of natural gas and 1,691 barrels of what appeared to be a mixture of formation salt water and the clear calcium bromide drilling fluid lost during drilling operations.
A gas gathering line was laid to a nearby transmission system about 7,500 feet to the south and a tank battery, separator, treater, plus other surface equipment was installed. Also, a shallow water disposal well has been drilled and cased. The well was placed on production late in November on various small sizes of surface chokes which yielded rates which have ranged from 60 to 200 barrels of oil per day with water cuts from 70% to 80% and a flowing tubing pressure of 750 to 950 psi. It is a bit early to forecast with any accuracy the amount of oil that will be recovered from this downdip lateral, but through the first 35 days to December 31, 1997, it had produced 5,156 barrels of oil, an estimated 26,000 barrels of water and 4,179,000 cubic feet of natural gas. It is planned to first try to essentially deplete the short downdip lateral before attempting removal of the junk and bridge plug above the updip lateral which will allow that lateral to be produced. There is no forecast of when a drilling rig might be contracted for another attempt at drilling a 4,000-foot downdip lateral.
At least one additional well in the AMI is proposed to be promoted at the second drillsite along with a sale of the AMI acreage which remains. However, the co-venturers have already determined not to exercise any of the remaining option acreage as no profit would be realized from Belco. Should the Morrow #23-1H not perform as currently forecasted from the two existing laterals, then it is highly unlikely further development by drilling one or more new laterals from this Morrow #23-1H well bore will ever be undertaken by this group. Significant impairment charges for this area and well of $1,475,000 have already been recognized in fiscal 1997 by the Company and this has reduced net book value significantly and will lower depletion charges per barrel for this area in 1998.
Columbus' own expenditures (before impairment charges) in this prospect through November 30, 1997 totaled $939,000 for undeveloped leaseholds and $2,879,000 for interests in producing wells with most of the latter costs related to the Morrow #23-1H completion.
Titles
The Company is confident that it has satisfactory title to its producing properties which are held pursuant to leases from third parties and have been examined on several occasions to determine their suitability to serve as collateral for bank loans. Oil and gas interests are subject to customary interest and burdens, including overriding royalties and operating agreements. Titles to the Company's properties may also be subject to liens incident to operating agreements and minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions.
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, the Company does not regularly investigate titles to oil and gas leases when acquiring undeveloped acreage. Title is typically examined before any drilling or development is undertaken by checking the county and various governmental records to determine the ownership of the land and the validity of the oil and gas leases on which drilling is to take place. The methods of title examination adopted by the Company are reasonably calculated, in the opinion of the Company, to insure that production from its properties, if obtained, will be readily salable for the account of the Company. As stated above, certain of the Company's producing properties have been subject to independent title investigations as a consequence of bank loans obtained and have been accepted for such purposes. Insofar as is known to the Company, there is no material litigation pending or threatened pertaining to its proved acreage.
The producing and non-producing acreages are subject to customary royalty interests, liens for current taxes, and other burdens, none of which, in the opinion of the Company, materially interfere with the use of or adversely affect the value of such properties.
Competition, Marketing and Customers
Competition and Marketing. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Major oil and gas companies, independent producers with public drilling and production purchase programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate such properties. Many competitors have financial resources, staffs and facilities substantially greater than those of the Company. A ready market for the oil and gas production is, to a limited extent, dependent upon the cost and availability of alternative fuels as well as upon the level of consumer demand and domestic production of oil and gas; the amount
of importation of foreign oil and gas; the cost and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities; the regulation of state and federal authorities; and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations.
All production of crude oil and condensate by the Company is sold to others at field prices posted by the principal purchasers of crude oil in the areas where the producing properties are located. In the Company's judgment, termination of the arrangements under which such sales are made would not adversely affect its ability to market oil and condensate at comparable prices. During recent years, the posted prices were directly affected by the fluctuations in the supply and price of imported crude oil as well as by trading of oil futures.
A very limited amount of the natural gas produced by the Company is being sold at the well head under long-term contracts. Following deregulation of natural gas, excesses of domestic supply over demand, plus competition from alternate fuels caused Columbus, through CGSI, to take a much more active role in marketing its own gas along with gas owned by third parties.
Customers. Sales to three purchasers of crude oil and natural gas, which amounted to more than 10% of the Company's combined revenues for the years ended November 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, are set forth in Note 3 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, a loss of a customer has not to date, and should not in the future, materially affect the Company since the nature of the oil and gas industry is such that alternative purchasers are normally available on very short notice.
Government Regulations
The development, production and sale of oil and gas is subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations. In general, regulatory agencies are empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent waste of oil and gas, to protect the correlative rights and opportunities to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir, and to protect the environment. Matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to, discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, taxation and environmental protection. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas.
The Company believes that the environmental regulations, as presently in effect, will not have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the industry. Consequently, the Company does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the current year or any succeeding year. No assurance can be
given as to the future capital expenditures which may be required for compliance with environmental regulations as they may be adopted in future. The Company believes, however, that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue to be towards stricter standards. For instance, legislation previously considered in Congress would amend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to reclassify oil and gas production wastes as "hazardous waste," the effect of which would be to further regulate the handling, transportation and disposal of such waste. If similar legislation were to pass, it could have a significant adverse impact on the operating costs of the Company, as well as the oil and gas industry in general.
Operating Hazards
The oil gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures and discharge of toxic gases, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. The Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. Furthermore, the Company cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at premium levels that justify its purchase or whether insurance will be available at all. Generally, the Company has elected to not obtain blow-out insurance when drilling a well, except for deep high pressure wells or when required such as within city limits.
Natural Gas Controls
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") has issued several rules which encourage sales of gas directly to end users and provides open access to existing pipelines by producers and end users at the highest possible prices that can be negotiated. All price controls were terminated as of January 1, 1993. On April 8, 1992, FERC issued Order No. 636 which has essentially restructured the interstate gas transportation business. The stated purpose of Order 636 was to improve the competitive structure of the pipeline industry and maximize consumer benefits from the competitive wellhead gas market and to assure that the services non-pipeline companies can obtain from pipelines is comparable to the services pipeline companies offer to their customers. The Order is complex and, while it faces challenges in court, it has been fully activated following a rehearing with minimum modification and subsequent reissuance as FERC Order No. 636A. The Company is not able to predict the extent to which this very complex order will change the industry in the long term but
short term it has led to much more competitive markets and raised serious questions about whether gathering systems of interstate pipelines can be sold off and totally escape regulation.
