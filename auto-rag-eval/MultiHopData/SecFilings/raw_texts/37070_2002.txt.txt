Any proceeds remaining thereafter will be split 25% to the holders of the Call Units and 75% to the General and Class A Limited Partners. The proceeds of the M&J/Grove capital call were primarily used for a mortgage debt restructuring of the Grove Office Park. The original $8,000,000 mortgage was paid off at a discounted amount of $5,600,000 and replaced with a new first mortgage loan in the amount of $5,500,000, bearing interest at the fixed rate of 8.55% per annum for five years.
