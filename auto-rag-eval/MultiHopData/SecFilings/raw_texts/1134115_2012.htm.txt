ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
LIVENGOOD GOLD PROJECT, Alaska
The Company currently holds, or has rights to acquire, ownership or leasehold interests in a group of adjacent mineral properties in Alaska which are collectively referred to as the “Livengood Gold Project.” The Livengood Gold Project is located approximately 115 km (71 miles) by road northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska and approximately 65 km (40 miles) north of the boundary of the Fairbanks North Star Borough as shown in Figure 1 below. The project lies within the Tolovana Mining District in the northern part of the Tintina Gold Belt. The Company’s primary focus is to continue to advance the Livengood Gold Project with the objective of assessing its viability for commercial gold mining.
The Company is in the exploration stage and does not mine, produce or sell any mineral products at this time. While the Livengood Gold Project has estimated mineral resources, it does not at this time have any known or identified
mineral reserves. There can be no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit, or reserve, exists on the project until appropriate exploratory and engineering work are done and a comprehensive evaluation based on such work concludes legal and economic feasibility.
In August, 2011, the Company reported an updated resource estimate for the Livengood Gold Project pursuant to its “August 2011 Summary Report on the Livengood Gold Project, Tolovana District, Alaska” dated August 25, 2011 (the “Livengood Report”), which updated its Preliminary Economic Assessment dated November 2010. The Livengood Report is preliminary in nature, and based on forward looking technical and economic assumptions which are being evaluated in the Feasibility Study, which is currently underway.
The Company relies upon consultants and contractors to carry on many of its activities and, in particular, to carry out drilling programs at the Livengood Gold Project and in connection with the preparation of its Feasibility Study on the project. However, as ITH expands its activities, it may choose to hire additional employees rather than relying on consultants.

Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The Livengood Gold Project is located approximately 115 km (71 miles) by road northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska in the Tolovana Mining District within the Tintina Gold Belt. The project area is centered on Money Knob, a local topographic high point. This feature and the adjoining ridgelines are the probable lode gold source for the Livengood placer deposits which lie in the adjacent valleys which have been actively mined since 1914 and have produced more than 500,000 ounces of gold.
The Livengood Gold Project straddles and is accessed via the Elliot Highway, a paved, all weather road linking the north slope oil fields at Prudhoe Bay to central and southern Alaska through Fairbanks. At present there are no full time residents in the former mining town of Livengood. A number of unpaved roads have been developed in the area providing excellent access. A 427-meter (1400-foot) runway is located 6 km (3.7 miles) to the southwest near the former Alyeska Pipeline Company Livengood Camp and is suitable for light aircraft. The Livengood Gold Project is also adjacent to the Alyeska Pipeline corridor, which transports crude oil from Prudhoe Bay south. This corridor contains a fiber optic communications cable utilized at the Livengood Gold Project.
Topography at the site is eroded hills and valleys with a general elevation difference of 200m (656 feet). The valleys generally contain active streams draining into the Tolovana River system to the west.
The site is approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of the Arctic Circle, and has a subarctic climate with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Annual precipitation is approximately 40 cm (16 inches). Average low temperatures in winter are -21° to -28° Celsius (-6° to -18° Fahrenheit), with records reaching as low as -55° Celsius (-67° Fahrenheit). Exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November. Road-accessible wetland areas may only be explored while frozen in the winter. Work to date on the site has been limited to exploration and geotechnical drilling and environmental baseline activities. The company does not have any plant or equipment at the site, relying on contractors to perform the work.
The nearest community to Livengood Gold Project is the village of Minto, a town with a population of 200 located approximately 65 km (40 miles) southwest by road. The Fairbanks metropolitan area has a population of approximately 98,000 people, and comprises the regional center with hospitals, government offices, businesses and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The city is linked to southern Alaska along a north-south transportation and utility corridor that includes two paved highways, a railroad to tide water, an interlinked electrical grid, and communications infrastructure. Fairbanks has a regional airport serviced daily by up to three major airlines.
In preliminary, nonbinding discussions, the local utility in Fairbanks (Golden Valley Electrical Association) has indicated that 80-100 Megawatts of power could be available to the Livengood Gold Project. Livengood would be connected to the local grid by building a 82 km (50 miles) 230- kVA line along the pipeline corridor. Environmental baseline studies required for the electrical line construction started in 2011.
The Feasibility Study is currently developing site layout plans for the infrastructure required at the Livengood Gold Project. This includes evaluating mine shops; process, water and tailing management facilities; power; access roads; administration offices; and camp facilities.

On State of Alaska lands, the state holds both the surface and the subsurface rights. State of Alaska 40-acre mining claims require an annual rental payment of $35/claim to be paid to the state (by November 30th of each year), for the first five years, $70 per year for the second five years, and $170 per year thereafter. These rental rates are multiplied by 4 for each 160 acre claim. As a consequence of the annual rentals due, all Alaska State Mining Claims have an expiry date of November 30th each year. In addition, there is a minimum annual work expenditure requirement of $100 per 40-acre claim (due on or before noon on September 1 in each year) or cash-in-lieu, and an affidavit evidencing that such work has been performed is required to be filed on or before November 30th in each year. Excess work can be carried forward for up to four years. If the rental is paid and the work requirements are met, the claims can be held indefinitely. The work completed by the Company during the 2012 field season was filed as assessment work, and the value of that work is sufficient to meet the assessment work requirements through
September 1, 2016 on all State of Alaska mining claims.
Holders of State of Alaska mining claims are also required to pay a production royalty on all revenue received from minerals produced on state land during each calendar year. The production royalty rate is 3% of net income.
Holders of federal unpatented mining claims are required to pay an annual rental of $140 per 20 acres.
All of the foregoing agreements are in good standing and are transferable. The Company has taken reasonable steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest. Except for the patented claims, none of the properties have been surveyed.
Holders of Federal and Alaska State unpatented mining claims have the right to use the land or water included within mining claims only when necessary for mineral prospecting, development, extraction, or basic processing, or for storage of mining equipment. However, the exercise of such rights is subject to the appropriate permits being obtained.
December 2011 Land Purchase Agreement
In December 2011, the Company completed a transaction to acquire certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project. This acquisition included both mining claims and all of the shares of LPI. These assets were purchased for aggregate consideration of $36,600,000 allocated between cash consideration of $13,500,000 and a derivative liability of $23,100,000. The derivative liability is a contingent payment based on the five-year average daily gold price (“Average Gold Price”) from the date of the acquisition. The derivative liability (payable in December 2016) will equal $23,148 for every dollar that the Average Gold Price exceeds $720 per troy ounce. If the Average Gold Price is less than $720, there will be no additional contingent payment. The subject ground was previously vacant or was used for placer gold mining.
No placer mineral reserves or mineral resources have been established on the ground subject to this agreement. However, records exist for 2,370 placer drill holes that have been completed on the subject ground between 1933 and 2011. Of these, the 945 holes completed between 1933 and 1984 were primarily 6” churn drill holes. The 1,425 drill holes completed between 1984 and 2000 were 8” RC rotary drill holes utilizing a center return tri-cone bit. All lands controlled by the Company, including the lands acquired pursuant to this agreement, are being evaluated as appropriate for integration into the Feasibility Study for the Livengood Gold Project.
Geology and Mineralization
Rocks at the Livengood Gold Project are part of the Livengood Terrane, an east-west belt, approximately 240 km (149 miles) long, consisting of tectonically interleaved assemblages of various ages. These assemblages include the Amy Creek Assemblage, a sequence of latest Proterozoic and/or early Paleozoic basalt, mudstone, chert, dolomite, and limestone. An early Cambrian ophiolite sequence of mafic and ultramafic sea floor rocks was thrust over the Amy Creek Assemblage and was, in turn, overthrust by a sequence of Devonian shale, siltstone, conglomerate, volcanic, and volcaniclastic rocks, which are the dominant host to the mineralization currently under exploration at the Livengood Gold Project. The Devonian assemblage was overthrust by a second klippe of Cambrian ophiolite rocks. All of these rocks are intruded by Cretaceous multiphase monzonitic and syenitic dikes and sills. Gold mineralization is spatially and temporally associated with these intrusive rocks.
Gold mineralization occurs in association with disseminated arsenopyrite and pyrite in volcanic, sedimentary, and intrusive rocks, and in quartz veins cutting the more competent lithologies, primarily volcanic rocks, sandstones, and, to a lesser degree, ultramafic rocks. Three principal stages of alteration are currently recognized, an early biotite stage, followed by albite-quartz, and a late sericite-quartz assemblage. Carbonate appears to have been introduced with and subsequent to these stages. Arsenopyrite and pyrite were introduced primarily during the albite-quartz and sericite-quartz stages. Gold correlates strongly with arsenic and occurs primarily within and on the margins of arsenopyrite and pyrite.
Mineralization is interpreted as intrusion-related, consistent with other gold deposits of the Tintina Gold Belt, and has a similar As-Sb geochemical association. Mineralization is controlled partly by lithologic units, but thrust-fold
architecture was key to providing pathways for intrusive and associated hydrothermal fluids.
Local fault and contact limits to mineralization have been identified, but overall the deposit has not been closed off in any direction. The current resource and area drilled covers the most significant portion of the area with anomalous gold in surface soil samples, but still represents only about 25% of the total gold-anomalous area.
Among deposits of the Tintina Gold Belt, mineralization at the Livengood Gold Project is most similar to the dike and sill-hosted mineralization at the Donlin Creek deposit, where gold occurs in narrow quartz veins associated with dikes and sills of similar composition. The age of the intrusions and the genetic link between the mineralization and intrusive rocks are typical of those of other nearby gold deposits of the Tintina Gold Belt, which have been characterized as intrusion-related gold systems and for these reasons the Livengood Gold Project is best classified with them.
History and Exploration
Gold was first discovered in the gravels of Livengood Creek in 1914. Subsequently, over 500,000 ounces of placer gold were produced and the small town of Livengood was established. From 1914 through the 1970’s, the primary focus of prospecting activity was placer deposits. Historically, prospectors considered Money Knob and the associated ridgeline the source of the placer gold. Prospecting, in the form of dozer trenches, was carried out for lode type mineralization in the vicinity of Money Knob primarily in the 1950’s. However, to date no significant production has been derived from lode gold sources.
The geology and mineral potential of the Livengood District have been investigated by state and federal agencies and explored by several companies over the past 40-plus years. Modern mapping and sampling investigations were initially carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1967 as part of a heavy metal assessment program. Mapping completed in the course of this program recognized the essential rock relations, thrust faulting, and mineralization associated with Devonian clastic rocks, the thrust system and intrusive rocks. Since then, the Livengood placer deposits and the surrounding geology have featured in numerous investigations and mapping programs at various scales by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Alaska State Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.
In addition to individuals prospecting the area, since the 1970’s several mining companies, including Homestake, AMAX, Placer Dome, Cambior and AngloGold, have investigated the potential for lode gold mineralization beneath the Livengood placers and on the adjacent hillsides, including at Money Knob. Placer Dome’s work appears to have been the most extensive, but it was focused largely on the northern flank of Money Knob and the valley of Livengood Creek.
The most recent round of exploration of the Money Knob area began when AngloGold acquired the property in 2003 and undertook an 8-hole reverse circulation (RC) program on the Hudson-Geraghty lease. The results from this program were encouraging and were followed up with an expanded soil geochemical survey which identified gold-anomalous zones over Money Knob and to the east. Based on the results of this and prior (Cambior) soil surveys, 4 diamond core holes were drilled in late 2004. Results from these two AngloGold drill programs were deemed favorable but no further work was executed due to financial constraints and a shift in corporate strategy.
The Company acquired the Livengood Gold Project in 2006 from AngloGold and has advanced the soil sampling coverage, undertook to drill surface geochemical anomalies and conducted drilling campaigns on the Livengood Gold Project since that time.
In 2006, the Company conducted a 1227m, seven-hole program and continued to demonstrate the presence of mineralization over a broader area. The 2007 campaign consisted of 15 diamond drill holes for a total of 4,411m. These holes focused on extending and defining the volcanic-hosted mineralization first recognized by AngloGold in 2003. However, as drilling progressed, it became clear that although mineralization is strongest in the volcanic rocks, it occurs in all rock types at Money Knob.
Based on favorable results in 2007, the 2008 program consisted of 29,150m of RC and 2,187m core drilling in 109 and 9 holes, respectively. The drill program was designed to improve definition and expand the resource calculated early in 2008 based on 2007 drill data. The 2008 drill program did not identify limits to mineralization in any
direction. Instead, a thicker mineralized zone (up to 200m) was identified. In addition, this campaign highlighted the fact that mineralization occurs in all rock types, not just in Devonian volcanic rocks, indicating potential more widespread mineralization than envisioned prior to the 2008 drill program.
In 2009, the Company completed 12 diamond drill holes totaling 4,572 meters and 195 RC holes totaling 59,757 meters. Six of the diamond drill holes were drilled across the NNW-trending Core Zone in order to better understand the structural controls and to test the depth continuity of the mineralization. This drilling confirmed that the Core Zone is the locus of a swarm of 0.2 - 1.0m thick southerly dipping dikes. In addition, a number of larger (+10m thick) steeply dipping NNW-trending dikes were observed suggesting that ENE extension may have occurred at about the time of dike magmatism. The RC holes were primarily targeted at grid infill drilling to improve resource estimation of the Core Zone and a step-out program that led to discovery and delineation of the Sunshine and Tower Zones.
In 2010, the Company completed 40 diamond drill holes totaling 13,631 meters and 198 RC holes totaling 56,550 meters. These holes filled in between the Core and Sunshine Zones, expanded the SW Zone and infilled to 50 meter spacing in the Core and Sunshine Zones.
Nearly all drill holes at Money Knob have been drilled in a northerly direction at an inclination of -50 degrees (RC) and -60 degrees (core) in order to best intercept the south dipping structures and mineralized zones as close to perpendicular as possible. A few holes have been drilled in other directions to test other features and aspects of mineralization. Most exploration holes have been spaced at 75m apart along lines 75m apart, subsequent infill drilling in the center of 75m squares brings the nominal drill spacing to 50m for a significant portion of the deposit. Core is recovered using triple tube techniques to ensure good recovery (>95%) and confidence in core orientation. RC holes are bored and cased for the upper 0-30m to prevent down hole contamination and to help keep the hole open for ease of drilling at greater depths.
In 2011, the Company continued with resource definition drilling, completing 26,163 meters of RC drilling and 11,468 meters of diamond drilling. Two areas of the deposit, the Core and Sunshine crosses, were selected for 15-meter-spaced reverse circulation (RC) in-fill drilling on crosses with north-south and east-west legs 150 meters in length. A third area, Area 50 in the Sunshine Zone, measuring 195 meters by 240 meters, was drilled on a 37.5-meter grid with alternating core and RC drilling. Two resources were generated for each volume using ordinary kriging on samples composited to 10-meter lengths: the first including those portions of the 50-meter grid drilling within the volume; and a second using both the grid and close-spaced drilling within the same volume. On average, the effect of the increased drilling density on tonnage, grade, and contained ounces of gold was less than 1% and confirmed the integrity of the resource estimate reported in the Livengood Report. In 2011, the Company broadened the scope of the field program to include 2,240 meters of exploration drilling outside the resource area, as well as 8,932 meters of geotechnical drilling and 1,192 meters of large diameter groundwater test wells.
In May 2012, the Company commenced an 18-hole program of condemnation drilling to either sterilize or establish the presence of significant mineralization in the area surrounding the Money Knob deposit. The purpose of the condemnation drilling program was to determine appropriate areas for infrastructure development. Additionally, four of these holes are also being used for hydrological studies. The program was completed in July with 3,065m in 19 holes.
Also in May 2012, the Company commenced multi-faceted drill programs consisting of hydraulic gradient, infrastructure, borrow source identification, and large-diameter wells for pump tests. The hydraulic gradient and infrastructure drilling consisted of 5,826m in 49 holes utilizing core drilling. The geotechnical and borrow source information was obtained from 2,695m drilled in 73 holes, utilizing core, sonic, and auger drilling methods. Seven large diameter wells have been drilled for a total of 1,031m.
The drill program from February through October 2012 totaled 15,731m in 199 holes.
Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
The Company samples all holes from surface to total depth, using defined procedures. For RC samples, pulverized material is passed through a cyclone to separate solids from drilling fluids, then over a spinning conical splitter. The
splitter is set to collect two identical splits of sample weighing 2-5 kg (4.4-11.0 pounds) each. Representative coarse material is collected and saved in chip trays for geological description. Samples are put in pre-numbered, bar-coded bags by the drill site crew. One sample is submitted for analysis, and one sample is kept for reference. Samples are secured on site, and transported to a sample preparation facility operated by ALS Chemex in Fairbanks.
Core materials are collected at the drill site and placed in core boxes. Run blocks, orientation blocks and depths are placed in the boxes at site. The core is transported to a sample management facility at Livengood, where it is described, then sawn in half. Half of the core is collected for assaying and half remains for reference. Core samples are weighed before shipping.
The geologic work program at Livengood was designed and is supervised by Chris Puchner, Chief Geologist of the Company, who is a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Puchner is responsible for all aspects of the work, including the quality control/quality assurance program. The quality assurance/quality control program implemented by the Company meets or exceeds industry standards. A quality assurance/quality control program includes insertion of blanks and standards (1/10 samples) and duplicates (1/20 samples). Blanks help assess the presence of any contamination introduced during sample preparation and help calibrate the low end of the assay detection limits. Commercial standards are used to assess the accuracy of the analyses. Duplicates help assess the homogeneity of the sample material and the overall sample variance. The Company has undertaken rigorous protocols to assure accurate and precise results. Among other methods, weights are tracked throughout the various steps performed in the laboratory to minimize and track errors. A group of 2096 metallic screen fire assays performed in 2011 did not indicate any bias in the matching fire assays.
On-site project personnel photograph the core from each individual borehole prior to preparing the split core. Duplicate RC drill samples are collected with one split sent for analysis. Representative chips are retained for geological logging. On-site personnel at the project log and track all samples prior to sealing and shipping. All sample shipments are sealed and shipped to ALS Chemex in Fairbanks, Alaska, for preparation and then on to ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, or Vancouver, B.C., for assay. ALS Chemex’s quality system complies with the requirements for the International Standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:1999. Analytical accuracy and precision are monitored by the analysis of reagent blanks, reference material and replicate samples. Quality control is further assured by the use of international and in-house standards. Finally, representative blind duplicate samples are forwarded to ALS Chemex and an ISO compliant third party laboratory for additional quality control.
Data entry and database validation procedures have been checked and found to conform to industry practices. Procedures are in place to minimize data entry errors. These include pre-numbered, pre-tagged, bar-coded bags, and bar-coded data entry methods which relate all information to sample and drill interval information. Likewise, data validation checks are run on all information used in the geologic modeling and resource estimation process. Database entries for a random sample (10%) of drill holes used for the resource estimate were checked against the original Assay Certificates by one of the independent authors of the Livengood Report described below and the error rate was found to be within acceptable limits.
Analysis of assay data from core and RC sampling has been performed to check for downhole contamination of RC and to compare the data distributions produced by the two methods. Analysis of RC data has not indicated cyclic down hole contamination. Decay analysis conducted on both core drilling and RC drilling indicates similar patterns of monotonic grade increase or decrease. Comparison of the grade distributions between core and RC data were conducted using Quantile-Quantile plots, and simulation of population means for different numbers of samples. The comparison indicated that the mean of all core data was 4% lower than RC data Comparison of core and RC data below the water table showed similar population means suggesting that down hole contamination was not occurring.
Core and RC check samples have been collected during each drilling campaign by independent third parties. Results from these samples, as well as blanks and standards included, are consistent with the Company’s initial results. This includes a similar increase in variance for samples at higher grades, a pattern consistent with nugget effect. No systematic high or low bias has been observed.
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
The Company has undertaken metallurgical and processing test work to determine optimal recoveries using
numerous conventional flow sheets: including milling with gravity, flotation, and CIL or gravity and CIL of the gravity tails, and heap leaching. This test work focused on determining the best means of optimizing these combined recovery methods. This work involved studies that evaluate how gold mineralization occurs and how the mineralized materials vary in their physical and metallurgical response to process treatment parameters according to the various lithologic units that host mineralization. The characteristics reviewed include grindability, abrasiveness, optimal particle size for downstream treatment, and response to leach, flotation, or gravity unit operations as a function of oxidation and lithology.
In 2012, additional metallurgical studies have determined that the gold recovery for the four key rock types that comprise the majority of the Livengood Gold resource will range between 77% and 88%. A substantial portion of the early production at Livengood is expected from these rock types.
The study program included tests to first determine the gravity recoverable gold, and then evaluated two alternative mill flow sheets for processing of the gravity tailing. The tests showed a robust gravity recovery of between 43 and 55%. The gravity recovery, total gravity/flotation/concentrate CIL recovery, and the total gravity/whole ore CIL recovery by major rock type are outlined below:
Estimated Gold Recovery by Rock Type (%):
Note: These four rock types comprised approximately 70% of the mineable resource described in the Livengood Report. The Feasibility Study will update and define the percentage of each rock type contained in the mineable resource.
These results are based upon test work completed on a large number of representative samples contained in the 10,800 kg of mineralized rock that was delivered to SGS Canada Inc. in February, 2012. This extensive program of optimization testing and analysis, overseen by Samuel Engineering, has defined the recovery for these rock types that will be used in the Feasibility Study.
Based on this successful test program and related engineering tradeoff studies, the Company has determined that a gravity circuit followed by a whole ore CIL circuit will be the mill flow sheet developed in the Feasibility Study.
Preliminary Economic Assessment
In August, 2011, the Company reported an updated resource estimate for the Livengood Gold Project pursuant to its Livengood Report. The Livengood Report estimates measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources as of August 22, 2011 based on borehole data up to May 31, 2011 and other technical information as of August 22, 2011 in accordance with the standards of NI 43-101. Readers are encouraged to review the entire Livengood Report, which is filed under the Company’s profile on SEDAR.
The Livengood Report is preliminary in nature, and based on forward looking technical and economic assumptions which are being evaluated in the Feasibility Study.
In June 2012, the Company determined the most efficient and cost effective path to permitting the Livengood Gold Project was to bypass the preparation of a pre-feasibility study and incorporate results from engineering and metallurgical test work directly to a definitive Feasibility Study, which is currently underway. The Company has engaged Samuel Engineering, Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colorado, to provide process engineering services for the Feasibility Study and AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc. of Denver, Colorado, to provide geotechnical infrastructure engineering services. The Company does not propose any method of production at this time, and one of the objectives of the Feasibility Study is to determine the optimum economic method for any production at the Livengood Gold Project.
Mineral Resource Estimation
No mineral reserves have been estimated on the Livengood Gold Project. However, a summary of the estimated global (in-situ) mineral resource from the Livengood Report is presented below for cutoff grades of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 g/t gold. Our Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources have been estimated in compliance with definitions set out in NI 43-101. We have filed Technical Reports regarding the disclosure of Mineral Resources for the Livengood Gold Project on SEDAR as required by NI 43-101. The terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not recognized by the SEC. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves or that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, will ever be upgraded to a higher category or is economically or legally mineable.

Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social and Community Impacts
The Livengood Gold Project is currently operating within compliance of all environmental regulations that apply during the exploration stage of major mineral projects. The Company has received all necessary exploration permits for activities such as trenching, drill road building and drilling. These permits are also reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment and require specific changes to the proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for major exploration projects generally requires 30-60 days for processing. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of exploration permits there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur. Reclamation of surface disturbance associated with exploration activities is conducted concurrently where required.
The Company has been conducting extensive, multi-disciplinary environmental baseline studies in and around the project area since 2008 in order to understand the current environmental conditions and to allow project design to be optimized to minimize potential environmental effects. The environmental baseline programs conducted or currently underway at Livengood include:
· surface water and hydrology;
· groundwater hydrogeology;
· geohydrology;
· wetlands and vegetation;
· meteorology and air quality;
· aquatic life and resources;
· wildlife and habitat;
· cultural resources;
· rock characterization; and
· geochemical characteristics.
Based on review of the studies completed to date, there are no known environmental issues that are anticipated to materially impact the Livengood Gold Project’s ability to extract the gold resource.
Looking forward to potential project development, a site-specific monitoring plan and water management plan for both operations and post mine closure will be developed in conjunction with detailed engineering and project permit planning. Development of the Livengood Gold Project will require a number of state and federal permits. Federal permits will be issued pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ). In fulfillment of the NEPA requirements, the Livengood Gold Project will be required to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. Although at this time it is unknown which department will become the lead federal agency, the State of Alaska is expected to take a cooperating role to coordinate the NEPA review with the State permit process. Actual permitting timelines are controlled by the NEPA review and US Federal and State agency decisions. There are no municipal or community agreements required for the Livengood Gold Project.
