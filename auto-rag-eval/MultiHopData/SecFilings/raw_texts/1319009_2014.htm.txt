Pan Project
The Pan project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit located along the prolific Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend at the northern end of the Pancake mountain range in western White Pine County, Nevada, approximately 18 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada, and 58 miles west of Ely, Nevada. Access is via a seven mile gravel road running south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Eureka has a population of about 1,400. Water is available from wells on the property. Construction of power lines to the property are approximately 76% complete, and should be operational during Q2 of 2015. Generators are being utilized for power at the mine prior to completion of the power line. Gold mineralization occurs in shallow oxide deposits, along a two-mile strike length of a faulted anticline. Construction of this project is nearly complete and the mine will operate as an open pit, heap leach mining operation. Production is planned for March of 2015 subject to completion of critical construction items and commissioning of the operating assets.
Title
We have controlled the property since April 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. We acquired our interest in a January 7, 2003 mineral lease agreement with Nevada Royalty Corp., Inc (“NRC”), as a result of our acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5th of each year we must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of U.S.$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 174 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing price for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. On January 2, 2014 we paid $245,768 (U.S.$231,072). On January 2, 2015 we paid $261,602 (U.S.$223,058). The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. We must incur a minimum of U.S.$65,000 a year of work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease.
We have staked additional claims adjacent to the Pan property, some of which fall within the one mile area of interest of the NRC mining lease and will be subject to the production royalty to NRC. We have staked additional claims around the project, increasing the total land holdings to over 16 square miles.
We hold 121 and lease 429 unpatented lode mining claims which constitute our Pan Mine. The leased unpatented lode mining claims are held with Nevada Royalty Corp. and expire on January 7, 2023. The total acreage covered by these 550 claims is approximately 10,473 acres. These claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. DOI, BLM and White Pine County, Nevada. To maintain all of the mining claims we must pay annual maintenance fees to the BLM and White Pine County. We have additional obligations to the lessor of the leased 429 mining claims which include making scheduled advance royalty payments. The leased portion of the Pan Mine is subject to a sliding scale royalty of 2.5% to 4% gross sales during production.
Mineral Resources
As we begin to operate at the Pan Mine and gain experience through our efforts, we are likely to update the reserve and resource estimates based upon current operating results. In October 2011, we reported a resource estimate for the Pan project based on results from 2011 drilling received up to the date of the resource estimate. The Measured and Indicated mineral resource estimate exceeded one million ounces of gold. The 1.13 million ounces of gold are contained in 37 million tonnes of 0.49 grams per tonne (gpt) gold in the Measured category and 43 million tonnes of 0.40 gpt gold in the Indicated category using a 0.14 gpt gold cutoff grade. The resource was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC, a qualified person and an arm’s length party to the Company. The mineral resources are summarized below. “NI 43-101 Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada”, dated November 1, 2011, which is available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com. The report was prepared to the standards of NI 43-101 and was filed on SEDAR on November 2, 2011.
			
		
Resource Estimate, Pan project, Nevada
Note: The tonnage and total ounces of gold were determined from the statistical block model. Average grades were calculated from the tonnage and total ounces and then rounded to the significant digits shown. Calculations based on this table may differ due to the effect of rounding. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
On November 15, 2011, we announced completion of a Feasibility Study for the Pan project. Mineral Reserves were based upon a design pit using Lerchs Grossmann generated pit surfaces that maximize revenue based on a U.S.$1,200 per ounce three-year trailing average price of gold. Cutoff grades of 0.21 gpt in the South pit and 0.27 gpt in the North & Central pits produced the project’s highest NPV. “NI 43-101 Technical Report Feasibility Study for the Pan project, White Pine County, Nevada, dated November 15, 2011,” which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. The Feasibility Study was prepared by Guastavson Associates LLC, to the standards of National Instrument 43-101 and was filed on SEDAR on December 21, 2011. An updated report “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report, Feasibility Study for the Pan project, White Pine County, Nevada” dated November 29, 2012 was filed to clarify responsibilities of the Qualified Persons. This updated report made no changes to the Feasibility Study numbers.

Note: The tonnage and total ounces of gold were determined from the statistical block model. Average grades were calculated from the tonnage and total ounces and then rounded to the significant digits shown. Calculations based on this table may differ due to the effect of rounding. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
We believe that there is no material difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed above under our NI 43-101 Feasibility Study and those disclosable under SEC Industry Guide 7, and therefore no reconciliation is provided. Since the Pan project has known reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 and has received its Record of Decision, the project is considered by us to be in the development stage. As of December 31, 2014, construction of the Pan Mine is approximately 83% complete.
Mining and Production
The Pan gold deposit contains near-surface mineralization that can be extracted using conventional open pit mining methods. Results from mineral extraction tests indicate that the ore can be processed by conventional heap leaching methods. Ore from the South Pan pit will be processed run of mine (“ROM”), while ore from the North Pan pit ores will be crushed before being placed on the leach pad. Pregnant solutions from leaching both South and North Pan ores will be treated in an adsorption/desorption recovery (ADR) plant.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized into property, equipment and mine development $74,675,623 and $8,454,762 of Pan expenditures, respectively. The 2014 costs were primarily related to the construction of the Pan Mine and its operating assets. There were some additional costs for permitting, mitigation, engineering, site characterization, metallurgy, mine planning, and detailed design. For a more detailed discussion of the Pan Mine’s production data, see Part II - Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we incurred exploration expenditures of $133,387, $2,151,355 and $1,415,189 at the Pan project, respectively. These expenditures were primarily for salaries and labor, which were 64%, 71% and 62% of mineral exploration expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Geology
The Pan project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit on the prolific Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend in Nevada. It is an oxide deposit exposed on the surface. Host rocks are Devonian-Mississippian marine siltstone and limestone of the Pilot Formation and the Devils Gate Formation. Breccias developed along the Pan fault are the primary host of gold mineralization. Argillic alteration and silicification are the dominant alteration types associated with gold. At North Pan, gold mineralization is primarily hosted by silicified breccia in the Pilot Formation. At South Pan, gold occurs primarily in argillic altered breccia in the Devils Gate Formation. Gold occurs as stratabound mineralization outside of the breccias particularly in the Wendy zone adjacent to South Pan.
			
		
Exploration and Development
The Pan mineralization was discovered in 1978 and over 860 holes have been drilled by 10 different exploration companies. These include: Amselco, Hecla, Echo Bay, Alta Gold, Pan Nevada Gold, and a number of other junior exploration companies.
In November 2011 we announced completion of a Feasibility Study showing strong economics for the Pan project. The Feasibility Study showed net present value of the project to be robust at a range of gold prices, increasing from U.S.$123 million at U.S.$1,200/oz gold to $344M at U.S.$1,900/oz gold. The internal rate of return grows from 32% to 79% using the same range of gold prices. Both use a 5% discount rate and are after tax figures. According to the 2011 Feasibility Study, the capital costs to build the mine are estimated to be U.S.$99M which includes U.S.$8.2M working capital and a U.S.$6.8M contingency. The operating cash cost was projected to be U.S.$585/oz which includes royalties, state taxes, and a 5% contingency. The total production cost including capital was projected to be U.S.$824/oz. For further information on this project, please see the report entitled “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report Feasibility Study for the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada”, dated November 29, 2012, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. The Feasibility study was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC, to the standards of National Instrument 43-101 and was originally filed on SEDAR on December 21, 2011.
A detailed discussion regarding Sampling, Analysis and Security of Samples is included within the Feasibility Study which is available under our profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
During 2013, a trial blast provided material for large column tests to evaluate the potential for ROM leaching at South Pan. Test results showed that ROM is a viable option at South Pan. The NEPA permitting process was completed with a Record of Decision for the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued on Dec 20, 2013. We also received confirmation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no “waters of the U.S.” are present at the project that would fall under the jurisdiction of Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. We received our Water Pollution Control Permit and our Air Quality Operating Permits to Construct.
During 2014, we commenced construction with an official groundbreaking ceremony on January 14, 2014 and have worked towards transitioning the Pan Mine from a development property to an operating property. Ledcor, our contract miner, began production activities during Q3 of 2014 through stacking of ore on the leach pad. Haul roads were constructed and are currently in use running to the leach pad and waste piles. Installation of liner in the barren pond and pregnant pond are completed with the remainder of the processing systems to be completed and operating during Q1 of 2015. To date we have incurred total costs of $90,504,152 (includes all capital spending on construction of the Pan Mine, permitting, drilling and other capitalized development costs) relating to the development of the Pan project.
The Pan project has known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is developmental in nature. With mining operations commencing during September of 2014 and production expected within the near term of the date of this report, we anticipate to be a production company during Q1 of 2015.
Gold Rock Project
Gold Rock is a sediment-hosted gold deposit located along the prolific Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend situated in the eastern Pancake Range in western White Pine County, Nevada, 8 miles southeast from the Pan project. Access is via the Green Springs road from US Highway 50 approximately 45 miles from Ely, Nevada. Water for exploration purposes is available from an existing well in the region under temporary grant of water rights. It is anticipated that power will be available from the line being extended to serve the nearby Pan project. The property includes the Easy Junior Mine, which reportedly produced approximately 2.9 million tons at a grade of 0.026 opt for 74,945 ounces of gold by 1994. Additional drilling was completed in 2013 to expand the resource. Surface work was completed to identify additional exploration targets on the property.
Title
We have controlled the property since April 13, 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode and placer mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. We acquired our interest in the March 20, 2006 mineral lease agreement with NRC as a result of our acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5 of each year we must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of U.S.$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 108.05 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing price for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. On January 2, 2014 we paid $152,616 (U.S.$143,490) and on January 2, 2015 we paid $162,449 (U.S.$138,514) in respect of our obligations under this agreement. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. We must incur a minimum of U.S.$75,000 annual work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease.
			
		
We have entered into or acquired four additional agreements for claims adjacent to and contiguous with the NRC claims:
·
On January 2, 2014, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of $71,768 (U.S.$67,476) to Anchor Minerals, Inc. to maintain its mineral lease for 80 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner holds a 3.5% gross production royalty. On January 2, 2015 we paid $79,136 (U.S.$67,476).
·
On January 2, 2014, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of $63,816 (U.S.$60,000) to Brian Peart to maintain our option to purchase 13 unpatented lode and placer mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$5,000,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Peart holds a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2 and 6% from commercial production on these claims. On January 7, 2015 we paid $71,106 (U.S.$60,000).
·
On January 22, 2014, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of $10,256 (U.S.$9,250) to Jerry Pankow to maintain our option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$775,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Pankow holds a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2 and 5% from commercial production on these claims. On January 14, 2015 we paid $11,061 (U.S.$9,250).
·
On January 23, 2014, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of $16,649 (U.S.$15,000) to Ronald Jordan to maintain our option to purchase 13 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$2,500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Jordan holds a 2.5% NSR from commercial production on these claims. The assignor of this lease agreement to us also holds a 0.5% NSR royalty. On January 14, 2015 we paid $17,937 (U.S.$15,000).
Over the years we have staked additional claims outright adjacent to and contiguous with the Gold Rock property, which are outside of any area of interest.
We hold 549 unpatented lode claims and 8 mill-site claims. Additionally, we lease 444 unpatented lode and 2 placer claims. These 1,003 claims constitute our Gold Rock property which covers an approximate area of 19,188 acres. The leased unpatented and placer claims are held with Anchor Minerals (expire 1/15/2017), Brian Peart (expire 1/14/2023), Nevada Royalty Corp (expire 3/20/2016) and Jerry Pankow (placer claims, expire 2/13/2023). These claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. DOI, BLM and White Pine County, Nevada. To maintain all of the mining claims we must pay annual maintenance fees to the BLM and White Pine County, Nevada. We have additional obligations to the lessors of the leased 446 mining claims which include making scheduled advance royalty payments. The leased portions of the Gold Rock Mine are subject to production royalties. These various royalties consist of 3% Net Smelter Returns, 2%-5% Net Smelter Returns, 2%-6% Net Smelter Returns, 3.5% gross revenues, or 2.5%-4% gross sales.
Geology
Gold Rock is a sediment-hosted gold system in highly prospective host rocks within a 20 square mile land position along the Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend. Gold was mined at the Easy Junior pit from siltstone and limestone of the Joanna and Chainman Formations. Additional gold anomalies occur in the Pilot and Devils Gate Formations, the same host rocks as found at the nearby Pan project. These potential host rocks are exposed along 6 miles of strike length and may have been repeated by east verging thrust faulting. Exposures in the Easy Junior pit show mineralization associated with the crest of a tight anticline cut by a high angle reverse fault. Gold is associated with silicification and argillic alteration of the host rocks along the structure. Historic drill data and geologic mapping suggests additional folds and thrust faulting around and along strike of the pit.
Exploration
The Easy Junior Mine, in the center of the Gold Rock property, reportedly produced 2.9 million tons of 0.026 opt gold (74,945 ounces gold contained) during operations by Alta Gold and the Alta Bay joint venture (Alta Gold-Echo Bay). The mine was shut down in 1994. A historic database of 794 holes containing 269,446 feet of drilling was acquired in 2008. Analysis of this drill data by us outlined a gold zone in the walls of the pit and along a strike extending south into the Decker Flat area. The gold zone is defined by 300 holes and extends for 9,200 feet along the strike of the Easy Junior anticline. This zone appears to be oxide, above the water table, and open in all directions.
Our exploration work has included drilling, data compilation and surface exploration. Data compilation has included historic drill hole data, rock and soil geochemical data, geologic mapping, and geophysical surveys generated by previous exploration companies. We have generated new geology and alteration mapping and additional rock and soil sampling. A gravity survey was conducted over the property position.
			
		
An independent engineer, Global Resource Engineering, reviewed all drilling results from 2012 and 2013 to provide a new resource update originally dated May 29, 2014 with an amended report date of January 8, 2015, entitled “Amended NI 43-101 Technical Report Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Gold Rock Project, White Pine County, Nevada” (the “Amended Gold Rock Report”). The Amended Gold Rock Report shows a 65% increase in measured, indicated resources and a 62% increase in inferred resources from the “NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources, Gold Rock Project, White Pine County, Nevada” prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC and dated April 10, 2012 (which report was updated on November 29, 2012 to clarify language regarding capping, density, and cut-off values). The Amended Gold Rock Report was prepared and filed in order to address inconsistencies between the previously filed report and the Company’s news release dated May 28, 2014.
The resource includes results from 785 drill holes and extends for over 8,000 feet north and south from the historic Easy Junior open pit gold mine. The mineral resource estimate, summarized in the table below, can be found in the Amended Gold Rock Report under our profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
A detailed discussion regarding Sampling, Analysis and Security of Samples is included within the Amended Gold Rock Report which is available under our profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
* - Inferred mineral resources are estimated pursuant to Canadian industry standards. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
All baseline studies were completed and a Plan of Operations (“PoO”) was developed and submitted to the BLM and has been declared complete. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (“DEIS”) was made available for public comment as published by the BLM in the federal register on February 13, 2015. The DEIS provides an analysis of environmental, social and economic impacts of the proposed mine plan and possible alternatives. Exploration permit approval has been received for an expanded drill plan that will allow both in-fill and step-out drilling.
During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred exploration expenditures of $1,861,905, $2,616,384 and $3,815,606, respectively. During 2012 and 2013, these costs primarily related to reverse circulation and diamond drilling as well as ongoing permitting efforts and salaries and labor associated with these activities. During 2014, the costs were primarily ongoing permitting efforts and the associated salaries of those efforts.
While the Gold Rock project has defined resources, insufficient information is available to support reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7. Additional exploration work is planned for the property to support a reserve estimate.
Spring Valley Project
Spring Valley is a diatreme/porphyry hosted gold system covered by gravel. Gold has been intercepted over an area 5,200 feet long by 3,500 feet wide that extended to a depth of 1,400 feet, suggesting the presence of a large mineral system. The Spring Valley project is under an exploration and option to joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Exploration Inc. Barrick funded 100% of the costs to earn an interest in this project. Barrick has completed the expenditure requirement of $38 million to earn a 70% interest in the Spring Valley project.
			
		
Location, Means of Access and State of Property
The Spring Valley property is located in the Spring Valley Mining District, Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 20 miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The property is accessed from Nevada State Highway 50, which extends eastward from US Interstate 80 and is paved to the Rochester turn-off; thereafter it is a dirt road. Water for exploration purposes is available from water wells drilled on the property under temporary grant of water rights. A new power line will be required to supply power to the property. There is an existing 345 kv power line, but additional costs would be required to relocate the line.
Agreement with Barrick Gold
On March 9, 2009, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Midway Gold US Inc. (“MGUS”), executed an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement, effective March 9, 2009 (the “EDM Agreement”), with Barrick, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, regarding the exploration, development and possible joint venture of our Spring Valley Project.
Exploration Period
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, MGUS granted to Barrick the exclusive right to explore and develop the Spring Valley Project. During this exploration period, Barrick had the exclusive right to earn a 60% interest in the Spring Valley Project by spending U.S.$30.0 million on the property over a five-year period ending December 31, 2013. During this five-year period Barrick had the sole right to determine the nature, scope, extent and method of all operations in relation to the property, without having to consult or gain our approval. Barrick was required to provide us with certain information and reports and access to the Spring Valley Project to conduct inspections of operations during this period.
After vesting at 60%, Barrick increased its interest by 10% (to 70% total) by spending an additional U.S.$8.0 million. We have elected to allow Barrick to earn an additional 5% (75% total) by carrying us to production and arranging financing for our share of mine development capital expenses. The cost that Barrick incurs from carrying us to commercial production will be recouped by Barrick, plus interest from project cash flows once production has been established.
To date, Barrick has conducted and reported funding exploration totaling U.S.$55.5 million. In 2014 and 2013, Barrick reported spending of U.S.$17.5 million and U.S.$11.0 million, respectively.
Joint Venture
We exercised our option to enter into a joint venture with Barrick as of February 23, 2014. With the formation of the joint venture with Barrick, initial capital accounts will be established in accordance with Barrick’s earned interest in the Spring Valley Project and Barrick will be the manager of the joint venture. During 2014, we conveyed a 70% interest in the property to Barrick subject to the terms of the Joint Venture and elected to allow Barrick to carry us to production and arrange financing for our share of development costs. At which point, we will convey an additional 5% interest in the property to Barrick and retain a 25% minority interest.
The EDM Agreement also provides for the adjustment of a party’s participating interest in the joint venture upon default in making agreed-upon contributions to adopted programs and budgets or upon contributing less to a program and budget than a percentage equal to the party’s participating interest.
Under the EDM Agreement, a party’s whose recalculated participating interest is reduced below 10% shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and shall relinquish its entire participating interest. Such relinquished participating interest shall be deemed to have accrued automatically to the other party. The reduced party shall have the right to receive 10% of net proceeds, if any, to a maximum amount of 75% percent of the reduced party’s equity account balance as of the effective date of the withdrawal. Upon receipt of such amount, the reduced party shall thereafter have no further right, title, or interest in the Spring Valley Project or under the EDM Agreement. If our interest becomes less than 10%, we shall be deemed to have reserved a NSR Royalty of 2%.
			
		
Title
We have held the property since 2003 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. In 2014 we conveyed a 70% interest, under the terms of the Joint Venture to the Joint Venture. Unpatented mining claims are kept active through payment of a maintenance fee due to the BLM and each county the claims are located in on August 31st of each year. Certain areas of the Spring Valley project are subject to NSR royalties ranging from 1% to 7% on different claim groups within the project package.
The Spring Valley property is constituted of 601 unpatented lode claims, 41 placer claims, and parcels of private property. The total acreage covered by mining claims is approximately 10,304 acres and private property is approximately 2,002 acres. All combined, Spring Valley covers approximately 12,306 acres. The mining claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management and Pershing County, Nevada. To maintain all of the mining claims the joint venture must pay annual maintenance fees to the BLM and Pershing County, Nevada. Additionally, there are scheduled advance royalty and option payments to the owners of certain mining claims and private property. Portions of the Spring Valley property are subject to a production royalty of 2%, 3%, or a sliding scale of 2% to 7% Net Smelter Returns..
In 2014, Barrick, on behalf of our Company, paid the following lease payments or fulfilled work commitments to maintain certain mineral leases and options for the Spring Valley project:
·
On April 25, 2014, Barrick paid our annual payment of U.S.$36,000 to Lamonte J. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 12 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner retained a 3% NSR royalty. Alternatively, we can purchase these claims for U.S.$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
During 2014, Barrick paid on the tenth day of each month on our behalf U.S.$1,000 option payment totaling U.S.$12,000 to George D. Duffy, MS Duffy Mine Properties LLC and the Estate of Margaret Suverkoop Duffy. Additionally, on June 1, 2014 Barrick paid on our behalf U.S.$150,000 to George D. Duffy Jr. as a Periodic One-Time Payment to maintain its option to purchase two unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
On July 16, 2014, Barrick paid our annual payment of U.S.$20,000 to Dave Rowe and Randall Stoeberl to maintain its option to purchase 97 unpatented mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Rowe and Mr. Stoeberl retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
·
On October 30, 2014, Barrick paid our annual payment of U.S.$6,000 to Dale and Diana Chabino to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for U.S.$100,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Chabino and Mrs. Chabino retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
·
In 2011, Barrick acquired a sub-lease and option agreement with Newmont Mining Company for mineral rights underlying certain surface rights acquired by the Company in 2006, which would become part of the Spring Valley joint venture between us and Barrick. The agreement requires Barrick to spend a cumulative amount of U.S.$2,000,000 in work expenditures on the ground leased over a period of six years, and to make advance royalty payments in the amount of U.S.$100,000 per year thereafter, up to a cap of U.S.$2,500,000. The advance royalty payments may be credited against a 3% NSR royalty payable from production on the area of ground leased. Barrick has maintained the sub-lease and option agreement and is in good standing as of December 31, 2014.
Over the years, we have staked additional claims and purchased rights to additional claims outright within and adjacent to the Spring Valley property.
Geology
The Spring Valley gold deposit is hosted in Permo-Triassic Koipato Group rocks made up of rhyolite flows, breccias, and volcaniclastic sediments. These volcanics were intruded by fine grained feldspar porphyry. Hydrothermal alteration includes quartz-sericite + pyrite alteration associated with gold, argillic alteration in hydrothermal breccias, and lesser secondary potassium feldspar, iron carbonate, and hematite-quartz alteration. Gold mineralization occurs in sheeted quartz veins, hydrothermal breccias, and open fractures. The gold is distributed along the top of the intrusion, and in overlying volcanic rocks, commonly at stratigraphic contacts, fracture zones, and in the remains of a diatreme breccia. Gold is found as grains of free gold up to 3 mm across, and has been observed along the edges of sulfide grains, indicating gold deposition is later than the sulfides. Relatively coarse gold is common and can be observed as free gold liberated by drilling.
			
		
Exploration
During 2014, Barrick reported drilling of 98,828 feet in 13 reverse circulation holes and 73 core holes. One reverse circulation drill rig and two core drill rigs were used during 2014. The 2014 drilling program emphasized in-pit infill drilling to convert inferred resources to an indicated resource status. Further, prefeasibility study and work for the plan of operations submittal began in April 2014 with scheduled completion in 2016.
During 2013, Barrick reported drilling of 39,357 feet in 24 reverse circulation holes and, 29,003 feet in 26 core holes. The 2013 drilling program was completed with two reverse circulation rigs and two core rigs. Barrick also reported continuing work on hydrology, biological baseline, initial site engineering, pit slope geotechnical, and initiated additional metallurgical testing.
During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred exploration expenditures of $249,604, $105,328 and $141,909, respectively. The work performed during 2014 was primarily related to engineering consultants for the resource estimate announced in September 2014. During 2013, the costs were similar in nature to 2014 expenditures.

Tonopah Project
Tonopah is a high-grade epithermal quartz-gold vein system, on the Round Mountain - Goldfield gold trend. A core drilling program was conducted at Tonopah during 2012 to define the true width and continuity of gold grade in veins and wall rock. A total of 13,000 feet was drilled in 26 holes to test areas of the Discovery, 121, Dauntless, and 63-77 areas. No drilling has been performed during 2013 or 2014.
Location and Means of Access
The Tonopah property is located in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles northeast of the town of Tonopah, 210 miles northwest of Las Vegas and 236 miles southeast of Reno. The property is over the northeastern flank of the San Antonio Mountains and in the Ralston Valley. Water for exploration purposes is available from water wells drilled on the property under a temporary grant of water rights. Power is accessible from existing power lines crossing the property, however capacity is unknown and may be limited.
			
		
Title
We have controlled the property since 2001. Through a series of agreements, amendments and payments we acquired a 100% interest in the Tonopah property subject to a sliding scale on an NSR royalty from any commercial production of between 2% to 7%, based on changes in gold prices, and we must pay an advance minimum royalty, recoverable from commercial production, of U.S.$300,000 per year, payable on August 15.
In addition, the surface rights to 560 acres in Section 32 are held by the Town of Tonopah. The remaining 80 acres of surface rights in Section 32 are held as two 40-acre parcels by two owners. We hold federal mineral rights for the entirety of Section 32 in unpatented claims.
We hold 444 unpatented lode claims which constitute our Tonopah property. The claims encompass an area of approximately 8,769 acres. These claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management and Nye County, Nevada. To maintain all of the mining claims we must pay annual maintenance fees to the BLM and Nye County, Nevada. We have additional obligations in the form of annual option payments. A portion of the Tonopah property is subject to a royalty on a sliding scale of 2% to 7% Net Smelter Returns.
Geology
The Tonopah project is located at the intersection of the Round Mountain/Goldfield gold trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Host rocks are Ordovician black argillite of the Palmetto Formation and unconformably overlying Tertiary rhyolitic volcanics. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization.
Exploration
Veins in the Discovery zone were discovered by Kennecott Utah Copper in 1992. Prior to this the property was explored by Houston Oil and Minerals, Coeur d’Alene Mines, and Rio Algom. Tombstone Exploration and Golconda Resources explored the property after Kennecott Utah Copper.
In 2011, an initial resource estimate was completed on select veins of the Discovery and Dauntless zones. In April, 2011 a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was completed by Gustavson Associates, LLC to evaluate a limited number of vein-like structures primarily in the Discovery Zone. Mineralization was modeled using Indicator Kriging to analyze zones of potential high grade mineralization. This indicator model was calibrated by comparison with veins modeled on cross sections, and appears to have identified higher grade areas with continuous gold mineralization that could possibly be mined by underground methods.

The report was prepared by William J. Crowl, Donald E. Hulse, Donald J. Baker, and Terre A. Lane, under the supervision of Gustavson who are “independent” and "qualified persons" as defined under NI 43-101. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion regarding Sampling and Analysis and Security of Analysis, please see the report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Midway Project, Nye County, Nevada" dated effective April 1, 2011, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com.
Following the resource estimate, core drilling was conducted at Tonopah to define the true width and continuity of gold grade in veins and wall rock. A total of 13,000 feet was drilled in 26 holes to test areas of the Discovery, 121, Dauntless, and 63-77 areas. Initial assay results indicated some high grade intercepts including 1.3 feet of 9.768 ounces per ton (opt) gold and 5 feet of 2.287 opt gold within a zone of 150 feet of 0.224 opt gold in drill hole MW11-09c as well as lower grade intercepts including 145 feet of 0.033 opt gold in MW11-06c. See our press release dated December 8, 2011 for full results.
In 2012, modeling of the veins was continued based on the 2011 drill results.
			
		
No drilling was done in 2013 or 2014 as the Company focused its efforts at the Pan and Gold Rock projects.
For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred exploration expenditures of $112,273, $84,814 and $232,880. The costs for all three years were primarily for land holding fees and salary expense.
The Tonopah project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and future work on the property is exploratory in nature.
Other Nevada Properties
Our Pinyon project is an exploration project that we do not consider to be a material property at this time. We abandoned the Thunder Mountain property in fiscal year 2013. These projects are without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7.
Pinyon
Pinyon is a disseminated gold target near the Gold Rock and Pan projects. Exposed mineralization is hosted in similar rock types with similar alteration as seen at Pan and Gold Rock. A portion of the claims were acquired in 2012 as part of an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement with Aurion Resources, which is subject to a Joint Venture agreement. Additional claims were staked in the surrounding area. The Pinyon property is located in White Pine County, Nevada approximately 20 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. It is 10 miles north of the Gold Rock project and 6 miles east of the Pan project. Access is by 5 miles of dirt road running south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Water is available from wells that supply the Pan project. Power is expected to be available from the Pan project.
We entered into an earn-in agreement with Aurion Resources (“Aurion”) in November 2012 for claims. We can earn up to a 70% interest in the Pinyon property through the earn-in agreement and can also earn an additional 5% (75% total) by arranging mine financing. In fulfillment of obligations under the earn-in agreement, on January 2, 2014 we paid $73,202 (U.S.$68,824) and on December 31, 2014, we paid $99,306 (U.S.$85,601) related to 2015 obligations.
Washington Property
The map below shows the location of our property located in Washington, USA. This property is described in further detail below.
Golden Eagle Project
Golden Eagle is a volcanic hosted, epithermal gold system with disseminated gold in quartz veins and extensive breccia bodies. Previous operators defined a large area of gold mineralization on the property. Metallurgical issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting continue to be assessed.
			
		
Location and Means of Access
The Golden Eagle property is located on private land in the Eureka (Republic) mining district in Ferry County, Washington. The property is two miles northwest of the town of Republic, Washington and is accessed by the Knob Hill county road. Power is available at the nearby (< 1 mile) Knob Hill Mine. Water availability has not yet been determined.
Title
On August 1, 2008, we issued 600,000 common shares at U.S.$2.50 per common share for proceeds of U.S.$1,500,000 by way of a private placement to Kinross Gold USA Inc. (“Kinross”) and concurrently purchased a 75% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Kinross at a cost of U.S.$1,500,000 ($1,537,950). We then purchased a 25% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Hecla Limited at a cost of U.S.$483,333 ($500,200). Kinross retained a 2% net smelter returns royalty and was granted a first right of refusal to toll mill ore from the Golden Eagle property at their Kettle River Mill. We completed the acquisition of the Golden Eagle property through a wholly-owned subsidiary created to hold the property.
In the year ended December 31, 2009, we staked additional claims and purchased two additional blocks of land at a cost of $177,393 to expand our Golden Eagle land property package.
Our land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 339.3 acres containing federal lode mining claims and patented lode mining claim and fee properties.
The Golden Eagle property consists of three unpatented lode claims and parcels of private property. Mining claims and private property together cover approximately 338 acres. The mining claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior, BLM and Ferry County, Washington. To maintain all of the mining claims we must pay annual maintenance fees to the BLM and Ferry County, Washington. Portions of the Golden Eagle property are subject to a production royalty of 2% or 2.75% Net Smelter Returns.
Mineral Resources
On June 25, 2009, we announced an indicated mineral resource estimate of 31,400,000 tons at a grade of 0.055 opt containing 1,744,000 ounces of gold based on drilling by previous operators. There is an additional inferred mineral resource estimate of 5,100,000 tons at a grade of 0.038 opt containing 192,000 ounces of gold. Both estimates are reported at a cutoff grade of 0.02 opt gold and constrained within a Lerchs-Grossman pit shell using a $750 per ounce gold price and 85% gold recovery. The estimated metal content does not include consideration of any other mining, mineral processing, or metallurgical recoveries. The most likely cut-off grade for this deposit is not known at this time and must be confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Mineral reserves have not been estimated. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion of Sampling and Analysis as well as Security of Samples, please see the report entitled "Golden Eagle Project, Washington State, USA, Technical Report", prepared by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, an independent company, dated effective July, 2009, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
Geology
The Golden Eagle project is a volcanic hosted, epithermal gold system with gold in quartz veins and disseminated in extensive breccia bodies. The host rocks are andesite flows and volcaniclastics of the Eocene age Sanpoil Formation along the western margin of the Republic Graben. Gold occurs primarily in silicified and argillized hydrothermal breccia that is 2,500 feet long and 1,000 feet wide. The gold zone trends roughly east-west. It is exposed at the surface at the historic Mountain Lion mine to the west and plunges to the northeast. Locally the breccia is cut by quartz veins carrying higher grades of gold. Gold and silver mineralization is often found in solid solution with sulfide minerals and is considered refractory. Historical underground mining extracted gold and silver rich quartz veins adjacent to and beneath Golden Eagle.
Exploration
Exploration was conducted on the property from 1940 to 2000 by Knob Hill Mining, Day Mines Inc., Hecla Mining Company, Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation, and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. Hecla and Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation defined a large gold resource on the property and conducted pre-feasibility studies including numerous metallurgical tests. After Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation was acquired by Newmont Mining Company, the property was traded to Echo Bay Mines Ltd. during a time of low gold prices. Kinross acquired Echo Bay and focused their efforts elsewhere.
			
		
In 2008, we acquired the Golden Eagle project and began compiling and reviewing the historic database of 835 drill holes containing 165,775 feet most of which was core drilling. Many of the older shallow holes could not be verified, leaving 126,591 feet in 164 holes that could be verified for use in creating a new resource model. Dr Thom Seal was contracted to review the numerous metallurgical reports and summarize the results for us. Our geologists mapped the historic pits and sampled pit walls and dumps.
In 2011, we commissioned a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the economics of different mining options at current higher gold prices. Issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting continue to be assessed.
No work has been performed on the project since 2011 as the focus of our efforts has been the Pan and Gold Rock projects.
The Golden Eagle project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and furture work for the property is exploratory in nature.
Office Facilities
We currently lease approximately 12,000 square feet. Monthly rent payments under this lease, including parking and operating expenses, average approximately U.S.$23,000 per month for fiscal years 2015 through 2020 when the lease expires. We entered into a sub-lease for 3,627 square feet of our office space, which runs through July of 2019. The average monthly rent received under the sublease agreement is approximately U.S$6,900 per month. We executed a second sub-lease in February of 2015 for approximately 4,300 square feet of our office space, which runs through August of 2020. The average monthly rent received under the sublease agreement is approximately U.S$7,800 per month. We believe the remaining space is adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that substitute space would be readily available, if needed.
