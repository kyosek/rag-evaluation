PROPERTIES
General
During 2003, the Company’s production averaged 274.0 MMcfe per day, of which 191.2 MMcfe per day or 70% was attributed to the Wattenberg Field of Colorado’s D-J Basin. Accordingly, the Company’s proved reserves at December 31, 2003 were concentrated primarily in Wattenberg. The Company also has proven reserves associated with its Elysium acquisition made in late 2000, and the Le Norman, Bravo, LNP, and Cordillera acquisitions made in 2002 and 2003 which comprise the Company’s Mid Continent assets. The following table sets forth summary information with respect to estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2003.
(a) Pre-tax Present Value 10% does not include the effects of future income taxes or future plugging and abandonment costs, as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows more fully described in Note (13) Unaudited Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information to the financial statements.
The following table sets forth summary information with respect to oil and natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Wattenberg
The Company’s reserves are primarily concentrated in the Wattenberg Field, which is located in the D-J Basin of north central Colorado. Discovered in 1970, the field is located approximately 35 miles northeast of Denver and stretches over portions of Adams, Boulder, Broomfield and Weld counties. One of the most attractive features of Wattenberg is the presence of multiple productive formations. In a section only 4,500 feet thick, there are up to eight potentially productive formations. Three of the formations, the Codell, Niobrara and J-Sand, are considered “blanket” zones in the area of the Company’s holdings, while others, such as the D-Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman, are more localized. While these zones may be present, any particular property’s productivity is dependent on the reservoir properties peculiar to its location. Such productivity may be uneconomic.
Drilling in Wattenberg is considered low risk from the perspective of finding oil and gas reserves, with better than 98% of the wells drilled encountering sufficient quantities of reserves to be completed as economic producers. In May 1998, the COGCC adopted new spacing rules for the Wattenberg Field that greatly enhanced the Company’s ability to more efficiently develop its properties. The rule also eliminated costly and time-consuming procedures required for certain development activities. All formations in Wattenberg can now be drilled, produced and commingled from any or all of ten “potential drilling locations” on a 320 acre parcel.
In 2003, development expenditures in Wattenberg totaled $92.1 million. The Company’s current Wattenberg activities are primarily focused on the development of J-Sand reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores and refracing or trifracing existing Codell wells. A refrac consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. These projects and continued success with the production enhancement program allowed the Company to increase its production and to add proved reserves in 2003 in what is considered a mature field.
During 2003, the Company drilled or deepened 39 wells to the J-Sand formation in Wattenberg. The cost of drilling and completing a J-Sand well approximates $350,000 while a completed deepening within an existing wellbore costs roughly $225,000. The reserves associated with a typical J-Sand well are more prolific than those of a Codell/Niobrara, with over 95% of such per well reserves comprised of natural gas. Consequently, the economics of a J-Sand project are more dependent on gas prices. At December 31, 2003, the Company had over 270 proven J-Sand drilling locations or deepening projects in inventory. The Company plans to drill or deepen approximately 37 wells to the J-Sand in 2004.
The Company performed 433 refracs in Wattenberg during 2003. The refrac program continues to be focused primarily on the Codell formation. A typical refrac costs approximately $140,000. At December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 1,100 proven refrac projects. The Company plans to perform approximately 450 refrac projects in 2004.
The Company performed 51 trifracs in Wattenberg during 2003. The trifrac program, which is effectively a refrac of a refrac, was initiated in 2003 with encouraging results. A typical trifrac costs approximately $130,000. The Company is in the early stages of evaluating the trifrac program and expects to perform approximately 50 trifracs in 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company had over 200 proven trifrac projects in inventory.
The Company also performed 14 recompletions and drilled 41 Codell wells in the D-J Basin in 2003. The Company had an additional 600 Codell / J-Sand / Sussex proven recompletion opportunities and over 600 Codell new drill opportunities at December 31, 2003. During 2003, numerous well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones were performed. These projects, combined with the new drills, deepenings and refracs, were an integral part of the 2003 capital development program and helped fuel the 44% increase in the Company’s production over the prior year. The Company estimates it had over 700 of these minor projects in inventory at year-end 2003.
At December 31, 2003, the Company had working interests in approximately 3,300 gross (3,140 net) producing oil and gas wells in the D-J Basin with estimated proved reserves of 811.0 Bcfe, including 36.4 million barrels of oil and 592.5 Bcf of gas. Daily production from these properties averaged 191,201 Mcfe, comprised of 7,797 barrels and 144,423 Mcf per day in 2003. Based on a capital of $210.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $110.0 million in Wattenberg in 2004.
Mid Continent
In November 2002, Patina acquired the stock of Le Norman Energy Corporation for $62.0 million and the issuance of 513,200 shares of the Company’s common stock. Le Norman’s properties are located primarily in the Anadarko and Ardmore-Marietta Basins of Oklahoma. The Le Norman properties primarily produce oil. At the date of the acquisition, Le Norman held a 30% interest in an affiliated entity, Le Norman Partners (“LNP”). In December 2002, Patina acquired the stock of Bravo Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for $119.0 million. Bravo’s properties are primarily located in Hemphill County, Texas and Custer and Caddo Counties of western Oklahoma, within the Anadarko Basin. The Bravo properties primarily produce natural gas. In March 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 70% interest in LNP for $39.7 million. LNP’s properties are located in Stephens, Garvin, and Carter Counties of Southern Oklahoma and produce primarily oil. In October 2003, the Company acquired Cordillera Energy Partners, LLC (“Cordillera”) for $243.0 million, comprised of $239.0 million and the issuance of five year warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Patina common stock for $22.50 per share. The Cordillera properties are primarily located in the Mid Continent, the San Juan Basin, and the Permian Basin, and primarily produce natural gas. Together the Le Norman, Bravo, LNP, and certain Cordillera properties comprise the Company’s Mid Continent assets.
The Loco Field is comprised of fourteen contiguous sections located in Stephens and Jefferson Counties, Oklahoma. The Field was discovered in 1913, producing from shallow oil formations at depths ranging from 60 feet to 1,300 feet. Secondary recovery operations were implemented in the Field beginning with the unitization of the Loco Unit in 1956. The sediments draped over this anticline include productive intervals on more than twenty lenticular sandstone intervals. Based on the average net pay of other completed wells in the area, a typical infill well will encounter in excess of 100 feet of net productive pay, although not necessarily assured on a single well basis. The Company acquired interests in the Field as part of the Le Norman acquisition. The Company drilled 76 wells in the Field in 2003 with plans to drill approximately 40 wells in 2004. Simultaneously, an expansion of the secondary recovery operations is underway with the installation of new injection facilities at the central tank batteries, along with the conversion of numerous producers to water injectors.
The Santa Fe Field, located in Stephens County, Oklahoma, was discovered in 1917. The Field covers approximately thirteen contiguous sections, targeting shallow oil formations with productive sediments at depths ranging from 100 feet up to 1,200 feet. Certain portions of the Field are under secondary recovery while others remain on primary production. The productive intervals are comprised of over twenty lenticular sands, routinely exhibiting porosities greater than 30% with an average well exhibiting approximately 90 feet of net pay. Interests in the Field were acquired as part of the Le Norman acquisition. The Company also holds various rights to certain deeper horizons in the Field. The Company drilled 39 wells in the Field in 2003 and plans to drill three wells and to continue to evaluate additional exploitation opportunities in the Field in 2004. The Company will continue to optimize and implement secondary recovery operations in the Field where permitted by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
The Company acquired interests in the Buffalo Wallow Field as part of the Bravo acquisition. The Field is located in Hemphill County in the Texas Panhandle. The primary producing horizons, which generally produce natural gas, are comprised of various intervals in the Granite Wash sequence. The productive intervals are comprised of a series of stratigraphically trapped sands with an average gross interval of 700 feet. Based on the average net pay of other completed wells in the area, an average well will contain 100 feet to 250 feet of net pay, although not necessarily assured on a single well basis. The Field is currently being developed on 40 acre spacing. However, the Company believes a portion of the Field could be down spaced to include 20 acre locations. The Company drilled 41 wells in the Field in 2003 and plans to drill approximately 40 wells in 2004.
The Eakly-Weatherford Field is located in western Oklahoma in Caddo and Custer Counties within the Anadarko Basin. Productive intervals include the Skinner, Red Fork, and Morrow producing sands ranging at depths of 10,000 feet to 14,000 feet. The deeper Springer series sands are also productive in the area at depths of approximately 15,000 feet. Interests in the Field were acquired as part of the Bravo acquisition and were increased with the Cordillera acquisition. The Company drilled three wells in the Field in 2003 and plans to drill approximately six wells in the Field during 2004 while continuing its evaluation of the acreage position. Various wells in the Field exhibit productive behind pipe intervals that are expected to eventually be exploited.
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired interests in the Elm Grove Field as part of the Cordillera acquisition. The Field is located within the central part of the Anadarko Basin in Caddo and Blaine Counties of Oklahoma. The two main producing reservoirs in the Field are the Red Fork and Springer Sandstones ranging at depths of 11,000 feet to 13,000 feet. Additionally, the Company is currently evaluating future potential in several horizons in the Field, including the Marchand, Skinner, and Hunton formations. The Company plans to drill approximately four wells in the Field during 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired interests in the South Thomas Field as part of the Cordillera acquisition. The Field is located in Blaine and Custer Counties in western Oklahoma and is primarily comprised of Red Fork production at a depth of approximately 10,600 feet, with additional potential in the deeper Morrow Sandstone. The Company plans to drill two wells in the Field during 2004.
During 2003, development expenditures for the Mid Continent region totaled $57.1 million for the drilling or deepening of 190 wells, eight refracs, and 12 recompletions. At December 31, 2003, estimated proved reserves attributed to the Mid Continent region totaled 461.1 Bcfe, including 30.5 million barrels of oil and 278.4 Bcf of gas. Daily production from these properties averaged 53,718 Mcfe, comprised of 4,067 barrels and 29,316 Mcf per day in 2003. Based on a capital budget of $210.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $70.0 million in the Mid Continent region in 2004.
San Juan
As a result of the Cordillera acquisition in October 2003, the Company established a presence in the San Juan Basin which is located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. The Basin is believed to contain the second largest deposit of natural gas reserves in North America. Within the Basin, gas production has been established across a broad area from multiple Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs and coalbeds occurring at depths ranging from 1,500 feet to 9,000 feet. Most of the gas is produced from the Dakota Sandstone, the Mesaverde Group, the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, and from coals in the Fruitland Formation. The Company’s assets consist of two relatively large consolidated acreage blocks in the northwestern and eastern parts of the Basin, with scattered acreage in the south-central portion, all in New Mexico. In each of these areas, natural gas is being produced from multiple reservoirs within one or more of the main gas producing formations.
The La Plata Field is in the northwestern part of the San Juan Basin and gas production is generally limited to the Mesaverde Group between 4,000 feet and 5,000 feet, and the Dakota Sandstone between 6,600 feet and 7,500 feet. Natural gas production in the Dakota Sandstone occurs across the entire block, whereas the Mesaverde Group gas production is confined mostly to the northeastern two-thirds of the acreage. Future gas production from these formations will come from additional development locations and possible infill drilling. Some coalbed methane is being produced from the Fruitland coals, and additional Fruitland coal development locations are possible within the La Plata acreage block.
The Jicarilla Field is located in the eastern part of the San Juan Basin on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation. Across this acreage block, natural gas is being produced from the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone at 3,900 feet, the Mesaverde Group between 5,500 feet and 6,200 feet, the Gallup Sandstone at 7,300 feet, and the Dakota Sandstone between 8,200 feet and 8,500 feet. Additional development locations and possible infill drilling targeting the main producing reservoirs may add gas reserves to the Jicarilla acreage block.
During 2003, development expenditures for the San Juan Basin totaled $1.3 million. At December 31, 2003, estimated proved reserves attributed to the San Juan Basin totaled 134.0 Bcfe, including 349,000 barrels of oil and 131.9 Bcf of gas. Based on a capital budget of $210.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $15.0 million in the San Juan Basin in 2004 for the drilling of approximately 19 wells.
Central Region and Other
In late 2000, Patina acquired various property interests out of a bankruptcy through Elysium Energy, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company, in which the Company initially held a 50% interest. The Elysium properties primarily produce oil. Elysium sold certain properties in the Lake Washington Field in Louisiana for $30.5 million in March 2001 ($15.25 million net to the Company). In January 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest of the joint venture for $25.8 million, simultaneously divesting the remainder of Lake Washington and all California assets. In late 2003, the Company sold its interests in various Louisiana fields for approximately $8.6 million. At December 31, 2003, the oil and gas properties were located primarily in central Kansas and the Illinois Basin, with minor interests remaining in Louisiana and Texas.
During 2001, the Company accumulated acreage positions in three Rocky Mountain basins and acquired a producing field in West Texas (collectively, “grassroots projects”). The intent was to aggregate prospects with significant reserve potential and long-term development prospects. As the grassroots projects comprise an insignificant portion of the Company’s current production, reserves, and expected future growth, they have become non-strategic to the Company. During late 2003, the Company exchanged its interests in the Wyoming prospect for certain oil and gas properties in Wattenberg and sold its interests in the coalbed methane project in Utah. In early 2004, the Company sold its interests in the West Texas project.
These properties and remaining grassroots project comprise the Company’s “Central Region and Other” areas of operations. During 2003 development expenditures for the Central Region and Other properties totaled $25.6 million for the drilling or deepening of 79 wells and performing 91 recompletions, primarily in the Illinois Basin, Kansas and Texas. Daily production from these properties averaged 26,477 Mcfe, comprised of 3,841 barrels and 3,431 Mcf per day in 2003. At December 31, 2003, estimated proved reserves totaled 109.8 Bcfe, including 14.7 million barrels of oil and 21.5 Bcf of gas. Based on a capital budget of $210.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $15.0 million on these properties in 2004.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated net proved reserves for the three years ended December 31, 2003.
The following table sets forth the estimated pretax future net revenues as of year-end 2003 from the production of proved reserves and the pretax present value discounted at 10% of such revenues, net of estimated future capital costs, including an estimate of $201.3 million of future development costs (comprised of $81.9 of expenditures on proved developed non-producing properties and $119.4 million in expenditures on proved undeveloped properties) in 2004 (in thousands):
(a) The after tax present value discounted at 10% of the proved reserves totaled $1.8 billion at year-end 2003.
At December 31, 2003 the Wattenberg Field represents 58% of the pretax PV10% value and 811.0 Bcfe or 54% of Patina’s proved reserves.
The quantities and values in the preceding tables are based on constant prices in effect at December 31, 2003, which averaged $31.16 per barrel of oil and $5.54 per Mcf of gas. These wellhead average prices were based on year-end NYMEX prices of $32.52 per barrel and $6.19 per MMBtu. Price declines decrease reserve values by lowering the future net revenues attributable to the reserves and reducing the quantities of reserves that are recoverable on an economic basis. Price increases have the opposite effect. A significant decline in the prices of oil and/or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods under current economic conditions. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
Future prices received from production and future production costs will vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be developed within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. There can be no assurance that actual production will equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections.
The present values shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The quantities and values shown in the preceding tables are based on oil and natural gas prices in effect on December 31, 2003. The value of the Company’s assets is in part dependent on the prices the Company receives for oil and natural gas, and a significant decline in the price of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate, and present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties operated by the Company, an allocation of certain overhead charges has been included in operating costs. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things all general and administrative overhead costs and interest expense.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil and gas reserve engineering must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often materially different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
The proved oil and gas reserves and future revenues as of December 31, 2003 were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”). On an annual basis, the Company files the Department of Energy Form EIA-23, “Annual Survey of Oil and Gas Reserves,” as required by operators of domestic oil and gas properties. There are differences between the reserves as reported on Form EIA-23 and reserves as reported herein. Form EIA-23 requires that operators report on total proved developed reserves for operated wells only and that the reserves be reported on a gross operated basis rather than on a net interest basis.
Producing Wells
The following table sets forth the producing wells in which the Company owned a working interest at December 31, 2003. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
The Company had 215 wells (207 net) in Wattenberg, 889 wells (655 net) in the Mid Continent region, two wells (two net) in the San Juan Basin, and 938 wells (845 net) in the Central Region and Other areas that were shut-in at December 31, 2003. The Company’s average working interest in the Wattenberg wells was approximately 95%, the average working interest in the Mid Continent wells was approximately 48%, and the average working interest in the San Juan wells was 74%. As of December 31, 2003, the Company operated approximately 5,800 gross (5,500 net) producing wells.
Drilling Results
The following table sets forth the number of wells drilled or deepened by the Company during the past three years. During 2001, the Company drilled or deepened 68 development wells (64 net) in Wattenberg, drilled 16 development wells (eight net) in the Illinois Basin and drilled nine development coalbed methane wells (five net) in Utah. During 2002, the Company drilled or deepened 66 development wells (62 net) in Wattenberg, drilled 24 development wells (12 net) in the Illinois Basin, drilled or deepened 16 development wells (eight net) in Kansas, and two wells (one net) in California, drilled 33 development wells (31 net) in the Mid Continent region, and drilled four gas wells on its grassroots projects (four net). The Company also drilled five exploratory coalbed methane wells (five net) in northwest Colorado. During 2003, the Company drilled or deepened 80 development wells (75 net) in Wattenberg, drilled 190 development wells (170 net) in the Mid Continent region, drilled one well (zero net) in the San Juan Basin, and drilled 74 development wells (73 net) in Other areas. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return.
At December 31, 2003, the Company had eight wells (eight net) in Wattenberg, 25 wells (14 net) in the Mid Continent region, and six wells (six net) in the Central and Other areas waiting on completion.
Acreage
The following table sets forth the leasehold acreage held by the Company at December 31, 2003. Undeveloped acreage is acreage held under lease, permit, contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for development or exploratory drilling. Developed acreage is acreage assigned to producing wells. The significant majority of the Company’s leases on undeveloped acreage have no term expiration as they are held by current production from offsetting wells.
