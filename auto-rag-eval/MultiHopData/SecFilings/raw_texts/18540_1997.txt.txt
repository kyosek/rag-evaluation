Natural Gas The U.S. Electric Operating Companies purchase their natural gas from a number of suppliers operating in and around their service territories. In 1997, approximately 36% of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' total natural gas purchases were made under long-term contracts and approximately 64% came from short-term contracts and spot market purchases.
CPL CPL's eight gas-fired electric generating plants are supplied by a portfolio of long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements through multiple natural gas pipeline systems. Approximately 48% of CPL's total natural gas requirements in 1997 were purchased under long-term arrangements representing both purchase obligations and discretionary purchases. The balance of CPL's natural gas requirements was acquired under short-term arrangements from the spot market.
PSO PSO's six gas-fired electric generating plants are supplied by a portfolio of long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. In 1997, approximately 37% of PSO's natural gas requirements were provided under firm contracts with the remaining requirements acquired from the spot market. In order to comply with an Oklahoma Commission order issued in 1991, PSO has contracted with two pipeline suppliers to connect to four of the natural gas-fired generating units. Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. is now connected to Riverside Power Station, and ONEOK Gas Marketing Company is connected to Riverside Power Station, Northeastern Power Station, Southwestern Power Station and Tulsa Power Station. Transok, a former affiliate, is still connected to all six plants. These additional connections will give PSO greater access to competitive supplies.
SWEPCO SWEPCO purchased approximately 97% of its natural gas requirements in 1997 pursuant to spot purchase contracts. Since SWEPCO's five gas-fired electric generating plants are used primarily for peaking requirements, a majority of SWEPCO's natural gas requirements will continue to be purchased on the spot market and will be subject to market conditions.
WTU WTU purchases its natural gas requirements from numerous suppliers. The long-term purchase contract with Lone Star Gas Company was renegotiated into a long-term transportation agreement with Lone Star Pipeline Company during the latter part of 1997. This new agreement will allow WTU to buy natural gas from alternative suppliers. In 1997, WTU purchased approximately 22% of its natural gas requirements under firm contracts with Lone Star Gas Company, and the remaining 78% was purchased from a number of suppliers on the spot market.
Coal and Lignite The U.S. Electric Operating Companies purchase coal from a number of suppliers. In 1997, the U.S. Electric Operating Companies purchased approximately 86% of their total coal purchases under long-term contracts with the balance procured on the spot market. The coal for the CSW U.S. Electric System plants comes primarily from Wyoming and Colorado mines which are located between 1,000 and 1,700 rail miles from the generating plants.
Oklaunion - CPL, PSO and WTU The jointly-owned Oklaunion plant purchases coal under a coal supply contract with Caballo Coal Company which accounts for approximately 68% of the total 1997 Oklaunion coal requirements for WTU, 68% for CPL and 69% for PSO with the balance procured on the spot market. As of December 31, 1997, CPL's share of the year-end 1997 coal inventory at Oklaunion was approximately 22,000 tons, representing a 29-day supply. PSO's share was approximately 41,000 tons, representing a 27-day supply. WTU's share was approximately 178,000 tons, representing a 33-day supply.
Burlington Northern supplies railcars to Oklaunion for the transportation of coal pursuant to a tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, whose authority in the matter was transferred to the STB effective January 1, 1996. In a decision issued May 3, 1996, the STB declared the rate set forth in Burlington Northern's tariff of $19.36 per ton to be unreasonably high and imposed a maximum rate of $13.68 per ton. On July 2, 1996, Burlington Northern established the new rate for the transportation of coal to Oklaunion. Burlington Northern appealed the May 3, 1996 decision and a related June 25, 1996 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 23, 1997, the STB decisions were upheld. Subsequently, on October 24, 1997, the STB ordered Burlington Northern to pay reparations, including interest, to WTU on or before November 24, 1997. On November 24, 1997, Burlington Northern paid WTU approximately $12.4 million. WTU's share of this amount was $7 million; PSO's share was $1.9 million; CPL's share was approximately $1 million, and the outside participants' share was $2.5 million. WTU, CPL and PSO each credited its respective fuel expense in November 1997 for the refund amounts.
Coleto Creek - CPL CPL has a long-term coal supply agreement with Colowyo Coal Company covering approximately 25% of the coal requirements of its Coleto Creek plant. During 1997, this agreement was suspended and replaced with an agreement pursuant to which both coal and coal transportation, using CPL-owned railcars, were provided by Colowyo Coal Company, which, in turn, entered into transportation agreements with Southern Pacific Transportation Company. Approximately 83% of Coleto Creek's deliveries were furnished under this agreement. The balance of the plant's coal deliveries resulted from spot purchases of Powder River Basin coal that was delivered under spot rail transportation agreements. Additionally, approximately 26,000 tons of coal were purchased from a supplier in Columbia and transported via ship to the Port of Corpus Christi where it was then transferred by train to the plant. At December 31, 1997, CPL had approximately 144,000 tons of coal in inventory at Coleto Creek, representing a 21-day supply.
During 1998, CPL intends to purchase Powder River Basin coal on the spot market for approximately 50% of the Coleto Creek plant requirements and will transport such coal pursuant to a rail transportation agreement with Union Pacific. The remainder of CPL's coal will be purchased from the Colowyo Coal Company. This coal will also be transported by Union Pacific. As a result of the recent merger between Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Union Pacific is currently the only rail carrier with access to the Coleto Creek Plant. In 1994, CPL instituted a proceeding at the Interstate Commerce Commission requesting a reasonable rate for the 16 miles transported from Victoria, Texas to Coleto Creek. Southern Pacific Transportation Company moved to dismiss the complaint and, in a decision issued December 31, 1996, the STB granted the motion. CPL has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
Northeastern Station - PSO PSO has a contract with Kerr-McGee Coal Corporation, which substantially covers the coal supply for PSO's Northeastern Station coal units through at least 2004. Coal delivery is by unit trains from mines located in the Gillette, Wyoming vicinity, a distance of about 1,100 rail miles from Northeastern Station. PSO owns sufficient railcars for operation of six unit trains. Coal is transported to Northeastern Station pursuant to a long-term contract with Burlington Northern. The plant is also equipped to accept deliveries from Union Pacific. At December 31, 1997, PSO had approximately 269,000 tons of coal in inventory at Northeastern Station representing a 22-day supply.
Welsh and Flint Creek - SWEPCO The long-term coal supply for SWEPCO's Welsh plant and its 50% owned Flint Creek plant is provided under a contract with Cyprus/Amax. Coal under this contract is mined near Gillette, Wyoming, a distance of about 1,500 and 1,100
miles, respectively, from the Welsh and Flint Creek plants. Coal is delivered to the plants under rail transportation contracts with Burlington Northern and the Kansas City Southern Railroad Company having expiration dates ranging between 1997 and 2007. SWEPCO owns or leases under long-term leases sufficient railcars and spares for operation of fifteen unit trains. SWEPCO has supplemented its railcar fleet from time to time with short-term leases. At December 31, 1997, SWEPCO had coal inventories of approximately 502,000 tons at Welsh representing a 25-day supply and approximately 179,000 tons at Flint Creek representing a 24-day supply. See ITEM 8 - NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS and NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for additional information.
Pirkey and Dolet Hills - SWEPCO SWEPCO has acquired lignite leases covering an aggregate of about 27,000 acres near the Henry W. Pirkey power plant. Sabine Mining Company is the contract miner of these reserves. At December 31, 1997, approximately 231,000 tons of lignite were in SWEPCO's inventory at the Pirkey plant representing a 19-day supply. Another 25,000 acres are jointly leased in equal portions by SWEPCO and CLECO in the Dolet Hills area of Louisiana near Dolet Hills Power Plant. The DHMV is the contract miner for these reserves. At December 31, 1997, SWEPCO had 161,000 tons of lignite in inventory at the Dolet Hills plant representing a 28-day supply. In the opinion of the management of SWEPCO, the acreage under lease in these areas contains sufficient reserves to cover the anticipated lignite requirements for the estimated useful lives of the lignite-fired plants.
Nuclear Fuel - CPL The supply of fuel for STP involves a complex process. This process includes the acquisition of uranium concentrate, the conversion of uranium concentrate to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride into the isotope U235, the fabrication of the enriched uranium into fuel rods and incorporation of fuel rods into fuel assemblies. The fuel assemblies are the final product loaded into the reactor core. The time associated with this process requires that fuel decisions be made years in advance of the actual need to refuel the reactor. Fuel requirements for STP are being handled by the STPNOC.
Outages are necessary approximately every 18 months for refueling. Because STP's fuel costs are significantly lower than any of the other CPL units, CPL's average fuel costs are expected to be higher whenever an STP unit is down for refueling or maintenance.
CPL and the other STP participants have entered into contracts with suppliers for 100% of the uranium concentrate sufficient for the operation of both STP units through April 2001, with additional flexible contracts to provide 69% of the uranium concentrate needed for STP through 2002. In addition, CPL and the other STP participants have entered into contracts with suppliers for 100% of the nuclear fuel conversion service sufficient for the operation of both STP units through November 1998, with additional flexible contracts to provide at least 50% of the conversion service needed for STP through 2002. Enrichment contracts were secured for a 30-year period from the initial operation of each unit. The STP participants have canceled the enrichment requirements for the period from October 2000 to September 2007 under a ten-year no-cost termination provision of the enrichment contracts. The STP participants believe that other, lower cost options will be available in the future. CPL and the other STP participants have entered into additional flexible contracts to provide enrichment service from October 2000 to December 2004. Also, nuclear fuel fabrication services have been contracted for operation through 2005 for Unit 1 and 2006 for Unit 2. Although CPL and the other STP owners cannot predict the availability of uranium and related services, CPL and the other STP owners do not currently expect to have difficulty obtaining uranium and related services required for the remaining years of STP operation.
The Energy Policy Act has provisions for the recovery of a portion of the costs associated with the decommissioning and decontamination of the gaseous diffusion plants used in the enrichment process. These costs are being recovered on the basis of enrichment services purchased by utilities from the DOE prior to October of 1992. The total annual assessment for all domestic utilities is limited to $150 million per federal fiscal year and assessable until October 2007. The STP assessment will be approximately $2.0 million each year with CPL's share being 25.2% of the annual STP assessment.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires the DOE to develop a permanent high level waste disposal facility for the storage of spent nuclear fuel by 1998. The DOE last estimated that the permanent facility will be available in 2010. The DOE will take possession of all spent fuel generated at STP as a result of a contract CPL and other STP participants have entered into with the DOE. STP has on-site storage facilities with the capability to store all the spent nuclear fuel generated by the STP units over their lives. Therefore, the DOE delay in providing the disposal facility will not impact the operation of the STP units. Under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1992, a one-mill per KWH assessment on electricity generated and sold from nuclear reactors funds the DOE waste disposal program.
Risks of substantial liability could arise from the operation of STP and from the use, handling, disposal and possible radioactive emissions associated with nuclear fuel. While CPL carries insurance, the availability, amount and coverage thereof is limited and may become more limited in the future. The available insurance may not cover all types or amounts of loss or expense which may be experienced in connection with the ownership of STP. See ITEM 8 - NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for information relating to nuclear insurance.
Governmental Regulation The price and availability of each of the foregoing fuel types are significantly affected by governmental regulation. Any inability in the future to obtain adequate fuel supplies or adoption of additional regulatory measures restricting the use of such fuels for the generation of electricity might affect the CSW U.S. Electric System's ability to economically meet the needs of its customers and could require the U.S. Electric Operating Companies to supplement or replace, prior to normal retirement, existing generating capability with units using other fuels. This would be impossible to accomplish quickly, would require substantial additional expenditures for construction and could have a significant adverse effect on CSW's and/or the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' financial condition and results of operations.
The Registrants are unable to predict the future cost of fuel (The foregoing statements constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results may differ materially from such projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions. See FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION). See ITEM 7. MD&A and ITEM 8 - NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS for additional information concerning fuel costs.
Power Purchases and Sales The U.S. Electric Operating Companies serve various municipalities, electric cooperatives and public power authorities. The U.S. Electric Operating Companies exchange power with various neighboring electric systems and engage in electric interchanges with each other. In addition, they contract with certain suppliers including power marketers and independent power producers for the purchase or sale of capacity, firm energy, responsive reserves and other wholesale services.
CPL - Magic Valley Electric Cooperative CPL's largest wholesale customer, Magic Valley Electric Cooperative, is currently served under an agreement that requires a five year notice of termination. During 1996, the cooperative exercised such notice of termination. Magic Valley Electric Cooperative's contract will expire July 23, 2001. During 1997, Magic Valley Electric Cooperative purchased 755 million KWHs from CPL which represents 43% of CPL's sales for resale but only 3% of CPL's total sales.
WTU - Weatherford and Hearne WTU began wholesale service to a new customer, the City of Weatherford, Texas, in January 1997. Service to the City of Weatherford for its load of approximately 55 MW will continue through the year 2001. WTU will begin wholesale service to a new customer, the City of Hearne, Texas, in April 1998. Service to the City of Hearne for its load of approximately 12 MW will continue through March 2003.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The CSW System is subject to regulation with respect to air and water quality, solid waste standards and other environmental matters by various governmental authorities. These authorities have continuing jurisdiction in most cases to require modifications in facilities and operations. Any such changes in environmental statutes or regulations could require substantial additional expenditures to modify the CSW System's facilities and operations and could have a material adverse effect on CSW and each of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' results of operations and financial condition. Violations of environmental statutes or regulations can result in fines and other costs.
Air Quality Air quality standards and emission limitations are subject to the jurisdiction of state regulatory authorities in each state in which the CSW System operates, with oversight by the EPA. In accordance with regulations of these state authorities, permits are required for all generating units on which construction is commenced or which are substantially modified after the effective date of the applicable regulations.
In 1990, the U.S. Congress amended the Clean Air Act. CAAA places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide from gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants. Beginning in the year 2000, the U.S. Electric Operating Companies will be required to hold allowances in order to emit sulfur dioxide. The EPA issues allowances to owners of existing generating units based on historical operating conditions. Based on the CSW U.S. Electric System facilities plan, CSW believes that the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' allowances are adequate to meet their needs at least through 2008. Public and private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.
As a result of requirements imposed by the CAAA, CSW spent approximately $16 million over the three year period from 1995 to 1997 for annual testing of, software modifications to, and maintenance of continuous emission monitoring equipment. Approximately $0.6 million of this amount was spent in 1997. Similarly, the expenditures for each of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies are presented in the following table.
CPL PSO SWEPCO WTU ------------------------------- (thousands)
Total expenditures (1995-1997) $530 $310 $469 $295 Expenditures in 1997 194 100 166 102
The CAAA also directed the EPA to issue regulations governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requiring government studies to determine what controls, if any, should be imposed on utilities to control toxic air emissions. The acid rain rules have not been released. Accordingly, the impact on CSW and the U.S. Electric Operating Companies cannot be determined at this time.
Under the Acid Rain Title IV rules of the CAAA for nitrogen oxide control for coal units, the U.S. Electric Operating Companies have elected alternate standards for their units under an optional provision regarding emission limits. This will eliminate any capital expenses through 2007, if the alternate standards are met. Approximately $150,000 was expended in 1997 towards optimizing nitrogen oxide emissions at the coal units to safeguard against exceeding those limits.
There is a legislative initiative in Texas to have older units, which were grandfathered under the CAAA, operate under permits and reduce emissions. Based upon reduction levels being discussed, the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' cost could be approximately $131 million. The time frame has not been established for these controls. The issue will be considered in the 1999 Texas legislative session.
The EPA recently promulgated revised, more stringent ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates. While these standards do not mandate emission levels for facilities such as electricity generating power plants, they may result in more areas being designated as non-attainment for these two pollutants. States will be required to develop strategies to achieve compliance in these areas, strategies that may include lower emission levels for electricity generating power plants, possibly including facilities within the CSW System. The impact, if any, on CSW or the U.S. Electric Operating Companies cannot yet be determined, but the impact could be significant.
At the Kyoto Conference on Global Warming held in December 1997, U.S. representatives agreed to a treaty which could require new limitations on "greenhouse gases" from power plants. CSW and the U.S. Electric Operating companies could be affected if this treaty is approved by Congress in its present form. The impact, if any, on CSW or the U.S. Electric Operating Companies cannot yet be determined, but the impact could be significant.
Water Quality Water quality is subject to the jurisdiction of each of the state regulatory authorities in which the U.S. Electric Operating Companies operate as well as the EPA. These authorities have jurisdiction over all wastewater discharges into state waters, establish water quality standards and issue waste control permits covering discharges which might affect the quality of state waters. The EPA has jurisdiction over point source discharges through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System provisions of the Clean Water Act.
RCRA and CERCLA The RCRA and the Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas solid waste rules provide for comprehensive control of all solid wastes from generation to final disposal. The appropriate state regulatory authorities in the states in which the U.S. Electric Operating Companies operate have received authorization from the EPA to administer the RCRA solid waste control program for their respective states.
The operations of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies, like those of other utility systems, generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject to environmental laws. CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances. Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault or the legality of past disposal activities. PRPs include owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or generators of hazardous substances. Many states have similar laws. Theoretically, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of a cleanup. Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.
CSW's subsidiaries incur significant costs for the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste materials. Unit costs for waste classified as hazardous exceed by a substantial margin unit costs for waste classified as non-hazardous.
The U.S. Electric Operating Companies, like other electric utilities, produce combustion and other generation by-products, such as ash, sludge, slag, low-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The U.S. Electric Operating Companies own distribution poles treated with creosote or other substances. The EPA currently exempts coal combustion by-products from regulation as hazardous wastes. Distribution poles treated with creosote or other substances are not expected to exhibit characteristics that would cause them to be hazardous waste. In connection with their operations, the U.S. Electric Operating Companies also have used asbestos, PCBs and materials classified as hazardous waste. If additional by-products or other materials generated or used by companies in the CSW U.S. Electric System were reclassified as hazardous wastes, or other new laws or regulations concerning hazardous wastes were put into effect, CSW System disposal and remedial costs could increase materially. The EPA is expected to issue new regulations stating whether certain other materials will be classified as hazardous.
SEEBOARD SEEBOARD's operations are subject to regulation with respect to water quality standards and other environmental matters by various authorities within the United Kingdom. Under certain circumstances, these authorities may require modifications to SEEBOARD's facilities and operations or impose fines and other costs for violations of applicable statutes and regulations. From time to time SEEBOARD is made aware of various environmental issues or is named as a party to various legal claims, actions, complaints or other proceedings related to environmental matters. Management does not expect disposition of any such pending environmental proceedings to have a material adverse effect on CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
PSO Sand Springs/Grandfield, Oklahoma Sites In 1989, PSO found some PCB contamination in a Sand Springs, Oklahoma PCB storage facility. The EPA-approved cleanup began in 1994. In 1996, the EPA filed a complaint against PSO alleging that PSO failed to comply with provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act. The complaint has three counts, two of which pertain to the Sand Springs facility and the third of which deals with a substation in Grandfield, Oklahoma. The EPA alleges improper disposal of PCBs at the Sand Springs site due to the length of time between discovery of the contamination and the actual cleanup at the site. The complaint at the Grandfield site alleges failure to date PCB articles at the site. The total proposed penalty for the three counts, which was accrued by PSO in 1996, was $479,000. PSO settled all claims in the suit in March, 1998. The settlement did not have a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's results of operations or financial condition.
PSO Compass Industries Superfund Site PSO has received notice from the EPA that it is a PRP under CERCLA and may be required to share in the reimbursement of cleanup costs for the Compass Industries Superfund site which has been remediated. PSO has been named
defendant in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August 29, 1994, for reimbursement of the cleanup costs. PSO's degree of responsibility, if any, is believed to be insignificant, and management expects that PSO will have an opportunity to pay its share of costs and remove itself from the case. Accordingly, in 1995, PSO accrued $100,000 for this matter.
On March 19, 1996, a district judge ruled in favor of the defendants and determined that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under CERCLA. The plaintiffs may have a claim to funds expended after August 29, 1991. This greatly reduces PSO's exposure since most of the remediation was completed prior to this date. In October, 1996, the plaintiffs appealed this ruling, and PSO is awaiting the outcome of this matter.
SWEPCO Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site SWEPCO was notified by Mississippi Power in 1994 that it may be a PRP at a MGP site in Biloxi, Mississippi, which was formerly owned and operated by a predecessor of SWEPCO. Since then, SWEPCO has worked with Mississippi Power on both the investigation of the extent of contamination on the site as well as on the subsequent sampling of the site. The sampling results indicated contamination at the property as well as the possibility of contamination of an adjacent property. A risk assessment was submitted to the MDEQ, and the MDEQ requested that a future residential exposure scenario be evaluated for comparison with commercial and industrial exposure scenarios. However, Mississippi Power and SWEPCO do not believe that cleanup to a residential scenario is appropriate since this site has been industrial/commercial for more than 100 years, and Mississippi Power plans to continue this type of usage. Mississippi Power and SWEPCO also presented a report to the MDEQ demonstrating that the ground water on the site was not potable, further demonstrating that cleanup to residential standards is not necessary.
The MDEQ has not agreed to a non-residential future land use scenario and has requested further testing. Following the additional testing and resolution of whether cleanup must meet a residential usage scenario or a commercial/industrial scenario, a feasibility study will be conducted to more definitively evaluate remedial strategies for the property. The feasibility study process will require public input prior to a final decision being made.
At the present time, SWEPCO has not had any further substantive discussions with MDEQ regarding the ultimate resolution of this issue. Therefore, a final range of cleanup costs is not yet determinable. SWEPCO has incurred approximately $200,000 to date for its portion of the cleanup of this site, and based on its preliminary estimates, anticipates that an additional $2 million may be incurred. Accordingly, SWEPCO has accrued $2 million for the cleanup of the site.
SWEPCO Voda Petroleum Superfund Site In April 1996, SWEPCO received correspondence from the EPA notifying SWEPCO that it is a PRP to a cleanup action planned for the Voda Petroleum Superfund Site located in Clarksville, Texas. SWEPCO is conducting a records review to compile documentation relating to SWEPCO's past use of the Voda Petroleum site. The proposed cleanup of the site is estimated by the EPA to cost approximately $2 million and to take approximately twelve months to complete. An option for over 30 PRPs to conduct the cleanup in lieu of the EPA conducting the cleanup is under consideration. Any SWEPCO liability associated with this project is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
EMFs Research is ongoing whether exposure to EMFs may result in adverse health effects. Although earlier studies suggested a correlation between EMFs and some types of effects, the research to date has not established a cause-and-effect
relationship between EMFs and adverse health effects from electric lines. Recently, more comprehensive studies have failed to show any correlation. CSW cannot predict the impact on CSW or the electric utility industry if further investigations or proceedings were to establish that the present electricity delivery system is contributing to increased risk or incidence of health problems.
Other Environmental Matters From time to time the Registrants are made aware of various other environmental issues or are named as parties to various other legal claims, actions, complaints or other proceedings related to environmental matters. Management does not expect disposition of any such pending environmental proceedings to have a material adverse effect on CSW's or any of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' results of operations or financial condition.

(a) Some plants have the capability of burning oil in combination with gas. Use of oil in facilities primarily designed to burn gas results in increased maintenance expense and a slight reduction in capability. PSO and WTU have 25 MW and 11 MW, respectively, of facilities primarily designed to burn oil. (b) Data reflects only the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' portion of plants which are jointly owned with non-affiliates. For additional information concerning jointly owned facilities see ITEM 8 - NOTE 6. JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT. (c) Excludes 310 MW from units in storage, consisting of 60 MW at Victoria for CPL and 250 MW at Tulsa for PSO of which 125 MW will be available in March 1998. Excludes 117 MW at Paint Creek and 39 MW at Rio Pecos for WTU which will be available in June 1998.
All of the generating facilities described above are located on land owned by the U.S. Electric Operating Companies or, in the case of jointly owned facilities, jointly with other participants. The U.S. Electric Operating Companies' electric transmission and distribution facilities are mostly located over or under highways, streets and other public places or property owned by others, for which permits, grants, easements or licenses (which the U.S. Electric Operating Companies believe to be satisfactory, but without examination of underlying land titles) have been obtained. The principal plants and properties of the U.S. Electric Operating Companies are subject to the liens of the first mortgage indentures under which the U.S. Electric Operating Companies' FMBs are issued.
OTHER PROPERTIES
In addition to the generating facilities described above, CSW has ownership interests in other electrical generating facilities, both foreign and domestic. Information concerning these facilities is listed below.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
The CSW System, including the U.S. Electric Operating Companies, maintains a continuing construction program, the nature and extent of which is based upon current and estimated demands upon the system. In addition, the CSW System requires capital to invest in new enterprises, either through equity investments or loans to projects, when deemed appropriate. See ITEM 7. MD&A for detailed information related to historical and projected capital expenditures.
