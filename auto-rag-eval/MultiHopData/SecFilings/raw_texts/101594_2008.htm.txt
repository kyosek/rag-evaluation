ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Molybdenum - Mount Emmons Project
The Company re-acquired the Mount Emmons (formerly known as the Lucky Jack molybdenum property) located near Crested Butte, Colorado on February 28, 2006. The property was returned to the Company by Phelps Dodge Corporation (“PD”) in accordance with a 1987 Amended Royalty Deed and Agreement between the Company and Amax Inc. (“Amax”). The Mount Emmons Project includes a total of 25 patented and approximately 612 unpatented mining and mill site claims, which together approximate 7,427 acres, or over 8 square miles of claims.
Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA) has an option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the Project. See Part I above.
Conveyance of the property to the Company also included the transfer of ownership and operational responsibility of the mine water treatment plant located on the property. The water treatment permit issued under the Colorado Discharge Permit System was assigned to the Company by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. We are responsible for all operating and maintenance costs until such time as Thompson Creek Metals elects to acquire a 15% interest in the property. Thereafter, costs will be shared according to USE and Thompson Creek’s participation interests. We also are evaluating using the plant in milling operations.
USE had leased various patented and unpatented mining claims on the Mount Emmons molybdenum property to Amax in 1974. In the late 1970s, Amax delineated a large deposit of molybdenum on the properties, reportedly containing approximately 155 million tons of mineralized material averaging 0.44% molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). In 1980, Amax constructed a water treatment plant at the Mount Emmons molybdenum property to treat water flowing from the old Keystone mine workings and for potential use in milling operations. By 1983, Amax had reportedly spent an estimated $150 million in the acquisition of the property, securing water rights, extensive exploration, ore body delineation, mine planning, metallurgical testing and other activities involving the mineral deposit. Amax was merged into Cyprus Minerals in 1992 to form Cyprus Amax. PD then acquired Mount Emmons in 1999 through its acquisition of Cyprus Amax. Thereafter, PD acquired additional conditional water rights and patents to certain mineral claims.
In its 1992 patent application to the BLM, Cyprus Amax stated that the size and grade of the Mount Emmons deposit was determined to approximate 220 million tons grading 0.366% molybdenite. In a letter dated April 2, 2004, the BLM estimated that there were about 23 million tons of mineable reserves containing 0.689% molybdenite, and that about 267 million pounds of molybdenum trioxide was recoverable. This letter covered only the high-grade mineralization which is only a portion of the total mineral deposit delineated to date. The BLM relied on a mineral report prepared by Western Mine Engineering (“WME”) for the U.S. Forest Service, which directed and administered the WME contract. WME’s analysis was based upon a price of $4.61 per pound for molybdic oxide and was used by the BLM in determining that nine claims satisfied the patenting requirement that the mining claims contain a valuable mineral that could be mined profitably. WME consulted a variety of sources in preparation of its report, including a study prepared in 1990 by American Mine Services, Inc. and a pre-feasibility report later prepared by Behre Dolbear & Company, Inc. in 1998.
Even with the historical data available, the size, configuration and operations of the mine plan that may be proposed by TCM have not been finalized. These factors, as well as the prevailing prices for molybdic oxide when the mine is active, will determine the economic viability of the project. The $4.61 price used by WME should not be considered to be a current breakeven price for Mount Emmons. It is anticipated that a full feasibility study will be prepared in the future, using current and expected capital costs, and operating expenses, to estimate the viability of the project.
In December 2008, an additional 160 acres of fee land in the vicinity of the claims was purchased for $4 million ($2 million in January 2009, $400,000 annually for five years). USE and TCM share the purchase cost of this land equally on a 50 - 50 basis.
Information About Molybdenum Markets
The metallurgical market for molybdenum is characterized by cyclical and volatile prices, little product differentiation and strong competition. In the market, prices are influenced by production costs of domestic and foreign competitors, worldwide economic conditions, world supply/demand balances, inventory levels, the U.S. Dollar exchange rate and other factors. Molybdenum prices also are affected by the demand for end-use products in, for example, the construction, transportation and durable goods markets. A substantial portion the of world’s molybdenum supply is produced as a by-product of copper mining. Today, by-product production is estimated to account for approximately 60% of global molybdenum production.
Molybdenum price experienced continued stability during 2007 but declined substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008. It is believed that the overall market remained in slight deficit during 2008 due to demand continuing to outpace supply, but the global recession has led to dramatic reductions in steel output and pricing, and correspondingly in market demand for molybdenum and its pricing.
Annual Metal Week Dealer Oxide mean prices averaged $29.71 in 2008 ($17.79 in the fourth quarter 2008 and $10.00 as of December 31, 2008), compared to a year average of $30.65 in 2007 ($25.55 in 2006 and $32.94 in 2005).
Oil and Gas
PetroQuest Energy, Inc. - Gulf Coast
In 2007, we entered into an Exploration and Area of Mutual Interest Agreement (the “E&AMI Agreement”) with PetroQuest Energy, Inc. (“PQ”) relating to three prospect areas in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The E&AMI Agreement provides us with the right, through September 13, 2011, to acquire a 20% working interest in each lease acquired by PQ within any of the three prospect areas. The parties also signed an operating agreement for PQ to be the operator for each prospect. PQ currently owns or will likely own a majority of the working interest in every area covered by the E&AMI Agreement.
Through December 31, 2008, we have paid $3.2 million for our 20% share of lease acquisition and seismic data reprocessing and reinterpretation costs with PQ. We have spent an additional $4.2 million in exploration costs. $2.5 million was spent on the Bluffs well, completed as an oil and gas producer (see “Reserves” below). Costs were approximately $607,800 more than anticipated due to drilling and completion cost overruns, some of which were due to adverse weather conditions. An additional $1.7 million of drilling expense was incurred for the Highlands well (a dry hole).
We have not yet committed to the drilling of any wells on other prospects. While successful Gulf Coast wells can provide favorable returns on investment, and the initial production from the Bluffs well was higher than expected, we will continue to assess the viability of participating in additional wells with PQ. If we should elect not to participate in any undrilled prospects proposed by PQ where we have paid for lease and seismic costs, we will attempt to farm out our interest, sell our interest in the seismic or abandon the prospect. The costs associated with these undrilled prospects will remain in the full cost pool and be subject to ceiling tests.
Wells Drilled with PetroQuest
As of December 31, 2008, we held working interests in 2,584 gross acres with PQ. The Bluffs well encountered approximately 85 feet of net pay in the Cris I - Hollywood I sand, and is producing in the range of 40 barrels of oil per day and 1,300 Mcf of gas per day, net to our interest. USE’s working interest is 15% (reduced from 20% due to a third party’s right and subsequent election to back in for 5% of the leasehold), representing a net revenue interest of 10.4%. The working and net revenue interests will be further reduced after payout of our costs, plus 6% annual interest, pursuant to the Wildes agreement (see below).
The Highlands well was a dry hole and has been plugged and abandoned.
Reserves
The reserve estimates for the Bluffs well (one well location with no additional locations to be drilled), net to our interest at December 31, 2008, was prepared by Ryder Scott, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Estimates of reserves are presented in accordance with SEC rules. All reserves are valued at the total estimated future net cash flows before income taxes, discounted at 10%. This value is not intended to represent the current market value of the reserves. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, oil and gas prices, and other factors.
Estimates of reserve volumes and future net cash flows use the prices received for production at December 31, 2008 ($41.41 per barrel of oil and $5.88 per Mcf of gas). Future estimated production and ad valorem taxes, capital costs and operating costs are deducted from estimated future cash flows, and the result is discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine “present value” (“PV-10”). Following is a summary of our reserves at December 31, 2008:
PV-10 is widely used in the oil and gas industry, and is followed by institutional investors and professional analysts, to compare companies. However, the PV-10 data is not an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculated under GAAP and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, which includes the effects of income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of Estimated Future Net Revenues Discounted at 10% to the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows as shown in Note F to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
USE’s oil and gas production for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 73,635 Mcf gas and 2,330 barrels of oil. The average price per Mcf sold was $6.93 and $41.85 per barrel of oil sold.
Yuma Exploration and Production Company, Inc. - South Louisiana
On April 27, 2008, we entered into a four year Joint Exploration Agreement (the “JEA”) with Yuma Exploration and Production Company, Inc. (“Yuma”), a private company based in Houston, Texas. Under the JEA, USE has purchased a working interest in a seismic, lease acquisition and drilling program covering approximately 138 square miles in South Louisiana. Net acreage acquired will depend on the terms of leases acquired, but is expected to be in excess of 50,000 net acres. Yuma holds a 48% working interest and the balance is held by USE (4.55%) and third parties (approximately 47.45%). For their working interests, the participants (other than Yuma) are paying 80% of the initial seismic, overhead and some land costs (total $1,390,000), and Yuma is paying 20%. All land and exploration costs going forward are to be paid according to the working interest percentages.
As of December 31, 2008, approximately 400 miles of reprocessed 2-D seismic data has been analyzed to prepare for a large 3-D seismic survey expected to be conducted in first and second quarter 2009. Yuma is expected to utilize the data to identify prospect areas and likely propose lease acquisition activities and an initial well in each prospect identified. Participants will have the opportunity to opt in or out of any prospect leasing program, and also as to the initial well in each prospect. Each prospect will have a separate operating agreement with Yuma as operator. It is expected that the program will yield multiple prospects, with exploration activities continuing for a number of years. Once the JEA is completed as to the seismic, acquisition and initial well phases in Phase I, Yuma may decide to conduct a 3-D seismic survey on another identified area (Phase II) and participants including USE, will have the option to participate in the area under the same terms as the JEA.
Through December 31, 2008, we have paid $801,900 for seismic and land costs. Our share of seismic, land and exploration costs for 2009 are expected to be $680,000. Exploration expenses for 2009 will depend on the number of wells to be proposed by Yuma, which are not presently known.
The area has significant pipeline infrastructure for oil and gas, and is believed to be highly prospective for oil and gas, with potential targets in known producing formations.
Wildes Exploration Agreements
In 2007, we entered into a Management Engagement Agreement (for a term of three years) with a management company affiliated with Wildes Exploration (“Wildes”). We are paying Wildes $100,000 annually for consulting and management services for the prospects under the E&AMI Agreement with PQ.
Pursuant to the agreement with Wildes, we also will assign to Wildes a working interest of 15% of our working interest after we have recovered 100% of our costs plus 6% interest compounded annually, for each producing well drilled and completed within a prospect area. This interest will increase to 20% of our working interest after we have recovered 200% of all our costs from each producing well within the prospect. This assignment will cover all wells drilled and completed in the particular prospect. From the assignment date forward, Wildes will be responsible for its proportionate share of all of costs associated with the wells in accordance with the operating agreement with PQ.
In fourth quarter 2008, we entered into a Participation and Management Agreement (the “PMA”) with Wildes relating to the Yuma prospects (for a term ending December 31, 2011). This agreement is similar in some respects to the Management Engagement Agreement covering the PetroQuest program. Under the PMA, we are paying Wildes $50,000 annually for consulting and management services in connection with Yuma’s JEA.
In addition, we will assign to Wildes (after we have recovered 100% of our drilling and completion costs plus 6% interest compounded annually) a working interest of 12.5% of our working interest in each well that is completed with Yuma. After assignment, Wildes will be responsible for its proportionate share of the well’s costs under the operating agreement with Yuma.
Texas Land & Petroleum Company, LLC - Northeast Texas
In October 2008, USE signed an agreement with TLPC Holdings, Ltd, an affiliate of Texas Land & Petroleum Company, LLC (“TL&P”) a private Texas company for a moderate risk low gravity oil well drilling program on the Hopkins Prospect in Wood County, Texas, located about 50 miles east of Dallas. The prospect is in a semi-rural area.
The prospect holds 790 gross (280 net) acres, with a 75% net revenue interest. Up to ten wells could be drilled (20 acre spacing); total depth to two formations within the Woodbine sand is approximately 6,000 feet. The Upper Cretaceous Sub Clarksville formation also is targeted. Well recoveries in the immediate vicinity have averaged 100,000 barrels per well.
We have paid TL&P a $45,000 prospect fee. We will participate in the first well on a one-third for one quarter basis (33% of drilling and completion costs, for a 25% working interest (18.75% net revenue interest)). Upon participation in the first well, USE will own its share of all the acreage. Subsequent wells will be unpromoted (25% of costs). TL&P holds 50% of the working interest.
Initial (promoted) well drilling and completion expense was estimated at $958,620 in early September 2008 ($362,000 for USE), with dry hole costs of $554,500 ($230,000 for USE). However, field costs are expected to decrease in 2009, and it is the intention of the parties to take advantage of lower costs before starting drilling.
Ridgeland Wyoming, Inc.
On December 23, 2008, we signed a Participation Agreement, (“Participation Agreement”) with Ridgeland Wyoming, Inc. (“Ridgeland”), a private oil and gas producer headquartered in Provo, Utah. We paid a $25,000 prospect fee to Ridgeland for a 50% working interest in the Schuricht Prospect in north east Wyoming. The first well was spud on January 17, 2009 and was drilled to a total depth of 6,180 feet. The well was determined to be unproductive and was subsequently plugged and abandoned on January 30, 2009. Ridgeland was carried for a 1/6th interest (on an 8/8th basis) to casing point on the first well. After the first well, the Company and Ridgeland will drill all subsequent wells on a 50 - 50 basis. All leases under the Participating Agreement with Ridgeland are to carry an 80% net revenue interest. Under the terms of the Participation Agreement the Company agreed to pay $338,800 as its initial expense in the first well. If any further wells are drilled on this prospect, the Company may participate in a 50% heads up basis. We earned interest in 80 gross acres (40 net acres) after drilling this first well.
Energy Housing
Remington Village - Gillette, Wyoming. We have completed construction of a nine building multifamily apartment complex, with 216 units on 10.15 acres (purchased in 2007) located in Gillette, Wyoming. The apartments are a mix of one, two, and three bedroom units, with a clubhouse and family amenities for the complex. This project is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary Remington Village, LLC. (“Remington”), and was 88% leased at December 31, 2008.
In August 2007, Zions Bank provided secured construction financing (also guaranteed by USE). The loan was $16.8 million at December 31, 2008. Total cost to buy the land, pay a developer’s fee, obtain permits and entitlements, site work and construction, was approximately $24.5 million at December 31, 2008. At that date, USE had invested $7.7 million cash equity into the project (including $1.2 million for land purchase). The interest rate on the loan balance at December 31, 2008 was 2.71% (payable monthly) based on LIBOR. Loan maturity was March 1, 2009. In January 2009, USE paid off the construction financing ($16,831,500) with internal funds.
As of the date this Annual Report is filed, we are realizing revenues of approximately $225,000 per month, representing a much higher return on investment (approximately 8% annually) compared to our Treasury Bills (assuming occupancy rates continue at current high levels).
Basin Electric Power Cooperative (“Basin”) is building a $1.345 billion coal fired power plant about 7 miles north of Gillette. Construction is expected to last two more years and employ up to 1,100 workers during the peak period. In 2007, Basin and Remington signed an agreement to pre-lease apartments from January 2008 through August 2011 to Basin employees and others associated with the construction. Basin was to pay Remington approximately $3.24 million in total rent during the period, regardless of whether the units were occupied.
On October 15, 2008, Basin terminated its agreement and paid USE the required $100,000 termination fee. The termination did not impact Zion’s construction loan or the 20 apartments then occupied by Basin employees and contractors. Termination had a temporary adverse impact on rent revenues, as the unleased inventory allocated to Basin was freed from Basin’s payment obligations. Since October 15, 2008, occupancy has increased from 62% to 88% at December 31, 2008, and we don’t expect the termination will have a material long term adverse impact.
The additional workforce and increased housing needs associated with construction and operation of the Basin project along with the coal operations and other capital projects in the Gillette, Wyoming area should favorably impact the local economy (and the Remington project) for years to come.
Riverton, Wyoming. On December 28, 2007, we purchased 13.84 acres of undeveloped land across the street from USE’s corporate office building for $500,400 cash, with the intention of developing the land for mixed commercial and multifamily residential purposes. Our basis in the property and improvements at December 31, 2008 is $652,800. We may sell the property in the future without development.
Sold Uranium Properties - Possible Future Revenues
In 2007, we sold to sxr Uranium One Inc. (“Uranium One”) all of our uranium assets for cash and stock in Uranium One. Included in the sold assets were the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in Utah and unpatented uranium claims in Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Utah. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, USE may also receive from Uranium One:
·
$20,000,000 cash when commercial production occurs at the Shootaring Canyon Mill (when the Shootaring Canyon Mill has been operating at 60% or more of its design capacity of 750 short tons per day for 60 consecutive days).
·
$7,500,000 cash on the first delivery (after commercial production has occurred) of mineralized material from any of the claims sold to Uranium One to a commercial mill (excluding existing ore stockpiles on the properties).
·
From and after commercial production occurs at the Shootaring Canyon Mill, a production payment royalty (up to but not more than $12,500,000) equal to five percent of (i) the gross value of uranium and vanadium products produced at and sold from the mill; or (ii) mill fees received by Uranium One from third parties for custom milling or tolling arrangements, as applicable. If production is sold to a Uranium One affiliate, partner, or joint venturer, gross value shall be determined by reference to mining industry publications or data.
The timing of future receipt of funds from any of these contingencies is not predicted.
Royalty on Uranium Claims
USE holds a 4% net profits interest on unpatented mining claims on Rio Tinto’s Jackpot uranium property located on Green Mountain in Wyoming.
Other Properties
USE owns a 14-acre tract in Riverton, Wyoming, with a two-story 30,400 square foot office building. The first floor is rented to non-affiliates and government agencies; the second floor is occupied by the Company. We also own a 10,000 square foot aircraft hangar on land leased from the City of Riverton with 7,000 square feet of associated offices and facilities; three vacant lots covering 16 acres in Fremont County, Wyoming, and two city lots and improvements including one small office building.
ITEM 3.
