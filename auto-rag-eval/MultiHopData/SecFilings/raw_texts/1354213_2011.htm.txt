Rubicon Option Agreement: Shabu Lake - Skinner Claims
Our Red Lake Property consists of 14 claims comprising approximately 6,680 acres in the prolific Red Lake Mining Division of Northwestern Ontario, Canada. These claims are located in the Shabu Lake area and are accessible by road. This property has multiple reported gold occurrences on it (Ontario Geological Survey Open File Report 5835) as well as multiple documented copper/nickel occurrences (Preliminary Map P973 Shabumeni River - Narrow Lake area).
Previous exploration was hampered by inaccessibility but the construction of an all-season logging road in recent years has alleviated this and enhanced the possibility of discovering new gold and base metal zones. In addition, follow up work on previous occurrences is now more economically viable.
Location and Access
The property lies in northwest part of the Birch-Confederation Lakes greenstone belt some 75 km east-northeast of Red Lake straddling the Skinner township / Shabu Lake area boundary. It comprises a contiguous group of claims (~175 units, 6,988 acres) extending 11.5 km from Leonard Lake in the east to Shabu Lake in the northwest.
The east part of the property is road accessible from Highway 105 in Ear Falls, eastwards towards Gold Pines on Lac Seul on Highway 653, then northeastwards along the South Bay Road and finally north on the Joyce Road which crosses the southeast extremity of the property. The South Bay and Joyce Roads are both well maintained, gravel logging access roads.
Northwest parts of the property are accessible by float plane available at the South End of Confederation Lake (Kabeelo’s; ~30 km), Ear Falls (several; 75 km) and Red Lake (e.g, Greens, 75 km).
Title
The properties are all unpatented mining claims in good standing with the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Foresty (MNDMF) registered to Perry English. Perry English has granted an option to Big Bear Mining which requires cash and stock payments, the terms of which are set out in the section entitled “Business”. In order to maintain ownership of the property we must maintain the option agreement in good standing and meet the work requirements of the MNDMF which are annual requirements calculated on the property size. On an annual basis the MNDMF requires eligible work to be carried out on the property with a cash value of CAD$56,400.

History
Parker and Atkinson (1993) record several gold showings on the property dating from 1926. Past work in the area has focused on the Bathurst Mine on Carr Lake which lies on the adjoining property south and east.
Parker and Atkinson (1993; Appendix A) provide detailed descriptions and histories of specific showings. Table 1 below lists work reported in the Shabu lake map area (NTS 52N07SW). Available data suggest that there is a significant and varied base of work on which to design further exploration programs. In recent work (circa 2004) by Fronteer, completed only on the Leonard Lake portion of the property, can be effectively applied to the central and western portions.

LOCAION
The Flint Rock Mines Ltd. occurrence is situated on leased mining claims KRL 51180 to 51191 inclusive. The main No. l vein is located about 1.2 km due west of Shabu Lake on leased claims KRL 51184 and 51186.
DESCRIPTION
Regional Structures
Fyon and ODonnell (1986) noted that the main structure at Shabu Lake is a complex or refolded fold. According to Fyon and ODonnell (1986): "A tight syncline with a highly strained (possibly sheared) core trends northwest, parallel to the northwestern arm of the lake. A second fold axial trace trends north-northeast, and defines a broad syncline in the southeastern section of the lake.”
Geology
Northeast-trending, fine-grained metasediments are intercalated with minor metavolcanic flows of the Cycle n metavolcanic sequence (Thurston 1986) and are intruded by granodioritic rocks of the Mainprize Lake granitoid complex.
Mineralization
No. l vein
The No. l vein occurs along the southern claim boundaries of leased claims KRL 51184 and 51186. The east-trending quartz vein has been traced by diamond drilling along the contact between biotite granodiorite and a diorite dike, for a strike length of 800 m. The vein is 0.1 to 0.6 m wide and contains sparse amounts of disseminated galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and visible gold (Pryslak 1974).
No. 2 vein
The No. 2 vein is approximately 460 m northwest of the No. l vein and is situated on leased mining claim KRL 51188. The east-trending vein dips 90 and is 5 cm to 30 cm wide with a strike length of 47 m. The vein is hosted by a narrow inclusion of metasediments and by biotite granodiorite and gabbro. Pryslak (1974) reported that the vein contained up to 10% galena and 2% chalcopyrite.
Alteration and deformation
Alteration and deformation associated with the quartz veins is very minimal and consists of silicification, epidotization and hematization with very minor shearing.
OWNERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT
Prospectors Airways Ltd. conducted trenching, channel sampling and diamond drilled 28 holes totalling 6500 feet on the No. l Vein zone.
Flint Rock Mines Ltd. diamond drilled 7 holes totalling 1999 feet on the No. l and No. 2 veins.
Flint Rock Mines diamond drilled 2 holes totalling 950 feet to test the base metal potential of a pyritic zone on the west shore of Shabu Lake (leased claim KRL 51180).
Flint Rock Mines conducted linecutting and induced polarization and resistivity surveys over the property and diamond drilled 6 holes totalling 2217.6 feet.

LOCATION
The Bathurst Mine is located on leased mining claim KRL 321974 (formerly KRL 4758) which is part of a group of 12 contiguous leased claims situated between Bathurst and Car lakes in the northwest corner of Skinner Township. Numerous pits and trenches are located on several of the leased claims.
DESCRIPTION
Regional Structures
The Bathurst Mine property is situated within the contact strain aureole of the Trout Lake batholith in the east-northeast-trending Swain Lake deformation zone (Fyon and Lane 1986).
Geology
Mafic, massive and pillowed metavolcanic flows of the Cycle II sequence (Thurston 1985) are intruded by coarse-grained gabbroic and dioritic sills and dikes and by wide felsite dikes commonly striking between 090 and 110° and dipping 75° to the south. The Bathurst Mine is approximately 600 m east of the contact between mafic metavolcanic rocks and granitic rocks of the Trout Lake batholith. Mafic, metavolcanic rocks commonly contain abundant green, fibrous, amphibole. The metavolcanic rocks are commonly foliated in a northerly direction, parallel to the contact of the Trout Lake batholith.
Mineralization
Mineralized quartz veins are hosted by numerous discrete, east- and east-southeast- trending shear zones in excess of 3 m wide. Shear and fracture zones commonly occur along the contacts of felsite dikes and also within the dikes.
The sheared wall rocks are chloritized and/or talcose and host calcite-filled extension veins. Wall rocks immediately adjacent to the quartz veins are commonly silicified. Alteration is confined to the shear zones.
Numerous trenches and pits have been sunk on 12 mineralized shear zones hosting fine-grained, white, sugary quartz veins and a few pale blue vitreous veins. The quartz veins contain minor amounts of disseminated pyrite associated with iron carbonate and chloritic wall rock fragments. Quartz veins may also contain sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and spectacular, coarse, visible gold. Sulphides are commonly concentrated within the quartz at quartz vein/wall rock contacts and are finely disseminated in the sheared wall rocks.
The quartz veins range between 2 and 9 feet in width with some strike lengths in excess of 1000 feet. Many of the quartz veins have been deformed and are folded and flat-lying (Bruce 1929; Fyon and O'Donnell 1986). The folded veins commonly have a shallow plunge to the southwest. The shaft was sunk on the No. l, 2, 3 and 4 veins on leased mining claim KRL 321974 (formerly KRL 4758). These veins were the most important on the property and contained the most abundant visible gold.
OWNERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT
Gold was discovered in wide quartz veins at Car and Bathurst lakes.
Bathurst Mines Ltd. acquired 30 contiguous mining claims consisting of the Bathurst, Price-Logan, and Daipre-Cobourn properties; trenching, stripping and sampling delineated 7 gold-bearing zones.
A two-compartment shaft was sunk to a depth of 223 feet on mining claim KRL 4758 and a level was started at 200 feet.
The shaft was deepened to 300 feet with levels at 200 and 300 feet; 1109 feet of crosscutting and 2046 feet of drifting was completed; a mill was installed and produced 149.06 ounces of gold and 50 ounces of silver for a total value of S3107 (Rogers and Young 1930), a different production figure of 160 ounces of gold was also reported for the same year (Harding 1936); the mine was closed by the end of the year.
The mine was reopened and a production of S1500 (Sinclair et al. 1934) was recorded by the end of the year when the mine was closed once more.
The shaft was deepened to 420 feet and the mine was reported to have produced 74.51 ounces of gold and 6 ounces of silver from 130 tons of ore (Bathurst Mines Ltd., assessment files, Resident Geologist's office, Red Lake).

DUNKIN PROSPECT
Map area
SKINNER TOWNSHIP
NTS
52N02SW
LOCATION
The Dunkin prospect consists of a shaft and several separate gold showings, known as the No. l, No. 2, No. 2a, No. 2b, Vihonen (No. 3), Tie-Line and Harbour showings. The gold showings are situated along the north shore of the northwest arm of Narrow Lake in the southeast corner of Skinner Township.
DESCRIPTION
Regional Structures:
The Dunkin prospect is situated within the west- to northwest-trending Narrow Lake deformation zone (Fyon and Lane 1986; Fyon and O'Donnell 1986).
Geology
Massive, mafic, pillowed and variolitic metavolcanic flows of the Cycle II sequence (Thurston 1985) are intruded by fine- to medium-grained, magnetite-bearing gabbroic sills and minor feldspar porphyry dikes. The Dunkin prospect is approximately 3.6 km east of the contact between mafic metavolcanic rocks and granitic rocks of the Trout Lake batholith.
The majority of gold-bearing quartz veins at the Dunkin prospect are hosted by numerous narrow, discrete, shear zones trending between 050 and 110 and commonly dipping 70 to 80 north. Shear zones at the No. 2 and Vihonen (No. 3) showings dip between 15 and 30 to the northwest.
Host rocks consist of variably sheared and altered mafic metavolcanic flows and/or magnetite-bearing, medium-grained gabbro. Sheared wall rocks are chloritized, carbonatized and weakly sericitized.
Mineralization
Quartz veins at the Dunkin prospect commonly consist of massive, milky-white quartz containing minor amounts of disseminated pyrite, chlorite, iron carbonate and visible gold.
Minor amounts of disseminated pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and bornite occur in the quartz veins at the Harbour showing. Sheared wall rocks commonly contain variable amounts of disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.
Quartz veins are generally less than 3 feet wide with strike lengths up to 290 feet. Exceptions are the quartz vein at the Dunkin shaft which varies in width from 3 to 14 feet and contains sections of vuggy, blue quartz (Greig 1928); and the Tie-Line showing which consists of several narrow quartz-carbonate veinlets within a wide shear zone.
Quartz veins at the Harbour showing are weakly to moderately boudinaged and one vein is intruded by a 2- to 3-foot wide lamprophyre dike.
OWNERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT

LOCATION
The Price-Logan occurrence is located near the northeast shore of Car Lake in the northwest corner of Skinner Township.
The occurrence is presently encompassed by 4 patented mining claims KRL 10869, 10870, 10871, and 10872 (formerly KRL 4743, 4742, 4693 and 4694) which adjoin the Bathurst Mine property situated west of Car Lake. The trenches and pits at the occurrence are situated at the northeast corner of patented mining claim KRL 10891 (formerly KRL 4693).
DESCRIPTION
Regional Structures
The Price-Logan occurrence is situated within the east-northeast-trending Swain Lake deformation zone (Fyon and Lane 1986).
Geology
Mafic, massive and pillowed metavolcanic flows of the Cycle II sequence (Thurston 1985) are intruded by coarse-grained gabbroic sills and by felsite dikes. Stratigraphy is north-trending and east-facing in the vicinity of the property.
The Price-Logan occurrence is approximately 1.6 km east of the contact between mafic metavolcanic rocks and granitic rocks of the Trout Lake batholith.
A 5 m wide shear zone striking 075 and dipping steeply to the north hosts gold mineralization at the Price-Logan occurrence. Mafic metavolcanic wall rocks within the shear zone are fissile, chloritized and talcose. Some wall rocks adjacent to the quartz veins have been silicified. The shear zone extends along the contact of a wide, sericitized, quartz porphyry dike.
Mineralization
Large pits and trenches have been sunk along a 1.5 m wide quartz-carbonate stringer zone within the shear zone. The discontinuous quartz-carbonate stringers are less than 20 cm wide and pinch and swell along strike. The quartz stringers contain minor amounts of disseminated pyrite, galena and fine visible gold. Sulphides are also disseminated amongst the sheared and altered wall rocks.

Potential economic Significance
"This group of claims is situated in the western part of Grace Lake. The rocks are basalts, acidic tuffs, and a small body of diorite. Seven veins were examined; six lie in the central and northern part of claim KRL10790, and the last in the northeast corner of KRL10788.
No. l vein strikes N80°E, and dips 67°N. It is exposed continuously for 300 feet [90m], varies in width from 5 to 18 inches [13 to 46 cm], and is composed of a moderately coarse-grained, glassy, light grey quartz cemented by a finer quartz and siderite. In narrow sections considerable orthoclase occurs. A trace of gold was found.
No. 2 veins (sic) is about 400 feet [120m] long and lies 55 feet north of No. l and approximately parallels it, dipping 60 N. It cuts a small, dark grey diorite dike.
No. 3 vein is about 1000 feet [300m] long, strikes N70°E, and dips 45°N. At the west end it consists of a number of stringers about 2 inches [5cm] wide, which appear to be barren, but contain a small amount of tourmaline. A few chains east the vein is about 2 feet [0.6m] wide and follows the south or foot wall of a dioritic sill. The vein contains inclusions of the diorite, which, in turn, contains inclusions of the rhyolitic wall rock. A pit shows the vein to be about a foot [0.3m] wide in the diorite, which is about 6 feet [1.8m] wide. The cribbing obscures a deformation zone in which the east portion of the vein is offset 4 feet [1.2m] north. Several irregular quartz stringers occur in this zone and unite immediately to form the easterly continuation of the vein. The vein carries some fine pyrite as does the diorite hanging wall. In this section the J the vein is exposed almost continuously for a distance of 150 feet [45.7m]. Farther east it becomes a series of small stringers and also a vein breccia.
Vein Nos. 4, 5, and 6 are quite small and have been exposed for a length of only a few feet.
Vein No. 7 has been tested by several trenches and three pits over a length of 800 feet [240m]. At the west end of this vein is a rusty, carbonated silicified zone in chlorite schist, striking about S25°E and dipping about 80°S. The central part of the zone is a silicified yellowish" schist, slightly mineralized with fine pyrite and arsenopyrite. Two chains east, siderite stringers in schist are cut by minute quartz veinlets carrying pyrite. At the east end, a pit 20 feet [6m] deep shows at the bottom a shear zone 2 feet [0.6m] wide in a carbonated and silicified yellowish grey schist. Traces of chalcopyrite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite occur, and gold is reported from the pit. A 2½ foot [0.67m] chip sample taken from the bottom assayed one-tenth of an ounce gold."
Stevens Lake Option Agreement - Central/Goodall Claims
Location and Access
The property lies to the west and north of Woman Lake (figure 1). The reported showings lie around Stevens Lake, a small lake situated a kilometre east of Woman Lake (figure 2).
Logging roads, extending northwards from the old South Bay Mine site, lie within two kilometres of the east property boundary, however, several small lakes and connecting creeks complicate access from this direction. Logging roads along the west side Woman Lake (Joyce and Spud roads) reach within 500 m of Shanty Bay on the SW side of the lake. This option requires a 50 km drive, half kilometre walk to the lake and a further 10 km up the lake to the property.
Kabeelo’s lodge (807-222-3246), lying ~20 km to southsouthwest on the westernmost tip of Confederation Lake, offers Beaver charters and accommodation, including meals. Docking may be problematic if there are significant southwesterly or westerly winds. Alternatively a boat and motor can be rented from Woman River Camp, a 10 km drive west of Kabeelo’s, (Paul & Debbie; Info@WomanRiver.com, Phone 807-221-6570 (party line) or cell 807-221-6570 (leave a message)). Estimated travel time is about 45 minutes. Numerous beaver slides on the east shore of Woman Lake opposite the showings provide convenient landing spots.
Cover comprises first growth black spruce with thick moss under cover with local areas of blow-down. Old stumps and occasional plastic pipe indicate areas of historic exploration activity which are obscured by second growth. Three of four showing areas sought were located with little difficulty, however, only one “shear” was located due to a thick moss cover.

Existing or potential economic significance
ZONE 1 (on Claims KRL 509733, 34 and KRL 526683)
This zone has been exposed over a length of 3,800 feet by 16 trenches. In 1958, Madsen Red Lake GML drilled one hole under “Trenches A-D”, totalling 178 feet cutting the shear zone 60 feet below surface (0.046 oz/T Au over 15 feet). Between trenches A to K, the trend of the shear changes from an E-W strike west of trench D to N75°E between trench D-J and finally to N60°E east of trench J. The dip remains nearly vertical.
The shear is generally well silicified and locally, as in pit H and G, a silicified-feldspar zone reaches 13 feet wide and in pit J, the quartz-ankerite vein is six feet wide. Arsenopyrite and pyrite mineralization occurs throughout the shear, especially in the sheared andesite near the quartz veins or silicified sections. Arsenopyrite needles measuring 2 cm are present in pit L, 200 feet east of pit K.
Gold is found in all trenches but its grade is generally low (less than 0.05 oz/T). The highest gold values obtained seem to be closely related to the points of inflexion, that is, where the shear changes in direction, as in the vicinity of trenches D-E and of trench J. Three ore shoots, of unknown width and length are observed from surface sampling.
These are:
i) Trenches A and B area, over a 30 foot long (open to the west) and a possible width of at least six feet.
ii) Trenches D and E area, 75 feet east of (i), has a possible length of 60 feet and 15 feet breath. Hole 59-1 (Madsen, 19) cut 0.046 oz/T Au. over 15 feet.
iii) Trenches J and L area, of unknown extent but with a minimum width of six feet.
Five short diamond drill holes (G-80-1 to 5; 761’) were completed over a 1,300-foot strike length.
·
Hole G-80-1 intersected a 30 foot silicified shear (103 to 134 feet) zone which returned a 15 foot section at 0.06 oz/T Au.
·
Holes G-80-2, 3 and 4 intersected the shear zone, but with no or only low values and narrow sections of gold bearing rock.
·
Hole G-80-5 intersected a carbonated shear zone from 91 to 109 feet with up to 201 sulphides (pyrite and minor arsenopyrite). This zone assayed only trace of gold. A section, from 135 to 201 feet is characterized by narrow shear zones and quartz-carbonate veins with minor pyrite. A 22 inch section returned .05 oz/T Au at 159 feet.
The results obtained from these five holes give only an objective comprehension of the gold occurrences in this zone, which seems to be controlled by the degree of silicification and of sulphide content.
ZONE 2 (On common boundary of Claim KRL 509733-34)
This zone is only exposed in two trenches covering an area of approximately 50 feet. It is located 500 feet north of Zone 1 and is very similar in nature.
The shear zone is three feet wide and is almost completely replaced by a quartz-ankerite vein. The host rock is a coarse grained andesite with 3-5% pyrite and minor pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena.
Interesting gold and silver values have been obtained from two grab samples.
ZONE 3 (On Claim KRL 509737)
This zone is exposed at two localities by trenches for a strike length of 1,000 feet. The shear varies in strike from N62° to 72°E and dips from 70 to 85°N. The zone consists of schistose, friable, fine grained andesite and spherulitic andesite with several quartz-ankerite veins varying from l inch to over one foot wide.
Hole 59-7 of Madsen was drilled to test this vein at a depth of 25 feet below surface. J.L. Morton (Madsen Red Lake GML) reported that a six-foot wide shear zone was exposed in the trench. Quartz veining on the shear contact assayed from 1.00 to 1.84 oz/T Au over approximately 2 inches while the sheared andesite assayed 0.01 oz/T Au. The best values obtained in hole 59-7 was 0.06 oz/T Au over 9 inches.
ZONE 4 (On Claim KRL 509739)
This zone is the west extension of the Ben Rouillard showing. (Refer to sketches 3 and 4). The zone has been followed for 1,100 feet on strike by trenches. The strike varies from N82°E to S80°2 and dips from 77°N to vertically. The zone consists of sheared andesite varying from 2.5 to 5 feet wide with several narrow quartz stringers containing from 5 to 25% sulfides (pyrite-arsenopyrite).
ZONE 5 (On Claim boundary of KRL 509738 and KRL 526684)
A 100 foot long by one foot wide shear zone in fine grained, dark green, carbonatized intermediate andesite is exposed for approximately 40 feet by trenches. In the trenches, a 3 inch quartz vein, at its maximum width, is well mineralized with fine grained sphalerite, galena and free gold. It seems the previous work here involved some high-grading.
The shear strikes N64°E and dips vertically to 70°S. To the northeast, the quartz vein splits into several quartz stringers. To the southwest, the shear lies under the overburden.
Zones 3 and 5 are on strike to each other, and the possibility of them being the same should be investigated.
ZONE 6 (On Claim KRL 526684)
This 5 to 8 foot wide sheared andesite-rhyolite zone strikes N60-66°W and dips 60°NE. The shear includes 5-8% sulphides and quartz veins and silicified sections. To the northwest, a one foot offshoot of the main shear has been stripped and exposed several quartz stringers.
The gold values are common to the shear as a whole (6-8 feet) and is consistent over a length of at least 50 feet.

History
The Rattlesnake Hills were prospected in the late 1800s and early 1900’s when a number of pits and shallow workings were dug. Not much of interest was found, as no mining district was ever organized in this are, nor were the Rattlesnake Hills included in any other mining district.
Modern prospecting activity in the Rattlesnake Hills began in 1982 when anomalous gold was found associated with sulfide hosted in a metachert exhalite at the Lost Muffler prospect along UT Creek by a Wyoming State geologist (Hausel and Jones, 1982). Gold was also found in quartz veins, breccias, and stockworks hosted in Archean rocks. Later investigations found Tertiary volcanic rocks and breccias to be gold-bearing also. According to Hausel (1996) several companies investigated gold potential in the Rattlesnake Hills after 1982 but only two, Newmont Exploration (“Newmont”) and American Copper and Nickel (“ACNC”) continued with sustained exploration programs leading to drill testing. Between 1983 and 1987 ACNC is reported to have drilled 9825 ft. in 32 drill holes. Newmont completed 14 drill holes totaling 10,705 ft between 1993 and 1995. By the end of Newmont’s interest in the Rattlesnake Hills, a low grade, non-compliant “resource” had reportedly been outlined (Hausel, 1996).
It is believed that virtually all the work including drilling was confined to the area where claims and leases are now held by Evolving Gold Corp. It is unknown whether any of the geochemical sampling completed by ACNC or Newmont occurred on ground now under option to Big Bear Mining.
Glasscock optioned the properties to Crescent Resources in August, 2009. Crescent completed a preliminary work program consisting of reconnaissance geology and sampling, orientation soil sampling, and stream sediment and ground magnetic surveys on parts of the property.
In the 1950’s the igneous petrology of the Tertiary alkaline and calc-alkaline plugs in the Rattlesnake Hills was investigated first by Carey (1954, 1959) and later by Pekarek (1974, 1977), both of whom were graduate students at the University of Wyoming, Laramie. More recently Hoch and Frost (1993) described the igneous petrology of nearly 50 mid-Tertiary sills, dikes, stocks, and plugs in the Rattlesnake Hills. In 1994 G. Langstaff of the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado conducted geologic mapping as a graduate student. This work led to publication of several maps by the Wyoming State Geological Survey (WSGS) (see Langstaff, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, and 1994d).
Beginning in 1982 the Wyoming State Geological Survey (WSGS) investigated the potential for gold mineralization in the Rattlesnake Hills as part of regional work funded by the University of Wyoming’s Mining and Mineral Resource and Research Institute (Hausel and Jones, 1982). In 1992 and 1993 supracrustal rocks and Tertiary volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of the Rattlesnake Hills were geologically mapped by the WSGS (Hausel, 1996). At the same time, reconnaissance and prospect rock geochemical sampling was conducted. Most of the samples were collected south of the Crescent Property but at least one sample was collected on ground now part of the RHN Property. WSGS compilations of regional geologic mapping of the Rattlesnake Hills were initially published by Hausel and Sutherland (2003) and more recently a geologic map of the Barlow Gap Quadrangle (see Figure 1 for location) was completed in cooperation with the US Geological Survey (Sutherland and Hausel, 2005).
Present Condition
The registrants plans for the Rattlesnake Hills claims in 2012 are to conduct additional soil sampling and build on the 2010 drill program.
Existing or potential economic significance
The Rattlesnake Hills Properties were initially acquired because they ground encompass what was thought to be geologically similar to rocks hosting the historic Newmont showing and then emerging news released by Evolving Gold.
Crescent Resources conducted a reconnaissance - level exploration program September - November, 2009 focusing primarily on the DC, SR, QL, and BG claim blocks.
Significant indicators of interest include rock and soil sample geochemical anomalies.
DC Claims
The DC claims encompass three large and three smaller Eocene - aged phonolite intrusives and one trachyte intrusive emplaced into Archean suprucrustal rocks. Contacts are covered by extensive talus and alluvial areas in most cases. Reconnaissance rock samples were collected. Three volcanic breccia samples thought to possibly represent diatreme contained 32 ppb to 42 ppb Au. An additional sample of Archean metabasalt limonitic fault breccia contained 452 ppb Au. Two soil geochemistry lines (43 samples) identified two anomalous Au intervals with samples containing up to 27 ppb and 43 ppb Au.
BG Claims
The BG claims encompass a quartz latite intrusive complex intruded into Archean - aged granitic gneiss.
Twenty-nine reconnaissance rock samples were collected. Two samples contained 25 ppb and 30 ppb Au, four samples contained values between 0.5 ppm and1.3 ppm Ag, four samples contained 2.8 ppm to 7.7 ppm Ag, and three more samples contained 16.3 ppm to 58.3 ppm Ag. Five of these samples also were enriched in Pb (87 ppm - 507 ppm) and zinc (192 ppm - 909 ppm). Anomalous Ag (+/- Pb+Zn+Au) samples were collected from weakly to moderately silicified quartz latite porphyry along two structural zones.
QL Claims
The QL claims cover approximately 2,000 acres and encompass an area where two regional faults intersect, the northeast trending UT Creek Fault and the East trending North Granite Mountain Fault. A quartz latite stock is intruded along the UT Creek Fault. Rock samples were collected from iron-oxidized, fractured metabasalts and graywackes lying adjacent to UT Creek including the western edge of the quartz latite stock. Forty six reconnaissance rock samples were collected from the claim block; One sample from an easterly trending fault contained 739 ppb Au and three samples collected adjacent to the quartz-latite stock contained gold values of 234, 56, and 28 ppb Au. Anomalous Cu values were widespread; 19 samples contained greater than 60 ppm including seven samples ranging from 248 ppm to 776 ppm, three samples ranging from 1,225 ppm to 3,470 ppm and three more containing values from 14,550 ppm to 33,370 ppm copper.
Lewiston Claims

History
The Lewiston gold district is of a type of gold occurrence called a greenstone shear zone hosted vein deposit. These deposits have been prolific gold producers throughout the world. Archean rocks in Wyoming are exposed due to large scale Laramide faulting that created the Wind River Mountains to the north of Lewiston. Gold was discovered at South Pass (7 miles to the west) in the 1867 and at Lewiston in 1895. There is no documented gold production from the district but reports and newspaper articles describe gold in quartz veins with some workings (Hidden Hand) having spectacular ore specimens. A total of 200,000 ounces may have been mined from the Lewiston district.
The Lewiston district has not been drilled. The only drill program of substance was carried out by The Anaconda Company in the early 1970’s at South Pass on the Carissa Mine. Of note is that every Anaconda drill hole encountered gold mineralization, with the average grade 0.20 ounce per ton.
The Lewiston mining district occurs within a complex sequence of Archean, volcano-sedimentary rocks, exposed along the southeastern margin of the Wind River Mountains. Regional mapping has subdivided the stratigraphy into three groups that define a major synform, trending northeast and plunging gently to the southwest. Lewiston occurs on the eastern limb of the regional synform.
Auriferous quartz veins are hosted in shear zones within a thick, greywacke sequence of the Miners Delight Formation, often at the contact with heterogeneous amphibolite units. These concordant amphibolites are in part, igneous bodies and in part, interlayered, metamorphosed, chemical and clastic sediments.
Previous workers at Lewiston have identified two gold targets from surface exposures of shear zones. 1.) Mulit-stage quartz veins 1.5 to 2.5 meters in width with strike lengths of 30 to 150 meters and grades of 3 to 22 grams of gold per tonne and 2.) disseminated gold in shear zones as demonstrated by US Borax’s work at the Ruby Mine Wolf ?where sampling yielded 8 meters at 3.6 g/t gold.
Multi-staged quartz veins were mapped by Anaconda and at least four events are recognized:
·
Initial quartz veining may be present that pre-dates the earliest deformation.
·
Close folding, locally isoclinal, of quartz veins and host sediments; axial planar to the dominate north east foliation.
·
Renewed shearing and emplacement of foliation parallel quartz veins.
·
A final shearing event, slivering the foliation parallel veins.
Anaconda concluded that available data suggested the highest gold values are associated with quartz fissure veins in areas that have been affected by late-stage, brittle deformation.
Vein mineralization is simple with quartz dominate and accompanied by accessory biotite, apple green epidote, sericite, and limonite after sulfides.
The Wolf mine, under lease by BBMC was sampled by US Borax in 1984 and results showed a composite zone 8 meters wide that averaged 3.6 g/t gold. Surface sampling and mapping extended the shear for 800 meters along strike. Gold occurs as quartz stringers in a meta-greywacke exposed in numerous pits and near the shaft collar.
Golden Predator’s processor company Energy Metals completed a drilling application with the BLM to drill the Wolf claims in 2005 but did not complete the project.
Present state of Property
The Company's plans for 2012 for Lewiston is to conduct further geologic mapping and sampling, geophysics, and to initiate a drill program by year end.
Potential economic Significance
Lewiston is the rare gold property in that it has not been drill tested and hosts gold in a setting that has produced many gold deposits (Archean shear zone hosted - see attached paper). The historical gold workings on the property are good initial drill targets - this is a drill ready property with excellent access in a mine friendly state.
