Footnotes to Property List (dollars in thousands except per square foot amounts):
(a)
Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases expiring December 31, 2012 aggregating 378,901 square feet (representing 1.2 percent of the Company’s total net rentable square footage) for which no new leases were signed.
(b)
Total base rent for 2012, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which includes the effects of tenant concessions, such as free rent. Substantially all of the leases provide for annual base rents plus recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant’s proportionate share of and/or increases in real estate taxes and certain operating costs, as defined, and the pass through of charges for electrical usage. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total escalations and recoveries from tenants were: $71,524, or $3.25 per leased square foot, for office properties; $9,672, or $2.19 per leased square foot, for office/flex properties and $405, or $1.02 per leased square foot for other properties. Office properties include $45 pertaining to properties held for sale, which are classified as discontinued operations in financial statements.
(c) Excludes space leased by the Company.
(d)
Base rent for 2012 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2012.
(e)
Total base rent for 2012 minus total 2012 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP, divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2012.
(f)
This property is located on land leased by the Company.
(g)
