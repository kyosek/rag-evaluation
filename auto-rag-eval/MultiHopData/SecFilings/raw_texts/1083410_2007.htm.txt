Description of Properties
Office Premises
We conduct our activities from our principal and technical office located at 18, 80 Furmanova Str, Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan. We believe that these offices are adequate for our purposes. We do not own any real property or significant assets. Management believes that this space will meet our needs for the next 12 months.
Mining Properties
Our properties are in the preliminary exploration stage and do not contain any known bodies of ore.
We conduct exploration activities from our principal and technical office located at 18, 80 Furmanova Str, Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan. The telephone number is (+7) 327-2611 026. We believe that these offices are adequate for our purposes and operations.
Our strategy is to concentrate our efforts on: (i) existing operations where an infrastructure already exists; (ii) properties presently being developed and/or in advanced stages of exploration which have potential for additional discoveries; and (iii) grass-roots exploration opportunities.
We are currently concentrating our property exploration activities in the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
Our properties are in the exploration stage only and are without a known body of mineral reserves. Development of the properties will follow only if satisfactory exploration results are obtained. Mineral exploration and development involves a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There is no assurance that our mineral exploration and development activities will result in any discoveries of commercially viable bodies of mineralization. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our exploration programs, which may be affected by a number of factors. Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
We currently have an interest in three (3) projects, two located in the Tomask Oblast region in the Russian Federation and one located in the Republic of Kazakhstan. We have conducted only preliminary exploration activities to date and may discontinue such activities and dispose of the properties if further exploration work is not warranted.

Haldeevskaya License
The Haldeevskaya exploration license covers an area of 576 km2 and is located approximately 16 kilometres NE from Tomsk via paved highway. Excellent infrastructure is currently in place, including, maintained tarmac access roads, high tension power lines at 500 kilowatts per line, gravel vehicular access roads over the project area with close-spaced, 100 metre, cut lines over the target areas. The area is also close to the railheads in Tomsk, with links to the Trans Siberian Railway, and all infrastructures associated with a regional centre.
Geology of Haldeevskaya area is represented by the mid Devonian volcanogenic-sedimentary sediments of the Mitrofan suite, terrigenous (“black shale”) sediments of the Jurginsk, Pachinsk, Salamat suites of upper Devonian, and the Yarsk, Lagernosadsk stratus of the lower Carboniferous age. The rock formations are deformed into the linear folds with the north-north-eastern strike and they are cut by the series of longitudinal, lateral and diagonal fractures of different type and order. The area is located at the front zone of the Tomsk thrust above the granitoid intrusions that are inferred by geophysics. Dolerite and Monzonite dikes intrude Paleozoic rocks forming the series of dike zones with a north-western trend with an echelon-like arrangement of some dikes and their groups. Mineralisation is focussed into areas associated with the thrusting. Towards the end of 19th and first half of the 20th centuries the region was one of the most prolific gold mining spots in Russia. The coarse gold was panned from the Tom river and the numerous drainage systems around the city of Tomsk. In late 1980 Geosphera made its first gold discoveries in hard rock. As a result of the geochemical and geophysical surveys a series of 6 highly prospective gold soil anomalies have been outlined Of the 6 large anomalies the area currently considered the most perspective are the Semiluzhenskoye, Verkhnekamensk and Sukhorechenskoye prospects. The Verkhnekamensk anomaly is located in the eastern part of the Haldeiskaja license on the tectonic contact between the clay shales and volcanics. As a result of the litho-geochemical, geological and geophysical studies, conducted by Cigma, two mineralized zones of east-west strike have been outlined and plotted at 1:20,000. These zones were traced across the area for 3 kilometres with widths ranging from 250 to 700 meters. Within these zones 3 anomalies were found and appear prospective for gold mineralization. The first diamond drilling program has outlined vast areas of hydrothermal alteration, preliminary mineralogical investigations have discovered free gold in drill core from the upper part of the mineralization zone.
Tugojakovsk License
The Tugojakovsk exploration license covers an area of 164 km2 and is located 25 kilometres SE from the regional centre of Tomsk via paved highway. An excellent infrastructure is in place including excellent sealed roads, close access to railheads and the infrastructure associated with the regional centre of Tomsk.
The geology of Tugojakovsk area is represented by the sedimentary rock formations of Carboniferous age composed of carbonaceous shales, siltstones and sandstones united under the common term "black shale". The rocks are deformed into linear folds and cut by the series of longitudinal, lateral and diagonal faults. The dolerite and monzonite dikes intrude Palaeozoic rocks forming a series of dike zones controlling quartz stock works with gold mineralization.
The Baturinsk occurrence, located within the Tugojakovsk license is composed of a series silicified shear zones (mylonite zones) consisting of numerous, locally intense, small quartz veinlets carrying gold. The surrounding geological units are composed of mineralised carbonaceous shales.

September 2007 Quarter
In September 2007 quarter the company continued drilling on Berezki East, Quartzite Gorka, Beskauga prospects and commenced drilling on Anino-Nikolaevo prospect.
Anino-Nikolaevo (AN) Copper-Gold Prospect
Primary Geology & Infrastructure
Anino-Nikolaevo is represented by two sections Anino & Nikolaevo located in same fault zone and distanced from each other by 2.5km.
The Anino mineralization is situated in a linear zone of brecciaed and silicified andesite tuffs. The length of the zone at the surface is 230m by width 5 to 20m. Strong malachite mineralization is presented at the surface and in historical trenches and shallow pits.
Anino-Nikolaevo is located 93km from Ekibastuz town and only 3km from bitumen road and high voltage power line.
Exploration works & results
The interesting results have been achieved only in 2 out of 11 drill holes. DDH#2 on Fence #2 has obtained and interval of 16.5 m at 2.65% copper. DDH #4 on Fence #3 has intersected 63m at 1.25% copper and was apparently drilled in dip direction. The entire length of traced mineralization was only 70m. Thus the Anino zone is represented by pocket-like copper accumulations and therefore is not interested for further exploration.
Nikolaevo zone is represented by bulk pyrite mineralization in andesite tuffs. Quite high gold grades (up to 17g/t) were defined in grab and channel samples from historic trenches. The company has drilled 12 diamond drill holes to trace these gold grades. However in all drill holes the gold grades varied from 0.05g/t to 0.6g/t only. Apparently high gold grades at the surface are related to sporadic gold accumulations in weathering crust.
December 2007 Quarter
In December 2007 quarter the Company continued infill and extension drilling on Berezki East and Beskauga prospects and collected two small (12kg each) metallurgical samples on Ushtogan prospect.
Primary Geology & Infrastructure
Ushtogan is situated in South-West corner of the license area and is represented by linear system of quartz veining with gold mineralization discovered and partially explored by trenches and drilling still in Soviet times.
Exploration works & results
Geological mapping carried out by Dostyk on Ushtogan was associated with re-sampling of trenches. The assays have confirmed presence of gold in trenches on zone length over 350m by width 2 to 14m. The gold grades vary from 0.1g/t to 12g/t averaging 2.5g/t. The prospect was prepared for drilling in 2008. Two small metallurgical samples were processed for gold recovery by means of cyanidation. As a results there have been achieved positive gold recovery of 81% and 82% respectively by crushing size 200 mesh.
