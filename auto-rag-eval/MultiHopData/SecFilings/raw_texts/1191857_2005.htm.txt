Item 2. PROPERTIES
We maintain our corporate headquarters and conduct our operations at the following facilities:
We believe the 335,000 square foot corporate headquarters, printing and manufacturing property and the Blasdell property have been adequately maintained, are in generally good condition and are suitable for our business as presently conducted. We also believe our existing facilities provide sufficient production capacity for our present needs and for our anticipated needs in the foreseeable future. The Company entered into a forty-nine year lease for the 230,000 square feet of office and warehouse buildings in November 2003. These buildings are adjacent to our corporate headquarters, printing and manufacturing property and were acquired for potential expansion of such facilities. In 2004, we undertook a survey of these buildings, developed a rehabilitation program, and spent $0.9 million in connection with this program. In 2005, we spent $1.7 million in connection with this rehabilitation program. Currently, much of this space is being rented to third parties. We have plans to continue additional rehabilitation over the next several years. The timing of these future rehabilitation expenditures will be based on our anticipated facility requirements.
There are no material pending legal proceeding to which the Registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject.

MARKET FOR THE COMPANY’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
On March 14, 2003, the Company was spun-off from Astronics Corporation in a tax-free distribution to the shareholders of Astronics Corporation and became listed on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol MPAC. Except for a special $7,000,000 dividend paid to Astronics Corporation on December 31, 2002, in connection with its spin-off from Astronics, the Company has not paid any cash dividends in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. It has no plans to pay dividends as it plans to retain all cash from operations as a source of capital to finance growth in the business. As of March 2, 2006, there were approximately 642 registered shareholders for the Company’s Common Stock and 591 registered shareholders for the Class B stock.
Quarterly information for each quarterly period during 2005 and 2004 on the range of prices for the Company’s Common Stock appears in the following table:

Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption “Forward-Looking Information” in Item 1.
Overview
Our strategy for returning to growth is continuing to gain market share in the custom folding cartons business and aggressively entering the commercial print market by serving the largest print distributors and internet print providers while capturing direct customers in select markets. We believe the commercial print industry will continue consolidating and, given our operational expertise to serve multitudes of large orders on a rapid, profitable basis, we can rapidly gain market share. We believe we can effectively challenge other printer businesses because we offer faster speed, higher variability and flexibility and can capitalize on our “Superprint” facility’s economies of scale to offer competitive prices with better margins than those printers whose business models are based on long lead-times and large production runs or those lacking the depth in capabilities and sufficient scale to profitably serve such a diverse marketplace. During the period of 2003 through 2005 reviewed in the following discussion, our operations have been significantly influenced by the activities associated with our supply agreements with VistaPrint Limited. In 2005, we lost VistaPrint’s business to its decision to produce its print products in house, however, we had stepped up our sales and marketing efforts to expand our existing custom folding carton market and to build new market opportunities for our commercial print products. We anticipate expenditures for sales and marketing to continue into 2006, however, we anticipate there should be reductions in our sales and marketing spending of approximately $1.0 million as a result of not having the marketing activities associated with the launch of our web-to-print store, www.printlizard.com. We anticipate 2006 to be a transition year as we build volume to fill the capacity vacated by our former customer.
Revenue
2005 compared with 2004
For fiscal 2005, revenue was $71.2 million compared with $50.3 million in 2004, an increase of $20.9 million or 41.6%. Included in 2005 and 2004 revenue was $19.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, associated with the contract buy-out fee received from our former customer. Excluding the revenue related to the contract buy-out fee, 2005 revenue was $51.6 million compared with $47.8 million in 2004.
The custom folding cartons product line had sales of $23.6 million in 2005, up $5.8 million, or 32.7%, from $17.8 million in 2004. Approximately 58% of this increase came from new customers, while 42% came from higher volumes with existing customers.
Commercial print-on-demand product line sales were down $2.1 million, or 12.8%, to $14.4 million in 2005 from $16.5 million in 2004. Until the fourth quarter of 2005, commercial print product sales were, for the most part, to VistaPrint.
During the first eight months of 2004, MOD-PAC’s contract with VistaPrint was based on a long-term cost recovery approach with the terms of the agreement stretching until April 2011. VistaPrint was billed for the costs in our plant that were dedicated to their production requirements plus a one-third mark-up on product fulfillment. On September 1, 2004, this arrangement was revised to a more traditional customer/vendor supply arrangement with the definitive term of the agreement changed to one year, through August 31, 2005. The pricing structure was changed as well to a units-based approach. As a part of the restructuring of the agreement, MOD-PAC received payment of $22 million from VisatPrint as a buy-out fee for the remaining years of the original contract. This fee was to be amortized over a 36-month period, which was defined by the 12-month definitive term of the new agreement that was effective September 1, 2004 and the 24-month period for which a pricing framework was described in this agreement relative to any subsequent agreements. On April 15, 2005, MOD-PAC agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement that was effective September 1, 2005, which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the North American market. As a result of the amendment, VistaPrint was allowed to produce and ship product to its North American customers from
its Windsor, Ontario plant prior to August 31, 2005, the expiration of the supply agreement. In exchange, MOD-PAC received payments that approximated MOD-PAC’s fixed costs and mark-up on such costs for the actual products VistaPrint shipped. During the period April 15, 2005 through the termination of the supply agreement at August 31, 2005, MOD-PAC received $2.2 million in payments from VistaPrint. Simultaneously, the Company executed a supply agreement with VistaPrint for the 12-month period ending August 30, 2006. This agreement established unit pricing for volumes above $750,000 per month, while for volumes below that threshold, a low volume surcharge was put into place. VistaPrint, however, was not obligated to purchase printed products from MOD-PAC under this agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2005, given the conclusion that the Company does not anticipate any future sales to VistaPrint, the remaining $14.1 million of the unamortized portion of the contract buy-out fee was recognized as revenue.
2005 net sales in MOD-PAC’s stock box product line remained flat year-over-year at $9.8 million, while the personalized print product line realized a slight increase of $0.1 million in net sales to $3.4 million in 2005, from $3.3 million in 2004.
2004 compared with 2003
For fiscal 2004, revenue was $50.3 million compared with $41.2 million in 2003, an increase of $9.1 million or 22%. Commercial print-on-demand, which had net product sales of $16.5 million in 2004, accounted for $2.9 million of this increase. This product line was up 21.3% from $13.6 million in 2003 sales. Revenue in 2004 also included $2.4 million associated with the amortization of the contract buy-out fee from VistaPrint.
The custom folding cartons product line had net sales of $17.8 million, up $3 million, or 20.3% from $14.8 million in 2003. Approximately 60% of this increase came from new customers with the balance of the increase coming from higher volume to existing customers.
Net sales in MOD-PAC’s stock box product line experienced a 3.2% increase of $0.3 million to $9.8 million in 2004 from $9.5 million in 2003. In 2004, personalized print net sales realized a slight increase of $0.1 million to $3.3 million from $3.2 million in 2003.
Cost of Products Sold
As a percentage of revenue, the cost of products sold were 60.3%, 73.6%, and 76.4% for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Excluding the amortization of the contract buy-out fee, the cost of products sold were 83.2%, 77.4%, and 76.4% for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Throughout the majority of this three-year period, we have added additional capacity measured both in terms of equipment and production hours available. In the first half of 2003, two high-speed presses were added, and by the second half of 2003, we were generally running three shifts a day. In 2004, another high-speed press was added, while we continued to increase the capabilities of our second and third shifts through increased supervision and production support, such as engineering, material handling, shipping and receiving. In 2005, additional machinery for finishing was purchased, including a stitchmaster, folder, and cutter that allows us to enlarge our portfolio of commercial print products. This aggressive ramp-up of capacity through the beginning of 2005 was undertaken both to successfully service the rapidly growing VistaPrint business and to address our strategic effort to aggressively enter the commercial print market. During the latter half of 2005, capacity was underutilized and pressure was placed on our cost of products sold. An increase in raw material costs and changing sales mix also contributed to the increase in costs.
The increase in cost of products sold, excluding the amortization of the contract buy-out fee, in 2005 to 83.2% of revenue from 77.4% of revenue in 2004 was primarily the result of increased raw material cost, changing sales mix, and investment in resources which supported previous VistaPrint business. With the loss of VistaPrint as a customer, the Company now has excess capacity, which we plan to use to reestablish growth in the commercial print business. The cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue in 2004, excluding the amortization of the contract buy-out fee, was 77.4% compared with 76.4% in 2003. The increase was a result of the costs associated with our increased capacity not recovered through volume increases and the effect on revenue related to the change in our billing structure with VistaPrint.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and administrative costs were 14.7%, 15.2%, and 15.0% for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Excluding the amortization of the contract buy-out fee, selling, general, and administrative costs were 20.5%, 16.0%, and 15.0% for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. The majority of selling, general and administrative costs were related to salaries and benefits for sales and administrative personnel, which have increased in order to develop our commercial print product line, salary adjustments and increased costs for benefits such as employee medical and dental. In addition, 2005 expenses were impacted by the increase in expenditures to develop and implement our web-to-print store, www.printlizard.com.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $216 thousand, $410 thousand and $245 thousand, respectively, in 2005, 2004, and 2003. The 2004 expense included $95 thousand reclassified from other comprehensive income related to a cash flow hedge on debt that was prepaid in 2004. The decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was a result of lower outstanding debt that was reduced with proceeds from the contract buy-out fee. The increase in 2004 from 2003 was a result of borrowings to fund the Company’s capital program.
Loss on Disposal of Assets
The loss on sale of assets of $101 thousand in 2003 resulted from the sale or disposal of mainly pre-press equipment and components, which became redundant as a result of the implementation of more advanced technology.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate was 38.0% in 2005, 29.7% in 2004, and 36.2% in 2003. The 2005 tax rate was higher than would be customary due to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to New York State Tax Credits. New York State enacted tax legislation resulting in a change to the New York State apportionment methodology. The enacted legislation will lower the apportionment of the Company’s taxable income to New York State and should result in lower New York State income taxes. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to use or realize New York State tax credits was reduced. As a result, the Company increased its valuation allowance reflecting an increase to income tax expense of approximately $696,000 in 2005. The 2004 tax rate was lower than customary due to the Company reducing its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as a result of realizing a portion of the deferred tax assets for the state tax credits.
Net Income
Net income in 2005 was $11.0 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 196.3%, over 2004’s net income of $3.7 million. This increase was mainly a result of $19.6 million of revenue recognized in 2005 related to the contract buy-out fee. In 2004, the Company recognized $2.4 million of revenue related to the contract buy-out fee. These increases were partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative costs related to the development of the Company’s Printlizard.com web-to-print store.
Net income in 2004 was $3.7 million, an increase of $1.7 million over 2003. This increase was primarily the result of increased sales in both the custom folding carton and commercial print product lines, as well as the recognition of $2.4 million of revenue related to the contract buy-out fee.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share (EPS) calculations prior to the spin-off reflect the shares and options outstanding had the Distribution occurred at the beginning of 2003. Shares used for the basic shares outstanding prior to the Distribution reflect the shares outstanding of Astronics Corporation factored by the distribution ratio. Since the date of the Distribution, the Company’s shares and dilutive stock options are used in the EPS calculations.
The dilutive earnings per share calculation for 2005 exclude 119,077 stock options that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased 100,328 shares of common stock, which was approximately 3% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the first quarter of 2005. These repurchases had a $0.08 per share favorable effect on 2005 basic and diluted earnings per share. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 2,555 shares of common stock. The purchase of this stock did not affect the results of the basic and diluted EPS calculations. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 290,232 shares of its common
stock, which was approximately 8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the third quarter. These repurchases had an $0.08 per share favorable affect on the 2005 basic EPS and a $0.07 per share favorable affect on the diluted EPS.
The diluted earnings per share calculation for 2004 exclude 24,094 stock options that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2004. Although the Company repurchased 133,829 shares of its common stock in 2004, 100,328 of the shares repurchased occurred in December 2004 and as a result, the 2004 repurchases did not affect the results of basic and diluted EPS calculations for 2004.
The diluted earnings per share calculation for 2003 exclude 54,052 stock options that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased 199,082 shares of its common stock, which was approximately 5% of the shares then outstanding. These repurchases had a $0.02 per share favorable effect on the 2003 basic and diluted EPS calculation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In 2005, cash used in operating activities was $2.8 million, $33.5 million less than the $30.6 million in cash generated in 2004. This decrease is primarily due to the receipt of the $22.0 million advance payment from VistaPrint in 2004 and the $7.5 million of income taxes paid in 2005 related to the receipt of this payment. In addition, lower net income, excluding the amortization of the buy-out fee, contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operations in 2005. In 2004, cash provided by operating activities was $30.6 million, $24.4 million more than the $6.2 million in 2003. This increase was primarily due to the $22.0 million advance payment received from VistaPrint, supplemented by a reduction in working capital components.
Capital expenditures in 2005 were $4.7 million compared with $6.3 million in 2004 and $8.6 million in 2003. Most of these expenditures were related to additional production equipment and, to a lesser extent, additional production facilities. Since the Company’s spin-off from Astronics in 2003, our high-speed press capacity has increased by 43% with the addition of three large format presses. In connection with these presses, substantial investment was made in pre-press and post-press equipment. During this time, four production lines were added which were based on leading edge digital press technology. Additionally, production, warehouse and office space were expanded at both of our production facilities in Western New York. At the main production facility, a 3.1-megawatt power plant was installed in 2003 that provides a more secure and stable source of electrical power to operate our production equipment than could have been achieved through the local utility. Capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to be substantially less and primarily related to maintenance. The Company anticipates up to approximately $1.0 million in capital spending for 2006.
The Company acquired temporary investments in 2004 of $12.2 million with its extra cash; $7.5 million of this was used in 2005 to pay income taxes above our regular requirements as all of the income taxes associated with the advanced contract buy-out fee were paid in 2005.
The Company borrowed $10.0 million on a term loan facility in 2003. The proceeds were used to pay amounts due Astronics and to fund capital expenditures. The term loan was paid in September 2004 with a portion of the advanced contract buy-out fee from VistaPrint.
A line of credit is available to MOD-PAC from a commercial bank for $6 million. We did not use the line of credit in 2005. The line of credit was used during 2003 and 2004, however, no amounts were outstanding on the line at December 31, 2003 and 2004. The line of credit is unsecured, and amounts outstanding, if any, bear interest generally based on LIBOR or the bank’s prime rate, at the Company’s option.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company expended $3.5 million, $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the repurchase of a total of 625,698 shares, or approximately 18.2% of total shares outstanding. In August of 2005, the Company received authorization from its Board to purchase an additional 200,000 shares for its share repurchase program. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s outstanding authorization for repurchase of shares is 100,885. The closing price of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2005 was $11.24. At this price, the repurchase of 100,885 shares would require $1,133,947.
At December 31, 2005, outstanding irrevocable letters of credit were $297,000.
We believe that cash on hand of $1.2 million at December 31, 2005, temporary investments of $2.7 million, cash flow
from operations, and the $6 million available on the line of credit are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, common stock redemptions and debt service for 2006. We expect to generate approximately break-even cash flow from operations in 2006, and expect capital expenditures up to approximately $1.0 million in 2006.
Contractual Obligations
(in thousands)
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The only off-balance sheet arrangements the Company has are operating leases for production equipment and a car lease. Rental expense under these non-cancellable leases was $498,000 in 2005, $492,000 in 2004, and $440,000 in 2003. Minimum future rental payments under non-cancellable operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2005 are: 2006, $498,000; 2007, $497,000; 2008, $445,000; 2009, $424,000; and thereafter, $354,000. The Company has the right to purchase the leased equipment for the fair market value at the end of the lease.
Relationship with VistaPrint Limited
The Company performed printing and order fulfillment services for VistaPrint Limited that resulted in revenue of $12,012,000 in 2005, $16,467,000 in 2004 and $13,631,000 in 2003. Accounts receivable from VistaPrint Limited at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $1,870,000 and $2,239,000 respectively, related to such services, and have subsequently been paid. There are no outstanding receivables from VistaPrint as of December 31, 2005. In 2005 and 2004, the Company also recognized $19,556,000 and $2,443,000 of revenue attributable to the amortization of the $22 million contract buy-out fee received on September 1, 2004 in connection with the new supply agreement. Robert S. Keane is a shareholder in and chief executive officer of VistaPrint Limited and is the son of Kevin T. Keane, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of MOD-PAC.
MOD-PAC had a supply agreement with VistaPrint Limited pursuant to which they were VistaPrint Limited’s exclusive North American supplier of printed products through August 30, 2005. This agreement, which was effective July 2004, set prices on a price per unit basis and provided a framework for pricing products covered by any renewals or extensions through August 2007. The unit prices were arrived at by reference to MOD-PAC’s fully burdened costs for products subject to the agreement, plus a 25% mark-up. The $22 million buyout fee that VistaPrint paid MOD-PAC on August 31, 2004 was negotiated between the two companies. The buyout fee was primarily associated with providing MOD-PAC cost recovery and profit on the production resources developed or acquired which were dedicated to the fulfillment of VistaPrint’s business in North America through 2011. This agreement replaced a previous supply agreement that extended to 2011, and whereby MOD-PAC charged VistaPrint on a cost plus one-third mark-up basis.
On April 15, 2005, the Company agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement with VistaPrint, which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the North American market. As a result, VistaPrint was allowed to produce and ship product to its customers in North America from its Windsor, Ontario plant prior to August 31, 2005, the expiration of the supply agreement, in exchange for payments to MOD-PAC that approximated MOD-PAC’s fixed costs and mark-up on such costs for the actual products VistaPrint ships. These payments totaled $2,154,000 in 2005.
Simultaneously, the Company executed a supply agreement with VistaPrint for the 12 month period ending August 30, 2006. This agreement established unit pricing for volumes above $750,000 per month, and for volumes below that threshold, a low volume surcharge was put into place. However, VistaPrint is not obligated to purchase printed products from MOD-PAC under this agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2005, given the final conclusion that the Company no longer expects to have sales to VistaPrint, the remaining $14.1 unamortized portion of the contract buy-out fee was recognized as revenue.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123(R) (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement 123(R) must be adopted no later than January 1, 2006, which is when the Company will adopt it.
As permitted by Statement 123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R)’s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Statement 123(R) allows for prospective adoption methods or restating prior years. The Company intends to apply the prospective method upon adoption. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Statement 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), no amounts of operating cash flows were recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” The amendments made by this statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and waste (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after November 2004. The Company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. In developing such estimates, management evaluates the facts known to it at the time and applies such facts within the framework of certain critical accounting policies that govern valuation allowances of the Company’s assets. These policies include determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to doubtful accounts receivable, lower of cost or market reserves related to the Company’s inventories, depreciation allowances, impairment reserves with respect to the Company’s long-lived assets and valuation allowances with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets. Often, management must make certain assumptions about the future when applying these policies. Management uses past experience in developing such assumptions about the future. Actual experience will be different than the assumptions made and the differences could result in material adjustments to management’s estimates.
Specifically and with respect to deferred tax assets, the Company had gross deferred assets at December 31, 2005 of $3.8 million related to New York State tax credits. These credits are subject to certain statutory provisions, such as length of available carry-forward period and minimum tax, which reduces the probability of realization of the full value of such credits. Management estimates the amount of credits the Company is likely to realize in the future based on actual historical realization rates and the statutory carry-forward period. As a result of the analysis performed as of December 31, 2005, management adjusted the valuation allowance for these credits to $3.8 million.
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a result of short cycle times, the Company does not have any long-term commitments to purchase production raw materials or sell products that would present significant risks due to price fluctuations. Raw paper stock is available to us from multiple domestic sources and, as a result, we believe the risk of supply interruptions due to such things as strikes at the source of supply or to logistics systems are limited.
Risks due to fluctuation in interest rates are not material to the Company at December 31, 2005, because we have no exposure to floating rate debt and limited market risk on our $2.7 million of temporary investments because interest is reset to market rates up to every 35 days.
Since May of 2003, over 90% of the Company’s power needs are met through natural gas. The Company has investigated supply contracts of various lengths; currently it has no supply arrangements for fixed prices. Historically, the price of natural gas has fluctuated widely. In the past 39 months, natural gas prices have been as low as $4.43 per decatherm and as high as $13.91 per decatherm, and it is currently trading around $7.10 per decatherm for April 2006 natural gas. A one-dollar per decatherm change in the price of natural gas would affect the Company’s annual net income by approximately $120,000. Although the Company is concerned about cost, and has from time to time acquired contracts for natural gas, its main concern is availability. The Company monitors the availability of natural gas, considering such factors as amount in storage, gas production data and transportation data, so that it can take appropriate action if concerns about availability occur. The Company has investigated and tested a back-up power source in the form of a rented transportable diesel-powered generator. Although such generators are generally available, the Company cannot be assured that a generator adequate to meet the Company’s needs would be available if and when such need should arise.
We have no foreign operations, nor do we transact any business in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we have no foreign currency market risks.
The market risk that the Company was exposed to at December 31, 2004 was generally the same as described above.
Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MOD-PAC CORP. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MOD-PAC CORP. at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Basis of Presentation
On March 14, 2003, MOD-PAC CORP. (the Company) was spun-off from Astronics Corporation by means of a tax-free distribution (the Distribution) of all of the outstanding shares of MOD-PAC CORP.’s common stock and Class B stock to Astronics shareholders. The Astronics Board of Directors set a one-for-two distribution ratio, in which (i) each Astronics common stock owner received one share of MOD-PAC CORP. common stock for every two shares of Astronics common stock owned on the record date for the Distribution and (ii) each Astronics Class B stock owner received one share of MOD-PAC CORP. Class B for every two shares of Astronics Class B stock owned on the record date for the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, MOD-PAC CORP. became a separately traded, publicly-held company.
Prior to the Distribution, the Company was recapitalized. Astronics exchanged its existing shares of our common stock for approximately 2,868,316 shares of our common stock and approximately 1,007,341 shares of our Class B stock. The accompanying financial statements give retroactive effect to this recapitalization.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue and Expense Recognition
The Company is a manufacturer and printer of folding cartons used primarily in the confectionary and consumer product markets. The Company also markets its printing and imprinting capabilities to the short-run commercial and the personalized print markets. Short-run commercial printing includes business cards, corporate stationery, marketing materials, booklets, calendars, annual reports, folders and direct mail post cards. Personalized printing and imprinting includes items used for social occasions and corporate events such as invitations, announcements and napkins. The vast majority of the Company’s sales are to customers in North America, although the Company often ships orders to destinations outside of North America on behalf of its North American customers.
Revenue is recognized on the accrual basis, which is at the time of shipment of goods, except for the advance payment received from VistaPrint, which was originally estimated to be amortized, on a straight - line basis, over 36 months from September 2004 through August 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2005, given the final conclusion that the Company would likely no longer have sales to VistaPrint, the remaining $14.1 million unamortized portion of the contract buy-out fee was recognized as revenue. There are no significant contracts allowing for right of return. A trade receivable is recorded at the value of the sale. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Amounts not collected from customers within 120 days of the due date of the invoice are credited to an allowance for doubtful accounts. After collection efforts have been exhausted, uncollected balances are charged off to the allowance. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 VistaPrint Limited accounted for 47.4%, 37.3% and 33.1%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in costs of products sold. Revenue excludes discounts.
All repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense. The Company does not provide services such as engineering or design for which it receives revenues.
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and were $1,056,000 in 2005, $187,000 in 2004 and $198,000 in 2003.
The Company accounts for its stock-based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and its related interpretations. The measurement prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 does not recognize compensation expense if the exercise price of the stock option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense related to stock options has been recorded in the financial statements.
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period. The Company’s pro forma information for the three years ended December 31, 2005 is presented in the table below:
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share computations are based upon the following table:
Earnings per share calculations prior to the spin-off reflect the shares and options outstanding had the Distribution occurred at the beginning of 2003. Shares used for the basic shares outstanding prior to the Distribution reflect the shares outstanding of Astronics Corporation factored by the distribution ratio. The net effect of dilutive stock options prior to the Distribution relates only to stock options held by employees of the Company and the Directors of Astronics. Since the date of the Distribution the Company’s shares and dilutive stock options are used in the EPS calculations. The diluted earnings per share calculations exclude 54,052 stock options that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2003, 24,094 stock options that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2004, and 119,077 stock option that were anti-dilutive at December 31, 2005.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: buildings, 10-40 years; and machinery and equipment,
3-10 years.
The costs of properties sold, or otherwise disposed of, and the accumulated depreciation thereon is eliminated from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Renewals and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are expensed.
Machinery and equipment includes $791,000 and $465,000 of unamortized computer software costs at December 31, 2005 and 2004 respectively. The depreciation expense related to the amortization of capitalized computer software costs for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $192,000, $13,000, and $0 respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if deemed necessary, by a valuation allowance for the amount of tax benefits not expected to be realized. The Company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Astronics Corporation through the date of the spin-off, however; income tax expense has been recorded on a separate return basis. Investment tax credits are recognized on the flow through method.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.
Temporary Investments
Temporary investments represent municipal or state agency debt securities that are classified as available for sale and are carried at market, which approximates cost, because these securities bear interest that is generally reset to market rates up to every 35 days. As a result of the periodic reset of the interest rates, no realized or unrealized gains or losses exist. The contractual maturities of such obligations range from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2036.
Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, temporary investments, receivables, accounts payable, and long-term debt. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments approximate fair value. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. Costs included in inventory are the cost to purchase the raw material, the direct labor incurred on work in progress and finished goods, and an overhead factor based on other indirect manufacturing costs incurred. Inventories at December 31, were as follows:
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Capital Stock
Class B Stock is identical to common stock, except Class B Stock has ten votes per share, and is automatically converted to common stock on a one-for-one basis when sold or transferred, and cannot receive dividends unless an equal or greater amount is declared on common stock. As of December 31, 2005, 1,033,907 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Class B stock and for options granted under the employee and director stock option plans.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used are initially recorded at cost. The carrying value of these assets is evaluated for recoverability whenever adverse effects or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognized if future undiscounted cash flows and earnings from operations are not expected to be sufficient to recover the long-lived assets. The carrying amounts are then reduced by the estimated shortfall of the discounted cash flows.
Other Comprehensive Income or Loss
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had an accumulated net loss in other comprehensive income related to a cash flow hedge, an interest rate option of $59,000 net of applicable income taxes. This accumulated net loss was being reclassified to interest expense over the term of the debt associated with the cash flow hedge. However, because the debt was paid in 2004 the entire amount was reclassified to interest expense. There were no hedging transactions in 2005.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123(Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement 123(R) must be adopted no later than January 1, 2006, which is when the Company will adopt it.
As permitted by Statement 123, the company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R)’s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Statement 123(R) allows for prospective adoption methods or restating prior years. The Company intends to apply the modified prospective method upon adoption. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Statement 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), no amounts of operating cash flows were recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” The amendments made by this statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
waste (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after November 2004. The Company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
3. Long-Term Debt
In November of 2003, the Company entered into a lease transaction, which gave it control of the real estate complex adjoining its main production facility. This complex consists of approximately 13 acres and buildings totaling approximately 270,000 square feet. It is a capital lease for accounting and financial reporting purposes, meaning that the land and buildings are capitalized and the building is amortized, while the lease obligation is treated as the equivalent of a mortgage note. The lease is for a term of forty-nine years with the option to buy the underlying real estate and terminate the lease in the 20th year. Lease payments are $155,000 annually for the first seven years, and $180,000 annually for the remainder of the lease. The purchase option in the twentieth year is $1.8 million, which represents the principal balance of the obligation. The carrying value of the underlying real estate, including improvements, was $4,376,000 at December 31, 2005. Amortization of such assets is included with depreciation and amortization in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Lease payments in each of the next five years are $155,000, and starting in November 2010, the lease payment will increase to $180,000 annually. The aggregate of the lease payments over the lease term is $8,645,000. The Company has non-cancelable sub-leases for space in the complex that have scheduled rents as follows over the next five years: $458,000 in 2006, $281,000 in 2007, $144,000 in 2008, $31,000 in 2009.
Long-term debt consists of the following:
Other long-term debt matures as follows: $87,000 in 2006, $37,000 in 2007, $19,000 in 2008, $20,000 in 2009, $21,000 in 2010 and $72,000 thereafter.

4. Operating Leases
The Company leases two pieces of production equipment under separate operating leases. Rental expense under these leases was $492,000 in 2005, $492,000 in 2004 and $440,000 in 2003. Minimum future rental payments under non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 31, 2005 are: 2006, $498,000; 2007, $497,000; 2008, $445,000; 2009, $424,000; 2010, $354,000. The Company has the right to purchase the leased equipment for the fair market value at the end of the lease.
5. Transactions with VistaPrint Limited
The Company performed printing and order fulfillment services for VistaPrint Limited that resulted in revenue of $12,012,000 in 2005, $16,467,000 in 2004 and $13,631,000 in 2003. Accounts receivable from VistaPrint Limited at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $1,870,000 and $2,239,000 respectively, related to such services, and have subsequently been paid. There are no outstanding receivables from VistaPrint as of December 31, 2005. In 2005 and 2004, the Company also recognized $19,556,000 and $2,443,000 of revenue attributable to the amortization of the $22 million contract buy-out fee received on September 1, 2004 in connection with the new supply agreement. Robert S. Keane is a shareholder in and chief executive officer of VistaPrint Limited and is the son of Kevin T. Keane, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of MOD-PAC.
MOD-PAC had a supply agreement with VistaPrint Limited pursuant to which they were VistaPrint Limited’s exclusive North American supplier of printed products through August 30, 2005. This agreement, which was effective July 2004, set prices on a price per unit basis and provided a framework for pricing products covered by any renewals or extensions through August 2007. The unit prices were arrived at by reference to MOD-PAC’s fully burdened costs for products subject to the agreement, plus a 25% mark-up. The $22 million buyout fee that VistaPrint paid MOD-PAC on September 1, 2004 was negotiated between the two companies. The buyout fee was primarily associated with providing MOD-PAC cost recovery and profit on the production resources developed or acquired which were dedicated to the fulfillment of VistaPrint’s business in North America through 2011. This agreement replaced a previous supply agreement that extended to 2011, and whereby MOD-PAC charged VistaPrint on a cost plus one-third mark-up basis.
On April 15, 2005, the Company agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement with VistaPrint, which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the North American market. As a result, VistaPrint was allowed to produce and ship product to its customers in North America from its Windsor, Ontario plant prior to August 31, 2005, the expiration of the supply agreement, in exchange for payments to MOD-PAC that approximated MOD-PAC’s fixed costs and mark-up on such costs for the actual products VistaPrint ships. These payments totaled $2,154,000 in 2005. Simultaneously, the Company executed a supply agreement with VistaPrint for the 12 month period ending August 30, 2006. This agreement established unit pricing for volumes above $750,000 per month, and for volumes below that threshold, a low volume surcharge was put into place. However, VistaPrint is not obligated to purchase printed products from MOD-PAC under this agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2005, given the final conclusion that the Company no longer expects to have sales to VistaPrint, the remaining $14.1 unamortized portion of the contract buy-out fee was recognized as revenue.
6. Stock Option and Purchase Plans
Prior to the Distribution, the Company’s employees participated in stock option plans sponsored by Astronics Corporation. In connection with the Distribution the Company granted, to its employees holding Astronics options, substitution options under its stock option plan. The substitution options preserve the intrinsic value of the Astronics options that were outstanding at the date of the Distribution. To determine the number and exercise price of the Company’s options to be substituted, the Company multiplied the number of shares purchasable under each Astronics stock option by a ratio determined at the time of the Distribution and divided the exercise price per share of each option by the same ratio. This ratio was determined by reference to the fair value of Astronics common stock and the Company common stock at the time of the Distribution, so as to equalize the intrinsic value of the option before and after the Distribution. Under SEC regulations, fair value for this purpose is defined as the first trade immediately following the distribution. Fractional shares were rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. The other
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
terms of the substituted options are the same as those in effect under the Astronics options immediately prior to the Distribution.
MOD-PAC CORP. established a Stock Option Plan that authorizes the issuance of 800,000 shares of Common Stock for the purpose of attracting and retaining executive officers and key employees, and to align management’s interests with those of the shareholders of MOD-PAC CORP. The options must be exercised no more than ten years from the grant date and vest over up to a five-year period. The exercise price for the options is equal to the fair market value as of the date immediately preceding the date of grant.
MOD-PAC CORP. established the Directors’ Stock Option Plan that authorizes the issuance of 200,000 shares of Common Stock for the purpose of attracting and retaining the services of experienced and knowledgeable outside directors, and to align their interest with those of its shareholders. The options must be exercised no more than ten years from the grant date and vest after six months. The exercise price for the options is equal to the fair market value at the date of grant.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003; risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, 4.5%, and 4.0% respectively; dividend yield of 0% for all three years; volatility factor of the expected market price of MOD-PAC common stock of .38, .36, and .35 respectively; and a weighted average expected option life of 7 years for all three years. The weighted average fair value at the grant date of options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $6.08, $3.92, and $2.76, respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
A summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 31 follows:
MOD-PAC CORP.

Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 range as follows:
MOD-PAC CORP. established the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to encourage its employees to invest in the Company. The plan provides employees that have been with the Company for at least a year the option to invest up to 20% of their cash compensation (up to an annual maximum of $20,000) in the Company’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock, determined each October 1. Employees are allowed to enroll annually. Employees indicate the number of shares they wish to obtain through the program and their intention to pay for the shares through payroll deductions over the annual cycle of October 1 through September 30. Employees can withdraw anytime during the annual cycle and all money withheld from the employee’s pay is returned with interest. If an employee remains enrolled in the program, enough money will have been withheld from the employee’s pay during the year to pay for all the shares that the employee opted for under the program. At December 31, 2005, employees have enrolled to purchase 15,940 shares at $9.25 per share on September 30, 2006.
7. Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes consists of the following:
The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:
On December 31, 2005, the Company had various state tax credit carry forwards of $5,703,000 ($2,350,000 in 2004) including approximately $2,090,000 of state investment tax credits expiring through 2019 and $3,613,000 of other business credits. In 2005, New York State enacted tax legislation resulting in a change to the New York State apportionment methodology. The enacted legislation will lower the apportionment of the Company’s taxable income to New York State and should result in lower New York State income taxes. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to use or realize New York State tax credits was reduced. As a result, the Company increased its valuation allowance reflecting an increase to income tax expense of approximately $696,000 in 2005. In 2004, the valuation allowance relates to such credits and was reduced by $130,000 as a result of realizing a portion of the deferred tax asset for the state tax credits. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2003 was $988,000.
8. Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan
Prior to the Distribution, the Company participated in the Astronics Qualified Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan. Subsequent to the Distribution, the assets in the Astronics Plan were transferred into the MOD-PAC CORP. Qualified Profit Sharing /401(k) Plan. Most of the Company’s full-time employees are eligible for annual contributions based on percentages of pre-tax income. In addition, employees may contribute a portion of their salary to the 401(k), which is partially matched by the Company. The plan may be amended or terminated at any time. Total charges to income for the Company plan and the predecessor Astronics Plan were $586,000, $689,000 and $511,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
9. Transactions with Astronics
In connection with the Distribution, the Company executed the Separation and Distribution Agreement (Distribution Agreement) and certain related agreements that are summarized below. This summary is qualified in all respects by the terms of the Distribution Agreement and such related agreements.
Distribution Agreement
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Astronics transferred to the Company all assets and liabilities associated with the Company that were not already in its name and distributed to its shareholders all of the shares of the Company’s common stock and Class B stock owned by Astronics. Pursuant to the Distribution, each holder of Astronics common stock received one share of the Company’s common stock for every two shares of Astronics common stock held by him or her on the record date, and each holder of Astronics Class B stock received one share of the Company’s Class B
MOD-PAC CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
stock for every two shares of Astronics Class B stock held by him or her on the record date. The Distribution Agreement also provides, among other things, that the Company indemnifies Astronics for all liabilities, including contingent liabilities, relating to the Company’s business and that certain contingent liabilities not allocated to one of the parties will be shared equally by the Company and Astronics.
Employee Benefits Agreement and Plans
The Company and Astronics entered into an Employee Benefits Agreement, pursuant to which the Company created independent employee benefit plans that are substantially similar to the existing Astronics’ plans, at the Distribution date. The agreement provides for the transfer of assets and liabilities of various Astronics employee benefit plans related to the Company’s employees. Generally, following the Distribution, Astronics ceases to have any liability or obligation to the Company’s employees and their beneficiaries under any of Astronics benefit plans, programs or policies.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The Company and Astronics entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, which governs the Company’s and Astronics’ respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Distribution with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before Distribution. Generally, pre-Distribution taxes that are clearly attributable to the business of one party will be borne solely by that party, and other pre-Distribution taxes will be shared by the parties based upon a formula set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, liability for taxes that are incurred as a result of the restructuring activities undertaken to implement the Distribution will be borne 60% by Astronics and 40% by the Company. If the Distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code because of an acquisition of our stock or assets, or some other action of ours, then the Company will be solely liable for any resulting corporate taxes.
Interim Services Agreement
The Company and Astronics entered into an Interim Services Agreement, whereby Astronics will provide the Company, on an interim, transitional basis, payroll processing, general ledger preparation, financial reporting, training, shareholder relations, risk management and benefits administration services. The agreed upon charges for such services are generally intended to allow Astronics to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services, plus all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, without profit, and will be allocated between us and Luminescent Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Astronics, on a fifty-fifty basis. Amounts paid to Astronics for such services for the period after the distribution date through December 31, 2003 was $506,000. In 2004 such amounts were $294,000. No amount was paid in 2005.
10. Bank line of credit and Letters of Credit
The Company has a $6,000,000 line of credit facility with a commercial bank. No amounts were outstanding on the line of credit at December 31, 2005. The commercial bank has also provided the company with a standby letter of credit facility of $750,000 and has issued on behalf of the Company $297,000 in standby letters of credit as collateral in lieu of cash with respect to several agreements entered into by the Company.

11. Selected Quarterly Financial Information (unaudited)
12. Concentrations Related to Production Assets, Employees and Power
Nearly all of the Company’s production assets and its employees are located in Western New York State. The Company believes that the supply of labor and the infrastructure to support the supply of materials and the shipment of product from its facilities is generally adequate. Since May of 2003, over 90% of the Company’s power needs are met through natural gas. The Company has investigated supply contracts of various lengths, however, it currently has no supply arrangements for fixed prices. Historically, the price of natural gas has fluctuated widely. Although the Company is concerned about cost and has from time to time acquired contracts for natural gas, its main concern is availability. The Company monitors the availability of natural gas, considering such factors as amount in storage, gas production data and transportation data, so that it can take appropriate action if concerns about availability occur. The Company has investigated and tested a back-up power source in the form of a rented transportable diesel powered generator. Although such generators are generally available, the Company cannot be assured that a generator adequate to meet the Company’s needs will be available if and when such need should arise.
13. Restatements and Change in Classification
In February 2005, the Company restated its financial statements and related footnote disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2003 to correct an error that overstated the cash balance reported on the balance sheet at December 31, 2003 by $679,000. This correction to cash resulted in: (a) increased cost of Products Sold of $209,000 and increased Selling, General and Administrative Expenses of $2,000 for a total reduction of income before taxes of $211,000, (b) reduced income taxes of $76,000 because of the additional Costs of Products Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, (c) decreased net income by $135,000 and net income per diluted share by $0.03, (d) an increase in amounts due from Astronics Corporation of $402,000 and (e) an increase in property plant and equipment by $66,000. The Company filed an amended 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A reflecting this restatement on February 7, 2005.
