Lake Mead Estates Apartments
On April 30, 1987, the Partnership acquired its first property, Lake Mead Estates Apartments, a 160-unit apartment complex located at 2068 North Nellis Boulevard, Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada. The property is situated on one of Las Vegas' major north/south arteries providing a direct route between the city center and Nellis Air Force Base, southern Nevada's largest employer. Total consideration of $5,912,400 was paid for the property. At December 31, 1996, this property is classified as held for sale on the Partnership's accompanying 1996 balance sheet.
The property, which was constructed in 1986, consists of ten two-story wood frame and stucco buildings. The unit mix is 40 one-bedroom/ one-bath units at 633 square feet each and 120 two-bedroom/ two-bath units at 919 square feet each. Common areas include a swimming pool and spa, exercise room, picnic/barbecue area, basketball and volleyball courts, and a separate children's play area. Each unit is assigned a carport for parking and there is additional uncovered parking surrounding the property.
All the units are rented unfurnished. Each unit is equipped with a refrigerator, electric range, garbage disposal, dishwasher, full size washer and dryer, wall-to-wall carpeting, custom window coverings, and electronic smoke detector. Each unit has a private balcony and central heating and cooling. Trash pickup, water and sewer services are included in the monthly rent. The leasing office and one decorated model are used in leasing activities.
The interior of the apartments are smaller in comparison to the modern competition. To remain competitive, the units are being upgraded upon turnover with new carpeting, bath light fixtures and ceiling fans.
According to research conducted by the Partnership's property manager, there are twelve properties in the immediate market area that compete with Lake Mead Estates Apartments, ranging from one to fourteen years old. The average occupancy in Clark County is 95% and within the Northeast area of Clark County, where the property is located, the occupancy is 94%. The market rents average $525 for one bedroom/one bath units and $617 for two bedroom/ two bath units.
Approximately five new apartment communities, comprising 1,124 units, are planned in the Northeast area by the end of 1997. Construction has already begun on a new 360 unit complex which is located less than one mile from Lake Mead Estates Apartments. Although the new apartment complexes could have an affect on the Partnership's rental activities; however, management believes that the new properties will attract a different tenant base due to the higher rental rates. In addition, the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which opened in November 1996, and adjacent shopping center, scheduled to open spring of 1997, will bring new employment to the area and is expected to increase housing needs.
At February 28, 1997, the occupancy rate has risen to 98%.
In the opinion of management, the property is adequately covered by insurance.

In 1996, the Lake Mead Estates Apartments property was assessed property taxes of approximately $55,000 based on a tax rate of 2.63%.
On September 19, 1988, the Partnership obtained a loan from American National Insurance Company in the original amount of $4,000,000, secured by a note and first deed of trust secured by the property. The note bears interest at 9.625%, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $34,000 and matures on October 1, 2018. At December 31, 1996, the outstanding balance of the note was $3,716,000.
Bryant Lake Business Center - Phases I & II
On January 28, 1988, the Partnership acquired a ninety percent (90%) general partner interest in Bryant Lake Associates, Phases I and II, a California Limited Partnership ("the Joint Venture"), in order to acquire Phases I and II of the Bryant Lake Business Center, a business center located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Total consideration paid by the Partnership was $4,890,000. On November 30, 1990, the Partnership purchased the 10% limited partnership interest for $180,000. As a consequence of the purchase, the Joint Venture was dissolved and the assets and liabilities of the Joint Venture were transferred to the Partnership.
The property consists of three single-story buildings totaling 80,011 square feet of office/showroom and office/warehouse space located on approximately 6.375 acres on Market Place Drive and Valley View Road, a triangular piece of land bound by Interstate Highway 494, Highway 62 and U.S. Highway 169 in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a southeastern suburb of Minneapolis.
The property was completed in two phases. Phase I, consisting of two buildings containing 60,757 rentable square feet, was completed in 1984. Phase II, consisting of one building containing 19,254 rentable square feet, was completed in 1985. The buildings each have brick facades with decorative metal accent features. All buildings have truck loading docks and are equipped with a fire sprinkler system.
According to research conducted by the Partnership's property manager, the Twin Cities metropolitan area is divided into five primary real estate sub-markets, the largest of which is the southwestern suburban sub-market, in which the Bryant Lake Business Center is located. The southwestern suburban area has been especially desirable due to its proximity to executive housing and large supply of skilled professionals.
The southwestern suburban sub-market is expected to lead the way in development in 1997 with approximately 910,000 square feet in new projects planned. These projects include 245,000 square feet of office/showroom (50% or more office), 540,000 square feet of office/warehouse (less than 50% office) and 125,000 square feet of bulk warehouse. Each of these projects will be direct competition to Bryant Lake Business Center. However, due to the lack of office space throughout the Twin Cities, traditional office tenants have been lead to lease office/showroom space as an alternative. Many office/showroom owners, including the Partnership, have been able to substantially increase rental rates, leading to increased property values.
The current office/warehouse area in which Bryant Lake Business Center is located, includes 5,782,801 square feet of leasable space with a 4.6% vacancy. The average annual effective rental rates range from $6.89 to $12.11 NNN (tenant pays all operating expenses, including taxes, insurance and capital). The property was 92% leased at December 31, 1996 with a major tenant lease expiration occurring in September 1997. The tenant has one three year option to renew, however, the space will also be marketed for lease if necessary after March 31, 1997. The property is in excellent physical condition and no capital improvements are planned for 1997.

The current annual effective rental rates ranged from $4.40 to $11.33 per square foot.
In August 1996, the property lost a major tenant, occupying 13,815 square feet, due to financial instability. Management has successfully leased 6,989 square feet of the space and continues to market the remainder.
Two tenants occupy ten percent or more of the leasable square footage of the property. The principal terms of their leases and the nature of the tenants' businesses are as follows: Data Collection Zytec Corp. Systems, Inc.

In the opinion of management, the property is adequately covered by insurance.
In 1996, the Bryant Lake Business Center, Phases I and II property was assessed property taxes of approximately $199,000 based on a tax rate of 6.38%.
As part of the 1990 workout of the Bryant Lake Phase III mortgage (see further discussion which follows), the lender received as additional security a first lien on the Bryant Lake Phases I and II property, but at any time, the Partnership may furnish a letter of credit in the amount of $1,738,838 to the lender, and upon the lender's acceptance of the letter of credit, the lender will release its first lien on the Bryant Lake Phases I and II property.
Bryant Lake Business Center - Phase III
On January 28, 1988, the Partnership acquired a fifty percent (50%) general partnership interest in Bryant Lake Associates, Phase III, a California limited partnership ( "Phase III"), in order to acquire Phase III of the Bryant Lake Business Center. Total consideration paid by the Partnership of $3,251,900 included $826,900 in cash and assumption of 50% of the existing $4,850,000 loan secured by a first deed of trust on the property.
On November 30, 1990, the Partnership purchased the 50% limited partnership interest. As consideration for the purchase, the seller is entitled to 25% of net cash flow, if any, from operations and ultimate disposition of the property, as provided in the purchase and sale agreement. Through December 31, 1996, no net cash flow payments have been due or payable to the seller. As a consequence of the purchase, Phase III was dissolved and the assets and liabilities of Phase III were transferred to the Partnership.

Two of the property's major tenants have lease expirations in 1997. Management is negotiating a lease renewal with Keomed, Inc. which may include a reduction in square footage. Management has extended the expiration of Sales Force Companies, Inc. lease to June 30, 1997 at which time they will vacate. Management is currently in negotiations with a possible tenant for 12,000 square feet of that space.
In the opinion of management, the property is adequately covered by insurance. In 1996, the Bryant Lake Business Center - Phase III property was assessed property taxes of approximately $218,000 based on a tax rate of 6.57%.
In 1985, the City of Eden Prairie, Minnesota issued commercial bonds in the original amount of $4,850,000 made payable to a lender who in turn lent the proceeds to Bryant Lake Partners pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement. With the purchase of the interests in Bryant Lake Associates, Phase III in 1990, the Partnership assumed the $4,850,000 loan. The loan is secured by first deeds of trust on the Bryant Lake Phase III and Bryant Lake Phases I and II properties and requires monthly interest-only payments of $35,000 through October 1, 2015.

From October 1, 1989 to October 31, 1990, interest payments for Bryant Lake III were in default. On November 1, 1990, the Partnership entered into an agreement with the lender. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender waived delinquent interest and other charges of $351,000.

At December 31, 1996, the delinquent interest totaled $693,000 and is included in interest payable on the Partnership's 1996 balance sheet.
Country Suites By Carlson - Memphis
On August 1, 1988, the Partnership purchased the Country Suites By Carlson - Memphis, a 121-suite hotel located at 4300 American Way in Memphis, Tennessee. Total consideration paid of $5,502,700 included a cash payment of $4,131,700 and a note in the original amount of $1,371,000 to which the property is subject.
The property is situated on the north side of American Way, west of the intersection of American Way & Cherry Road, approximately nine miles east of the Memphis Central Business District and 1-1/2 miles northeast of Memphis International Airport. The property was completed in February 1988 and consists of four three-story buildings containing 121 hotel suites. Each suite is furnished and features a complete kitchen facility, except the mini suites, which contain a microwave and small refrigerator. Amenities include a centrally located swimming pool and spa, guest laundry facilities and conference rooms above the lobby area. An atrium located at the rear of the office/registration area, overlooks the courtyard area. An elevator located adjacent to the courtyard area, services the three-story hotel.
The target market is small corporate business, larger contract accounts and government/military business; each of which provide a strong base of week-day revenues. In addition, transient business and discounted leisure groups provide on-going week-end revenues. Marketing efforts will continue to focus on new account development within the business and government sector to build a strong base of week-day clients.
From 1993 through 1996, the hotel has undergone significant improvements in order to meet and maintain the Country Suites By Carlson standards. By upgrading the hotel's physical and aesthetic appeal, management has not only met the Country Suites By Carlson franchise standards but also improved the average room rates. However, the hotel's cash flow has not been sufficient to cover monthly debt service payments.

The 121 suites are summarized as follows:
Sq. Ft. Total No. Description Per Suite Sq. Ft. 17 Twins 367 6,239 42 1 Bedroom 367 15,414 6 Kings 367 2,202 56 Studio 248 13,888 - ----- ------ 121 37,743

The above rates are for 1-7 night stays and include any extended stay, corporate or military discounts.
According to research conducted by the Partnership's general manager, competing hotels in the area averaged 72% occupancy and daily room rates of $57.00 during 1996.
In the opinion of management, the property is adequately covered by insurance.
In 1996, the Country Suites by Carlson - Memphis property was assessed property taxes of approximately $59,000 based on a tax rate of 3.18%.
The property is owned by the Partnership in fee, subject to a note and first deed of trust in the original amount of $3,471,000, payable to GLENFED Service Corporation. The note bears interest at a fixed 9% rate, payable in monthly principal and interest installments of $28,951 until the note matures in July 1999, when all principal and interest is due and payable. In January 1997, due to the insufficient cash flow of the property in relation to the debt service requirements, the Partnership stopped making debt service payments and as a result is in default under the terms of the loan which is secured by the property. In addition, the Partnership has received notice that the lender will foreclose on the property on April 4, 1997.
Country Suites By Carlson - Tempe
On August 1, 1988, the Partnership acquired an undivided seventy-five percent (75%) interest as Tenants in Common with Outlook Income Fund 10, a California Limited Partnership ("OIF 10"), in a 139-suite hotel known as Country Suites By Carlson - Tempe, located at 1660 East Elliot Road and Harl Avenue, in Tempe, Arizona. OIF 10 was an affiliate of the Partnership with similar investment objectives. Total consideration paid by the Tenancy in Common for the property was $7,786,800, which included a cash payment of $5,927,800 and a promissory note in the original amount of $1,859,000, to which the property was subject.
On November 4, 1993, the Partnership finalized the purchase of the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) interest from OIF 10 and Country Suites By Carlson - Tempe became 100% owned by the Partnership. The total purchase price of $1,225,000 included a cash payment of $950,000 plus the cancellation of the $275,000 note receivable from OIF 10.
Page 9 of 41
The property contains 2.532 acres of level, irregularly shaped land, at the intersection of Elliot Road and Harl Road, with 468.94 feet of frontage along Harl Road and 175 feet of frontage along Elliot Road. It is located one quarter mile east of Interstate 10, south of Phoenix, in the I-10 Commerce Center. The property was completed in May 1988 and consists of five three-story buildings containing 139 hotel suites. Each suite is furnished and features a complete kitchen facility, except the studio units, which contain a microwave oven and refrigerator. Amenities include a centrally located swimming pool and spa; two guest laundry facilities; 1,000 square feet of meeting rooms and two heated pools including a child pool. An atrium located adjacent to the office/registration area overlooks the courtyard area.
The hotel is well located within the high tech, government and business strip in the fourth largest and most progressive city in the valley. Although the local economy is fairly strong, low visibility from the freeway and the effects of the recession on travel had curbed the hotel's profitability. Furthermore, city government will not approve a larger sign to improve visibility of the hotel, so management is considering other options to attract "walk-in" business. Despite these local factors, management uses aggressive marketing and a strong reservations network which resulted in an improvement in room rates during the course of the year.
The target markets include tour groups which resulted in a high percentage of total revenues. Management also continues to develop commercial accounts to provide a base for non-tourist season. In addition, an account executive has been hired to focus on direct sales calls to maximize new account development. Furthermore, the franchise reservation system, which books the highest rated room rates, has matured and helps to aid the property in earning a higher average daily room rate. The discount segment constituted the largest base of revenues.
From 1993 through 1996, the hotel has undergone significant improvements in order to meet and maintain the Country Suites By Carlson standards. By upgrading the hotel's physical and aesthetic appeal, management has not only met the Country Suites By Carlson franchise standards but also improved the average room rates.
The 139 suites are summarized as follows:
Sq. Ft. Total No. Description Per Suite. Sq. Ft. --- ----------- ---------- ------- 29 Queens 361 10,469 24 1 Bedroom 361 8,664 13 Kings 418 5,434 71 Studio 196 13,916 2 Handicap 361 722 ---- ------- 139 39,205
