ITEM 2. Our Properties.
At December 31, 2003, we owned a total of 684 gross wells, of which 266 were producing, 351 were shut-in or temporarily abandoned and 67 were injection or saltwater wells. We owned an average 94% working interest in the 266 gross (249.90 net) producing wells. Gross wells are the total wells in which we own a working interest. Net wells are the sum of the fractional working interests we own in gross wells. Our part of the estimated proved reserves these properties contain was approximately 5.0 million barrels (MBbl) of oil and 32.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas. Substantially all of our properties are located in Texas, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma.
Proved Reserves.
The following table reflects our estimated proved reserves at December 31 for each of the preceding three years.

(a) Approximately 75% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed at December 31, 2003.
(b) Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE) is based on a ratio of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas for each barrel of oil.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows.
The following table sets forth as of December 31 for each of the preceding three years, the estimated future net cash flow from and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our proved reserves, which were prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Future net cash flow represents future gross cash flow from the production and sale of proved reserves, net of crude oil and natural gas production costs (including production taxes, ad valorem taxes and operating expenses) and future development costs. The calculations used to produce the figures in this table are based on current cost and price factors at December 31 for each year. We cannot assure you that the proved reserves will all be developed within the periods used in the calculations or that prices and costs will remain constant.

(1) The average prices of our proved reserves were $29.51 per Bbl and $5.82 per Mcf at December 31, 2003.
All information set forth herein relating to our proved reserves, estimated future net cash flows and present values is taken from reports prepared by Pressler Petroleum Consultants, independent petroleum engineers. The estimates of these engineers were based upon their review of production histories and other geological, economic, ownership and engineering data provided by and relating to us. No reports on our reserves have been filed with any federal agency. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, our estimates of proved reserves and the future net revenues from which present values are derived are made using year end crude oil and natural gas sales prices held constant throughout the life of the properties (except to the extent a contract specifically provides otherwise). Operating costs, development costs and certain production-related taxes were deducted in arriving at estimated future net revenues, but such costs do not include debt service, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data set forth in this report are based upon estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process, which involves estimating the sizes of underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation of that data, and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers, including those used by us, may vary. In addition, estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production, results of future development, exploitation and exploration activities, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and other factors. Such revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. We cannot assure you that the estimates contained in this report are accurate predictions of our crude oil and natural gas reserves or their values. Estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than upon actual production history. Estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in potentially substantial variations in the estimated reserves.
Production, Revenue and Price History.
The following table sets forth information (associated with our proved reserves) regarding production volumes of crude oil and natural gas, revenues and expenses attributable to such production (all net to our interests) and certain price and cost information for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Drilling Results.
We did not drill any wells in 2003. In 2002, we drilled one exploratory well, in which we own 18% working interest, that resulted in a dry hole and one development well, in which we own 100% working interest, that is productive. We drilled three wells in 2001, all of which were development wells and are currently productive. These development wells included two horizontal wells, in which we own 96% and 89% working interest, drilled by sidetracking from existing wellbores in the Madisonville Field, Texas, and one well, in which we own 100% working interest, that was deepened in our Leona River Field, Texas.
Risk Factors.
Our success depends heavily upon our ability to market our crude oil and natural gas production at favorable prices.
In recent decades, there have been both periods of worldwide overproduction and underproduction of crude oil and natural gas, and periods of increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts. Such conditions have resulted in excess supply of, and reduced demand for, crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis. At other times, there has been short supply of, and increased demand for, crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. These changes have resulted in dramatic price fluctuations.
The degree to which we are leveraged could possibly have important consequences to our shareholders, including the following:
(i) Our indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired;
(ii) Funds available for our operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures will be reduced as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness;
(iii)We may be more highly leveraged than certain of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;
(iv) The agreements governing our long-term indebtedness and bank loans may contain restrictive financial and operating covenants;
(v) An event of default (not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our debt instruments could occur and have a material adverse effect;
(vi) Certain of the borrowings under our debt agreements have floating rates of interest, which causes us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and,
(vii)Our substantial degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.
Our ability to make principal and interest payments under long-term indebtedness and bank loans will be dependent upon our future performance, which is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
We cannot assure you that our current level of operating results will continue or improve. We believe that we will need to access capital markets in the future in order to provide the funds necessary to repay a significant portion of our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that any such refinancing will be possible or that we can obtain any additional financing, particularly in view of our anticipated high levels of debt. If no such refinancing or additional financing were available, we could default on our debt obligations.
We have incurred net losses in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in the future.
Our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors, including industry conditions, prices of crude oil and natural gas, rates of production, timing of capital expenditures and drilling success. These variables could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.
Estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn our to be inaccurate.
Estimates of our proved reserves for crude oil and natural gas and the estimated future net revenues from the production of such reserves rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions as to crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and imprecise.
Actual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from the estimates we obtain from reserve engineers. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves we have set forth. In addition, our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision due to factors that are beyond our control, such as production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors.
Approximately 25% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2003 were proved undeveloped reserves, which are by their nature less certain.
Recovery of such reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data set forth in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. Although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our crude oil and natural gas reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards, we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated.
You should not interpret the present value referred to in this report or documents incorporated herein by reference as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves.
In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.
The estimates of our proved reserves and the future net revenues from which the present value of our properties is derived were calculated based on the actual prices of our various properties on a property-by-property basis at December 31, 2003. The average prices of all properties were $29.51 per barrel of oil and $5.82 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas at that date.
Actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by crude oil and natural gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both the production and the incurring of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties affect the timing of actual future net cash flows
from proved reserves. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.
Except to the extent that we acquire properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful development or exploitation activities, our proved reserves will decline as they are produced.
In general, the volume of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Our future crude oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.
The business of acquiring, enhancing or developing reserves requires considerable capital.
Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves could be impaired to the extent that cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. In addition, we cannot be sure that our future acquisition and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.
Crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control.
These risks include (i) the possibility that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered; and, (ii) that operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled due to title problems, weather conditions, governmental requirements, mechanical difficulties, or delays in the delivery of drilling rigs and other equipment that may limit our ability to develop, produce and market our reserves. We cannot assure you that new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such new wells.
Drilling for crude oil and natural gas may not be profitable.
Any wells that we drill may be dry wells or wells that are not sufficiently productive to be profitable after drilling. Such wells will have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, our properties may be susceptible to drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties.
Our industry experiences numerous operating risks that could cause us to suffer substantial losses.
Such risks include fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure and environmental hazards, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. We could also suffer losses due to personnel injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property; or environmental damage that could result in clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation, penalties or suspension of our operations. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance policies against some, but not all, of the risks described above. Our insurance policies may not adequately protect us against loss or liability. There is no guarantee that insurance policies that protect us against the many risks we face will continue to be available at justifiable premium levels.
As owners and operators of crude oil and natural gas properties, we may be liable under federal, state and local environmental regulations for activities involving water pollution, hazardous waste transport, storage, disposal or other activities.
Our past growth has been attributable to acquisitions of producing crude oil and natural gas properties with proved reserves. There are risks involved with such acquisitions.
The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond our control. Such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy uncertain. In connection with such an assessment, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Such a review, however, will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us, as the buyer, to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their capabilities or deficiencies. We may not inspect every well and, even when an inspection is undertaken, structural and environmental problems may not necessarily be observable.
When we acquire properties, in most cases, we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities.
We generally acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, we cannot assure you that the seller will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. In addition, the competition to acquire producing crude oil and natural gas properties is intense and many of our larger competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire producing crude oil and natural gas properties that have economically recoverable reserves for acceptable prices.
We may acquire royalty, overriding royalty or working interests in properties that are less than the controlling interest.
In such cases, it is likely that we will not operate, nor control the decisions affecting the operations, of such properties. We intend to limit such acquisitions to properties operated by competent parties with whom we have discussed their plans for operation of the properties.
We will need additional financing in the future to continue to fund our developmental and exploitation activities.
We have made and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploitation and development projects. We intend to finance these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, existing financing arrangements or new financing. We cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available. If it is not available, our development and exploitation activities may have to be curtailed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as was the case in 2003.
The marketing of our natural gas production depends, in part, upon the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.
We could be adversely affected by changes in existing arrangements with transporters of our natural gas since we do not own most of the gathering systems and pipelines through which our natural gas is delivered to purchasers. Our ability to produce and market our natural gas could also be adversely affected by federal, state and local regulation of production and transportation.
The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases.
Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable producing properties, the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas prospects suitable for enhanced production efforts, and the hiring of experienced personnel. Our competitors in crude oil and natural gas acquisition, development, and production include the major oil companies, in addition to numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individual proprietors and drilling programs.
Many of these competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those which are available to us and may, therefore, be able to pay more for desirable producing properties and prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of producing properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Our ability to generate reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects while competing with these companies.
The domestic oil industry is extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels. Although we believe we are presently in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations, we cannot assure you that changes in such laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or the results of our operations.
Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on the industry. There are numerous federal and state agencies authorized to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and gas industry. These rules and regulations are often difficult and costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for noncompliance.
State statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Most states also have statutes and regulations governing conservation matters, including the unitization or pooling of properties, and the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells. Some states have also enacted statutes prescribing price ceilings for natural gas sold within their states.
Our industry is also subject to numerous laws and regulations governing plugging and abandonment of wells, discharge of materials into the environment and other matters relating to environmental protection. The heavy regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the costs of our doing business as an oil and gas company, consequently affecting our profitability.
Our board of directors is authorized, without further shareholder action, to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the dividend rate, voting rights and other rights, preferences and restrictions of each such series.
As of March 29, 2004, there was a total of 19,000 shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding in three series, including 8,000 shares of Series D, 9,000 shares of Series E and 2,000 shares of Series F. The 8,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock are held by a former director, the 9,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock are held by a current director and the 2,000 shares of Series F are held by our largest lender. Our preferred stock is senior to our common stock regarding liquidation. The holders of the preferred stock do not have voting rights or preemptive rights nor are they subject to the benefits of any retirement or sinking fund.
The Series D preferred stock is not entitled to dividends, nor is it redeemable, however it is convertible to common stock at anytime. None of the 8,000 outstanding shares of Series D preferred stock has been converted. On a fully converted basis, the 8,000 shares of Series D preferred stock would convert to 500,000 shares of common stock.
The Series E preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends at the rate of $12.50 per share per annum, payable quarterly, as declared by the board of directors, until June 30, 2004 when the dividend rate shall be increased to $30.00 per share per annum. The board of directors did not declare payment of dividends during 2003. The Series E preferred stock is redeemable in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the issuer, at a price of $500 per share, plus all accrued and undeclared or unpaid dividends; except that, prior to our redemption of the remaining, the holders of record shall be given a 60-day written notice of the issuer's intent to redeem and the opportunity to convert the Series E preferred stock to common stock. The conversion price for the Series E preferred stock is based on $2.00 per share of common stock. None of the 9,000 outstanding shares of Series E preferred stock has been redeemed or converted. On a fully converted basis, the 9,000 shares of Series E preferred stock would convert to 2,250,000 shares of common stock.
The Series F preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends at the rate of $12.50 per share per annum, payable quarterly, as declared by the board of directors, until May 30, 2006 when the dividend rate shall be increased to $30.00 per share per annum. The Series F preferred stock is redeemable in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the issuer, at a price of $500 per share, plus all accrued and undeclared or unpaid dividends; except that, after two years from the date of the original issuance, June 1, 2003, and prior to our redemption of the remaining shares, the holders of record shall be given a 60-day written notice of the issuer's intent to redeem and the opportunity to convert the Series F preferred stock to common stock. The conversion price for the Series F preferred stock is based on $1.00 per share of common stock. None of the 2,000 outstanding shares of Series F preferred stock has been redeemed or converted. On a fully converted basis, the 2,000 shares of Series F preferred stock would convert to 1,000,000 shares of common stock.
We do not pay dividends on our common stock.
Our board of directors presently intends to retain all of our earnings for the expansion of our business, therefore we do not anticipate distributing cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision of our board of directors to pay cash dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial position, cash requirements and other factors.
The holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, preemptive rights or rights to convert their common stock to other securities.
We are authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share. As of March 29, 2004, there were 18,492,541 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Since the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, the holder(s) of a majority of the shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors. The holders of shares of our common stock do not have preemptive rights or rights to convert their common stock into other securities. At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding warrants and options for the purchase of 3,067,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $.75 to $1.81 per share, including employee stock options to purchase 1,102,000 shares at prices ranging from $.75 to $1.81 per share. If we issue additional shares, the existing shareholders' percentage ownership of our company may be further diluted.
Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements.
We make forward-looking statements throughout this report. Whenever you read a statement that is not simply a statement of historical fact, such as when we describe what we "believe," "expect" or "anticipate" will occur, and other similar statements, you must remember that our expectations may not be correct, even though we believe they are reasonable. These forward-looking statements generally relate to our plans and objectives for future operations and are based upon our management's reasonable estimates of future results and trends. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). In connection with forward-looking statements, you should carefully review the factors set forth in this report under "Risk Factors."
ITEM 3.
