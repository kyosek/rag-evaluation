Acquisition
The property was acquired through the July 2003 reverse-takeover acquisition of Paso Rico Resources Ltd. (subsequently known as Rare Element Holdings Ltd., (“Holdings”)), which originally had a property option to acquire full ownership of the property through exploration expenditures on the property and subsequently, before the reverse-takeover by the Company, obtained 100% ownership in September 2002.
Location and Ownership
Rare Element Resources, Inc. (“RER, Inc.”) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings) holds a 100 percent mineral rights interest in a group of unpatented mineral claims, known as the Bear Lodge Property, which consists of the Bear Lodge REE Project and the Sundance Gold Project. The property is situated in the Bear Lodge Mountains of Crook County, northeastern Wyoming. These claims were, in part, acquired from Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (“Freeport”), which was known as Phelp Dodge Corporation at that time, by way of a “Mineral Lease and Option for Deed”. Some of the claims and a portion of a defined area of influence surrounding the claims were previously subject to a production royalty of 2 percent of Net Smelter Returns ("NSR") payable to Freeport. RER, Inc. owns a portion of the claim group outright and those claims were not subject to the NSR. On March 31, 2009, the Company re-purchased the NSR for $50,000. The core group of claims is free of royalties.
The total property comprises 494 unpatented mineral claims located on land administered by the U.S. Forest Service and a 640-acre Wyoming state lease for a total of approximately 16 square miles.

Upon Newmont Mining Company’s (“Newmont”) withdrawal from the Sundance Gold Project, it transferred 327 of its claims to the Company in May 2010. There is a sliding scale royalty on certain state lease land due to the State of Wyoming if ore is mined from the state section. All claims are located on federal lands and are subject to annual maintenance fees payable to the United States Bureau of Land Management. These fees are paid up to date.
The Bear Lodge REE Project contains high grades of predominantly the “light” REE (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and some of the highest grades in North America of the “heavy” REE europium and terbium plus significant quantities of the heavy REE--dysprosium.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The Bear Lodge Property is located in central Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, in the northwestern portion of the Black Hills uplift. The property is situated immediately north of the crest of the Bear Lodge Mountains, a relatively small northwesterly trending range. The property is flanked to the west by the Powder River Basin, famous for its extensive coalmines, and is surrounded by the Great Plains. The Bear Lodge Property lies about 12 road miles northwest of the small town of Sundance, Wyoming, approximately 22 air miles west of the South Dakota state line, 55 air miles east of the larger town of Gillette, Wyoming, and 230 miles north of Cheyenne, the state capitol. Gillette has many of the services required by the mining industry.
Access to the Bear Lodge Property is very good, but in the winter months the property is not as readily accessible due to snow accumulation. Primary access to the property is from the town of Sundance, Wyoming, situated along US Interstate Highway 90. The project area is reached by traveling on paved roads west from Sundance about 1.5 miles along US Highway 14, then north on US Forest Service Taylor Divide Road #838 for 7.4 miles to the summit of Warren Peaks. The final 3.2 miles to the Bull Hill area of the property is on well-maintained gravel roads (continuing on USFS#838 and then right on USFS#851) until the turnoff to the Bull Hill Road, about 0.8 miles of a narrow one-lane dirt road leading to the Bull Hill REE target area. Road access within the property is relatively extensive via a number of good quality logging roads and four-wheel drive trails that were cleared during previous exploration and logging activities.
Motels, restaurants, and gas stations are available to the south in the nearby town of Sundance, and a greater variety of accommodations and services are available to the east in Spearfish, South Dakota.
Necessary infrastructure, such as housing, food, fuel, etc., would be available in either town, or further to the west in Gillette, Wyoming, should the property enter the development stage. Water rights would likely be available through purchase, and a major power line runs within a mile of the property. Supplies can be trucked to the site 60 miles from Gillette, which is located on both US Interstate Highway 90 and rail lines. A Burlington Northern rail transport line also runs through Moorcroft, 34 miles west of Sundance. The Gillette area has a coal-fired power plant, and the city would be a major logistics center for any development at the Bear Lodge Property. The current size of the property is sufficiently large to support a mining operation, with no foreseeable obstacles regarding expansion, subject to a favorable environmental permitting outcome.
The Bear Lodge Mountains have a warm and relatively dry climate during summer, followed by cold winters with variable amounts of snow. Optimal field conditions extend from April to November. The Taylor Divide Road is not maintained during winter months, and snowmobile access is given priority from December through March. The property lies within the Black Hills National Forest along the crest of the northern part of the Bear Lodge Mountains, a narrow northwest-trending range situated in northeastern Wyoming. Physiographically it is a northwesterly extension of the Black Hills of western South Dakota. The range is characterized by rounded grass- and pine-covered mountains reaching elevations of 6,400 feet within the property. The mountains have moderate slopes covered by western yellow pine forest interspersed with dense thickets of brush. Narrow grassy meadows cover the upper reaches of seasonal drainages. The lowest point within the property is about 5,800 feet elevation.
Bear Lodge REE Project
Mineral Resources
The Company’s comprehensive NI 43-101-compliant Technical Report with an initial mineral resource estimate of REE plus yttrium at the Bull Hill deposit was dated April 14, 2009. The report incorporated descriptions of all the exploration work and metallurgical testing completed by the Company since the initial exploration NI 43-101-compliant report was issued in 2002. The report also included recommendations for additional exploration work to expand the REE mineral resource and the metallurgical testing program. The recommended work was completed.
On May 26, 2010, the Company reported an updated mineral resource estimate of REE plus yttrium contained in two deposits located in the Bull Hill area of the Bear Lodge REE Project. The updated mineral resource estimate increased the total pounds of Rare Earth Oxides (“REOs”) contained in the Bull Hill deposits by more than 50 percent from 800 million pounds to 1,210 million pounds at a 1.5 percent REO cutoff grade. The mineral resource was estimated by an independent consultant-Ore Reserves Engineering (“ORE”).
On June 14, 2011, the Company announced the results of an upgraded and increased NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate of REE plus yttrium contained in three deposits located in the Bull Hill area of the Bear Lodge REE Project (Table 1). The updated resource estimate upgrades 4.9 million tons (4.44 mm metric tonnes) to the indicated category and increases the total pounds of REO contained in the Bull Hill high-grade deposits by 20 percent from 1,210 million pounds (550 million kg) to 1,450 million pounds (660 million kg) at a 1.5 percent REO cutoff grade (Tables 1 and 2). The mineral resources were estimated by ORE, an independent consultant.
The new resource estimate is derived from a REE database that includes eighty six core drill holes completed by the Company between 2008 and 2010 for a total of 62,625 feet (19,093 m). The new resource estimate focuses on the dike sets in the Bull Hill (Bull Hill Southwest) deposit, plus the Bull Hill Northwest and the Whitetail Ridge deposit areas. In addition, the drilling indicates significant potential for expansion of all three deposits, for discovering mineralization in the undrilled areas between the deposits, and for definition of resources in other areas, such as Bull Hill West, East Taylor and the Carbon REE target.
The total mineral resources estimate by ORE for the three deposits are summarized in the following tables at a range of cutoff grades and for the different oxidation zones, including the oxide, oxide-carbonate, transitional, and sulfide/unoxidized zones (Tables 1 and 2):
Table 1. Total Indicated Tons and Grade of the Various Oxidation Zones at a Range of Cut-Off Grades
Table 2. Total Inferred Tons and Grade of the Various Oxidation Zones at a Range of Cut-Off Grades
Table 3. Resource Estimates and Contained REO for the Three Individual Deposits
1.
REO (rare-earth oxides) include Ce2O3, La2O3, Nd2O3, Pr2O3, Sm2O3, Gd2O3, Y2O3, Eu2O3, Dy2O3, Tb2O3, Er2O3 and other minor oxides listed in general order of decreasing abundance in the deposits.
2.
The resources estimates are classified as Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources as defined by CIM and referenced in NI 43-101.
3.
ORE considers a range of 1.0 to 2.5 percent REO cut-off grade to be reasonable in preliminary estimation of potentially economic resources. A cutoff grade of 1.5 percent REO has been selected as the base case and it is highlighted; a cutoff grade of 3.0 percent REO is also highlighted to show the higher-grade tons above the cutoff. Low-grade material above 0.5 percent cut-off grade is undergoing metallurgical testing to determine if a simple low-cost process can result in its being upgraded.
4.
A detailed program of core sampling and bulk density measurement was conducted successfully during the 2010 drilling program, especially for oxide mineralization which is more difficult to measure accurately.
5.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource", which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the "Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates" above.
The current upgraded resource, plus additional resources planned for upgrade during the 2011 drill program, will be included in a Preliminary Feasibility Study scheduled for completion in early 2012. The Company’s 2011 exploration program is planned to include more than 50 in-fill and step-out drill holes to further upgrade and expand the resource.
Geology & Mineralization
REE mineralization occurs in the north-central core of the Bear Lodge alkaline-igneous complex located in northeastern Wyoming. All of the most important REE deposits and occurrences in the Bear Lodge district are controlled by RER, Inc.’s lode claims, and are located in the vicinity of Bull Hill.
Rare-earth mineralized bodies occurring as dikes and veins within the Bull Hill area of the district include a well-defined, near-surface oxidized FMR (iron oxide-manganese oxide-REE) zone, a near-surface oxidized but incompletely leached carbonatite zone (oxide-carbonate zone), a transitional or mixed zone (oxide + sulfide), and a deeper sulfide-bearing carbonatite (a high-carbonate igneous rock) zone. The oxide-carbonate and transitional zones were referred to collectively in previous new releases and technical reports as “transitional zone”. As the Company’s understanding of the deposit has progressed, it made sense to subclassify mineralized zones based on key characteristics of those zones. The FMR dikes and veins contain no matrix carbonates or sulfides. The sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides, and the non-REE bearing carbonate minerals (calcite and strontianite) are completely leached from the zone, which ranges from the surface to depths of about 300 - 500 feet. The oxide-carbonate zone generally occurs beneath the oxide zone, but may locally breach the surface in select dikes. It is characterized by an absence of sulfides, with the residual iron oxides formed during the complete oxidation of the
former sulfide minerals, and by variable amounts of relict matrix carbonates (calcite ± strontianite). As now defined, the transitional zone is relatively flat-lying and occurs as a thin layer immediately above the sulfide-bearing carbonatite zone. It contains mixed iron oxides and sulfides, along with a significant amount of relict matrix carbonates. The iron oxides in this zone are derived primarily from the variable partial to complete oxidation of constituent sulfide minerals. The unoxidized sulfide-bearing carbonatite at depth has not been leached of matrix carbonates and retains all of its initial sulfide content.
Metallurgy of the oxide zone is well established and has been reported previously. Initial metallurgical testing of the oxide-carbonate zone resource indicates that mineral pre-concentration test results are similar to those for the oxide zone mineralization. Early indications suggest that chemical concentration of the REO from this zone will consume more reagents than the oxide zone mineralization.
The Bull Hill deposit, formerly known as Bull Hill SW, contains the bulk of the current resources. The deposit comprises a steeply-dipping FMR-carbonatite dike swarm. Geological interpretation of results from the 2010 drill program indicate that the Bull Hill resource area is dominated by northwest-striking mineralized bodies in the southern two-thirds of the resource area, while the northern part of the resource area exhibits a transitional change in strike from dominantly northwesterly to almost due north. The dike swarm primarily intrudes heterolithic intrusive breccia of the Bull Hill diatreme. Carbonatite dikes at depth are interpreted to transition toward the surface into either oxide-carbonate bodies or FMR bodies, which range in size from veinlets to large dikes more than 100 feet in width. The Bull Hill deposit consists of one dominant dike set and several subsidiary dike sets in a swarm that strikes over 1,500 feet in length and covers several hundred feet in width. The dikes appear to pinch and swell in both strike and dip directions, and they can be traced in drill holes more than 1,000 feet down dip. A number of gold deposits and other occurrences of anomalous gold are distributed peripherally to the Bull Hill REE mineralization and are part of the Company’s Sundance Gold Project.
The Bull Hill Northwest deposit shares many characteristics with the Bull Hill deposit. The oxide zone extends somewhat deeper, probably owing to a complex regime of intersecting fault structures. The structural controls for the mineralized bodies remain incompletely understood in this resource area, but it appears most likely that northerly-striking mineralized bodies predominate. The dikes cut alkalic silicate rocks, predominantly trachytes and phonolites, and they are part of an FMR/carbonatite dike system that appears to be distinct from the Bull Hill SW dike system. The deposit is open to the north and at depth. Additional drilling will be done during the 2011 program to better define the orientation of the system and to expand the current resource.
The Whitetail Ridge deposit is marked at the surface by a zone of FMR stockwork and a coincident geophysical anomaly. The size of the geophysical anomaly (approximately 1,400 by 2,000 feet elongate northeasterly) provides an indication that the REE target may be larger than others in the district. Detailed mapping suggests that the REE mineralization consists of northwest-striking FMR dikes and an FMR stockwork zone that is elongate northeasterly, with dimensions of roughly 1,250 feet (380 meters) by 950 feet (290 meters). The enveloping geophysical anomaly is larger and may indicate a broader distribution of REE mineralization beneath the extensive soil and colluvial cover. This is the same area that the US Bureau of Mines drilled in the early 1950s and estimated a large tonnage of low-grade stockwork mineralization. Only a small part of this target area has been tested with the Company’s drill holes. Drilling during the Company’s planned 2011 program is expected to expand and better delineate the current Whitetail Ridge resource.
The major dike sets in all of the resource areas are accompanied by peripheral zones of lower-grade stockwork REE mineralization. The term “stockwork” refers to a rock cut by a network of small veins or dikes that contain the mineralization. REE grades in the stockwork zones range between about 0.5 and 2 percent REO. The Company is investigating low-cost physical processing methods to upgrade the contained REE mineralization in the stockwork for eventual inclusion with the resources reported here.
The Company considers the geologic modeling and resource estimation results encouraging for the following reasons:
·
A portion of the oxidized resource was upgraded to the “indicated” category.
·
The tonnage of the overall resource was expanded relative to the May, 2010 NI 43-101- compliant resource estimate, but with slightly lower REO grades.
·
The more extensively drilled Bull Hill deposit shows excellent lateral and vertical continuity of mineralization and grades within the dike sets.
·
The REE mineralization that constitutes the Bull Hill resource is open for expansion at depth, to the southeast, and to the northwest toward Whitetail Ridge.
·
The Whitetail Ridge deposit was defined by drilling in only a small part of the target area.
·
The Bull Hill West target area hosts FMR/carbonatite dikes that may be related to both the Bull Hill and Whitetail Ridge mineralizing systems and mineralization appears to be open in all directions.
·
The Company believes that there is room for the mineral resource tonnage to increase significantly in all deposit and target areas.
·
Bulk-tonnage, lower-grade stockwork mineralization adjacent to the higher-grade zones is extensive, and only a small part of the potential has been tested by drill holes. With further metallurgical testing, this material may be defined as an additional resource.
The updated mineral resource estimate confirms that potentially economic resources are present in the Bull Hill area, and it justifies further technical work including drilling, metallurgical testing, and engineering studies. Considerable in-fill definition drilling is required to increase the confidence level and upgrade more of the inferred resources to the indicated category. Step-out drilling is planned to expand the resource and define the boundaries of the mineralization.
Cutoff Grade & Metallurgy
The resource size is sensitive to an assumed cut-off grade, which is sensitive to metallurgical operating costs. The Company is advancing its rare-earth metallurgical studies at: Mountain States Research & Development International, Vail, Arizona, Nagrom, Perth, Australia, and Hazen Research, Golden, Colorado. The objective for each of these testing laboratories is developing and optimizing an effective and cost-efficient metallurgical flowsheet. The metallurgical testing program will continue through 2011 on mineralized core samples collected during 2010. The test program includes a pilot plant test being conducted at Hazen Research using approximately 13 tons of material collected in 2010 near the surface with large diameter core drilling and from surface samples collected during drill-site excavations.
Quality Assurance
The mineral resource estimate was completed by Mr. Alan C. Noble, P.E., principal engineer of Ore Reserves Engineering (ORE), and is based on geological interpretations supplied by the Company to ORE and subsequently modified by ORE. Mr. Noble is an independent qualified person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators and has verified the data disclosed here.
The Rare Element Resources’ field programs were carried out under the supervision of Dr. James G. Clark, the Company’s Vice President of Exploration. Dr. Clark was also a senior geologist and, subsequently, exploration supervisor for Hecla Mining Company during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s and was responsible for that company’s exploration of Bull Hill and the Bear Lodge district, and its initial discovery of the Bull Hill SW resource area. A detailed QA/QC program was implemented for the 2007 through 2011 drill programs. The QA/QC program was organized by Dr. Jeffrey Jaacks. Dr. Jaacks and Dr. Clark have verified the sampling procedures and QA/QC data delivered to ORE. They share the opinion that the data are of good quality and suitable for use in the resource estimate.
Metallurgy
The metallurgical testing is ongoing on oxide samples. Nearly all of this material is sufficiently close to the surface for potential mining by open pit methods. The current oxide mineral resource contains 4.9 million tons of indicated resource at a grade of 3.77% REO and 11.6 million tons of inferred resource at a grade of 3.22% REO, using a 1.5% REO cutoff grade (Table 3 above). The oxide mineralization extends from surface to depths of 400 to 500 feet. Excellent exploration potential for expansion of the oxide mineralization was tested in 2010 by a program of step-out drilling, and in-fill drilling was directed at an upgrade of the mineral resource category.
The current testing program conducted on this oxide mineralization is designed to take advantage of the unique type of mineral occurrence of the REE mineralization. The mineralization is characterized by fine-grained REE minerals that variably adhere to the surfaces of the coarser gangue (non-REE-bearing) minerals. The REE minerals in oxide mineralization from the mineral resource area are largely from the bastnasite group (bastnasite, synchysite, and parasite) with variable proportions of monazite.
Metallurgical testwork is being conducted at Mountain States R&D International, Inc. (MSRDI) of Vail, Arizona. Preliminary Testing of REE separation was conducted at Intellimet LLC of Missoula, Montana. Confirmatory testing is being conducted by NAGROM of Perth, Australia with additional separation testwork planned to be conducted by ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization) of Sydney, Australia. Bulk sampling of oxide mineralization from large diameter drill core and from surface trenches took place in the Fall of 2010. The bulk sample is being processed in a pilot plant test currently in 2011 as part of a planned pre-feasibility study.
Rare-earth mineralized bodies occur as high-grade dikes and veins within the Bull Hill deposit. They include a well-defined, near-surface oxidized zone that has been the subject of most metallurgical testing to date. The oxide mineralization contains essentially no matrix carbonates or sulfides. The sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides, and the non-REE bearing carbonate minerals (calcite and strontianite) are completely leached from the zone, which ranges from the surface to depths of about 500 feet. These conditions created a loose and friable oxide material that allows for a simple physical mineral processing method.
In parts of the high-grade zone, the sulfides are oxidized but matrix carbonate is partially and variably leached. This zone is termed the “oxide-carbonate” zone. A thin “transitional zone” occurs at the base of the oxide and/or oxide-carbonate zone at a depth of approximately 500 feet (150 m). The transitional zone passes relatively abruptly into the sulfide-bearing zone with typical carbonatite characteristics.
Tests on the high-grade oxide mineralization indicate that recoveries of 80 to 85 percent of REO are expected using a two-stage process. The first stage is mineral concentration, also known as physical upgrading (“PUG”). The second stage is a chemical leaching process using hydrochloric acid that produces a mixed rare-earths leachate that is precipitated as a bulk carbonate concentrate. The series of bench-scale testing programs was completed by MSRDI under the direction of Dr. Roshan Bhappu. The test results show that 90 percent REO can be recovered in 40-50 weight percent of the original mass weight by employing a simple washing, scrubbing, and screening process that produces a mineral pre-concentrate of sand-size and finer particles. The washing and screening process uses only water as a process media and is similar to gravel washing plants that are commonly employed throughout the United States. Using an 8 percent REO head grade sample, the pre-concentrate can be upgraded to 14-18 percent REO using this process. A parallel series of tests to verify the process has been conducted by Nagrom of Perth, Australia, under the direction of Mr. Tony Wilkinson, General Manager.
Mr. Jaye T. Pickarts, P.E., who is the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, is the Qualified Person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the contents of the “Metallurgy” section of this Form 10-K.

The Study was prepared by independent consultant, John T. Boyd Company (“Boyd”), with the assistance of consultants Mountain States R&D International (“MSRDI”) and ORE. It includes NI 43-101-compliant inferred mineral resource estimates for two of the four known mineralized zones at Bear Lodge REE Project (Bull Hill and Bull Hill Northwest deposits) that were prepared by ORE. The Study provides an initial development model and a preliminary economic analysis of the project based on the mineral resources estimated for the two deposits. The final NI 43-101-compliant technical report was filed on SEDAR on November 9, 2010.
The Study was commissioned by the Company in 2009 to evaluate the potential economic viability of recovering REEs in concentrate from the mineral resources in the Bull Hill area of the Bear Lodge REE Project, with a future goal to recover individual REOs. This was in response to growing demand for these elements in environmental and other applications where the REE are vital to the new technologies developed for fuel efficient (“hybrid”) automobiles and plug-in electric vehicles. Many hybrid cars use rechargeable nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-M-H) batteries that contain lanthanum along with electric motors and generators that require high-strength permanent magnets containing neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium. Substantial quantities of all five of these rare-earth elements would be produced by a mine at Bear Lodge, and these five elements would represent nearly 65 percent of potential saleable products’ value.
Rare Earths - Markets and Pricing
For an independent analysis of REE markets, including supply and demand forecasts, Boyd relied on a recent confidential report and supporting data produced by IMCOA, an independent industrial minerals research firm based in Perth, Australia and led by Dudley J. Kingsnorth. This report was requested by the Company and provided to Boyd as a basic reference. The IMCOA report forecasts growth in global demand for REE at a rate of nearly 10 percent per year until 2020, from approximately 125,000 tons in 2010 to 200,000 tons by 2015 to 280,000 tons by 2020, expressed
as “TREO” (total rare-earth oxides or the sum of all 14 REE plus yttrium). During this period, primary supply sources located mainly in China are not expected to increase production significantly, creating a growing supply/demand gap. China has been reducing its exports of rare earths for several years and announced a major reduction in exports in early July 2010. These policies have already caused significant price increases for most REE and created opportunities for new primary suppliers to enter the market. Boyd concludes that the Bear Lodge REE Project mineral resources, which require significant further work to bring to the feasibility level of analysis, represent an attractive potential mine development opportunity for the Company.
Bear Lodge - Low-cost Open Pit Mining
The development model utilized by Boyd and its associates for the Study contemplates conventional truck and shovel open-pit mine production from the near-surface oxide inferred mineral resources in the Bull Hill and Bull Hill NW deposits, which would provide an initial mine life of 15 years. Recent drilling has successfully intersected REE outside the known mineral resources and may support an eventual increase of mine life beyond that contemplated in the Study. The current mineral resources at the Bear Lodge REE Project are categorized as indicated and inferred mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates do not account for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution. These mineral resource estimates include inferred mineral resources that are normally considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is also no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be converted to measured and indicated categories through further drilling, or into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Also, there is no certainty that this Preliminary Economic Assessment will be realized. An economic assessment will almost certainly change as new information is generated on the mineral resources, mine plan, and processing methodology.
Bear Lodge - REE Production
In the base case scenario, a conservative production rate beginning at 500 tons per day of mineralized material will progressively increase to 1,000 tons per day by year three. Once full production is achieved, the total REO (“TREO”) produced each year would be approximately 11,400 tons (10,300 metric tons) in bulk REE concentrates. Discounted cash flow analysis of this scenario, using 2008 through 2010 REE bulk mixed concentrate prices, and capital and operating costs, yields a 40 percent Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$213 million at a 10 percent discount rate or a US$131 million NPV at a 15 percent discount rate on an after-tax basis over a mine life of 15 years. The Company is performing initial market studies regarding the sale of bulk REE concentrates in North America to potential refiners/processors.
Hydrometallurgical tests for extraction and separation of individual rare-earth oxides are progressing, and the ultimate goal is the production and sale of high-purity oxides of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, and possibly europium, dysprosium, terbium, and other REO. These products may be sold individually as oxides, or in various combinations such as “Didymium” (Neodymium and Praseodymium), “SEG” (Samarium, Europium and Gadolinium), or as mischmetal (a mix of the rare earth elements).
Bear Lodge - Rare Earth Prices
The prices used in this Study are based on historic three-year average concentrate prices. It is important to note the following:
1.
REO concentrate prices are lower than refined REO prices.
2.
Historic REO concentrate prices are significantly lower than the current REO concentrate prices as quoted in Metal Pages. For the Bear Lodge distribution of rare earths, current prices have recently increased approximately 360 percent from the three-year historic average due to the reduction in exports of REE products from China during the third quarter of 2010; however, it is unknown if the current higher prices are sustainable.
3.
A 10 percent change in the price of REO concentrate would change the Base Case NPV of the project on an after-tax basis by approximately $58 million at a 10 percent discount rate, and $42 million at a 15 percent discount rate.
4.
The sale of concentrates from Bear Lodge would likely be subject to a long-term supply contract for which a price would be set in the contract with one or more buyers. These long-term prices can differ substantially from quoted spot prices for metals with smaller markets such as REEs.
The price assumptions used by Boyd for the REO concentrates are based on compilations of the past three years that range from $4.59 (2008), to $3.65 (2009), to $7.54/kg (2010). These concentrates contain approximately 43.5 percent REO and were derived from deposits that have a similar, but slightly less valuable, REO distribution compared to the Bear Lodge deposits. The 2010 concentrate price is based on Metal-Pages’ data through August 31, 2010.
A recent price quote for REE concentrates on an FOB China basis, as reported on September 2, 2010 by Metal-Pages.com, was $33.25/kg and on February 3, 2011, is $38/kg. The elements needed for high-strength permanent REE magnets include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium; prices were quoted by Metal-Pages (September 2, 2010) at $56.75, $55.75, $288 and $595/kg, respectively for those elements, and (February 3, 2011) at $104.50, $103.50, $365 and $630/kg, respectively. Current REE producers seek to increase production of neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium to meet the growing demand from magnet manufacturers. This underlines the need for new producers with mineral resources having an REE distribution that is more reflective of current market demand, such as that indicated for the bastnasite-group minerals at Bear Lodge.
The economic model suggested by IMCOA and tested by Boyd envisions a 5 percent market share capture (10,400 metric tonnes of up to a 200,000-tonne REO market) specifically for cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, plus significant quantities of other rare earths. This assumes that 2 other mines, one in the USA and one in Australia, plus possibly one or two others will go into production prior to Bear Lodge, and that IMCOA’s projections of market growth will allow additional producers of the light and heavy rare earths to successfully market their products by 2015.
For the purposes of the PEA, the Company has also shown a case that uses a 25 percent increase from the three-year trailing average prices used in the Base Case scenario. The Company believes these may more realistically reflect long-term pricing for REO based on market outlook information available at this time. As with the recent pricing for REO, there is no certainty these prices will be maintained for the duration of the operating life of the Bear Lodge REE Project.
Bear Lodge - Capital Costs
Capital cost estimates for the Bear Lodge REE Project are lower than many other REE projects for two principal reasons: 1) infrastructure in the project vicinity is already well established with an excellent road and highway system, nearby railroads, nearby power lines, an available water source, and skilled labor within several local communities; and 2) the metallurgical pre-concentration of rare-earth minerals is a very simple and low-cost process that upgrades the mineralized material for further hydrometallurgical concentration.
The capital cost estimate for the base-case production is projected at $87 million in construction capital and $88 million in sustaining capital. This scenario involves development of the Bull Hill deposit at a mining rate of 1000 tons per day (tpd) or 360,000 tons per year (tpy). Operating costs for the project are estimated at $213 per ton of material milled, with the most significant single cost being reagent consumption in hydrometallurgical processing. The model assumes mining by open pit methods and processing of the mineralized material on site to produce mineral pre-concentrates by crushing, attritioning with water, and size separation methods. REE recoveries of 90 percent are assumed for the mineral pre-concentration based on preliminary bench-scale testwork; however these results have yet to be confirmed with pilot-scale tests. While this model further assumes construction of a hydrometallurgical plant near the mine site, the current plans are to move this plant off site to an industrial area where there is access to water and low-cost power for the processing of the REE mineral concentrates in order to produce a bulk mixed REE concentrate. Metallurgical recovery to a concentrate is estimated at 90 percent from the pre-concentrate, for overall recoveries of approximately 80 to 85 percent into the concentrate. All of these process stages are being tested currently for optimization and reduction of operating costs, and significant progress is being made with potential reduction of reagent costs.
Further testwork is ongoing to extract and separate individual REO products to 99+ percent purity levels. The Company’s ultimate goal is the production and sale of individual high-purity rare-earth oxides (REO), which would require additional capital costs.
Bear Lodge - REO Distribution
The REE mineral resources at Bear Lodge are of potentially significant interest to the market because of their relatively high proportions of contained neodymium, praseodymium, europium, dysprosium and terbium. Demand is
increasing for these elements in the magnet production and other industries, but they typically occur in lower concentrations in the majority of known REE deposits.
Bear Lodge - PEA Summary
The results of the PEA demonstrate that the Bear Lodge REE Project can achieve acceptable after-tax returns on invested capital and therefore warrants further investment to advance the project to a prefeasibility level of analysis. Increased rates of return are potentially achievable through any combination of higher prices, increased product sales, higher mineral resource/reserve grades, lower operating costs, or higher metal recoveries.
Boyd recommended that the Bear Lodge REE Project proceed to a Preliminary Feasibility level analysis. The recommended work includes completion of bulk sampling, pilot plant testing, further drilling of the Bull Hill and Bull Hill NW deposits to upgrade more of the REE mineral resources to Measured or Indicated categories of confidence, REO extraction and separation testwork on both the Bull Hill and Bull Hill NW deposits, environmental studies, mine permitting, and continuing community engagement.
The estimated cost of this work program is $15 million with the work to be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 is currently underway and comprises preparation of an updated mineral resources estimate that includes 2010 drilling results (completed), continued metallurgical testing, and a pilot plant test. Phase 1 work is being conducted on samples and analyses from the 2010 drilling program. Phase 2 includes another drilling program (initiated in June 2011 and extending through November 2011) for further mineral resource expansion, mineral resource definition, and collection of metallurgical samples that will be used in a subsequent full feasibility study. The Phase 2 program will then proceed to more detailed metallurgical testwork and engineering studies, leading to final process design and commercial testing, market studies, environmental studies and mine permitting, community consultation, engineering design, and economic modeling. Phase 2 work commenced in the late spring of 2011.
Risks & Opportunities
The principal risks for the Bear Lodge REE Project are identified as follows:
1.
Permitting and regulatory timelines and outcomes;
2.
Changes in metallurgical recoveries as testwork continues;
3.
Future pricing of REO;
4.
Changes to capital and operating costs as studies continue.
The principal opportunities for the project are identified as follows:
1.
Drilling in 2010 intersected significant grades of REO outside the limits of the mineral resources used in the PEA, which could result in increased mineral resources and potentially extend the mine life and/or support a higher production level.
2.
Optimization work is advancing and has had some success in developing a more cost-effective and efficient metallurgical processing method than that included in the Scoping Study for the Bull Hill area mineralization. These data were not available for the Scoping Study.
3.
Hydrometallurgical tests for extraction and separation of individual rare-earth oxides is progressing, and the ultimate goal is the production and sale of high-purity oxides of neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium, europium, lanthanum, cerium, and other REO.
4.
Drilling has encountered large areas of low-grade (1.0-1.5 percent REO) oxide mineralization adjacent to the higher grade dikes. These areas are not included in the mineral resource estimates and will be the subject of some drilling and metallurgical testing to determine if the material can be upgraded with a simple, inexpensive process of screening or screening and washing.

Recent Updates
On August 4, 2011, the Company announced the discovery of high grades of heavy rare-earth elements (“HREE”) in the Whitetail Ridge resource area, and in the East Taylor and Carbon target areas, and the discovery of high-grade REE mineralization at the East Taylor target at the Bear Lodge REE Project (Figure 1). All three of the mineralized zones are located in the western half of an expanding REE mineralized district (the Bear Lodge REE District). The western areas are characterized by high grades (>3 percent REO) and substantial quantities of the light rare earths (“LREE”), along with some of the highest grades of heavy rare earths in North American deposits. They are particularly enriched in europium, terbium, dysprosium, and gadolinium (Eu, Tb, Dy, and Gd). The East Taylor and Carbon targets also contain significant yttrium.
The recognition of substantial grades of HREE, in addition to the known high grades of LREE in the western part of the Bear Lodge rare-earth district, is a major step forward in expanding the potential size of the district. The higher HREE values and projected increased demand for select light and heavy REE could have strongly positive economic benefits to the Bear Lodge REE Project. These deposits may represent a significant source of the most valuable REE, which include neodymium, praseodymium, europium, terbium, and dysprosium. Rare Element is considering a variety of alliances in the advancement of its Bear Lodge REE Project.
Bear Lodge Rare-Earth District-Zonation of light and heavy REE
Discoveries of high-grade REE mineralization at Whitetail Ridge, East Taylor, and Carbon expand the area of known REE mineralization well outside of the Bull Hill deposits and identify a “district” underlain by significant and potentially economic REE mineralization. The data indicate that the Bear Lodge REE District covers a crudely elliptical area that extends approximately 5740 feet (1750m) northwest-southeast by 4260 feet (1300m) northeast-southwest (Figure 1). The Whitetail Ridge resource area and Carbon target are located northwest of the Bull Hill REE deposits, and the East Taylor target is located west of the Bull Hill deposits. Based on a re-evaluation of assay data for the Whitetail Ridge and Carbon areas during the Company’s most recent resource estimation (news release dated 10 June 2011), and newly received REE assay data from the East Taylor target area, assay grades for individual REE between deposits and target areas at the Bear Lodge project suggest a zonation of REE distribution in the district. The mineralization at Whitetail Ridge, East Taylor, and Carbon has a distribution characterized by elevated abundances of HREE relative to the mineralization at Bull Hill. The three western mineralized zones are characterized by high grades and substantial quantities of the LREE, as well as some of the highest grades of HREE in North American deposits. They are particularly enriched in europium, terbium, dysprosium, and gadolinium (Eu, Tb, Dy, and Gd), as shown in Table 5. The HREE enrichment was identified during the re-examination of reverse circulation drill chips in several of the Company’s gold exploration holes. The mineralized intervals in drill holes SUN-076, SUN-079, and SUN-090 were submitted for REE analyses earlier this year, and the assay results demonstrate the HREE enrichment. LREE generally include Ce, La, Nd, Pr, and Sm; HREE include Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y.
These new discoveries indicate good potential for new deposits of high-grade REE in the western half of the Bear Lodge REE project, and those deposits appear particularly enriched in the HREE. A grade comparison of individual REE between the Bull Hill resource, the Whitetail Ridge resource, and drill holes at the East Taylor and Carbon target areas is given below in Table 5. The location and geologic setting of the deposits and targets are shown in Figure 1.

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource", which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the "Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates" above.
Identification of High-grade HREEs at the Whitetail Ridge Deposit
The identification of significant HREE mineralization at the Whitetail Ridge resource area is the result of a detailed evaluation of assay data during the most recent resource estimation work (news release dated June 14, 2011). This recognition triggered a review of all the REE mineralized drill holes in the general western area. The Whitetail Ridge deposit is located approximately 1500 feet (450 m) northwest of the main Bull Hill REE deposit (Figure 1). The area was identified previously as an exceptional REE mineralization target (news release dated October 13, 2009), based on factors including: 1) the intersection of REE mineralization as FMR (FeOx-MnOx-REE; designated as MnOx veins in Figure 1) dikes and veins in five nearby historic drill holes; 2) detailed geological mapping of FMR vein material in historic exploration trenches (Figure 1); and 3) a broad positive ground geophysical anomaly of a type coincident with significant REE mineralization in other parts of the project area. The size of the geophysical anomaly (approximately 1400 by 2000 feet, 400 by 610 m, elongate northeasterly) provides an indication that this REE target may be larger than others in the district. Detailed mapping suggests that the REE mineralization consists of northwest-striking FMR dikes and an FMR stockwork zone that is elongate northeasterly, with dimensions of roughly 1250 feet (380 meters) by 950 feet (290 meters). The enveloping geophysical anomaly is larger and may indicate a broader distribution of REE mineralization beneath the extensive soil and colluvial cover. Preliminary mineralogical studies by Dr. Anthony N. Mariano indicate that monazite (an REE-Th phosphate) may represent a significant proportion of the REE mineralogy, and that the HREE mineralization may reside in the monazite. Grades for europium, gadolinium, terbium, and dysprosium for the current Whitetail Ridge resource estimate, as reported in Table 5, are among the highest in North American REE deposits.
During the 2010 drilling program, two core holes were completed in the Whitetail Ridge area from a single drill site (Figure 1). Both holes encountered significant intercepts of REE mineralization that exhibit strong enrichment in both LREE and HREE (Tables 5 and 6; news release dated November 9, 2010). Only a small portion of the large Whitetail Ridge target area was tested with the holes, but the drilling gives a good indication of the total potential of the target area. These holes, plus historic drill-hole assay data from five widely spaced older holes in the general target area, surface mapping, and trench sampling assay data were all used directly or indirectly by ORE to estimate an inferred mineral resource for Whitetail Ridge of 1.7 million tons (1.5 million metric tonnes) averaging 3.24 percent TREO (news release dated June 14, 2011). Drilling is currently underway at the Whitetail Ridge deposit and surrounding target area. Approximately 12 to 15 additional holes are planned for the target area in 2011.

New High-grade REE Discovery at East Taylor and HREE-enrichment
The East Taylor target is located approximately 2500 feet (760 m) west of the main Bull Hill REE deposit and 2500 feet southwest of the Whitetail Ridge deposit (Figure 1). The Taylor target area was principally known as a gold target until the 2010 drilling program intersected a thick FMR zone in reverse circulation (RC) drill-hole SUN-090. Drill-hole SUN-090 and an earlier RC hole drilled by Newmont (SUN-009) were collared adjacent to an outcrop of FMR veins identified by the U.S. Geological Survey (Staatz, 1983) (Figure 1). The zone appears to have an easterly strike, as opposed to the dominant northwesterly and northerly mineralized structures in the Bull Hill/Whitetail Ridge deposits. Preliminary geological mapping and projection of FMR intercepts in drill holes suggest that the REE mineralization consists of dikes and adjacent stockwork with dimensions of roughly 700 feet (210 meters) east-west by 250 feet (75 meters) north-south, and the mineralization is open to the east.
The REE mineralization was recognized in drill chips from SUN-090 by Rare Element geologist, Allen Andersen. The mineralized intercepts were sent subsequently for quantitative REE assays, reported here in Tables 5 and 7. Newmont hole SUN-009 also intersected strong REE mineralization in a correlative intercept (Table 7), The high-grade REE zone in drill-hole SUN-090 is contained within a well-mineralized gold zone that averages 0.038 ounces per ton (1.3 grams per tonne) from 0 to 205 feet (0-62.5 m). Correlative FMR mineralization was recognized also in Newmont drill hole SUN-023, which was not assayed for REE. Follow-up core drilling at the East Taylor target was undertaken with seven drill holes. Assays are pending.

REE assays for Newmont drill-hole SUN-009 were done using partial digestion analytical methods. In many cases values exceeded the upper limit of the method for individual REE (i.e. upper assay limit for Ce was 5000 ppm.
It should be noted that the Company’s proprietary internal standards submitted with the samples from drill hole SUN-090 were certified at that time for only Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Th, and U, and not for the other REE. The samples are now being re-submitted with the newly developed standards that are certified for Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Th, and U. Rare Element’s rigorous QA/QC program exceeds industry standards, as REE assays are routinely reported and assessed using only analytical laboratory standards for evaluation of data quality.
Discovery of High-grade HREEs at the Carbon REE Target
The Carbon REE mineralization was identified by Rare Element in drill-hole SUN-079, a reverse circulation drill hole that was part of the Company’s 2010 gold exploration program. The Carbon REE target is located about 1200 feet (370 m) northwest of the Whitetail Ridge deposit along an apparent northwest-trending zone of mineralization (Figure 1). Two reverse-circulation drill holes (SUN-076 and SUN-079) completed during the 2010 Sundance gold exploration program cut significant REE mineralization in FMR vein material. REE-bearing intercepts from the Carbon target area
are summarized in Table 8 and were reported earlier this year in a news release dated April 6, 2011. If this mineralization is a continuation of the Whitetail Ridge dike system and the Bull Hill system, the total mineralization trend may reach more than 5000 feet (1500m) in length.

Assays, Quality Control, and Standard Certification
ALS Chemex conducted the assaying for the REEs reported here in their Vancouver, British Columbia assay facility. ALS Chemex Vancouver is accredited to ISO 9001 and operates according to ALS Group standards consistent with ISO 17025 methods at other laboratories. The samples were prepared and subjected to lithium metaborate fusion, followed by ICP analysis and a mass spectroscopy finish.
Analytical quality is monitored through the use of randomly inserted quality control samples, including standards, blanks, and duplicates, which are blinded to the analytical laboratory. No duplicates were submitted for the SUN-090 samples, owing to insufficient sample. Results of the analyses at ALS Chemex are evaluated continuously by Dr Jeffrey Jaacks, the Company's QA/QC consultant, who is a Qualified Person according to National Instrument 43-101. The results from the current data set indicate acceptable accuracy and precision. Blank analyses also indicate no issues with carry-over contamination.
Rare Element Resources developed a set of proprietary internal REE analytical standards using Bear Lodge deposit mineralized material during late 2009 and early 2010 under the supervision of Dr. Jaacks. The original round robin assay series at four laboratories indicated that these materials could be used as standards for Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Th, and U analyses. However, the results also indicated that the concentration of the remaining elements in the REE series were at the lower end of the working range of the analytical method, and standard values gave unacceptable accuracy and precision for Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu analyses. The Company conducted a new round robin standard certification program during the first half of the current year. The results from most recent round robin assay series qualify the reference materials for a greater number of rare-earth elements. Improvements in analytical methods, and a larger base of certification analyses generated by utilizing eight analytical laboratories, indicates that the standards can be used as reference materials for Au, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Th, and U analyses.
2011 REE Drill Program
The 2011 REE drilling program commenced in mid June 2011 at the Company’s Bear Lodge REE Project in Wyoming. Four core drilling rigs are currently on the project site and will be used to test REE mineralization at the Bull Hill and Whitetail Ridge resource areas, and at the Bull Hill West, East Taylor, and Carbon REE target areas. The program to test the REE mineralization will consist of approximately 60 angle drill holes to general depths of 400 to 1,200 feet. The REE drilling program will be augmented by geological mapping, geophysical surveys, soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, and additional bulk sampling of near-surface mineralized material.
Personnel
The Company hired a government and community affairs specialist, Mr. George G. Byers as VP Government and Community Affairs, to advance project development activities on the Bear Lodge REE Project. With the guidance of Mr. Byers, the Company has initiated a program to educate federal, state, and local government officials and community leaders about the quality and quantity of the Bear Lodge REE mineral resources, and about its exceptional exploration and development potential.
The Company hired Jaye T. Pickarts, P.E. as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Company. Mr. Pickarts’ primary focus will be to lead the technical team in advancing the Company’s Bear Lodge REE project through the development phase and into production. Mr. Pickarts’ primary responsibilities are to coordinate all of the following activities: mine planning, mineral processing and hydrometallurgical studies, environmental baseline assessment and permitting studies, other engineering studies, and completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study. Successful completion of these studies with positive results will allow the project to advance to Feasibility Study stage and further the project’s development.
Dr. James G. Clark, L.Geo, the Company’s Vice President of Exploration, assisted by John Ray, Exploration Manager and Dr. Ellen Leavitt, Chief Geologist/REE, lead the Bear Lodge REE Project exploration program. Dr. Clark and Dr. Leavitt are both qualified persons for the purposes of NI 43-101.
During the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company incurred $6.9 million in exploration expenses on the Bear Lodge REE Project. As of at June 30, 2011, the Company had incurred a total of $11.3 million on exploration work at the Bear Lodge REE Project.

Sundance Gold Project
The Sundance Gold Project is the second project located on the Company’s Bear Lodge Property. For a description of the property’s location, ownership, accessibility, infrastructure and climate, see the section heading “Item 2. Properties - Bear Lodge Property (Wyoming, USA)” above.
Mineral Resources
The Company reported an NI 43-101-compliant inferred mineral resource estimate for the Sundance Gold Project on March 15, 2011. The gold mineral resource estimate was prepared by ORE of Lakewood, Colorado.
Drill-hole Database Compilation and Mineral Resource Estimation
Following compilation of the Sundance drill-hole database, ORE analyzed the data to determine the size, shape, and internal continuity of the three principal gold deposits in order to calculate inferred mineral resources. Alan C. Noble, P.E., is the Principal Engineer of ORE and is an independent Qualified Person for the purpose of Canadian NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. These wireframe models will also be utilized to design the optimal placement of new drill holes to be completed in 2011.
The East and West Breccias of the Smith deposit were discovered by FMC (1982-1986), and subsequently explored by International Curator and Coca Mines (“Coca”). In 1991, Coca estimated a historical mineral resource of 8.2 million tons (7.4 million metric tonnes) at a grade of 0.02 ounces of gold per ton (0.68 g/t; not NI 43-101compliant) for the two deposits. The Company is not treating the historical estimate as NI 43-101 defined mineral resources verified by a qualified person, and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. The new ORE mineral resource estimate updates this historical mineral resource to the current standards and incorporates the drilling done during the past several years by Rare Element Resources and Newmont Mining Company. The new Smith mineral resource includes 25.2 million tonnes grading 0.50 grams of gold/tonne at a cutoff of 0.15 g/t (Table 9). Mineral resource estimates for the Taylor and Carbon areas are also shown in Table 9.

Mineral Resources are not Reserves
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates do not account for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution. These mineral resource estimates are in the inferred mineral resource category. Inferred mineral resources are normally considered too speculative geologically for the application of economic considerations that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, however they are allowed to be included in a preliminary economic assessment. There is also no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be converted to measured and indicated mineral resource categories through further drilling, or into mineral reserves once economic considerations are applied. Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the "Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates" above.
Drill-hole Results from the 2010 Program
The Company announced assay results from the 2010 rotary (reverse circulation) drill program in three previous press releases (dated September 21 and November 15, 2010 and January 3, 2011). Thirty-four rotary drill holes containing 21,605 feet (6,585 m) were drilled during 2010 on near-surface targets within oxide zone mineralization at the Smith, Carbon, and Taylor target areas (Figure 2). Gold exploration activity during 2010 focused on: 1) detailed definition of known gold-mineralized targets with in-fill drilling, 2) step-off drilling from known mineralization, and 3) discovery of gold mineralization in new peripheral gold targets.

Quality Assurance
The mineral resource estimate was completed by Mr. Alan C. Noble, P.E., principal engineer of ORE, and is based on geological interpretations supplied by the Company to ORE and subsequently modified by ORE. Mr. Noble is an independent qualified person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators and has verified the data disclosed in this release.
The Rare Element Resources’ field programs were carried out under the supervision of Dr. James G. Clark, LGeo, the Company’s Vice President of Exploration and a qualified person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators. Dr. Clark has direct experience with the project dating back to 1986.
A detailed QA/QC program was implemented by the Company for the 2010 drill program. The 2009 QA/QC program was organized by Dr. Jeffrey Jaacks. Newmont Mining was responsible for QA/QC during their work from 2004 through 2009. Dr. Jaacks and Dr. Clark have verified the 2010 sampling procedures and QA/QC data delivered to ORE. They share the opinion that the data are of good quality and suitable for use in the mineral resource estimate.

Upcoming / Outlook
The Company’s plans for 2011 include completion of metallurgical tests of the Smith deposit mineralized rock, continuation of geochemical and structural reviews, conducting a limited geophysical survey, and rotary and core drilling to define the lateral limits of known gold mineral resources at Smith, Taylor, and Carbon, which are open in several directions, as well as deeper and to identify and define outlying targets.
The new mineral resources estimate will be used to guide a subsequent planned drilling program. The Company’s 2011 exploration program will focus on expanding zones of greater than 1 g Au/t mineralization to enhance future economic evaluations. This mineral resource is provided for information and the Company believes that subsequent work on the gold targets may provide an asset that has the potential to substantially increase in size and value to the Company in the future.
