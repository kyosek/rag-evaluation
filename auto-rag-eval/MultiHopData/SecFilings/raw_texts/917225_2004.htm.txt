Item 2. Properties
Pedra Branca Platinum Group Metals Project, Brazil
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of Pedra Branca Property)
We are exploring the Pedra Branca property for platinum and palladium mineralization (platinum group metals, or "PGM"). We hold 100% interest in 60 exploration concessions in Ceará State, Brazil comprising the Pedra Branca Project at December 31, 2004, totaling approximately 61,357 hectares. Altoro Mineraçao Ltda., a subsidiary of ours incorporated in Brazil, holds all 60 concessions. Eldorado Gold Corporation is entitled to a 2% NSR royalty on 10 of the concessions totaling 10,000 hectares.
On January 28, 2003, we entered into an agreement with Anglo Platinum whereby Anglo Platinum may earn a 51% interest in the Pedra Branca Project, by spending $7 million on exploration at Pedra Branca over a four-year period. Anglo Platinum agreed to a minimum expenditure of $500,000 during the first six months of the agreement. Anglo Platinum can earn an additional 9% interest in Pedra Branca (for a total of 60%) by completing a bankable feasibility study. Anglo Platinum can also earn an additional 5% interest in Pedra Branca (for a total of 65%) by arranging for financing to put the project into commercial production. In July 2004, we signed the First Amendment to Pedra Branca Letter Agreement that provided Anglo Platinum a ten-month period (to May 26, 2005) to complete its Phase II $500,000 work commitment, and extended subsequent work commitments by one-year. Anglo Platinum met its minimum required expenditure for the first six-month period and has nearly completed its ten-month $500,000 Phase II work commitment. Anglo Platinum is currently reviewing the results of the exploration program, before making a decision on whether to fund the next $1.25 million in exploration, or terminate its option to earn an interest. If Anglo Platinum declines to continue, Solitario will retain 100% of the Pedra Branca Project.
Land payments for 2005 are projected to be approximately $42,000. This amount may change due to the reduction or addition of properties, or a change in the currency exchange rate.
The mineral interests held by us within the property are subject to the mining regulations of Brazil. These rights are granted by the Brazilian government and administered by the National Department of Mineral Production ("DNPM"). To obtain mineral concessions from the DNPM, we must provide the DNPM with work plans and pay an initial fee of approximately $0.60 per hectare, depending upon the Brazil-U.S. exchange rate. To keep the concessions in good standing, we must continue to pay the regular annual fee of $0.90 per hectare and provide the DNPM with annual progress reports. We are subject to yearly inspections by the DNPM for compliance with reported plans and environmental regulations. In addition, the exploration concessions may be converted to exploitation concessions by demonstrating the economic feasibility of the project.
Prior to mining on the claims we must reach an agreement with the surface rights owners of the affected land. Additionally, we must pay a royalty to governmental agencies based on the materials produced. This amount is 0.2% of the sales for precious metals excluding gold, which is subject to a 3% royalty.
We currently hold no surface rights to the property but have entered into short-term agreements with the surface rights owners to compensate for exploration activities.
A number of prospects have been located on the project, which have undergone surface, and in some cases, drill exploration. A total of 15 prospects have been located throughout the property with surface showings of significant geochemical values. Drilling has intersected significant mineralization on six of these prospects.
2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
Access to the project is by paved road from the state capital of Forteleza in Ceará State and by local farm roads. Where necessary, local access is constructed. The largest towns in the immediate vicinity of the project are Pedra Branca and Boa Viagem. A field camp is located at the small community of Capitao Mor. The climate is warm and dry for eight months of the year with a warm wet season prevailing for the remaining four months. Year-round operation can be conducted. The topography is rolling to flat and vegetation is sparse to heavy brush. The elevation in no location exceeds 800 meters.
3. History
In the 1980's Rio Tinto Ltd., ("Rio Tinto") and Gencore, Ltd. ("Gencore") performed exploration work on part of the project now operated by us. Both companies did surface exploration and drilling, including 42 diamond drill holes by Rio Tinto and 8 diamond drill holes by Gencore on the former Eldorado lease. In October 2000, we completed a plan of arrangement (the "Plan of Arrangement") whereby we acquired Altoro Gold Corp. ("Altoro"). In 2000, Altoro acquired the concessions from the government over the property previously held by Rio Tinto. We acquired additional concessions in 2000 and 2001 to cover extensions of the mineralized trend.
Altoro, prior to the Plan of Arrangement with us, conducted surface work and drilled 18 diamond drill holes. Subsequently, Altoro entered into a Joint Venture agreement with Rockwell Ventures, Inc. ("Rockwell") of Vancouver, British Columbia under which Rockwell conducted further surface exploration and drilled an additional 31 holes. Rockwell terminated its agreement with Altoro in June 2001. From July 2001 until January of 2003, we conducted geochemical sampling, geophysical surveys and drilled 54 diamond drill holes. From January 2003 to date, Anglo Platinum funded two drilling programs that focused on better defining the Esbarro and Curiu deposits, further testing the Cedro, Trapia and Santo Amaro prospects, and initial drill testing of 10 other target areas. A total of 208 core holes have been drilled on the property to date.
4. Geological Setting
The project lies within an Archean-aged block in the Brazilian shield, which is characterized by amphibolite grade metamorphic rocks of various compositions. The most common rock types in the area are unmineralized intermediate to felsic composition gneisses and granitic intrusive phases.
The PGM mineralization occurs in specific stratigraphic intervals within a segmented mafic-ultramafic layered complex. The mineralized intervals comprise concordant layers, originally of composition varying from peridotite to dunite. These layers contain chromite and/or minor sulfides of iron, copper and/or nickel. The primary silicate ultramafic minerals in the rocks have been variably converted to amphibole, serpentine or talc. A number of separate bodies of the ultramafic phases of the complex have been discovered, some of which contain the PGM-bearing stratigraphic intervals. All of the rocks have been folded and faulted to differing degrees during dynamic metamorphism in the area.
5. Prior Exploration
Surface exploration conducted, initially by Altoro, and subsequently by Rockwell and then us, consists of:
Reconnaissance geologic mapping and rock sampling
Systematic line cutting, soil sampling and geologic mapping of lines
Ground magnetics
Stream sediment and panned-concentrate geochemistry
Diamond drilling of 15 prospect areas
All of the above work has been conducted directly by us, our predecessor or its partners with the exception of diamond drilling which was performed by Boart-Longyear Geoserv do Brasil and Major Drilling. Ground magnetometry was conducted primarily using a Scintrex Portable EnviMag model number 788011 hand-held magnetometer with a base station for recording diurnal corrections.
Soil and rock surveying conducted to date shows that both methods reliably reflect the location of outcropping and subcropping PGM mineralization. Twenty areas with significant soil and/or rock anomalies have been located within the area covered by line gridding. Detailed geologic mapping has been conducted over the majority of these locations to determine the source of anomalous PGM values. Further, basic work of this nature is planned in future programs to more fully determine the potential of the entire project.
The targeted ultramafic rocks are generally more magnetic than the surrounding rocks and magnetometry has been shown to be effective at locating these bodies, though magnetometry and surface geochemical sampling does not determine the PGM content of an ultramafic body with certainty. Additional ground magnetometry is planned to locate potential buried targets and to direct surface exploration techniques to define outcropping and subcropping bodies. Drilling has successfully intersected potentially ore-grade PGM mineralization in several areas.
We believe the data obtained from the above exploration activities to be reliable, however the nature of exploration mineral properties and analysis of geological information is subjective and data and conclusions are subject to uncertainty including invalid data as a result of many reasons, including sample contamination, analysis variation, extrapolation, and the use of geologic and economic assumptions.
6. Mineralization
The stratigraphic layering of an ultramafic body controls the PGM content of the ultramafic rocks. In many cases the PGM grade is associated with the mineral chromite. In other areas the PGM is more closely related with minor sulfide concentration. However, the presence of either chromite or sulfides within ultramafic rocks does not assure elevated PGM grade.
Within PGM-enriched ultramafics, grade and thickness can vary considerably. Widths encountered vary from several to tens of meters in interpreted true thickness. In no location has drilling been conducted on spacing of sufficient density to assure the continuity necessary to define reserves. For this reason no representation can be made as to the probability of defining reserves.
7. Drilling
A total of 208 holes totaling 15,112 meters of core drilling have been completed on the project to date. Of this, 3,217 meters were drilled by Rio Tinto and Gencore for which the core itself is not available, nor are the procedures documented under which the holes were completed.
In the case of holes drilled by Altoro, Rockwell and us, the following procedures were followed. Drill holes were either of NQ (1 and 7/8 inch) or HQ (2 and 1/2 inch) diameter and were boxed in the field under the supervision of the geologist in charge. With the exception of weathered material near surface, at least 90% of the core had recoveries exceeding 90%. The core was transported to the field camp in sealed core boxes where processing took place under the supervision of the geologist in charge.
Based on drill results to date we(believe the prospects Esbarro, Cedro, Curiu, Trapia I and Santo Amaro exhibit results warranting further definition drilling of high priority. We are planning on drilling additional targets in future programs.
The Esbarro prospect, with 105 holes, has the largest database of information of the drilled prospects. Drilling was conducted on fences spaced at approximately 50 meters apart and drill holes averaging 50 meters apart. A high percentage of holes have intersected mineralized material, but the spacing of the drill holes is currently insufficient to substantiate the continuity necessary to define a reserve.
The Curiu prospect is the second most detailed prospect drilled to date with 21 holes completed to date. Drilling was conducted on approximately 25-meter spaced centers. A high percentage of the holes intersected mineralized material. However, additional drilling is required before a reserve can be estimated for this deposit.
We have completed 9 drill holes at Santa Amaro, 8 at the Trapia I, and 19 on the Cedro prospect. Although significant mineralized material was encountered in many of these drill holes, drill hole density is not sufficient to make an estimate of the deposit size.
The inability to resample the drilling of Rio Tinto core holes has reduced the confidence, which would normally be attributed to these results. However, one twin hole drilled next to a Rio Tinto hole at Esbarro showed excellent reproducibility of results. During the current exploration phase of the program, the Rio Tinto and Gencore results are accepted as accurately representing the sampled interval. However, in order to establish a resource or reserve, additional twin holes and/or infill holes are necessary to provide a degree of confidence commensurate with assignment to these categories.
8. Sampling and Analysis
Following is a tabulation of samples taken through October 2003, which are assigned a high degree of confidence in relation to location, type and sample procedure.

Rock sampling generally employed the use of composite surface samples, which are representative aggregates of available material from an outcrop or sub-cropping body collected on the surface. Selective sampling was occasionally used to identify the geochemical character of a rock not representative of an outcrop. This technique represents a small percentage of the total samples collected. Soil samples were collected of soil horizons thought to be derived from the decomposition of underlying bedrock. Soils were screened to -80 mesh prior to pulverization. Stream sediment geochemistry has been applied to both active wet stream beds and dry stream beds. Panned concentrate sampling of both dry and wet stream beds has been effectively utilized on a regional basis.
No known significant factors relating to sampling, drilling or recovery exist that are thought to have an impact on interpreted results. Core recovery is rarely less than 90%, but such cases are sufficiently uncommon as to not have an adverse effect on the interpretation of results.
Assays results for the Rio Tinto and Gencore core samples cannot be checked, as the core is not available for resampling. For all other samples, assaying for PGM was done by Bondar Clegg Laboratories of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Check assays were performed by Altoro and by Rockwell Ventures. All of our programs have been, and will continue to be conducted under a check assay program in progress with samples sent to a third party laboratory (Lakefield Laboratories).
9. Security of Samples
Core samples are sawn on site into two halves, one submitted to the laboratory and one kept in a secure location on site. The half-core, selected according to geologic criteria or regularly spaced intervals, is sent by land or air to the sample preparation laboratory in Goiania, Brazil operated by Bondar Clegg Laboratories. The samples are sealed on site under the supervision of the geologist in charge and the laboratory is instructed to report any breaks in the seal to the Project Manager. No such security breaches have been noted since Solitario has taken over operation of the project.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
There are no reported reserves.
11. Mining Operations
There are no current mining operations associated with this project.
12. Planned Exploration
We, together with Anglo Platinum, are reviewing data to develop the 2005 exploration plan. Continued exploration and delineation drilling, and pre-feasibility work are under consideration.
Triunfo Gold-Silver-Lead-Zinc Property, Bolivia
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of Triunfo Property)
We are exploring the Triunfo project for gold, silver, lead and zinc. The property position consists of three concessions totaling 256 hectares. We signed an Option to Purchase ("Option") a 100% interest in the concessions with private Bolivian individuals ("Vendors") controlling the concessions in July 2003. An amendment modifying the Option was signed in March of 2004. The Option, as amended, calls for Solitario to spend up to $2.3 million on exploration activities over a five-year period. The first year work commitment of $100,000 has been completed. The second year work commitment is $200,000, with escalating commitments thereafter. Additionally, the Vendors may receive payments of up to $185,000 over the first four years, with an option for us to acquire a 100% interest in the property by making a one-time payment of $1.0 million ("Option Payment") by the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Option. The first and second payments of $10,000 and $15,000, respectively, have been made. The next payment of $25,000 is due September 9, 2005 with another $35,000 payment due six months thereafter. Solitario can elect to make the Option Payment prior to the fifth anniversary and forego any remaining scheduled work commitments or Vendor payments, as long as the scheduled work commitments expenditures and Vendor cash payments are current at the time of the Option Payment. We may elect to terminate the Option at anytime without any additional payment or work commitment obligations due to the Vendor.
2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
The project is located about 50 kilometers east of the Bolivian capital of La Paz at an elevation of approximately 4,500 meters. Access is gained by a well-maintained gravel road from La Paz. We have completed construction of a 2.5-kilometer road to the property significantly upgrading access.
Climate is typical of the Bolivian altiplano that varies from cool dry weather to sub-freezing days with significant snow and wind. Although located relatively near La Paz, the nearest small village of Tres Rios is situated six-kilometers to the southeast. The surrounding area has high relief and the property is positioned between the mountains of Illimani and Mururata, both over 6,000 meters high. Vegetation is very sparse.
3. History
Not much is known about the history of mining on the property. During the past ten years, the Vendors excavated a 50-meter long adit to sample a part of the mineralized area. Prior to the Vendors work, it is believed that several other adits were excavated into other parts of the mineralized zone, but these tunnels have subsequently collapsed.
4. Geological Setting
The geology of the Triunfo project consists of Paleozoic-aged interlayered shales, black shales, siltstones and quartzites. These rock formations have been faulted and folded. Two large granitic batholiths occur to the north and south of the property.
5. Prior Exploration
We began surface exploration activities in August 2003, and consequently only a limited amount of surface exploration consisting of detailed geologic mapping and channel sampling has been completed. Mapping has indicated that the main area of interest occurs along an east-west trending anticline with an interpreted steep fault along its axis. To date, geochemical results for 266 rock chip samples have been received. An induced-polarization geophysical survey over the mineralized area was completed in 2004.
6. Mineralization
The project hosts a large mineralized area extending for at least 800 meters in length and up to 200 meters in width. Mineralization occurs as a stockwork zone of veining within a sequence of Paleozoic shales, siltstones and quartzites. The veining is generally steeply dipping and trends east-west parallel with the axis of folding. Within the mineralized zone, surface sampling has returned elevated values of gold, silver, lead and zinc.
7. Drilling
No drilling has been conducted on the project, although, a road for drill rig access was completed to the mineralized area in 2004.
8. Sampling and Analysis
To date, 266 rock chip samples have been conducted over select parts of the property. The sampling procedure consists of chipping pieces of rock with a hammer from outcropping rock formations over a continuous length of usually four or five meters. The axis of the long sample is oriented perpendicular to the trend of veining, wherever possible. The samples are placed in cloth or plastic bags, labeled and sealed, and then sent to ALS Chemex laboratories for(analysis.
9. Security of Samples
Surface rock chip samples collected are sealed within a cloth or plastic bag by the geologist and stored in a secure area until shipped to the laboratory via bus transportation.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
There are no reported reserves or resources.
11. Mining Operations
There are no current mining operations associated with this project.
12. Planned Exploration
Based upon the work completed to date, we believe the property is ready for drill testing. We have recently initiated an effort to secure a joint venture partner to fund this drilling.
Bongara Zinc Project, Peru
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of Bongara Property)
The Bongara project consists of 10 concessions comprising 6,000 hectares of mineral rights granted to Minera Bongara S.A., a subsidiary of ours incorporated in Peru. The property is located in the Department of Amazonas. All of the claims are owned 100% by us and have no underlying agreements or royalty obligations. According to Peruvian law, concessions may be held indefinitely, subject only to payment of annual fees to the government. Each year a payment of $3.00 per hectare must be made by the last day of June to keep the claims in good standing. Because the Bongara concessions are more than 10 years old beginning in 2005, there is a $6.00 surcharge per hectare. Land payments made in 2004 were $18,100 and payments in 2005 are projected to be $54,000. We have a surface rights agreement with the local community, which controls the surface of the primary area of interest. This agreement provides for an annual payment of $5,000 in return for the right to perform exploration work including road building and drilling.
An environmental permit is required for advanced exploration projects in Peru. The requisite environmental and archeological studies have been completed and the permit has been granted for future exploration activities subject to approval of amendments describing annual planned work.
2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
The Bongara property is accessed by the paved Carretera Marginal road, which provides access from the coastal city of Chiclayo. The area of the majority of past drilling and the most prospective mineralization is currently inaccessible by road, the work to date having been done by either foot or helicopter access.
The climate is tropical jungle and the terrain is mountainous. Seasonal rains hamper exploration work for four to five months of the year by limiting access by road. A small village is located approximately four kilometers from the drilling area. The nearest larger town is Pedro Ruiz, which is a base of operations for the project on the main road. We have located a project office in Pedro Ruiz during exploration activities.
3. History
We discovered the Florida Canyon mineralized zone of the Bongara Project in 1996. Subsequently, we optioned the property in December 1996 to Cominco. Cominco withdrew from the joint venture in February 2001. All of the significant work on the property has been conducted by Cominco and is described below in section 5, Prior Exploration.
4. Geological Setting
The geology of the Bongara area is relatively simple consisting of a sequence of Jurassic and Triassic clastic and carbonate rocks which are gently deformed. The Mississippi Valley type mineralization occurs in the carbonate faces of this sedimentary sequence.
5. Prior Exploration
We conducted a regional stream sediment survey and reconnaissance geological surveys leading to the discovery of the Florida Canyon area. The discovered outcropping mineralization is located in two deeply incised canyons within the limestone stratigraphy.
Subsequent to our initial work, Cominco conducted extensive mapping, soil and rock sampling, stream sediment surveys and drilling. This work was designed to determine the extent and grade of the zinc-lead mineralization and the controls of deposition. All work performed by us or Cominco was done by direct employees of the respective companies with the exception of the drilling which was performed by Bradley Drilling Co.
6. Mineralization
Mineralization occurs as massive to semi-massive replacements of sphalerite and galena localized by specific sedimentary facies within the limestone stratigraphy and by structural feeders and karst breccias. A total of eleven preferred beds for replacement mineralization have been located within the middle unit of the Chambara Formation. Mineralization is associated with the conversion of limestone to dolomite, which creates open spaces within the rock formations, promoting the passage of mineralizing fluids through the rock formations. Karst features are localized along faults, in particular the Sam Fault, which cuts the Chambara formation in a north-northeasterly direction. Mineralized karst structures are up to fifty meters in width. The stratigraphically controlled mineralization is typically several meters in thickness but locally attains thicknesses of eight to ten meters. Generally the stratigraphic mineralization, while thinner, is of higher grade.
The middle unit of the Chambara formation, where mineralized, is commonly dolomitized within the zone of highest sedimentary-induced permeability. Dolomitization reaches stratigraphic thicknesses in excess of 100 meters locally. This alteration is thought to be related to the mineralized event in some cases and is an important exploration tool. Continuity of the mineralization is thought to be demonstrable in areas of highest drilling density by correlation of mineralization within sedimentary facies typical of specific stratigraphic intervals.
7. Drilling
A total of 81 diamond drill holes (HQ and NQ size) have been completed at the Florida Canyon Prospect. These holes vary in depth up to 610 meters. The geologic targets that these holes test are nearly evenly divided between near-vertical karst hosted targets and near-horizontal stratigraphically-controlled mineralization. The mineralized area that has been drilled measures approximately two by two kilometers. All drilling was done by a LF-70 core-drilling rig.
Drilling on stratigraphic targets has shown that certain coarser bioclastic or pseudo-breccia facies of the stratigraphy are hosts for mineralization. Although the mineralization intersected in adjacent holes within the same stratigraphic unit often appears to be continuous, the drill spacing of approximately 100 meters is insufficient to define a reserve in Mississippi Valley type deposits. Similarly, the drilling on the karst style of mineralization is of insufficient density to define a resource.
8. Sampling and Analysis
Rock samples taken were composited from mineralization or alteration within an outcrop. The samples were pulverized and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) for a variety of elements including zinc and lead. Soil samples were screened to -80 mesh prior to pulverization and analysis by ICP.
Core samples were transported from the drill by helicopter in sealed boxes to the processing facility in Pedro Ruiz where they were split by a diamond saw. Half of the core was selected according to geologic criteria under the supervision of the geologist in charge and shipped in sealed bags by land to SGS Laboratories in Lima, where all samples were analyzed by ICP. Any samples that contained greater than 1% zinc, were then analyzed by wet chemistry assay for zinc and lead to provide a more accurate analysis of grade.
The following is a summary of samples taken and analyzed according to type within the Florida Canyon area.
Sample Type
Core
Rocks
Stream Sediments
Soils
Number of Samples
1,970
3,326
7,733
It was found that ICP systematically underestimated the true grade in high-grade samples in excess of 1% zinc. This systematic error varies according to grade with the higher samples having the largest error. The average error of all reported core results for ICP was approximately 10% below the true grade. All grades reported to the public have been based on assay rather than geochemical techniques in order to represent the most accurate data possible.
9. Security of Samples
As described above the geologist in charge supervised the control of the core sample handling from the drill to the sample preparation facility and in the preparation itself. Sealed containers were used for shipping the samples to the laboratory. No breaches of security of samples are known to have occurred.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
There are no reported mineral reserves or resources.
11. Mining Operations
No mining operations have occurred on the project.
12. Planned Exploration
We are currently searching for a joint venture partner to further advance the project into pre-feasibility.
Yanacocha Royalty Property, Peru
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of Yanacocha Property)
The Yanacocha royalty property consists of 69 concessions totaling approximately 61,000 hectares in northern Peru 25 kilometers north of the city of Cajamarca. The property position consists of a rectangular-shaped contiguous block of concessions nearly 50 kilometers long in an east-west direction and 25 kilometers wide in a north-south direction. The southern boundary of the royalty property abuts Newmont Mining Corporation's Minera Yanacocha mining operation, a large gold mine currently in operation.
We held the concessions until April 2000, at which time we signed an agreement with Newmont Peru, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation (both companies referred to as "Newmont"), whereby we sold our Yanacocha Property to Newmont for $6,000,000 and a sliding scale net smelter return royalty ("NSR-Royalty") that varied from two to five percent, depending on the price of gold. Newmont has not reported reserves on our NSR-Royalty property and we have not received any royalty income from Newmont.
In 2004, the Peruvian government implemented a national NSR-Royalty on minerals that ranges from 1 to 3 percent, depending upon the total revenue from an operation. The top royalty rate applies to operations that produce in excess of US$120 million in annual revenues. Operations producing between US$60 million to US$120 million in annual revenues will have a 2 percent royalty, while a 1 percent royalty will be imposed on smaller operations of less than US$60 million in annual revenues.
In January 2005, we signed and Amended and Restated Royalty Grant with Minera Los Tapados S.A., a subsidiary of Newmont Peru Limited, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L., and Minera Chaupiloma Dos de Cajamarca, S.R.L. (affiliates of Newmont Peru, Ltd., collectively "Newmont") to modify the NSR-Royalty schedule that recognizes the impact that Peru's national NSR-Royalty has on the exploration and development of new mining operations. The modified royalty structure is classified into several categories, depending on the type of process used to recover each metal, gold and copper prices, as well as any government royalty burden imposed by Peru on the project ores. The following summarizes the revised royalty structure:
Heap leach ores: For gold recovered by heap leach processing, the lesser of the sliding scale royalty set out below (the "Base Rate"), or a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any government royalty required to be paid in Peru is no more than 5.25% NSR unless the gold price is greater than $500 per ounce, in which case then a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any royalty due to the government is no more than 5.75% NSR.

Doré end-product, non-flotation mill ores:
For gold recovered as doré in a non-flotation mill, the lesser of the Base Rate, or a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any government royalty required to be paid in Peru is no more than 4.5% NSR unless the gold price is greater than $500 per ounce, in which case then a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any royalty due to the government is no more than 5% NSR. Concentrate-producing, Cu-Au flotation mill ores: For gold and copper recovered in a concentrate producing, copper-gold flotation mill, the lesser of the Base Rate, or a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any government royalty required to be paid in Peru is no more than 3.5% NSR unless the gold price is greater than $500 per ounce and the copper price is greater than a PPI-indexed price of $1.50 per pound, in which case then a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any royalty due to the government is no more than 4% NSR.
Silver: For silver, the lesser of 3% NSR, or a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any government royalty required to be paid Peru is no more than 4.5% NSR unless the gold price is greater than $500 per ounce, in which case then a royalty such that the royalty to Solitario plus any royalty due to the government is no more than 5% NSR.
As part of the NSR-Royalty modification, Newmont, through its subsidiaries and/or affiliates, agreed to spend an aggregate of $4.0 million on Solitario's royalty property during the next eight years. Details of the newly established work commitment calls for the following expenditure schedule:

2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
The property is easily accessed within an hour by paved and improved gravel roads from the city of Cajamarca, a regional hub for commerce and government administration. The terrain ranges from gently rolling to mountainous and varies in altitude from 2,800 to over 4,200 meters. A rainy season of approximately four months hampers exploration and access, but year-round work can be done. Vegetation in the area consists of alpine tundra type conditions.
3. History
The majority of concessions were acquired in 1993, with several concessions added in 1994 and 1995. We conducted regional surface exploration on the property in 1994 and 1995, which included a limited core-drilling program on two gold targets. At various times between 1995 and 1999, we joint ventured the property with three major mining companies, Barrick Gold Corporation, Rio Tinto, Ltd., and Placer Dome, Inc. All three companies conducted limited surface exploration programs and each elected to terminate its respective option to earn an interest in the property. Barrick Gold Corporation was the only company to conduct exploration drilling on the property. Newmont purchased the property, subject to our retained net smelter return royalty, in April 2000.
4. Geological Setting
The property is situated within a northwest trending belt of Tertiary-aged volcanic and associated intrusive rocks that overlie and intrude Cretaceous-aged sedimentary rocks. The Cretaceous sediments are strongly deformed and consist of a lower sequence of sandstones, shales and quartzites and an upper sequence of carbonate rocks. Approximately half the property is underlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks consisting mainly of older andesitic to dacitic flows and tuffs. Locally these older volcanics are covered by a younger rhyo-dacitic tuff unit. Mineralization usually is hosted in the older volcanic unit.
5. Prior Exploration
We have independently, and through the efforts of our various joint venture partners, collected rock, soil and stream sediment samples on the surface. Geologic mapping has revealed 15 medium-to-large areas of hydrothermal alteration contained within both the volcanic and sedimentary rock units. Three gold targets were tested by us and our joint venture partner Barrick Gold prior to Newmont purchasing the project in 2000. We conducted a large-scale helicopter-bourn geophysical program in 1994 that identified a number of magnetic anomalies. Newmont conducted a more detailed and comprehensive helicopter-bourn geophysical program in 2003. During the past four years Newmont has conducted extensive surface sampling in the central and south-central portion of our NSR-Royalty property and has conducted a limited amount of drilling. The results of these Newmont programs are not available to us for review at this time, but future results of Newmont's work will be made available as part of Newmont's work commitment obligations.
6. Mineralization
Gold mineralization has been identified in at least 15 separate areas within altered volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Alteration generally consists of silicification (addition of quartz to the host rock) and argillization (destruction of feldspar minerals to clay). Rock chip sampling within these altered areas often contains anomalous values of gold, silver, mercury, arsenic or antimony. Alteration appears to be partially controlled by fault structures in the underlying rock formations or proximity to intrusive rocks.
7. Drilling
Twenty-one core-holes totaling approximately 2,700 meters were drilled on three gold targets prior to Newmont purchasing the project in 2000. We drilled eight holes on the Los Negritos prospect and Barrick Gold drilled nine holes at the Shuito prospect and four holes at the Chaluaquero prospect.
8. Sampling and Analysis
Prior to Newmont's purchase of the property, Solitario and its various joint venture partners collected rock samples as composites of specific rock types or as select samples of altered lithologies. Regional stream sediment sampling was also conducted throughout the property. Specific results from these various surface sampling programs have not been compiled into a single data base since the Newmont purchase. We do not anticipate compiling these results, as we no longer hold an operating interest in the property.
9. Security of Samples
The geologist in charge of the project supervised the collection and shipping of the samples by ground transportation to the sample preparation facility in Lima, Peru. Pulps were subsequently shipped to laboratories in North America for analysis.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
No resources or reserves have been delineated on the property.
11. Mining Operations
No mining is conducted on the property.
12. Planned Exploration
We own an NSR-Royalty interest in the property and have no participating interest or control over future exploration activities. Newmont has indicated that it may conduct drilling on Solitario's royalty property in 2005. However, Newmont may, in its sole discretion, elect to defer its $1.0 million, two-year work obligation entirely into 2006.
La Tola Gold Project, Peru
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of La Tola Property)
In October 2003, we acquired the La Tola project to explore for gold and possibly silver. The project is located in southern Peru and consists of 14 concessions totaling 11,030 hectares. We own a 100%-interest in the all the concessions without any underlying owners or royalties, except for a 100-hectare option to buy lease (the "Polet Option") from a private Peruvian party. According to Peruvian law, claims may be held indefinitely subject only to payment of annual fees to the government. A payment of $3.00 per hectare must be made by the last day of June each year to keep the concessions in good standing. We made payments to the government of approximately $36,000 in 2003 and approximately $7,000 in 2004. In 2005 approximately $33,000 will be due to keep all the concessions in good standing.
In March 2004 we signed an Option to Buy agreement with a Peruvian national for an option to purchase the 100 hectare Polet claim at the La Tola Project. Payments were made to the mineral rights holder of $5,000 in March and $10,000 in September of 2004. The agreement provides for 2005 payments of $10,000 in March and $20,000 September. In 2006 one payment of $30,000 is due in March. Prior to September 2006 Solitario may exercise its option to purchase the Polet claim for $200,000. Solitario may withdraw from the agreement at any time without further obligations.
In April 2004, we signed a Letter Agreement with Newmont Peru S.L.R. ("Newmont"), a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, whereby Newmont can earn a 51%-interest in the La Tola property by completing 2,500 meters of drilling (firm commitment) within the first year of the Letter Agreement and by spending the following cumulative amounts on future exploration and development (optional): by end of second year - $1.25 million; by end of third year - $3.0 million; and, by end of fourth year - $7.0 million. Newmont can earn an additional 9% interest (total 60% interest) by completing a feasibility study and an addition 5% interest by arranging 100% project financing. In addition to our participating interest, we also retain a sliding scale NSR-Royalty interest on gold and silver production (0 to 2.25% subject to gold price and the imposed national Peruvian NSR-Royalty rate).
2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
The town of Callalli is accessed by approximately 150 kilometers of paved and improved unpaved roads from the city of Arequipa in southern Peru. The area is situated in the alta plano geomorphic region that consists of gently rolling hills varying in altitude from 3,800 to over 4,800 meters. A rainy season of approximately four months from December through March is relatively mild allowing for year-round work. Vegetation in the area consists of alpine tundra type conditions.
3. History
We staked the 11 concessions in 2003. No previous work is known to have been conducted in the area. We have no obligation for royalties or underlying payments.
4. Geological Setting
The area is underlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks typical of the gold-bearing volcanic field situated throughout the central part of Peru. The area is cut by structures that have undergone hydrothermal alteration, but with very little structural deformation.
5. Prior Exploration
We collected approximately 150 rock chip samples and about 20 stream sediment samples in 2003. Bedrock exposures are quite limited throughout the area. Since signing the Newmont Letter Agreement, Newmont has been responsible for managing all exploration activities on the project. Newmont's exploration program focused on an eight-kilometer long corridor of altered Tertiary volcanic rocks with disseminated and stockwork gold mineralization within a large low-sulfidation gold system. Newmont has collected approximately 4,000 surface samples, including 3,820 meters of trench and channel samples, and conducted 850 line-kilometers of magnetic geophysical surveys and 102 line-kilometers of IP-geophysical surveys to define drill targets.
6. Mineralization
Gold mineralization is found in structures ranging from 1 to several meters in width and in wallrock that has been variably altered to silica, argillic and/or phyllic mineral assemblages with pyrite. Quartz and barite veining is found variably throughout the area. Assay results for approximately 150 rock chip samples indicate gold mineralization occurs along a northeast trending zone that is over eight kilometers long and up to one kilometer in width.
7. Drilling
Newmont Mining Corporation, completed 13 reverse circulation drill holes totaling 1,698 meters testing six target areas in late-2004. The two best holes, LT-04 and LT-05, intersected 18.0 meters grading 1.29 gpt gold and 14.0 meters grading 0.85 gpt gold, respectively. Six of the drill holes did not intersect any mineralization.
8. Sampling and Analysis
Our rock sampling regimen consisted mainly of collecting composites of specific rock types or as select samples of quartz-flooded lithologies associated with structures or bedding. The rock samples were shipped to ALS preparation laboratory in Lima and the pulps were analyzed in their laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia. No duplicates or replicate analyses have been taken. We cannot independently verify Newmont's sampling quality control, but based upon information we believe is reliable, we believe Newmont's sampling quality control meets or exceeds industry standards.
9. Security of Samples
During the period of time that we managed exploration, our geologist in charge has supervised the collection and shipping of the samples by ground transportation to the sample preparation facility in Lima. We cannot independently verify Newmont's sample security, but based upon information we believe is reliable, we believe Newmont's sample security meets or exceeds industry standards.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
No resources or reserves have been delineated on the property.
11. Mining Operations
No mining is conducted on the property.
12. Planned Exploration
Newmont plans to conduct another round of drilling beginning in March 2005. Current plans call for approximately 900 meters of drilling on several untested drill targets.
Windy Peak Gold-Silver Project, Nevada, USA
1. Property Description and Location
(Map of Windy Peak Property)
The Windy Peak gold-silver project is located 45 miles southeast of the town of Fallon in Churchill County, Nevada, USA. On July 12, 2004, we signed an agreement (the "WP Agreement") with Silverthorn Exploration, Inc. ("Silverthorn"), a private Nevada exploration company, to earn up to an 80% interest in the Windy Peak property. The property consists of 144 unpatented mining claims totaling approximately 1,175 hectares To earn an 80% interest in the property, the WP Agreement calls for us to make payments to Silverthorn of $10,000 on signing (paid), $15,000 on the first (annual) anniversary, $20,000 on the second anniversary, $25,000 on the third anniversary; and $30,000 on the fourth anniversary. We must also complete 1,220 meters of drilling (firm commitment) before the first anniversary and then spend the following cumulative amounts on exploration and development (optional commitments); $300,000 before the second anniversary; $1.0 million before the third anniversary; and, $2.0 million in cumulative expenditures before the fourth anniversary. Upon completion of these payment and work commitment obligations, we will then have earned a 60% interest in the property. We have a Phase II Earn-in option to earn an additional 20% (for a total interest of 80%) by spending an additional $2.0 million on exploration and development before the sixth anniversary and paying Silverthorn $50,000 on the fifth and sixth anniversaries. We may elect to terminate the Windy Peak Agreement at anytime after completing the first year's drilling commitment without any additional payment or work commitment obligations due Silverthorn.
2. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology
Access to the project area is very easy. The town of Fallon lies 45 miles north of the project area by paved highway and three miles west of the highway via gravel roads. The area is typical of Nevada's basin and range geomorphology. Altitudes range from 1,600 to over 2,000 meters. A winter season of approximately four months hampers exploration and access from December through March, but year-round work can be conducted.
3. History
Limited small-scale mining activities were conducted by various private parties from 1945 to 1979. Virtually no usable information is available to us from these past mining activities. Silverthorn staked most of the WP claims in 2002 and 2003.
4. Geological Setting
The area is underlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks associated with the 19 million year old Fairview Peak caldera. The volcanic rocks are generally classified as pyroclastic in origin and range in composition from andesite to rhyolite. Much younger dacite dikes cut the older mineralized volcanic package.
5. Prior Exploration
It is believed that at least four mineral exploration companies, excluding Silverthorn, conducted work on various parts of the WP property during the past 25 years. However, none of this information is available to us. Silverthorn conducted geologic mapping, rock chip sampling, sagebrush biogeochemistry, and VLF-EM, VLF-resistivity and magnetic geophysical surveys from 2002 through 2004.
6. Mineralization
Gold and silver mineralization is associated with several styles of mineralization that include both low angle and steeply dipping structures that contain quartz veins, mineralization associated with hydrothermal vent breccias, mineralization associated with the margins of volcanic domes and mineralization associated with volcanic formations that have undergone silicification resulting in the development of jasperoid. rock formations. Quartz veins are generally restricted to only one-meter in width. Other styles of mineralization are tens to hundreds of meters in size and display variably silicified and argillically altered latite volcanic bedrock. The mineralization is characterized by low sulfide concentrations.
7. Drilling
Approximately 60 holes have been drilled on the WP property during the past 20 years by at least four different companies. Although we know where many of the holes are located, we do not have the assay results or the geologic logs of any of the drill holes.
8. Sampling and Analysis
Only a limited number of rock and soil samples are reported from the property and are considered of limited value. Of greater importance are the biogeochemistry samples collected by Silverthorn. Biogeochemical sampling protocol by Silverthorn was as follows. A 15 gram sample of Artemesia t. (sagebrush) was collected at each sample site. Samples were prepared and processed into briquettes by MEG of Carson City, Nevada, and analyzed by neutron activation by ACTLabs of Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.
9. Security of Samples
The chain of custody procedures for sampling performed by Silverthorn are not known. Samples we collected were transported by the geologist to the ALS Chemex sample prep laboratory in Reno, Nevada, and the pulps were then analyzed in ALS Chemex's laboratory in Vancouver, B.C.
10. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimations
No mineral reserves or resources are reported on the property.
11. Mining Operations
There are no mining operations on the property.
12. Planned Exploration
We plan to conduct a 10-hole, 1,220-meter reverse circulation drilling program in the second quarter of 2005.
Reconnaissance Exploration and Pending Concession Applications
Brazil Concession Applications
We conducted grassroots reconnaissance gold exploration in the Tapajos gold region of northern Brazil throughout much of 2004. We have applied for three concession areas totaling 11,641 hectares. These applications are currently pending with the Brazilian DNPM mining authority. Although we expect to receive approvals for our concessions during 2005, we can provide no assurance that the DNPM will approve our applications and grant the concessions and we have no capitalized costs related to the concession applications as of December 31, 2004. We have only conducted a limited amount of surface work consisting mainly of geochemical sampling and geologic reconnaissance on the subject concession applications. Upon the granting of the concession applications, we anticipate conducting a more detailed exploration program to define drill targets. We expect to continue our reconnaissance program to identify and acquire prospective new concession areas in the Tapajos region in 2005.
Mexico Concession Applications
We conducted grassroots reconnaissance gold, silver and base metal exploration in central and northern Mexico throughout much of 2004. As a result of these efforts, we identified several areas of interest for acquisition. We are currently in the process of receiving concession titles to two project areas totaling approximately 12,100 hectares, however, these titles have not yet been transferred. Although we expect to receive these title transfers during 2005, we can provide no assurance such transfers will occur and we have no capitalized costs related to these concessions as of December 31, 2004. We have only conducted a limited amount of surface work consisting mainly of geochemical sampling and geologic reconnaissance on these concessions. Upon the receipt of the concession titles, we anticipate conducting a more detailed exploration program to define drill targets. We expect to continue our reconnaissance program to identify and acquire prospective new concession areas in Mexico in 2005.
Discontinued Projects
During 2004 we abandoned the following projects:
La Pampa Gold Property, Peru
The La Pampa property consisted of four concessions, covering 3,400 hectares located in the Department of Lambayeque in west-central Peru. In July 2002, we signed an agreement with Bear Creek Mining Company ("Bear Creek") whereby Bear Creek could have earned 51% interest in the La Pampa property by expending $4.5 million on exploration of La Pampa over a five-year period. As part of the agreement, Bear Creek would have paid all costs to maintain the concessions complete a minimum of 1,000 meters of drilling on the property. In June 2004, Bear Creek paid Solitario $15,000 to terminate its joint venture interest in the La Pampa project. During the third quarter of 2004 Solitario dropped the La Pampa project and because it had no capitalized mineral interest, there was no related charge to mineral property write down. As of December 31, 2004, Solitario has no interest in the La Pampa project.
Sapalache Gold Project, Peru
The Sapalache gold project is located in the Department of Piura, Peru near the town of Huancabamba. The project consisted of two claims that were held by a third party on behalf of Solitario. During the third quarter of 2004, after failing to secure a joint venture, we dropped our claims at the Sapalache gold project located in the Department of Piura, Peru and recorded a mineral property write-down of $29,000. As of December 31, 2004 we have no interest in the Sapalache project.
San Pablo Gold Project, Bolivia
The San Pablo gold project was located in Potosi Department of southwestern Bolivia 32 kilometers east of the small town of Rio Mulatos. The property consisted of two concession blocks. One block of concessions covering 650 hectares was held under an Option to Purchase Agreement (the "San Pablo Option") from private Bolivian parties (the "Owners"). In February 2004, we signed an option agreement (the "San Pablo Agreement") to acquire a 100% interest, with no retained royalty, in the 700-hectare San Pablo gold project in southwestern Bolivia. The San Pablo Agreement called for us to make escalating payments to the underlying private Bolivian owners of the property totaling $1.0 million and spend $190,000 on exploration over a four-year period. The first six-month payment of $10,000 was made. After spending $15,000 during the first six-month period, we had the right to terminate the San Pablo Agreement at any time with no further obligations. In September 2004, after performing a limited project review consisting of geochemical sampling to confirm the presence of gold mineralization, we decided to terminate the San Pablo Agreement and recorded a $10,000 mineral property write down. As of December 31, 2004, Solitario has no interest in the San Pablo project.
CC Gold-Silver Project, Nevada, USA
In February 2004, we signed an option agreement (the "CC Agreement") to acquire a 100% interest in 88 unpatented claims totaling approximately 700-hectares on the Legacy Ridge project in west-central Nevada (U.S.). The CC Agreement called for us to make escalating payments to the underlying private owner of the project of $25,000 in the first year with a total of $2.0 million over a five-year period and spend $900,000 in exploration over four years, including $150,000 in the first year. We completed our initial $150,000 exploration commitment during the second quarter of 2004 by conducting a surface sampling program and drilling 14 reverse circulation drill holes totaling 1,203 meters. After reviewing the assay results of the drilling we elected to terminate our option to earn an interest in the project and recorded a $25,000 mineral property write-down during the third quarter of 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we have no interest in the Legacy Ridge project.
