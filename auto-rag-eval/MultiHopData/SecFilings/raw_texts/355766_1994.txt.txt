Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Second Quarter 1994 Compared to Second Quarter 1993
Revenues for the second quarter of 1994 decreased 1.0% to $64.0 million from $64.7 million in the second quarter of 1993 due to the sale of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants effective May 5, 1994. Revenue generated by the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants increased to $62.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 from $59.8 million in 1993 due to the net addition of six Company restaurants in the first six months of 1994 and 33 Company restaurants in 1993. Comparable store sales from the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants for the quarter ended July 1, 1994 declined by 4.5% from the comparable period of the prior year. Revenues from the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants were $1.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 1993.
Operating income decreased to $2.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 from $3.0 million in the second quarter of 1993. Included in operating income is a gain of $5.5 million related to the sale of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants and a $1.9 million loss associated with the valuation of fixed assets used in certain Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. The decline in operating income is primarily due to the decline in comparable store sales and operating margins in the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. A material portion of operating costs are fixed resulting in an erosion of operating margins at lower sales levels.
A summary of the results of operations of the Company as a percentage of revenues for the two quarters is shown below.
Revenues
Revenues from the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants increased by 4.6% to $62.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 from $59.8 million in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to new restaurant development which occurred throughout 1993 and the first six months of 1994. Comparable store sales of such restaurants which were open during all of the second quarters of both 1994 and 1993 declined by 4.5% between the two periods. Menu prices were not increased between the two periods.
Management believes that several factors may have contributed to the comparable store sales decline including increased competition and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of restaurants remodeled since 1992 and the impact of newly opened restaurants on comparable store sales of existing restaurants in certain markets. Some of the factors impacting comparable store sales are believed to be negatively impacting sales volumes of newer restaurants opened since 1990. During the second quarter of 1994, the average sales volume of the 70 new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants opened in 1991 through 1993 was 3.3% lower than the average sales volume of existing restaurants during the same period.
Revenues from the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants were $1.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 1993 due to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants on May 5, 1994.
Costs and Expenses
Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 96.0% in the second quarter of 1994 from 95.4% in the second quarter of 1993.
Cost of sales increased as a percentage of revenues to 51.8% in the second quarter of 1994 from 51.2% in the comparable period of 1993. Cost of food, beverage, prize and merchandise items for Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 18.5% in the second quarter of 1994 from 18.3% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to an increase in costs relating to the enhancement of certain prize and merchandise items. Labor expenses for Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to 30.3% during the second quarter of 1994 from 29.5% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to the decline in the comparable store sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 19.1% in the second quarter of 1994 from 16.2% in the comparable period of 1993 primarily due to increased advertising expense as a percentage of revenues. Corporate overhead costs were impacted by an increase of approximately $384,000 as a result of increasing the number of operational regional and district managers to provide a more concentrated focus on guest satisfaction.
Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 9.6% in the second quarter of 1994 from 8.9% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense of new restaurants relative to older restaurants and the decline in comparable store sales.
Other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to 21.0% in the second quarter of 1994 from 18.9% in the second quarter of 1993 primarily due to increased rent and utility costs as a percentage of revenues and the decline in comparable store sales.
The Company had a net gain on property transactions of $3.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to a loss on property transactions of $114,000 in the second quarter of 1993. In the second quarter of 1994, the Company recognized a gain of $5.5 million from the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants on May 5, 1994. The gain was partially offset by a loss of approximately $1.9 million in the second quarter of 1994. The loss was a result of the Company's decision to close one Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant and the decline in fair value of the fixed assets of eight Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants due to the Company's decision not to renew the leases as a result of the deterioration of site characteristics. The Company will consider possible relocation of some of the restaurants. The Company provided for an additional loss on property transactions of approximately $100,000 in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $114,000 in the second quarter of 1993 due to the replacement of certain assets in conjunction with the enhancement of facilities and entertainment packages of restaurants.
Operating Income
As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above, the Company had operating income of $2.5 million in the second quarter of 1994 compared to $3.0 million in the second quarter of 1993. Included in operating income are the operations of Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants through May 5, 1994. Operating income in the second quarter of 1994 for Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants was $5.6 million, including a gain on property transactions of $5.5 million, compared to operating income of $260,000 in the second quarter of 1993.
Net Income
Interest expense increased to $430,000 in the second quarter of 1994 from $169,000 in the second quarter of 1993 due primarily to an increase in long-term debt of $24 million since the second quarter of 1993 primarily to fund the Company's repurchase of its common stock. The Company's net income decreased to $1.2 million in the second quarter of 1994 from $1.8 million in the second quarter of 1993 due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above. The Company's primary and fully diluted earnings per share decreased to $.10 per share in the second quarter of 1994 from $.13 per share in the second quarter of 1993.
First Six Months of 1994 Compared to First Six Months of 1993
Revenues increased 1.7% to $140.4 million in the first six months of 1994 from $138.1 million in the comparable period of 1993. Revenue generated by the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants increased by 4.4% to $134.2 million in the first six months of 1994 from $128.5 million in the first six months of 1993 due to the net addition of six Company restaurants in the first six months of 1994 and 33 Company restaurants in 1993. Comparable store sales from the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants declined 7.0% between the periods. Revenues from the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants declined to $6.2 million in the first six months of 1994 from $9.6 million in the first six months of 1993 due to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants on May 5, 1994.
Operating income decreased to $8.3 million in the first six months of 1994 from $13.8 million in the first six months of 1993. Included in operating income is a gain of $5.5 million related to the sale of the Company's Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants and a $1.9 million loss associated with the valuation of fixed assets used in certain Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. The decline in operating income is primarily due to the decline in comparable store sales and operating margins in the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. A material portion of operating costs are fixed resulting in an erosion of operating margins at lower sales levels.
A summary of the results of operations of the Company as a percentage of revenues for the six month periods is shown below.
Revenues
Revenues from the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants increased by 4.4% to $134.2 million in the first six months of 1994 from $128.5 million in the first six months of 1993 primarily due to new restaurant development which occurred throughout 1993 and the first six months of 1994. Comparable store sales of such restaurants which were open during all of the first six months of both 1994 and 1993 declined by 7.0% between the two periods. Menu prices were increased approximately .2% between the two periods.
Management believes that several factors may have contributed to the comparable store sales decline including increased competition and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of restaurants remodeled since 1992; the impact of newly opened restaurants on comparable store sales of existing restaurants in certain markets; and an ineffective advertising campaign that was replaced with a new advertising campaign effective February 1994. Some of the factors impacting comparable store sales are believed to be negatively impacting sales volumes of newer restaurants opened since 1990. During the first six months of 1994, the average sales volume of the 70 new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants opened in 1991 through 1993 was 1.3% lower than the average sales volume of existing restaurants during the same period.

Operating Income
As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above, operating income declined to $8.3 million in the first six months of 1994 from $13.8 million in the first six months of 1993. Included in operating income are the operations of Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants through May 5, 1994. Operating income in the first six months of 1994 for Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe restaurants was $5.9 million, including a gain on property transactions of 5.5 million, compared to $485,000 in the first six months of 1993.
Net Income
Interest expense increased to $792,000 in the first six months of 1994 from $348,000 in the first six months of 1993 due primarily to an increase in long-term debt of $24 million since the second quarter of 1993 primarily to fund the Company's repurchase of its common stock. The Company's net income decreased to $4.7 million in the first six months of 1994 from $8.4 million in the first six months of 1993 due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above. The Company's primary and fully diluted earnings per share decreased to $.37 per share in the first six months of 1994 from $.60 per share in the first six months of 1993.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash provided by operations decreased to $18.3 million in the first six months of 1994 from $26.1 million in the comparable period of 1993. The Company's primary requirements for cash relate to planned capital expenditures and debt service.
During the first six months of 1994, the Company made approximately $15.4 million in capital expenditures related to the opening of seven new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants and the enhancement of facilities and entertainment packages of ten restaurants. The Company plans to make additional capital expenditures of approximately $14 million during the remainder of 1994 primarily related to the construction of approximately six new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants and the enhancement of existing facility and entertainment packages at a total of 30 Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. In the event certain site characteristics considered essential for the success of a restaurant deteriorate, the Company will consider relocating the restaurant to a more desirable site or closing the restaurant.
The Company previously announced that it planned to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock at an aggregate purchase price of up to $30 million. As of July 1, 1994, the Company had repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24.8 million. The Company has purchased treasury shares up to the limit permitted under its revolving loan agreement and intends to use its future cash flow for new store development and the enhancement of existing facility and entertainment packages. The Company expects that it will satisfy its capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash provided by operations and funds available under its revolving loan agreement.
The Company's revolving loan agreement was amended effective July 1994 to provide the Company with a credit line of up to $32 million which declines by $100,000 each month beginning on January 31, 1995 and is due on January 31, 1996. Available borrowings under the credit line are reduced by outstanding letters of credit which totaled $1.5 million at July 1, 1994. The revolving loan agreement previously provided for borrowings up to $50 million through 1997. The interest rate payable under the revised loan agreement was increased by 50 basis points over prior levels. The Company is required to comply with certain financial ratio tests during the term of the revolving loan agreement.
The Company believes that the success of its facility and entertainment enhancement program in addition to new restaurant development will continue to be significant factors in its ability to generate increased revenues over the foreseeable future. The Company plans to open approximately 25 new Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants in 1994 and 1995, with approximately 13 of such restaurants to be opened in 1994. If the decline in comparable store sales of the Company's Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants experienced in 1993 and the first six months of 1994 continue to be experienced over the longer term, an adverse impact on the Company's operating margins and results of operations could continue.
The Company is implementing several strategies designed to strengthen the sales vitality of its existing unit base in what management believes will become an increasingly competitive market. The Company has appointed a new advertising agency; accelerated its commitment of capital to existing stores; increased the number of its operational regional and district managers to provide a more concentrated focus on guest satisfaction; and is limiting its 1994 new unit development to approximately 13 new stores in order to ensure that new unit growth and the sales vitality of the Company's existing unit base are both given equal priority. The Company believes that certain operating costs will increase as a result of implementing these strategies designed to strengthen existing unit sales.
The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits. The Company presently believes that it will continue to incur expense to defend against and resolve such litigation, and anticipates that it will satisfy such expense with cash flow from operations.
The Company believes it will realize substantial benefit from utilization of approximately $73 million in net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its federal income tax liability. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire from years 1999 through 2002. Although the use of such carryforwards could, under certain circumstances, be limited, the Company is presently unaware of the occurrence of any event which would result in the imposition of such limitation. The Company has adopted an amendment to its Restated Articles of Incorporation which is intended to prevent changes in ownership of its common stock that would cause such limitation. In addition, the Company has investment tax credit, job tax credit and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $7 million expiring from years 1997 through 2008. Tax credit carryforwards can be utilized by the Company only after all net operating loss carryforwards have been realized. If the Company's results of operations continue to decline, a portion of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire prior to utilization resulting in a charge against income.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
In December 1991, the Company, The Hallwood Group Incorporated ("Hallwood"), Integra-A Hotel and Restaurant Company ("Integra"), and their individual directors were named defendants in two separate but related lawsuits brought in the 14th and 134th District Courts of Dallas County, Texas. In April 1993, the Company and its two directors who are also employees of the Company, were dismissed as defendants in the lawsuit brought in the 134th District Court by an Integra common stockholder. Integra owned approximately 90% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company prior to Integra's distribution of such Common Stock in December 1988 (the "1988 Distribution") to its shareholders of record. The plaintiffs in the remaining lawsuit constitute certain holders of warrants, options and preferred stock of Integra who seek to serve as representatives of proposed classes of other holders of such securities. The plaintiffs allege that the Company has (i) violated Texas statutes related to securities fraud and the fraudulent transfer of assets, (ii) committed common law fraud, and (iii) breached fiduciary and other duties to the plaintiffs. As amended, this suit seeks rescission of the 1988 Distribution, actual damages in excess of $184 million, and punitive damages in excess of $500 million. In May 1993, further action in this case was abated by order of the Court pending the resolution of disciplinary proceedings in process against the plaintiffs' counsel in a separate court action in Dallas County, Texas. The Company believes that the claims made against it in this suit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against such claims.
In July 1992, Integra sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court ("Bankruptcy Court") in Denver, Colorado (the "Integra Bankruptcy"). Integra, its Bankruptcy Court-appointed Unsecured Creditors Committee, Hallwood and other parties including certain of the Company's officers and directors and the individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit discussed above, are parties to either one or both Settlement Agreements (the "Settlement Agreements") in conjunction with a modified plan of reorganization of Integra approved by the Bankruptcy Court in February 1994. One of the Settlement Agreements provides for the creation of a trust to which certain claims of Integra are to be transferred. The trust will retain the right to investigate, compromise or adjudicate the claims transferred from Integra against defendants other than the parties released under the Settlement Agreements. The Company and many of its shareholders are not parties to the Settlement Agreements.
In April 1993, the Company, Hallwood and certain directors of the Company individually were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in the 68th District Court of Dallas County, Texas, by Hermitage Hotel, Ltd., L.P. claiming to be an unsecured creditor of Integra and seeking to serve as a representative of a class of all unsecured creditors of Integra. In November 1993, the Court entered an order closing the lawsuit in light of the pending Integra bankruptcy. In May 1994, Hermitage Hotel, Ltd., L.P. filed a new lawsuit against the same defendants in the 101st District Court of Dallas County, Texas. No longer filed as a class action, the new lawsuit seeks recovery on behalf of plaintiff under theories of successor liability, tortious interference with contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. The plaintiff is seeking approximately $10.2 million in actual damages, $30 million in exemplary damages, attorneys fees and court costs. The Company believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit.
In June 1993, the Company was named as a nominal defendant in a shareholders' derivative action in the 68th Judicial District Court in Dallas County, Texas in which three of the Company's executive officers, four of the Company's outside directors and Hallwood were named defendants. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit have alleged the individual defendants (i) breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders, (ii) committed constructive fraud and (iii) unjustly enriched themselves as a result of alleged violations of federal securities laws and illegal insider trading between July 13, 1992 and June 11, 1993. The Company does not believe that this action will result in any significant damages to the Company.
In July, 1993, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit brought in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Nashville, Tennessee by Third National Bank in Nashville, as Trustee pursuant to a municipal bond issuance of $6.4 million made in 1980, for which Integra executed a guaranty. The plaintiff alleged that Integra's guaranty of the municipal bond issuance was binding on successors of Integra and that the Company is the legal successor to Integra. The plaintiff sought to recover a judgment against the Company in the full amount of its claim against Integra, which is unspecified, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. In April 1994, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal. The Company believes the allegations made in this suit to be without merit and will offer a vigorous defense in this lawsuit.
In January 1994, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Queens, by Big Six Towers, Inc., in its purported capacity as a landlord to the Company with regard to a restaurant/entertainment center location in Queens County, New York which the Company had contracted to lease from the plaintiff. The plaintiff has alleged that the Company has breached the lease and is seeking total damages in excess of $4.0 million against the Company. The Company believes it validly terminated the lease in question pursuant to an agreement with the plaintiff and believes the allegations made in this suit to be without merit and therefore intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit.
Certain other pending legal proceedings exist against the Company which the Company believes are not material in amount or have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
