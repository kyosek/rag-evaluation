ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company's real estate portfolio consists exclusively of apartment communities and land held for the development of apartment communities located in California, Washington and Oregon. For purposes of this discussion, the portfolio consists of the following categories:
-- Original Communities: Those communities owned directly or indirectly by the Company or certain investors prior to the Initial Offering.
-- 1994 Acquisition Communities: Those communities acquired during 1994.
-- 1995 Acquisition Communities: Those communities acquired during 1995.
-- 1995 Development Communities: Carriage Square and Canyon Creek, which were completed, leased up and stabilized in 1995.
-- 1996 Acquisition Communities: Those communities acquired during 1996.
-- 1996 Development Community: Rosewalk, which was completed in January 1997 and leased up and stabilized in February 1997.
-- 1997 Acquisition Communities: Those communities acquired during 1997.
-- 1998 Acquisition Communities: Warner Oaks, Amberway, Arbor Park, Laguna Brisas and Cabrillo Square.
-- Current Development Communities: Toscana, CentreMark, Paseo Alameda, Bay Towers (formerly San Francisco, CA Land Site), Mountain View, CA Land Site and Rosewalk II.
The specific communities included in these categories are detailed beginning on page 7.
As of December 31, 1997 the Company owned substantially all of the ownership interests in 54 communities comprised of 15,297 upscale apartment homes in California, Washington and Oregon. For those communities developed by the Company, stabilized occupancy typically has occurred between six and nine months after completion of construction, depending on the size of the community. Stabilized occupancy is defined as the first calendar month following completion of construction in which the community has a physical occupancy of at least 95%. The 1996 Development Community, Rosewalk, stabilized within one month after completion of construction. The Company's portfolio has operated at an average occupancy of more than 95% after operations stabilized.
The communities generally are located in high visibility areas in close proximity to major transportation arteries, mass transit lines, commercial districts, shopping or other services. The Company attempts to develop or acquire apartment communities in high visibility locations that not only provide many conveniences for residents, but also encourage greater walk-in traffic and consequently improve leasing opportunities and allow the Company to operate with reduced marketing costs.
The communities generally contain contemporary two and three-story buildings in extensively landscaped settings with lush gardens, fountains or waterscapes. The objectives of the site layout and building design are to provide residents with convenient indoor or covered parking, ample private storage areas and a comfortable living environment. Most of the communities feature solar-heated swimming pools, hydro-jet spas, high-tech fitness facilities, and expansive community areas. The apartment homes typically offer spacious, open living areas with an abundance of natural light, and many of the following amenities: ceiling fans, vaulted ceilings, patios or balconies, fireplaces, designer coordinated kitchens often with built-in buffets, wine racks, microwaves, disposals and dishwashers. In many cases the Company makes certain other services available to residents such as aerobics classes, dry cleaning pick up and delivery, and mail drops and package acceptance.
In addition to the physical advantages of the communities, the Company has highly-trained professional on-site management and maintenance staffs that provide courteous and responsive service to the residents of each community. Management believes that excellent design and intensive, service oriented property management that is focused on the specific needs of residents creates a very desirable living environment for residents. This combination of features allows the Company to achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses and maximizing current and long-term cash flow and the value of the communities.
The communities were designed to control costs both during construction and operation and to provide maximum long-term investment value and resident appeal. In connection with the preparation of the design and plans for each community and the apartment homes therein, the Company's employees have regular meetings with all of the major trade contractors associated with the project to ensure that the communities are well-planned and construction is well-coordinated, thereby minimizing the possibility for construction cost overruns.
The Company includes many long-term durable features in the design of communities that it constructs to maximize the useful life of the communities. For example, on newly constructed communities, the Company used concrete tile roofs, cast iron drains, waste and vent pipes, copper water pipes, extra deep base rock and asphalt lifts. In addition, extensive measures are employed to minimize noise between apartment homes. The Company uses condominium standards for this purpose, including the use of double walls and double insulation between apartment homes, lightweight concrete on floors and insulation between ceilings and floors. The Company, whenever possible, locates closets, bathrooms, and laundries in locations which minimize sound transmission.
The Company improves and repositions their acquired communities, as appropriate, in an effort to enhance returns and upgrade each community's competitive position in its respective submarket. At the end of 1997, the Company had committed to undertake or completed capital improvements totaling $175.6 million for 37 communities acquired since the Initial Offering. The Company's repositioning activities vary from community to community and include reconstruction and renovation of leasing pavilions, pool areas, fitness facilities, parking structures, landscaping, major plumbing, electrical, roofing and siding repairs.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company's communities:
- --------------- (1) Excludes washer/dryer rental fees, covered parking fees, credit check and application fees and other similar charges.
(2) The Foxchase community includes 252 apartment homes constructed in 1986 as Phase I and 144 apartment homes constructed in 1987 as Phase II.
(3) The Company owns this community through a partnership, and, as general partner, receives 94% of the distributions of cash from operations and proceeds from any sale, refinancing or disposition made by the partnership. An unrelated third party owns the remaining 6% interest in the partnership as a limited partner.
(4) Reconstruction was completed in 1997.
(5) Reconstruction is ongoing or planned as of December 31, 1997.
(6) As part of the purchase price for the CountryBrook community acquired in July 1996, the Company issued to the seller 298,577 operating partnership units (with a value of approximately $7.3 million) of a special purpose limited partnership, Bay Countrybrook L.P., formed by the Company. The operating partnership unitholders may request that they be redeemed for cash, subject to the Company's right to satisfy any redemption request by issuing an equivalent number of shares of common stock. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had issued 166,142 shares of common stock to limited partners of Bay Countrybrook L.P. who had requested a redemption of their partnership units. Countrybrook units redeemed for cash aggregated 762 as of December 31, 1997.
(7) As part of the purchase price for the Gallery Place community acquired in September 1997, the Company issued to the seller 163,448 operating partnership units (with a value of approximately $6.2 million) of a special purpose limited partnership, Bay Pacific Northwest, L.P., formed by the Company. The operating partnership unitholders may request that they be redeemed for cash, subject to the Company's right to satisfy any redemption request by issuing an equivalent number of shares of common stock. As of December 31, 1997, no operating partnership units had been redeemed.
(8) As of December 31, 1997, 276 of the total 710 apartment homes at the Toscana community had been completed.
(9) Represents the additional 72 apartment homes completed during January 1998 and 72 apartment homes completed in March 1998 at the Toscana community.
(10) The Company acquired this land site through a special purpose limited partnership, Bay Rincon, L.P., in which it is the sole general partner.
Acquisitions entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that judgments with respect to the costs of improvements to bring an acquired community up to standards established for the market position intended for that community will prove inaccurate, as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment. Although the Company undertakes an evaluation of the physical condition of each new community before it is acquired, certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after the community is acquired, which could significantly increase the Company's total acquisition costs.
As described below, construction costs are increasing and the cost to reposition communities that have been acquired has, in some cases, exceeded management's original estimates. Management believes that it may experience similar increases in the future. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to charge rents upon completing the repositioning of the communities that will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increases in construction costs.
CURRENT DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES
This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, the risk factors set forth herein and in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, changes in general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements.
The Company has acquired six land sites on which it is building, or plans to commence building in the future, the Current Development Communities with a total of approximately 1,908 apartment homes.
- TOSCANA, SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA. The Company purchased this partially built and abandoned 17.8 acre site in May 1996 on which it is building a 710 apartment home community. The original total budgeted construction cost of this community was $95.7 million. The site, located approximately at the intersection of Highway 101 and Lawrence Expressway, is close to the center of Silicon Valley. This community will contain a large leasing pavilion, business center, fitness center, two swimming pools, including one 75 foot lap pool, a small commercial area, secure underground parking and a perimeter gate system. Stabilized operations are expected in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first apartment homes were completed and occupied in July 1997. As of December 31, 1997, construction had been completed on 276 apartment homes.
- CENTREMARK, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. The Company purchased 2.5 acres of this 7.9 acre site in May 1996. The remainder of this site was purchased in December 1996 after obtaining substantially all of the necessary public approvals for development of the community. The site is located at the intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Interstate 280, in the northwest corner of San Jose, almost immediately adjacent to the City of Cupertino. The planned 311 apartment home community will include a large leasing facility, business center, fitness center, 65 foot lap pool, secure underground parking and perimeter gate system. The Company has estimated a total budgeted construction cost for this community of $44.1 million. Stabilized operations are expected in the first quarter of 1999 and the first apartment homes are expected to be occupied in the third quarter of 1998.
- PASEO ALAMEDA, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. The Company purchased 7.44 acres of this 8.87 acre site in February 1997 after it obtained substantially all of the necessary public approvals for development of the community. The remainder of this site was purchased in April 1997. The site is located on a major street, approximately one mile from downtown San Jose. The Company has approvals to build a 305 apartment home community which will include a large leasing pavilion, business center, fitness center, 75 foot lap pool, a small commercial area and secure underground parking. The Company has estimated a total budgeted construction cost for this community of $44.4 million. Stabilized operations are expected in the second quarter of 1999 and the first apartment homes are expected to be occupied in the fourth quarter of 1998.
- BAY TOWERS, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. The Company acquired, through a limited partnership in which it is the sole general partner, a portion of a city block in the Rincon Hill area of San Francisco for approximately $7.8 million in June 1997. The Company is constructing twin, 16-story towers above a four story parking garage on this land site. All public approvals have been received to allow 226 apartment homes, approximately 2,900 square feet of retail space and between 224 and 271 controlled access parking spaces. The land site is on Beale Street, between Harrison and Folsom Streets, almost two blocks north of the Bay Bridge, approximately three blocks south of Market Street and three blocks west of the Embarcadero and San Francisco Bay. The Company began site work in late 1997 and actual construction of the community in early 1998, with initial occupancy expected in 1999. The community will contain one, two and three bedroom apartment homes, with resident amenities including a health club, meeting and conference rooms, business center, leasing pavillion and parking deck gardens.
- ROSEWALK II, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. In October 1997, the Company acquired a 5.82 acre land site adjacent to the Company's recently constructed 300 apartment home community, Rosewalk, in San Jose, California. The Company has public approvals and is under construction on 156 apartment homes as a second phase of Rosewalk on this land site. The Company has estimated a total budgeted construction cost for this community of $20.3 million. Stabilized operations are expected in the second quarter of 1999 and the first apartment homes are expected to be occupied in the fourth quarter of 1998.
- MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA LAND SITE. In September 1997, the Company acquired a 1.917 acre land site in Mountain View, California which includes a 50% undivided interest in an existing underground parking garage adjacent to this land site, subject to agreements which specifically allocate parking rights between an adjacent office building and this development, including 266 spaces reserved exclusively for residents of the community planned for this site. The Company intends to build two residential towers on this land site, which will contain an as yet undetermined number of apartment homes, expected to be at least 200, and approximately 10,000 square feet of ground level space for a recreation, leasing and community center. The acquisition of this site, purchased in two separate parcels for approximately $8.93 million, includes various public approvals and previously paid fees totaling approximately $800,000.
The Company intends to continue to pursue the development and construction of apartment home communities in accordance with the Company's development and underwriting policies. Risks associated with the Company's development and construction activities may include: the abandonment of development and acquisition opportunities explored by the Company; construction costs of a community may exceed original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other expenses, which could make completion of the community uneconomical; occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed community are dependent on a number of factors, including market and general economic conditions, and may not be sufficient to make the community profitable; financing may not be available on favorable terms for the development of a community; and construction and lease-up may not be completed on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs. Development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations. The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve its projected yields on communities under development or reconstruction and could prevent the Company from paying distributions to its stockholders.
For new development communities, the Company's goal, on average, is to achieve projected earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") as a percentage of total budgeted construction cost of approximately 10%. Projected EBITDA as a percentage of total budgeted construction cost represents EBITDA projected to be received in the first calendar year after a community reaches stabilized occupancy (i.e., the first month when the community has a weighted average physical occupancy of at least 95%), based on current market rents, less projected stabilized property operating and maintenance expenses, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Total budgeted construction cost is based on current construction costs, including interest capitalized during the construction period. Market rents and construction costs reflect those prevailing in the community's market at the time the Company's development budgets are prepared while taking into consideration certain changes to those market conditions anticipated by the Company at the time. Although the Company attempts to anticipate changes in market
conditions, the Company cannot predict with certainty what those changes will be. For example, upon the acquisition of the Toscana land site in May 1996, the Company estimated that the total budgeted construction cost for this Current Development Community would be $95.7 million. Since that time, construction costs have been increasing and management believes that the total construction cost for this development will be higher than the original budget. Nonetheless, because of increases in prevailing market rents, management believes that it will still be able to achieve projected EBITDA as a percentage of total budgeted construction cost of at least 10%. Management believes that it will experience similar increases in construction costs and market rents with respect to the CentreMark and Paseo Alameda Current Development Communities. However, there can be no assurances that market rents in effect at the time the Current Development Communities are leased-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction costs.
SEISMIC CONCERNS
Many of the communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. In June 1997, the Company obtained a seismic risk analysis from an engineering firm which estimated the probable maximum loss ("PML") for each of the 41 communities owned at that time and Toscana, a Current Development Community, individually and for all of such communities and Toscana combined. To establish a PML, the engineers first define a severe earthquake event for the applicable geographic area, which is an earthquake that has only a 10% likelihood of occurring over a 50-year period. The PML is determined as the structural and architectural damage and business interruption loss that has a 10% probability of being exceeded in the event of such an earthquake. Because the communities are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, the engineers' analysis defined an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault with a Richter Scale magnitude of 8.0 as a severe earthquake with a 10% probability of occurring within a 50-year period. The engineers then established an aggregate PML at that time of $63.8 million for the 41 communities owned at that time and Toscana. The $63.8 million PML for those communities was a PML level that is expected to be exceeded only 10% of the time in the event of such a severe earthquake. The actual aggregate PML could be higher or lower as a result of variations in soil classifications and structural vulnerabilities. For each community, the engineers' analysis calculated an individual PML as a percentage of the community's replacement cost and projected revenues. Two of the communities had individual PMLs of 30%, while seven had individual PMLs of 25%, and the remaining 32 communities owned at such time and Toscana each had individual PMLs of 20% or less. The Company has obtained an individual PML assessment for each of the seventeen communities acquired since June 1997. One community had an individual PML of 50%, one had an individual PML of 30%, three had individual PMLs of 24%, one had an individual PML of 21% and the remaining eleven communities had individual PMLs of 20% or less. While the Company has not yet obtained an engineers' analysis establishing an aggregate PML for all of the communities combined, the Company currently intends to do so on an annual basis in order to assist it in evaluating appropriate levels of insurance coverage. No assurance can be given that an earthquake would not cause damage or loss greater than the PML assessments indicate, that future PML levels will not be higher than the current PML levels for the communities, or that future acquisitions or developments will not have PML assessments indicating the possibility of greater damage or loss than currently indicated.
In July 1997, the Company renewed its earthquake insurance, both for physical damage and lost revenue, with respect to the 41 communities then owned and Toscana. In addition, the seventeen communities acquired subsequent to June 1997 are included under the Company's earthquake insurance policy. For any single occurrence, the Company self-insures the first $25 million of loss and has in place $35 million of coverage above this amount. In addition, the Company's general liability and property casualty insurance provides coverage for personal liability and fire damage. In the event that an uninsured disaster or a loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, the Company could lose its capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from such community, and would continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the business of the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
The apartment communities owned by the Company and any newly acquired apartment communities must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the Company's properties where such removal is readily achievable. The ADA does not, however, consider residential properties, such as apartment communities, to be public accommodations or commercial facilities, except to the extent portions of such facilities, such as leasing offices, are open to the public. The Company believes that its properties comply in all material respects with all present requirements under the ADA and applicable state laws. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
