Refinancing of Bonds Payable
As of September 30, 1997, the Partnership, with the assistance of Tri-Stone Mortgage Company, an affiliate of the General Partner, closed three new fixed rate first mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans") from Westco Real Estate Finance Corp. (the "Lender") in the amounts of $2,865,000, $8,445,000 and $5,400,000, respectively. Tri-Stone Mortgage Company did not receive any compensation for its services. All three Mortgage Loans are secured by first mortgages on all three of the Properties. Prior to September 30, 1997, the Properties were encumbered by mortgages granted by the Partnership to United States Trust Company of New York, as trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Partnership's Escalating Rate Collateralized Mortgage Bonds due November 30, 1997 (the "Bonds"). The Partnership used the proceeds of the Mortgage Loans and available cash to redeem all of the outstanding Bonds. An aggregate of $17,015,650 was paid to the holders of the Bonds in connection with such redemption, of which $16,452,000 was applied to prepay the principal of the Bonds and $563,650 was applied to pay interest accrued on the Bonds through the redemption date.
The Mortgage Loans and related terms at December 31, 1997 for the Properties are summarized as follows:
Principal Monthly Balance at Payments of December Interest Principal Property/Location 31, 1997 Rate % and Interest - ----------------- -------------- ------ ------------
Searcy, AR $2,861,153 8.125 $21,640 Valencia, CA 8,429,458 8.125 65,881 Green Valley, AZ 5,392,963 8.250 41,252 --------- ------ Total $16,683,574 $128,773 ========== =======
The Mortgage Loans require payments of principal and interest through and including September 1, 2007. On October 1, 2007, the balance of principal and interest is estimated to be $2,505,981, $7,003,227, and $4,738,096 for the Searcy, Valencia and Green Valley Properties, respectively, and will be due and payable. Subsequent to October 31, 2003 and prior to May 31, 2007, each Mortgage Loan may be prepaid in whole but not in part on any payment date with a prepayment penalty equal to the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding principal balance at such time, or (ii) the excess, if any, of the present value of the remaining scheduled principal and interest payments (including any balloon payment), discounted at the Discount Rate (as defined below), over the amount of principal being prepaid. The Mortgage Loans may be prepaid without penalty on any payment date after May 31, 2007. The Discount Rate is a rate determined as of the week ending prior to the prepayment date and is based on the published rates of U.S. Government securities having maturities approximating the maturity date of the Mortgage Loans. The Mortgage Loans are each secured by first mortgages on all three of the Partnership's Properties and a default under any of the Mortgage Loans constitutes a default on all of the Mortgage Loans. Each mortgage may be released at the Partnership's option after the corresponding Mortgage Loan is fully paid provided that no event of default exists under any of the Mortgage Loans, the mortgagee has not given the Partnership notice of any event which, with the passage of time, would constitute an event of default, and certain other conditions are satisfied.
In connection with the Green Valley Mortgage Loan, the Partnership has deposited $150,000 into an escrow account (the "Green Valley Escrow Account") with the Lender. The funds held in the Green Valley Escrow Account may be released upon the execution of a new lease or renewal lease, with a termination date of July 31, 2004 or later, by Abco, a tenant of the Green Valley Property and the satisfaction of certain other conditions.
In connection with the Valencia Mortgage Loan, the Partnership deposited $45,000 into an escrow account (the "Valencia Escrow Account") with the Lender. Such amount was released to the Partnership during February 1998 after a certain environmental condition existing at the Property was shown to require no further action to the satisfaction of the State of California Environmental Protection Agency Department of Toxic Substances Contract ("DOTSC"). The cost of the various tests, studies, legal representation and negotiations with the DOTSC relating to the resolution of this environmental problem was approximately $71,000, all of which was accrued and expensed during 1997.
CM Plus Corporation, the general partner of the Partnership, guarantees certain limited recourse obligations under the Mortgage Loans.

Penney. On November 5, 1996, the lease was amended, to allow for J.C. Penney's expansion. Pursuant to the amendment, the expanded store opened for business on September 1, 1997, thereby changing the expiration date to 10 years from the expanded store opening date (August 31, 2007). The expansion includes 12,902 square feet of additional land, which includes 5,600 square feet of pad space previously occupied by smaller tenants. In 1997, J.C. Penney built on the 7,302 square feet of unoccupied land. The additional annual base rent due to the expansion was $40,000 and, as of January 1, 1997, the annual minimum base rent increased to $205,600 ($5.21 per square foot). The lease provides for annual percentage rent equal to 1.5% of the tenant's gross receipts in excess of $11,820,004. The total rent received from J.C. Penney in 1997 was $205,600. In addition, J.C. Penney is required to reimburse the Partnership (as an offset against percentage rent) a pro rata share of any increases in real estate taxes over the highest tax paid by the Partnership during any of the first three years of operation. J.C. Penney is also required to reimburse the Partnership for common area maintenance expenses in annual amounts per square foot of tenant space as follows: $.20 for years 1-5, $.25 for years 6-10, $.30 for years 11-15, $.35 for years 16-20 and $.50 during the option periods.

J.C. Penney has the right to discontinue use of the premises as a J.C. Penney retail store business, or sublet or assign the premises, at any time. This right is subject to certain notice requirements and the Partnership's option to cancel the lease. As long as the lease remains in effect after 30 days of discontinued use, J.C. Penney must pay, in addition to the annual minimum rent, additional rent equal to the average of the amounts paid as percentage rent for each lease year during the period between the commencement of the lease and the time when it discontinues use of the premises.
Stage has given notice of its intention to discontinue its operations effective April 30, 1998. Stage will still be responsible for the basic minimum rental and the average of the amounts actually received each lease year under the provisions for contingent additional rentals including real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. The annual minimum rent is $81,900 ($5.25 per square foot). The total rent received from Stage in 1997 was $81,900.
