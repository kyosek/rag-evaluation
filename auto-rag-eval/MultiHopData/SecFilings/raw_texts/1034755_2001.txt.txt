ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
PRIMARY EXPLORATION PROVINCES
Brigham focuses its 3-D seismic exploration efforts in oil and natural gas producing provinces where it believes 3-D technology may be effectively applied to discover relatively large potential reserve volumes (on both a per well basis and per field basis) with high potential production rates and multiple producing objectives. Brigham's exploration activities are concentrated primarily in three core provinces: the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; the onshore Texas Gulf Coast; and West Texas.
Since inception in 1990 through 2001, Brigham has drilled 420 exploratory and 110 development wells on its 3-D generated prospects with an aggregate completion rate of 67% and an average working interest of 30%. During this period, Brigham has added an estimated 191 Bcfe of net proved reserves, 168 net Bcfe of which were discovered by Brigham through its systematic 3-D exploration drilling activities at an average drilling finding cost of $0.79 per Mcfe.
Brigham was a pioneer in 3-D exploration in domestic onshore provinces. From 1990 to 1996 Brigham acquired approximately 2,760 square miles of 3-D seismic data in over 28 different geologic plays, seven basins and seven states, and in the process identified the geologic objectives that it believed would provide optimal 3-D drilling economics.
During 1997 and 1998, Brigham aggressively capitalized on its 3-D exploration experience by accumulating a multi-year inventory of 3-D delineated drilling locations in the plays that it believed were most likely to provide attractive 3-D delineated drilling economics. During this period, Brigham acquired an additional 2,475 square miles of 3-D seismic data and retained a substantially higher than historical project working interests of 73%. These acquisitions were the largest in Brigham's history and nearly doubled Brigham's inventory of onshore 3-D seismic data, as compared to year-end 1996, to 5,235 square miles. With these significant investments, Brigham believes it has assembled a superior knowledge base and the premier seismic and leasehold position in each of its current focus plays. Brigham further believes it has captured a high quality, multi-year inventory of 3-D delineated potential drilling locations and the quality and depth of this inventory is evidenced by its recent drilling results.
Beginning in 1999, Brigham began to focus the majority of its capital expenditures on drilling in its 3-D delineated prospect inventory in the five plays where it has assembled a superior knowledge base and an optimal seismic and leasehold position. As a result of this focus, for the three-year period ending December 31, 2001, Brigham achieved an average drilling finding cost and all-sources finding cost of $0.74 and $1.00 per Mcfe, respectively. Also, during this same three-year period Brigham's production volumes grew by 44% to average 26.6 MMcfe per day in 2001, while EBITDA grew by 244% to $22.7 million in 2001.
Brigham's exploration success achieved through the drilling of its 3-D delineated prospect inventory has resulted in four substantial field discoveries since 1999 and has added a substantial number of developmental locations to Brigham's large inventory of 3-D delineated exploration prospects. As a result, the Company's annual drilling investments have evolved from pure 3-D delineated exploration to a blended exploration and development portfolio. For example, while Brigham's drilling capital expenditures in 1999 were almost 100% exploration, capital expenditures in 2001 were approximately 50% developmental. Growth in the proportion of the drilling expenditures allocated to development drilling should continue in 2002, particularly given the discovery of the Triple Crown Field and the Providence Field in 2001. Although these new field discoveries did not materially impact production volumes and cash flow in 2001, management believes they will have a material impact on production volumes in 2002.
Continuing its strategic focus implemented during 1999, Brigham intends to direct substantially all of its efforts and available capital resources in 2002 to the drilling and monetization of the prospective
drilling locations within its over 6,600 square mile inventory of 3-D seismic data. Brigham's planned 2002 capital budget is estimated to be approximately $23.7 million. The spending will be funded out of Brigham's discretionary cash flow and availability under its Subordinated Notes Facility. Depressed commodity prices have led to a budgeted decrease in capital spending of $12.3 million (34%) for 2002 when compared to 2001. Brigham's budget is based upon anticipated commodity prices and is subject to change if market conditions shift.
For 2002, Brigham plans to spend approximately 80% of its $17.9 million exploration and development budget to drill 26 planned wells with an average working interest of 32%. Brigham's planned 2002 drilling program represents a blend of capital investments consisting of both, development projects to recent discoveries and high potential exploration prospects. Approximately 80% of budgeted drilling expenditures are allocated to development activities with the remaining 20% targeted for exploratory drilling. In addition, over 90% of Brigham's budgeted drilling expenditures are focused in the Company's five focus plays, which include the Frio and Vicksburg trends in the Texas Gulf Coast, the Springer and Hunton trends in the Anadarko Basin, and the Horseshoe Atoll trend in West Texas. In these focus plays Brigham has completed 25 wells in 28 recent attempts, generated four significant field discoveries and achieved an average proved developed drilling finding cost of $0.75 per Mcfe.
Brigham's actual capital expenditures in 2002 may differ from the estimates discussed herein based upon cash flow and capital availability during the year. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources" There can be no assurance that any potential drilling locations identified by Brigham will be drilled at all or within the expected time frame. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any well, including those currently budgeted, will depend upon a number of factors, including:
- the availability of leases on reasonable terms and permitting for the potential drilling location;
- economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability and cost of drilling rigs and crews;
- the results of exploration and development efforts and the continuing review and analysis of seismic data; and
- the availability of sufficient capital resources by Brigham and other participants to fund drilling and completion expenditures.
In addition, there can be no assurance that the budgeted wells will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas.
ANADARKO BASIN
The Anadarko Basin is a prolific natural gas province that Brigham believes offers a combination of lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons and deeper, higher potential objectives that have been relatively under explored. This province has produced approximately 100 Tcfe to date from numerous, historically elusive stratigraphic targets, such as the Red Fork, Upper Morrow and Springer channel sands, as well as from deeper, higher potential structural objectives, such the Lower Morrow sandstones and the Hunton and Arbuckle carbonates. In some cases, these objectives have produced in excess of 50 Bcf of natural gas from a single well at rates of up to 30 MMcf of natural gas per day. In addition, drilling economics in the Anadarko Basin are enhanced by the multi-pay nature of many of the prospects, with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as a bailout alternative in the event the primary target zone is not productive.
Each of the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the Anadarko Basin can provide excellent targets for 3-D seismic imaging. Brigham has assembled an extensive digital database in this province,
including geologic studies, basin-wide geologic tops, production data, well data, geographic data and over 8,400 miles of 2-D seismic data. Brigham's explorationists integrate this data with their extensive expertise and knowledge base to generate 3-D delineated drilling prospects.
As of December 31, 2001, Brigham had accumulated 2,259 square miles (1.4 million acres) of 3-D seismic data in the Anadarko Basin. Since 1994, Brigham has completed 104 (37.8 net) wells in 133 (48.8 net) attempts for a net completion rate of 77% and has found cumulative net proved reserves of 81 Bcfe at an average drilling finding cost of $0.60 per Mcfe. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, Brigham completed 33 (11.8 net) wells in 38 (13.0 net) attempts in the Anadarko Basin for a net completion rate of 91%. The Company retained an average working interest of 34% in these wells and added 33 net Bcfe of proved reserves at an average drilling finding cost of $0.47 per Mcfe.
For 2002, Brigham intends to focus the majority of its Anadarko Basin drilling activities in the following key focus trends:
SPRINGER TREND
Brigham's inventory of 3-D projects in the Springer trend consists of approximately 630 square miles of 3-D seismic data covering approximately 400,000 acres in Dewey, Blaine, Canadian and Caddo Counties, Oklahoma. These projects target stratigraphic fluvial sand channels in the Springer-aged Old Woman and Britt intervals, as well as secondary objectives including the Morrow.
Brigham initiated the acquisition of 3-D seismic data in the area in 1991 by acquiring a 13 square mile program, and subsequently acquired 14 square miles in 1994, and 219 square miles in 1996. To capitalize on its prior experiences and successes in the play, the Company accelerated its 3-D acquisitions in the trend in 1997 and 1998, when it acquired 383 square miles of 3-D seismic data with an average working interest of 72%. The processing of the majority of this data was completed in 1998 and 1999, and Brigham's interpretation and prospect generation efforts are still underway.
In May 2000, Brigham completed the Price #2, a 3-D delineated Springer channel test in Blaine County, Oklahoma. The Company retained a 71% working interest and 56% net revenue interest in the discovery, which began producing to sales at a curtailed rate of approximately 3.5 MMcf of natural gas and 350 barrels of condensate per day. Due to increased pipeline capacity, production rates were increased in December 2000 to approximately 6.5 MMcf of natural gas and 250 barrels of condensate per day. At year-end 2001, the Price #2 had produced 2.7 Bcfe and was producing approximately 2.4 MMcfe per day. During 2001, Brigham drilled the Price #3, a successful offset to its earlier Price #2 discovery. Brigham operated the Price #3 and retained a 41% net revenue interest in the well, which began producing to sales in May 2001 at 2.8 MMcf of natural gas and 70 barrels of condensate per day. At year-end 2001, the Price #3 had produced 0.5 Bcfe and was producing approximately 1.3 MMcfe per day.
In February 2001, Brigham completed the Zachary #1, another Springer channel discovery, which was drilled to a total depth of approximately 9,750 feet. The Company began producing the well to sales in March 2001 at a pipeline-curtailed rate of approximately 2.2 MMcf of natural gas and 75 barrels of condensate per day. In April 2001, the production rate was increased to approximately 6.0 MMcf of natural gas and 200 barrels of condensate per day, or approximately 1.4 MMcfe per day to Brigham's 20% net revenue interest. At year-end, 2001 the Zachary #1 had produced 2.0 Bcfe and was producing approximately 8.4 MMcfe per day. In July 2001, Brigham completed two offset wells to this discovery. The Company retained a 24% working interest and 20% net revenue interest in the first offset, which began producing to sales in September 2001 at 3.3 MMcfe per day. Brigham retained a 47% working interest and 38% net revenue interest in the second offset, which also began producing to sales in September 2001 at 2.1 MMcfe per day. The Company plans to stimulate both of these wells in early 2002.
Since 2000, Brigham has completed six Springer channel tests in eight attempts at an estimated proved developed drilling finding cost of $0.58 per Mcfe. Based on this recent drilling success, Brigham plans to drill four to six Springer channel tests in 2002. These wells target similar objectives as its previous producers, and the Company expects to retain an average working interest of approximately 35% in these planned wells.
HUNTON TREND
Brigham's 3-D seismic inventory in the deep Hunton play of the southwestern portion of the Anadarko Basin consists of approximately 763 square miles of 3-D seismic data covering approximately 488,000 acres in the southern portion of the Texas Panhandle in Wheeler, Hemphill and Roberts Counties, Texas and Beckham County, Oklahoma. The primary exploration targets within these projects are high potential, structural features at depths ranging from 7,500 to 25,000 feet.
Brigham initiated acquisition of data in the Hunton trend in 1994 when it retained a 25% working interest in 67 square miles of 3-D seismic. Following Brigham's 3-D seismic acquisition in 1994, it acquired an additional 85 square miles of 3-D seismic (average working interest of 15%) in 1995, 254 square miles (average working interest of 30%) in 1996, and 123 square miles (average working interest of 38%) in 1997. Based upon the interpretation of these data sets Brigham acquired an additional 99 square miles of 3-D data in 1998 where it retained a 100% working interest. In 2001, Brigham traded ownership interest in a less active 3-D project to obtain an additional 135 square miles of 3-D seismic data in the Hunton trend.
MILLS RANCH FIELD
In July 2000, Brigham spud the Mills Ranch #1, which targeted a large high potential Hunton structure adjacent to a currently producing Hunton well that has produced over 15 Bcfe. The Company operated and retained a 64% working interest in the well, which was drilled directionally to a total depth of over 25,000 feet. Brigham completed the discovery in the targeted Hunton formation in December 2000. The well encountered approximately 1,200 feet of gross pay and 340 feet of measured depth net pay (240 feet of calculated true vertical net pay) in three Hunton intervals. The well began producing to sales from one Hunton interval in January 2001 at approximately 9.5 MMcf of natural gas and 90 barrels of condensate per day, or 5.1 MMcfe per day to Brigham's 51% net revenue interest. As of December 31, 2001 the Mills Ranch #1 had produced 1.9 Bcfe and was producing approximately 4.0 MMcfe per day.
The Company estimates its proved developed drilling finding cost for the Mills Ranch discovery well was $0.31 per Mcfe, and currently plans to drill an offset well during 2002 or early in 2003.
TEXAS GULF COAST
The onshore Texas Gulf Coast region is a high potential, multi-pay province that lends itself to 3-D seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity. Brigham was attracted to the Gulf Coast province because of the opportunity to apply its established 3-D seismic exploration approach and its exploration staff's extensive Gulf Coast experience to a prolific, structurally complex province with the potential to discover significant natural gas reserves with associated high production rates. Brigham has assembled a digital database including geographical, production, geophysical and geological information that it evaluates on CAEX workstations.
A portion of Brigham's 3-D seismic data acquisition in the Texas Gulf Coast has been accomplished through participation in certain non-proprietary, or speculative, seismic programs. By converting certain of Brigham's proprietary seismic projects in core exploration areas to speculative data, Brigham was able to leverage these proprietary projects for access to substantially larger non-proprietary speculative data for minimal or no additional cost. While increasing its exposure to
competition in speculative seismic programs, Brigham believes this 3-D seismic acquisition strategy in the Gulf Coast, in certain circumstances, can accelerate the addition of attractive potential drilling locations in targeted trends at costs that are considerably less than those associated with proprietary 3-D seismic programs, thereby enhancing the expected project rate of return.
As of December 31, 2001, Brigham had accumulated 2,233 square miles (1.4 million acres) of 3-D seismic data in its Texas Gulf Coast province. The Company began to acquire 3-D seismic in the Texas Gulf Coast in 1995 when it acquired 39 square miles of 3-D seismic data. Brigham subsequently acquired 115 square miles in 1996, and in 1997 and 1998 accelerated its acquisition of 3-D seismic data by acquiring approximately 990 square miles in the plays it believed would provide optimal 3-D drilling economics. The Company further capitalized on its experience by retaining an average working interest of 78% in this newly acquired data. In 2001, Brigham exchanged licensing rights in certain non-core 3-D data volumes for licenses to additional 3-D seismic data programs located in Brigham's focus plays in the Texas Gulf Coast. As a result, Brigham added approximately 1,100 square miles of 3-D seismic data in the Texas Gulf Coast in 2001, with very little capital investment. The Company believes that by applying its knowledge base and expertise to this newly acquired 3-D seismic data it should generate additional drilling inventory in its current focus plays. One of Brigham's 2001 Frio discoveries was drilled on this recently acquired data.
Since 1996 Brigham has completed 59 (21.7 net) wells in 75 (27.3 net) attempts in the Texas Gulf Coast for a net completion rate of 79%. Brigham has discovered cumulative net proved reserves of 60 Bcfe at an average net drilling finding cost of $0.85 per Mcfe. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, Brigham completed 34 (10.8 net) wells in 43 (14.5 net) attempts in the Texas Gulf Coast for a net completion rate of 74%. Brigham retained an average working interest in these wells of 34% and added approximately 36 net Bcfe of proved reserves at an average drilling finding cost of $1.02 per Mcfe.
For 2002, Brigham intends to focus the majority of its Texas Gulf Coast drilling activities in the following key focus plays:
VICKSBURG TREND
Brigham has made two significant field discoveries (Home Run Field and Triple Crown Field) in the Vicksburg trend since 1999. Brigham and its participant, a major integrated oil company, acquired a 54 square mile program in 1997 and 1998, and jointly control 10,000 gross and net acres of leasehold. Brigham retained a 34% working interest in the project to explore and develop the Vicksburg formation below 10,000 feet, but increased its pre-payout working interest to 50% in select acreage that was subsequently drilled as its Triple Crown Field discovery. Also in the project, in the prospective zones above 10,000 feet, the Company retained a 100% working interest in its original 4,000 acre lease block. Since 1999, excluding the Palmer #5 well (which experienced a casing failure) Brigham has completed eight Vicksburg wells in eight attempts at an estimated proved developed drilling finding cost of $1.47 per Mcfe.
HOME RUN FIELD
Brigham discovered the Home Run Field in late 1999 with its Palmer State #2 discovery well. The Brigham operated Palmer State #2 began producing in February 2000 at an initial rate of 10.1 MMcf of natural gas and 650 barrels of condensate per day, or 4.1 MMcfe to Brigham's 29% net revenue interest. At year-end 2001, the Palmer #2 had produced 3.2 Bcfe and was producing 2.0 MMcfe per day.
In 2001, Brigham completed four wells in its Home Run Field. Two of these wells, the Palmer #4 and the D.J. Sullivan #C-25, were spud in the fourth quarter of 2000 and completed during the first quarter of 2001. Brigham retained a 34% working interest in both wells. The Palmer #4, an offset to
the previously drilled Palmer #2 and Palmer #3 wells, was drilled to a total depth of approximately 13,550 feet and encountered prospective pay intervals in several of the targeted Lower Vicksburg objectives. The Palmer #4 was fracture stimulated in four Vicksburg pay intervals and began producing to sales in March 2001 at 6.8 MMcf of natural gas and 280 barrels of condensate per day, or 2.5 MMcfe net to Brigham's 29% net revenue interest. The D.J. Sullivan #C-25 began producing to sales in March at 9.8 MMcf of natural gas and 390 barrels of condensate per day, or 3.0 MMcfe net to Brigham's 25% net revenue interest. At year-end 2001, the D.J. Sullivan #C-25 had produced 1.5 Bcfe and was producing 3.1 MMcfe per day.
During August 2001, Brigham drilled the Palmer #5, its fourth successive development well in the Home Run Field and encountered pay intervals comparable to the previously completed D.J. Sullivan #C-25 well. Subsequent to fracture stimulation, Brigham's initial completion of one of several potential pay intervals in the Palmer #5 tested at an estimated 1.6 MMcf of natural gas per day. However, surface production facilities subsequently plugged with large pieces of formation and steel casing fragments, and repeated attempts to restore the well to production were unsuccessful. The Company believes that the well's problems were created by a poor cement job caused by a casing failure during cementing operations. As a result, Brigham is currently pursuing compensation for losses, and anticipates drilling a replacement well late in 2002. See "Item 3.
