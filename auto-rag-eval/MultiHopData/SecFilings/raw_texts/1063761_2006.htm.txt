Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. Our Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 200 million square feet of GLA, of which we own approximately 120.2 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2006 were approximately $53 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 171 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.0 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,800 occupied stores, including approximately 675 anchors, which are mostly national retailers.
Premium Outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturers' outlet centers. Our 36 Premium Outlet centers range in size from approximately 200,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet centers are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco; or within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 69 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other tenants that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets. These tenants generally occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 10 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These other Properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 300,000 square feet of GLA. The combined other Properties represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

We own 100% of 199 of our 286 Properties, effectively control 19 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 68 Properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 276 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

Our properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan, primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of these properties are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.
Other International Investments
We also hold real estate interests in five joint ventures in Japan and one in Mexico. The five joint ventures in Japan operate Premium Outlet centers in various cities in Japan and have over 1.4 million square feet of GLA. These centers were 100% leased as of December 31, 2006 and contained 600 stores with approximately 300 different tenants. The Premium Outlet center in Mexico is 85% leased as of December 31, 2006.

The joint venture partner has indemnified us for the amount of our allocated investment in the project.
Land Held for Development
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in five parcels of land held in the United States for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately 400 acres located in three states.
Also, on December 28, 2005, we invested $50.0 million of equity for a 40% interest in a joint venture with Toll Brothers, Inc. (Toll Brothers) and Meritage Homes Corp. (Meritage Homes) to purchase a 5,485-acre land parcel in northwest Phoenix from DaimlerChrysler Corporation for $312 million. Toll Brothers and Meritage Homes each plan to build a significant number of homes on the site. We have the option to purchase a substantial portion of the commercial property for retail uses. Other parcels may also be sold to third parties. The site plans call for a mixed-use master planned community, which will include approximately 4,840 acres of single-family homes and attached homes. Approximately 645 acres of commercial and retail development will include schools, community amenities and open space. The entitlement, planning, and design processes are ongoing and initial home sales are tentatively scheduled to begin in 2009. The joint venture, of which Toll Brothers is the managing member, expects to develop a master planned community of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 residential units.
Energy Costs Conservation
In 2003, we began monitoring and benchmarking our energy consumption and initiated a process to assess energy efficiency across our enclosed mall properties. In 2004, we implemented a comprehensive strategy to improve energy efficiency. This included the launch of our Energy Best Practices Program, which challenged managers of our enclosed mall properties to examine their operating practices in an effort to reduce energy costs without affecting comfort, safety or reliability. We also developed strategic relationships for investing in cost-effective, energy-efficiency projects. In 2005, we enhanced the remote monitoring of our malls' Energy Management Systems to help ensure optimal system operations through alarm delivery to mall operators and reporting of non-optimal operating practices to management. In 2006, we piloted various techniques in the area of demand shifting and response initiatives to reduce load on utility networks when advised that supply capacity is critically low, while reducing our operating costs.
This strategy helped us reduce electricity usage by 175 million kWhs for 2004, 2005, and 2006 combined, as compared to 2003. This is an 8.2% reduction in electricity usage which represents approximately $18 million in avoided annual operating costs at current market prices. This reduction in electricity usage translates to the avoidance of 110,576 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, which is equivalent to 23,934 cars not driven for one year, saved electrical energy to power 14,195 U.S. homes for a full year, or 92,147 acres of pine or fir forests storing carbon for one year.
A substantial portion of savings was generated through low cost/no cost measures ranging from simple actions to complex ones. For example, we minimize costs by keeping tight control over hours of operation for all lighting systems in the common area, parking lot, and back of the house areas of our properties without affecting comfort or safety. We also optimize the start/stop of HVAC systems with direct digital controls to meet cooling requirements. Another key strategy for management of energy use is the investment in energy efficient technologies in areas such as lighting, HVAC and building control systems.
In recognition of our excellence in energy efficiency, we received the 2005 Bronze Leader in the Light Award from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2006, our leadership was further recognized as we received the Gold Leader in the Light Award from NAREIT. Recipients are judged on the basis of how effectively they have implemented company-wide operations that generate substantially improved energy efficiency and expense management.
For the past two years, we also participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project's greenhouse emissions information requests to inform investors of our activities in the area of climate change and energy conservation. We also joined the U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR program, with the goal of continuing to improve our organization's energy and environmental performance.
