OFFICE PROPERTIES
The Company's office properties consist of all or a portion of 14 office buildings in the New York City metropolitan area (primarily Manhattan) containing approximately 8.4 million square feet. As a result of extensive renovations and upgrades over the last ten years and the Company's on-going program of preventative maintenance, the Company believes that its properties are modern structures, attract high quality tenants and are well positioned to compete with other Class A office properties in their respective submarkets.
The office properties currently are leased to over 770 tenants, which are engaged in a variety of businesses, including financial services, investment banking, publishing, computer technology, health care services, accounting and law. The average lease term of a tenant's lease is 12 years. Leases typically provide for step-ups in rent periodically over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants the tenant's share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for a building over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a submetered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. At December 31, 1997, no single tenant accounted for more than 5.7% of the Company's total leasable office property square footage.
The following table sets forth a schedule of lease expirations for leases in place, as of December 31, 1997 for each of the next 10 years on an aggregate basis, assuming that none of the tenants exercise their renewal options.
For the year ended December 31, 1997, office properties accounted for 41% of total revenues (46% of pro forma total revenues which gives effect to the completed and pending acquisitions previously described as if they had occurred on January 1, 1997). The occupancy rate of the properties was 95% as of March 1, 1998. The annual rent per square foot as of December 31, 1997 was $27.09. Two Penn Plaza accounted for 12% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997. One Penn Plaza accounted for 10% of total pro forma revenues. No other office property exceeded 10% of total historical or pro forma revenues or assets. Below are descriptions of One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza:
Two Penn Plaza
Two Penn Plaza is a 32-story Manhattan office building that sits directly atop Penn Station and occupies the entire block front on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets (adjacent to Madison Square Garden). Built in 1968, Two Penn Plaza has approximately 1,500,000 rentable square feet (including 30,000 square feet of retail space and 28,000 square feet of storage space). The Penn Plaza area has been improved in recent years through the efforts of the 34th Street Business Improvement District Partnership ("BID"), which provides street cleaning services, security personnel and other community services to businesses in the area.
The Company currently is exploring the possibility of developing additional retail space at Two Penn Plaza. The Company believes that the development of additional retail space may provide a source of
additional cash flow and therefore enhance the value of Two Penn Plaza. There can be no assurance, however, that any such additional retail space will be developed.
As of March 1, 1998, approximately 98% of the rentable square footage in Two Penn Plaza was leased. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to Two Penn Plaza at the end of each of the past five years.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable"), leased approximately 430,000 square feet at Two Penn Plaza under a lease which expired on October 31, 1996. Equitable relocated its operations to a building closer to its Manhattan headquarters. At December 31, 1996, approximately 465,000 square feet (approximately 31%) of the property was vacant. During 1997, the Company entered into separate leases with Information Builders Inc. ("IBI") and The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. ("McGraw-Hill") for space previously occupied by Equitable. IBI, a privately held software company, leased approximately 180,000 square feet, which commenced on October 1, 1997 and expires on May 31, 2013. Subsequently, IBI exercised their option to lease an additional 40,000 square feet, which also expires on May 31, 2013. In November 1997, McGraw-Hill signed a lease, which when fully implemented, encompasses approximately 407,000 square feet. McGraw-Hill will take possession of approximately 290,000 square feet during the first quarter of 1998. McGraw-Hill will take possession of the remainder of the space as current leases expire in subsequent periods. McGraw-Hill's lease expires on March 31, 2020.
The following table is a schedule of the annual lease expirations at Two Penn Plaza as of March 1, 1998 (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal options):
The aggregate undepreciated tax basis of depreciable real property at Two Penn Plaza for Federal income tax purposes was approximately $111,000,000 as of December 31, 1997, and depreciation for such property is computed for Federal income tax purposes on the declining balance or straight-line methods over lives which range from 15 to 39 years.
The current assessed value of Two Penn Plaza for real estate tax purposes is $74,250,000. The tax rate in New York City for commercial real estate is 10.164 for $100 of assessed value which results in real estate taxes for the 1997/1998 tax year of $7,897,380 (including the 34th Street BID tax of $350,610).
One Penn Plaza
One Penn Plaza is a 57-story Manhattan office building which encompasses substantially the entire square block bounded by 33rd Street, 34th Street, Seventh Avenue and Eight Avenue. Built in 1972, One Penn Plaza contains approximately 2,350,000 square feet (including 239,000 square feet of retail space, 154,000 square feet of garage space and 22,000 square feet of storage space).
One Penn Plaza is one of the largest office buildings in Midtown Manhattan. It is strategically located between Macy's and Madison Square Garden with direct access to Pennsylvania Station. A recently completed $28.5 million capital improvement program has enhanced the building's competitiveness. The Program included upgrading the lobby, public corridors on all multi-tenant floors, elevators, mechanical and HVAC systems. The Penn Plaza area has been enhanced in recent years through the efforts of the 34th Street BID.
As of March 1, 1998, approximately 94% of the square footage in One Penn Plaza was leased. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to One Penn Plaza at the end of each of the past five years.
The following table is a schedule of the annual lease expirations at One Penn Plaza as of March 1, 1998 (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal options):
The aggregate undepreciated tax basis of depreciable real property at One Penn Plaza for Federal income tax purposes was approximately $410,000,000 as of December 31, 1997, and depreciation for such property will be computed for Federal income tax purposes on the straight-line method over 39 years. The Company acquired this property on February 9, 1998.
The current assessed value of One Penn Plaza for real estate tax purposes is $116,860,000. The tax rate in New York City for commercial real estate is 10.164 for $100 of assessed value which produces real estate taxes for the 1997/1998 tax year of $12,409,287 (including the 34th Street BID tax of $536,637).
Washington, D.C.
The Company has a 15% limited partnership interest in Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. which owns interests in and manages approximately 7.2 million square feet of office properties in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and manages an additional 14.0 million square feet of office and other commercial properties in the Washington, D.C. area.
SHOPPING CENTERS
The Company owns 59 shopping center properties of which 57 are strip shopping centers primarily located in the Northeast and Midatlantic states, one is a regional center located in San Juan, Puerto Rico and one is a super-regional center located in Nassau County, Long Island, New York. The Company's shopping centers are generally located on major regional highways in mature densely populated areas. The Company believes its shopping centers attract consumers from a regional, rather than a neighborhood marketplace because of their location on regional highways. Shopping centers accounted for 54% of the Company's total revenue (29% of pro forma total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 1997. The occupancy rate of the shopping center properties was 92% and 90% as of March 1, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and has been over 90% in each of the past five years.
The Company's shopping center lease terms range from five years or less in some instances, for smaller tenant spaces to as long as thirty years for major tenants. Leases generally provide for additional rents based on a percentage of tenant's sales and pass through to tenant's the tenant's share of all common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenant's direct responsibility), real estate taxes and insurance costs and certain capital expenditures. Percentage rent accounted for less than 1% of total revenues in 1997. As of December 31, 1997, the average annual base rent per square foot for the Company's shopping centers was $9.78 (excluding the Green Acres Mall). The average annual base rent per square foot for the Green Acres Mall was $13.16 in total and $27.08 for mall tenants only.
The following table sets forth a schedule of lease expirations for leases in place, as of December 31, 1997 for each of the next 10 years on an aggregate basis, assuming that none of the tenants exercise their renewal options.
The Company's Montehiedra shopping center, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, accounted for 4.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997 and 2% on a pro forma basis. No other shopping center accounted for more than 2.7% of total revenues. The Green Acres Mall, acquired in December 1997, is the Company's largest shopping center property. It contains 1.8 million square feet or 14.7% of total shopping center square footage and represents 7.0% of 1997 pro forma revenues. No other shopping center accounted for more than 5% of total shopping center square footage.
The Company's strip shopping centers are substantially leased to large stores (over 20,000 square feet). Tenants include destination retailers such as discount department stores, supermarkets, home improvements stores, discount apparel stores, membership warehouse clubs and "category killers." Category killers are large stores which offer a complete selection of a category of items (e.g., toys, office supplies, etc.) at low prices, often in a warehouse format. Tenants typically offer basic consumer necessities such as food, health and beauty aids, moderately priced clothing, building materials and home improvement supplies, and compete primarily on the basis of price.
The Green Acres Mall is a 1.8 million square foot super-regional enclosed shopping mall complex situated in Nassau County, Long Island, New York one-mile east of the borough of Queens, New York. The Green Acres Mall is anchored by four major department stores: Sears, Roebuck and Co., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., and Federated Department Stores, Inc. doing business as Stern's and as Macy's. The complex also includes The Plaza at Green Acres, a 179,000 square foot strip shopping center which is anchored by Kmart and Waldbaums.
Only one of the Company's tenants, Bradlees, represented more than 10% of total property rentals for the year ended December 31, 1997. Bradlees accounted for 10.5% of total property rentals (4.2% of total pro forma property rentals). In June 1995, Bradlees filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company currently leases 16 locations to Bradlees. Of these locations, the leases for 14 are fully guaranteed by Stop & Shop Companies, Inc. ("Stop & Shop"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Ahold NV, a leading international food retailer, and one is guaranteed as to 70% of the rent.

Refrigerated warehouses are comprised of production and distribution facilities. Production facilities typically serve one or a small number of customers, generally food processors, located nearby. These customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in the facility until they are shipped to the next stage of production or distribution. Distribution facilities primarily warehouse a wide variety of customers' finished products until future shipment to end-users. Each distribution facility primarily services the surrounding regional market.

Capital Expenditures
The Cold Storage Companies have budgeted approximately $47,000,000 for capital expenditures over the next year of which (i) $23,000,000 is for warehouse expansions, (ii) $15,000,000 is for recurring replacements of equipment and (iii) $9,000,000 is for non-recurring items including $3,000,000 resulting from the consolidation of the computer systems and offices of the two companies acquired, $3,000,000 for reracking of an existing warehouse and $3,000,000 of structural warehouse delayed maintenance.
On March 25, 1998, the Cold Storage Companies entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of Freezer Services, Inc., consisting of nine cold storage warehouses for approximately $134 million, including $22 million of indebtedness.
