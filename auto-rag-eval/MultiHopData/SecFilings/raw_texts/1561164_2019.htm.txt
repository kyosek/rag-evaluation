We do not typically enter into month-to-month leases.
Description of Our Properties
Below is a description of our properties. More detail is provided for the properties that represent more than ten percent of our total assets or accounted for more than ten percent of our aggregate gross revenues or both as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Atlanta, Georgia Campus
Our Atlanta (DC-1) facility, formerly known as Atlanta-Metro, is currently our largest data center based on total operating NRSF. As of December 31, 2019, the property consisted of approximately 969,000 gross square feet with approximately 929,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 527,000 raised floor operating NRSF. An on-site Georgia Power substation supplies 72 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators, and the facility has 120 MW of transformer capacity. The facility also includes a small amount of private “Class A” office space. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 96% occupied by 241 customers across our product offerings.
Portions of the Atlanta (DC-1) facility are included in our development pipeline, as we plan to continue to expand the facility in multiple phases. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we placed approximately 49,000 NRSF of raised floor into service. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 938,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 527,000 NRSF of raised floor.
We are the owner of our Atlanta (DC-1) facility. We were previously the owner of the facility through a bond-financed sale-leaseback structure. The structure was necessary in the State of Georgia to receive property tax abatement. In 2006, the Development Authority of Fulton County (“DAFC”) issued a taxable industrial development revenue bond to us with a face amount of $300 million in exchange for legal title to the facility. The acquisition of the bond by us was “cashless” as the bond was issued to us in exchange for title to the facility. The bond matured on December 1, 2019, at which time we exercised our option to purchase the facility for $10.
In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of approximately 55 acres of land in Atlanta, Georgia adjacent to our existing Atlanta (DC-1) data center. In addition, this facility is adjacent to approximately 72 acres of undeveloped land, inclusive of the land purchase in October 2018, owned by us that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, approximately 2.5 million additional NRSF of raised floor. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain land improvements near its Atlanta (DC-1) facility and entered into an underlying ground lease and services agreement with the buyer.
We have begun the construction of a second megascale data center Atlanta (DC-2) on our land adjacent to the existing Atlanta (DC-1) facility. The Atlanta (DC-2) facility is included within our development pipeline, as we plan to construct the facility in multiple phases. Upon completion of the first phase of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 495,000 gross square feet, and 276,000 raised floor NRSF upon completion of the build-out. We anticipate that this first phase of development will cost (in addition to the $48 million already incurred as of December 31, 2019) approximately $99 million in the aggregate based on current estimates.

Atlanta-Suwanee
Our Suwanee, Georgia, or Atlanta-Suwanee, facility consists of approximately 370,000 gross square feet, and as of December 31, 2019 it had approximately 321,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 206,000 raised floor operating NRSF. Georgia Power supplies 36 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” private office space and our operating service center, which provides 24x7 support to all of our customers and data centers. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 93% occupied by 325 customers. We are the fee simple owner of the Atlanta-Suwanee facility.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions the Atlanta-Suwanee facility.
The facility is adjacent to 15 acres of undeveloped land owned by us that we believe could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 310,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately would be 210,000 NRSF of raised floor. These 15 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.

Irving
We purchased our Irving facility in February 2013. Prior to our purchase, the facility was operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility. Similar to our Richmond facility, the Irving facility has significant pre-existing infrastructure. Specifically, the Irving facility has diverse feeds of 140 MW of utility power and approximately 698,000 gross square feet on 39 acres. We are the fee simple owner of the Irving facility.
We acquired our Irving facility because we believe that we will be able to execute a redevelopment strategy similar to our Richmond facility. Given the infrastructure that was already in place due to its former use as a semiconductor fabrication facility, we believe that the incremental costs to redevelop data center raised floor space in this facility will be lower compared to typical costs for ground-up development or redevelopments of other building types. In addition, the access to a significant amount of utility power provides the necessary power capacity to support our growth strategy for our Irving data center. Furthermore, we believe that the Dallas market is an important data center market primarily due to its strong business environment and relatively affordable power costs.
The Irving facility is included in our development pipeline, as we continue to convert the entire facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. We placed approximately 25,000 raised floor NRSF and 26,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we placed approximately 14,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 49,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 20,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2019) approximately $1 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 226,000 total NRSF, of which approximately 68,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 669,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 276,000 NRSF of raised floor.
We own sufficient undeveloped land on the site, approximately 29 acres, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 1.3 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately 680,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These 29 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 95% occupied by 151 customers.
Lease Expirations. The following table sets forth a summary schedule of the lease expirations for leases in place as of December 31, 2019 at the Irving facility.

Below is a description of our other properties.
Richmond
Our Richmond, Virginia data center is situated on an approximately 292-acre site comprised of three large buildings available for data center redevelopment, each with two to three floors, and an administrative building that also has space available for data center redevelopment. As of December 31, 2019, the data center had approximately 1.3 million gross square feet with approximately 300,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 117,000 of raised floor operating NRSF. The Richmond facility contains approximately 110 MW of utility power, which is backed up by diesel generators. As of December 31, 2019, one of these primary buildings was fully operational as a data center and another was partially operational. We believe that our Richmond facility is situated in an ideal location due to its proximity to Washington, DC, which offers numerous sources of demand for our products including the federal government, and provides geographical diversification from the Northern Virginia data center market. There are three core segments that we believe represent the most significant opportunity for our Richmond data center: entities associated with the federal government, given the highly secured nature of this facility and its proximity to Washington, DC; regulated industries, such as financial institutions, given our investments in security and regulatory compliance; and large enterprise customers, given the large scale of this facility. Our Richmond mega data center can accommodate large and growing customers, while also accommodating colocation and cloud and managed services customers, at attractive energy costs.
We acquired our Richmond facility in 2010 through a bankruptcy process. We estimate that the former owner, a semiconductor manufacturer, had invested over $1 billion to develop the facility prior to the bankruptcy. Because the facility operated as a semiconductor fabrication facility prior to our acquisition, it had significant pre-existing infrastructure, including 110 MW of utility power, approximately 25,000 tons of chiller capacity, “Class A” private office space and other related supporting infrastructure. As a result, to date the incremental cost to redevelop the facility into a data center has been lower than the typical cost of ground-up data center development or redevelopment of other types of buildings into data centers. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 84% occupied by 144 customers across our product offerings.
We are the fee simple owner of the Richmond facility.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions of the Richmond facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 888,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 440,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 1.2 million total operating NRSF, including approximately 557,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, we own approximately 182 acres of undeveloped land on the site that we estimate could be developed to provide, at a minimum, an additional approximately 6.3 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately
3.5 million NRSF would be raised floor. These 182 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
Chicago
Our Chicago facility, which we acquired on July 8, 2014, is the former Sun Times Press facility near downtown Chicago, Illinois. We are the fee simple owner of the Chicago facility. The facility consists of approximately 475,000 gross square feet, including approximately 70,000 raised floor operating NRSF.
The Chicago facility is included in our development pipeline, as we plan to convert the facility into an operating data center in multiple phases. We placed approximately 14,000 raised floor NRSF and 18,000 raised floor NRSF into service during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we placed approximately 24,000 raised floor NRSF into service. Our current under construction redevelopment plans call for the addition of up to approximately 10,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 5,000 NRSF of raised floor. We anticipate that this expansion will cost (in addition to costs already incurred as of December 31, 2019) approximately $7 million in the aggregate based on current estimates. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 280,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 141,000 would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 433,000 total operating NRSF with raised floor capacity of approximately 216,000 square feet.
We own sufficient undeveloped land on the site, approximately 23 acres, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 350,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 200,000 NRSF would be raised floor. These 23 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 95% occupied by 79 customers.
Leased Facilities Acquired in 2015
We acquired leased facilities as part of our acquisition of Carpathia Hosting, Inc. (“Carpathia”) on June 16, 2015. As of December 31, 2019, these leased facilities, including those subject to finance leases, consisted of four domestic data centers located in Phoenix, Arizona; San Jose, California and Ashburn, Virginia; and two international data centers located in Toronto, Canada and Amsterdam, Netherlands. As of December 31, 2019, QTS is no longer leasing space at the Secaucus, New Jersey; London, United Kingdom and Hong Kong facilities.
These leased facilities consist of approximately 70,513 gross square feet with approximately 36,413 total operating NRSF, including approximately 31,862 raised floor operating NRSF. We are not currently redeveloping the leased facilities, we have no current plans to further build out or expand any of these leased facilities.
As of December 31, 2019, the facilities were approximately 85% occupied by 62 customers. The majority of the customers at these facilities are cloud and managed services customers which lease small amounts of space.
Santa Clara
Our Santa Clara, California facility was acquired in November 2007. The facility, which is owned subject to a long-term ground sublease as described below, consists of two buildings containing approximately 135,000 gross square feet with approximately 106,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 60,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The facility is situated on a 6.5-acre site in Silicon Valley. Several Silicon Valley Power substations supply 11 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. We believe that Silicon Valley is an ideal data center location due to the large concentration of technology companies and the high local demand for data centers and cloud and managed services.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 88% occupied by 90 customers.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions of the Santa Clara facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 25,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 21,000 NRSF would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 131,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 81,000 NRSF of raised floor.
The Santa Clara facility is subject to a ground lease. We acquired a ground sublease interest in the land on which the Santa Clara facility is located in November 2007. The ground sublease expires in 2052, subject to two 10-year extension options. The annual rent payable under the ground sublease increases annually by the lesser of 6% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay area. The rent was recently adjusted effective October 1, 2018, and will also be adjusted in 2038, to equal one-twelfth of an amount equal to 8.5% of the product of (i) the then fair market value of the demised premises (without taking into account the value of the improvements existing on the land) calculated on a per square foot basis, and (ii) the net square footage of the demised premises. During the term of the ground lease, we have certain obligations to facilitate the provision of job training, seminars and research opportunities for students of a community college that is adjacent to the property. We are the indirect holder of this ground sublease.
Sacramento
Our Sacramento, California facility, which we acquired in December 2012, is located 120 miles from our Santa Clara facility on a 6.8-acre site. The facility currently consists of approximately 93,000 gross square feet with approximately 81,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 55,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District supplies 8 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility is an institutional grade data center with a classic “N+1” design that provides a single extra uninterruptible power supply module for use in the event of a system failure. This facility will provide our regional customer base with business continuity services. We believe the property’s location is a valuable complement to our Santa Clara facility for our customers, as it will allow them to diversify their footprint in the California market with a single provider.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions the Sacramento facility.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 37% occupied by 132 customers. The majority of the customers at this facility are colocation customers which lease small amounts of space. We are the fee simple owner of the Sacramento facility.
Miami
Our Miami, Florida facility currently consists of approximately 30,000 gross square feet with approximately 26,000 total operating NRSF, including 20,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The property sits on a 1.6-acre site located at Dolphin Center with 4 MW of utility power supplied by Florida Power & Light and backed up by diesel generators. With a wind rating of 185 miles-per-hour, the facility is built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. Miami is a strategic location for us because it is a gateway to the South American financial markets and a transcontinental Internet hub. Other than normally recurring capital expenditures, we have no current plans to further build-out or expand the Miami facility.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 71% occupied by 101 customers. We intend to continue to lease-up this property. We are the fee simple owner of the Miami facility.
Jersey City
Our Jersey City, New Jersey facility is a leased facility that consists of approximately 122,000 gross square feet with approximately 88,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 32,000 raised floor operating NRSF. The Jersey City facility was originally leased by another party in March 2004 and we acquired the lease in October 2006 when we acquired the lessee. The lease expires in September 2026 and is subject to one five-year extension option. The facility was redeveloped in November 2006, and we subsequently leased it to service customers in New Jersey and New York. The facility is comprised of four floors of a 19 story building located on one city block in the metropolitan New York City area, six miles from Manhattan. PSE&G supplies 7 MW of utility power to the facility, which is backed up by diesel generators. The facility also contains a small amount of “Class A” office space. We believe that the location in Jersey City provides us with a crucial presence in the tri-state area, where space is highly coveted given the strong demand from financial services firms.
We are not currently redeveloping significant portions of the Jersey City facility. Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 21,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 109,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 53,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 76% occupied by 57 customers.

Longer term, we can further expand the facility by approximately 106,000 total operating NRSF, of which approximately 36,000 would be raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 408,000 gross square feet, including approximately 178,000 NRSF of raised floor.
In addition, in October 2017, we completed the acquisition of approximately 28 acres of land in Ashburn, Virginia, that we believe could also be developed to provide an additional 2 million total operating NRSF, of which approximately 1 million NRSF would be raised floor. These 28 acres of undeveloped land are not included in our current development plans or property table.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 95% occupied by 12 customers.
Dulles
Our Vault facility in Dulles, Virginia consists of approximately 88,000 gross square feet, including approximately 31,000 square feet of raised floor NRSF and 13 MW of available utility power. The data center buildings were built from the ground up to stringent Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility standards set by the Department of Defense and National Security Agency. The Dulles campus has two data center buildings and we initiated a plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 to abandon one of the buildings and relocate customers from the smaller and older facility being abandoned to the newer facility in an effort to better optimize our operating cost structure. In addition, the Dulles data center is located a quarter of a mile from our Ashburn data center.
We acquired the Dulles, Virginia campus as part of our acquisition of Carpathia on June 16, 2015. From the Carpathia acquisition date through October 5, 2017, the facility was subject to a lease financing obligation. On October 6, 2017, the Company completed the buyout of the Dulles facility. At the time of the Dulles facility purchase the lease financing obligation was approximately $17.8 million and the Company purchased the property for approximately $34.1 million cash, for a net purchase price of $16.3 million.
The Dulles facility is included in our development pipeline. Longer term, we can further expand the existing facility by approximately 18,000 NRSF of raised floor. Upon completion of the build-out of the facility, we anticipate that the facility would contain approximately 87,000 total operating NRSF, including approximately 48,000 NRSF of raised floor.
As of December 31, 2019, the facility was approximately 68% occupied by 99 customers.
Groningen, Netherlands and Eemshaven, Netherlands
In April 2019 we completed the acquisition of two data centers in the Netherlands for approximately $44 million in cash consideration, including closing costs. The two facilities, in Groningen and Eemshaven, have approximately 160,000 square feet of raised floor capacity and over 35 megawatts of built out available utility power.
As of December 31, 2019, the Groningen data center was largely stabilized with over 30 colocation tenants and had built-out capacity representing approximately 10 gross megawatts of power and 45,000 square feet of raised floor data center space.
The Eemshaven facility, which was vacant as of December 31, 2019, was originally constructed to support a single hyperscale tenant and has built-out capacity representing approximately 28 gross megawatts of power and 113,000 square feet of raised floor data center space. The facility is strategically located adjacent to multiple hyperscale customer-owned data center deployments, including a 500+ megawatt data center campus operated by one of the largest hyperscale cloud providers in the world. In addition, the facility is located in close proximity to multiple transatlantic fiber cable landings providing access to multiple markets within Europe and North America. QTS anticipates investing incremental capital to recommission the facility in order to position the Eemshaven data center with sellable capacity in future years.
Phoenix
In July 2017, we completed the acquisition of approximately 84 acres of land in Phoenix, Arizona to be used for future development.
Hillsboro
In October 2017, we completed the acquisition of approximately 92 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon to be used for future development. Ultimately, we believe the 92 acre parcel of land can support approximately 250 megawatts of available utility power, 1.5 million gross square feet and 1.0 million square feet of raised floor capacity upon completion.
The Hillsboro facility is included in our development pipeline, as we plan to bring online the mega data center in multiple phases. The first phase will consist of 27 megawatts of power capacity, 158,000 gross square feet and 85,000 square feet of raised floor capacity. We anticipate that this first phase of development will cost (in addition to the $7 million already incurred as of December 31, 2019) approximately $15 million in the aggregate based on current estimates.
Manassas
In March 2018, we completed the acquisition of approximately 61 acres of land in Manassas, Virginia. The land is currently being used to support the construction of a data center, which the Company completed and delivered Phase 1 in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 57 acres of additional land in Manassas, Virginia to be used for future development which is adjacent to the aforementioned 61 acres of land in Manassas.
On February 22, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Alinda, an infrastructure investment firm, with respect to our Manassas data center. At closing, we contributed the Manassas data center, and Alinda contributed cash, in each case, in exchange for a 50% interest in the unconsolidated entity (which includes a 50% interest in future income). The Company received approximately $53 million in cash plus a 50% equity interest in the unconsolidated entity at closing in exchange for contributing the data center to the unconsolidated entity. Under the agreement, we serve as the entity’s operating member, subject to authority and oversight of a board appointed by us and Alinda, and separately we serve as manager and developer of the facility in exchange for management and development fees. The agreement includes various transfer restrictions and rights of first offer that will allow us to repurchase Alinda’s interest should Alinda wish to exit in the future. In addition, we have agreed to provide Alinda an opportunity to invest in future similar agreements based on similar terms and a comparable capitalization rate. This agreement has been reflected as an unconsolidated entity on our reported financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows-Unconsolidated Entity.”
