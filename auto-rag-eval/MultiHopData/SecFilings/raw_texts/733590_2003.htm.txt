ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
TCI’s principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for TCI’s present operations.
Details of TCI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2003, are set forth in Schedules III and IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.” The discussions set forth below under the headings “Real Estate” and “Mortgage Loans” provide certain summary information concerning TCI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
TCI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, properties held for sale, which were primarily obtained through foreclosure of the collateral securing mortgage notes receivable, and investments in partnerships. The discussion set forth below under the heading “Real Estate” provides certain summary information concerning TCI’s real estate and further summary information with respect to its properties held for investment, properties held for sale and its investment in partnerships.
At December 31, 2003, none of TCI’s properties, mortgage notes receivable or investment in partnerships exceeded 10% of total assets. At December 31, 2003, 81% of TCI’s assets consisted of properties held for investment, 7% consisted of properties held for sale, 4% consisted of mortgage notes and interest receivable and 2% consisted of investments in partnerships. The remaining 6% of TCI’s assets were invested in cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The percentage of TCI’s assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of TCI’s assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
TCI’s real estate is geographically diverse. At December 31, 2003, TCI held investments in apartments and commercial properties in each of the geographic regions of the continental United States, although its apartments and commercial properties were concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest regions, as shown more specifically in the table under “Real Estate” below. At December 31, 2003, TCI held mortgage notes receivable secured by apartments and commercial properties in the Southwest and Southeast regions of the continental United States, as shown more specifically in the table under “Mortgage Loans” below.
Geographic Regions
Excluded from the above are 35 parcels of unimproved land and one hotel in Wroclaw, Poland, as described below.
Real Estate
At December 31, 2003, approximately 88% of TCI’s assets were invested in real estate. TCI invests primarily in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or nonleveraged basis. TCI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, investments in partnerships and properties held for sale (which were primarily obtained through foreclosure of the collateral securing mortgage notes receivable).
Types of Real Estate Investments. TCI’s real estate consists of commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses and shopping centers), hotels and apartments having established income-producing capabilities. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. TCI may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
TCI’s real estate portfolio consists of 134 owned properties. Of the 134 properties, 12 apartments were sold to partnerships controlled by Metra Capital, LLC (“Metra”). See NOTE 7. “NOTES AND INTEREST PAYABLE.” Because the Metra sales transaction was accounted for as a finance transaction, TCI continues to account for the 12 properties as owned properties.
TCI typically invests in developed real estate. However, TCI has recently invested in unimproved land and apartment development and construction. To the extent that TCI continues to invest in development and construction projects, it will be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.
At December 31, 2003, TCI had the following properties under construction:
In 2002, TCI completed the 252 unit Limestone Ranch in Lewisville, Texas, the 284 unit Falcon Lakes Apartments in Arlington, Texas, the 190 unit Tivoli Apartments in Dallas, Texas, the 80 unit Waters Edge IV Apartments in Gulfport, Mississippi and the 161 room Hotel Akademia in Wroclaw, Poland. In 2003, TCI completed 186 unit Blue Lake Villas in Waxahachie, Texas, the 284 unit Falcon Lakes in Arlington, Texas, the 180 unit River Oaks Apartments in Wiley, Texas, the 384 unit Sendero Ridge Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, the 256 unit Spyglass Apartments in Mansfield, Texas and the 188 unit Windsong Apartments in Fort Worth, Texas.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by TCI are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of TCI’s real estate (other than four hotels in the Pacific and Midwest regions, one hotel in Poland and 35 parcels of unimproved land, as described below) at December 31, 2003.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units and amount of commercial square footage and does not reflect the value of TCI’s investment in each region. TCI owns 35 parcels of unimproved land, two parcels for a total of 22.16 acres in the Southeast region and 33 parcels for a total of 1,025.38 acres in the Southwest region. See Schedule III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of TCI’s real estate portfolio.

TCI is a 30% general partner in Sacramento Nine (“SAC 9”), which owns the Prospect Park #29 Office Building.
TCI recorded asset impairments of $4.7 million in 2003 and $2.6 million for 2002, representing the write down of certain operating properties to current estimated fair value. The assets for 2003 include the following properties:
Brandeis was returned to the lien holder via a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure on February 27, 2004 and the outstanding debt and accrued interest was used as the fair value. The gross impairment for Brandeis was $4.9 million but was reduced by $452,000 for the minority interest portion. Red Cross land was sold on January 30, 2004 and the actual sales price less selling costs was used as the fair value.
The assets for 2002 include the following properties:
The Red Cross land was under contract to sell in 2002 and the sales price was used as fair value. The fair value determined for four apartments above were agreed upon purchase prices as part of the refinancing transaction with Metra Capital, LLC. The costs to sell were actual fees paid to refinance the properties. TCI refinanced the Plantation Apartments in May 2003, incurring a new note for $2.3 million and discharging debt of $1.9 million. See NOTE 7. “NOTES AND INTEREST PAYABLE.”
Mortgage Loans
In addition to investments in real estate, a portion of TCI’s assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally secured by real estate. TCI may originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of property sales. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes in TCI’s portfolio. TCI’s mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. TCI has originated its own mortgage loans, as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services TCI’s mortgage notes. TCI’s investment policy is described in ITEM 1. “BUSINESS-Business Plan and Investment Policy.”
Types of Properties Securing Mortgage Notes. The properties securing TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 2003, consisted of two apartments, five office buildings, unimproved land, a partnership interest, an assignment of claims from litigation and two unsecured loans. The Board of Directors may alter the types of properties securing or collateralizing mortgage loans in which TCI invests without a vote of stockholders. TCI’s Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.”
At December 31, 2003, TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio included seven mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $23.6 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the continental
United States, one mortgage loan with an aggregate principal balance of $2.4 million secured by unimproved land in the Southwest region of the continental United States, one loan with a principal balance of $300,000 secured by a partnership interest, one loan with a principal balance of $4.3 million secured by an assignment of litigation proceeds and two unsecured loans with a principal balance of $64,000. At December 31, 2003, 3.6% of TCI’s assets were invested in notes and interest receivable.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the mortgage note principal balance) by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as collateral for TCI’s mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2003. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for further details of TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in TCI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2003 is as follows:
During 2003, $4.5 million was collected in full payment of five mortgage notes and $141,000 in principal payments were received on other mortgage notes. At December 31, 2003, 1% of TCI’s assets were invested in mortgage notes secured by non-income producing real estate, comprised of a second lien mortgage note secured by 33 acres of unimproved land in Travis County, Texas and a loan secured by a partnership interest.
First Mortgage Loans. TCI invests in first mortgage notes with short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a “balloon” principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the borrower is required to provide a mortgagee’s title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. TCI may grant participations in first mortgage loans that it originates to other lenders.
In July 2001, TCI funded a $1.7 million mortgage loan secured by a first lien on 44.6 acres of unimproved land in Fort Worth, Texas, and a 100% interest in a partnership. The note receivable bears interest at 16.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matured in June 2002. In September 2002, TCI received $1.3 million on the note. With this payment, TCI agreed to release the lien on the 44.6 acres substituting a second lien on 21.61 acres of unimproved land in Tarrant County, Texas, from the borrower to secure the remaining $689,000 in debt. TCI has extended the maturity to November 2002. In May 2003, the loan was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In December 2003, TCI purchased a note receivable secured by a second lien on 33 acres of raw land in Travis County, Texas at par value from ARI for $2.4 million as a paydown on an affiliate loan balance. This note bears interest at 10%, requires interest only payments in November 2007 and matures in October 2008.
Junior Mortgage Loans. TCI may invest in junior mortgage loans, secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of TCI’s assets. At December 31, 2003, 3% of TCI’s assets were invested in junior and wraparound mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loans that TCI originated as well as events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 2003.
In March 2001, TCI funded a $3.5 million mortgage loan secured by a second lien on a retail center in Montgomery County, Texas. In June 2001, an additional $1.5 million was funded. The note receivable bore interest at 16.0% per annum, required monthly interest only payments of $67,000 and matured in September 2001. In October 2001, TCI extended the loan until February 2002, receiving $100,000 as an extension fee. In December 2001, TCI received a $1.5 million principal payment. In February 2002, TCI
sold a $2.0 million senior participation interest in the loan to IORI, a related party. TCI and IORI received 43% and 57%, respectively, of the remaining principal and interest payments. Also in February 2002, TCI extended the loan until April 2002, receiving $23,000 as an extension fee. In April 2002, the loan was extended until July 2002. In July 2002, the loan was extended until September 2002. In August 2002, the loan was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In June 2001, in conjunction with the sale of 275 unit McCallum Glen Apartments in Dallas, Texas, TCI funded a $1.5 million mortgage loan secured by a second lien on the apartments. The note receivable bore interest at 10% per annum, required monthly interest only payments and matured in June 2003. In May 2002, the loan was paid off. TCI agreed to a 5% discount on the note and recognized a loss of $75,000 from the note. TCI also recognized a previously deferred gain on $1.5 million on the sale of the property.
In July 2001, TCI agreed to fund a $4.4 million line of credit secured by a second lien on 1,714.16 acres of unimproved land in Tarrant County, Texas. The note receivable bears interest at 15% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments beginning in September 2001 and matures in July 2003. In March 2002, TCI received a $1.8 million principal payment. As of April 2003, TCI had funded $2.9 million of the line of credit and it was classified as nonperforming. In May 2003, TCI received a $433,000 principal paydown. Also during May 2003, TCI received 14.373 acres of unimproved land in Tarrant County, Texas, valued at $1.1 million, as a principal paydown. As of July 2003, the loan has been paid in full.
In August 2001, TCI agreed to fund up to $5.6 million secured by a second lien on an office building in Dallas, Texas. The note receivable bears interest at a variable rate, currently 9.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matured in January 2003. As of March 2004, TCI has funded a total of $4.3 million. On January 22, 2003, TCI agreed to extend the maturity date until May 1, 2003. No payments have been received and this note is considered nonperforming. The collateral used to secure TCI’s second lien was seized by the first lien holder. On March 11, 2004, TCI agreed to accept an assignment of claims in litigation as security for the note. TCI is also working on securing additional collateral for this note and restructuring the terms of the note. The agreement requires interest to accrue at the default rate of 18%.
In December 2000, TCI funded a $3.0 million mortgage loan secured by a second lien on four office buildings in San Antonio, Texas. The note receivable bore interest at 16.0% per annum, required monthly interest only payments of $40,000 and matured in June 2001. The note was extended until November 2001 with a $750,000 loan principal paydown. With this paydown, the note was renegotiated to replace the existing collateral with new collateral consisting of a 120,000 sq. ft. office building and industrial warehouse in Carrollton, Texas. The note bore interest at 16.0% per annum, required monthly payments of interest only and matured in May 2002. In July 2002, the note was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In October 2001, TCI funded a $4.0 million loan secured by a 375,152 sq.ft. office building in St. Louis, Missouri. The note receivable bore interest at 9.0% per annum, required monthly interest only payments of $30,000 and matured in February 2002. In February 2002, TCI extended the loan maturity to February 2003. In August 2002, the note was paid off including accrued but unpaid interest.
In January 2002, TCI purchased 100% of the outstanding common shares of ART Two Hickory Corporation (“Two Hickory”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARI, a related party, for $4.4 million cash. Two Hickory owns the 96,217 sq. ft. Two Hickory Centre Office Building in Farmers Branch, Texas. ARI has guaranteed that the asset shall produce at least a 12% annual return of the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the asset fails to produce the 12% annual return, ARI shall pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the asset fails to produce the 12% return for a calendar year and ARI fails to pay the shortfall, TCI may require ARI to repurchase the shares of Two Hickory for the purchase price. Because ARI has guaranteed the 12% return and TCI has the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, management has classified this related party transaction as a note receivable from ARI. In June 2002, the asset was refinanced. TCI received $1.3 million of the proceeds as a principal reduction on its note receivable from ARI.
Also in January 2002, a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $608,000 was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest. With the payoff of the note, TCI recognized a previously deferred gain on the sale of the property of $608,000.
In March 2002, TCI sold the 174,513 sq.ft. Hartford Office Building in Dallas, Texas, for $4.0 million and provided the $4.0 million purchase price as seller financing and an additional $1.4 million line of credit for leasehold improvements in the form of a first lien mortgage note. The note bears interest at a variable interest rate, currently 6.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments of $14,667 and matures in March 2007. As of February 2004, TCI has funded $323,000 of the additional line of credit.
In April 2002, TCI purchased 100% of the following entities: ART One Hickory Corporation (“One Hickory”), Garden Confederate Point, LP (“Confederate Point”), Garden Foxwood, LP (“Foxwood”), and Garden Woodsong, LP (“Woodsong”), all wholly-owned subsidiaries of ARI, a related party, for $10.0 million. One Hickory owns the 120,615 sq. ft. One Hickory Centre Office Building in Farmers Branch, Texas. Confederate Point owns the 206 unit Confederate Apartments in Jacksonville, Florida. Foxwood owns the 220 unit Foxwood Apartments in Memphis, Tennessee. Woodsong owned the 190 unit Woodsong Apartments in
Smyrna, Georgia. ARI has guaranteed that these assets shall produce at least a 12% return annually of the purchase price for a period of three years from the purchase date. If the assets fail to produce the 12% return, ARI shall pay TCI any shortfall. In addition, if the assets fail to produce the 12% return for a calendar year and ARI fails to pay the shortfall, TCI may require ARI to repurchase the entities for the purchase price. Because ARI has guaranteed the 12% return and TCI has the option of requiring ARI to repurchase the entities, management has classified this related party transaction as a note receivable from ARI. In October 2003, TCI sold One Hickory to IORI for a $12.2 million, less prorations, for a wrap-round promissory note of $12.0 million. This note bears interest at 5.49% interest, requires monthly interest and principal payments and mature in June 2006. This transaction effectively discharged the note receivable TCI had from ARI for the financing of One Hickory. Also, in November 2003, Confederate Point sold the Confederate Apartments and paid $2.1 million to TCI to pay off the loan and accrued but unpaid interest.
Also in April 2002, a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $155,000 was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In July 2002, a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $2.2 million was paid off, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In July 2002, the Woodsong Apartments were sold. ARI received $2.6 million from the proceeds as payment of principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the note receivable. The funds were received by ARI and the affiliate receivable balance was increased.
In July 2002, TCI entered into an agreement to fund up to $300,000 under a revolving line of credit secured by 100% interest in a partnership of the borrower. The line of credit bears interest at 12.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matures in June 2005. As of March 2004, TCI has funded all $300,000 of the line of credit.
In September 2002, TCI sold a 36 acre tract of the Palm Desert land parcel for $3.6 million and provided $2.7 million as seller financing in the form of a first lien mortgage note. The note bears interest at 8.0% per annum, requires quarterly interest only payments of $54,000 and matures in September 2004. In March 2003, the note was sold to a financial institution for $2.6 million.
In June 2003, TCI sold the 104 unit Willow Wick Apartments in North Augusta, South Carolina, for $2.7 million and provided $42,000 of the purchaser’s closing costs as seller financing. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 5% and requires all interest and principal payments be paid at maturity on December 2003. This loan was extended until February 2004 and $10,000 was received in March 2004. Current negotiations are ongoing to extend the loan or collect payment.
In December 2003, TCI purchased a note receivable secured by 33 acres of raw land in Travis County, Texas from ARI for $2.4 million, which reduced ARI’s affiliate payable to Prime and TCI. The note bears interest at 10% per annum, requires interest only payments beginning in November 2007 and matures in October 2008.
Partnership mortgage loans. TCI owns a 60% general partner interest and IORI owns a 40% general partner interest in Nakash Income Associates (“NIA”), which owns a wraparound mortgage note receivable secured by a building occupied by a Wal-Mart in Maulden, Missouri.
