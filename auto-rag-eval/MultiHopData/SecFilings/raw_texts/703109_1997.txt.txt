Drovers Bancshares Corporation manages the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio through various control processes. Risk is further controlled through the application of lending procedures such as the holding of adequate collateral, contractual guarantees, and compensating balances.
Management also considers the amount of recent and expected charge-offs, the loan portfolio mix and changes in the economy when determining the provision for loan losses. Management believes these procedures provide adequate assurance against losses and the level of the Reserve for Loan Losses is sufficient to meet any present or potential risks.
