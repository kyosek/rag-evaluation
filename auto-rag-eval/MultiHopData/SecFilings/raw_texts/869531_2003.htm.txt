Item 2. Our Properties
(a) The Cangalli Properties.
In October 1995, we began reviewing potential mining opportunities in Bolivia. Thereafter, we conducted a site visit to the Tipuani Gold Mining District (approximately 62 miles north of the Bolivian capital of La Paz). Our representatives traveled to the town of Cangalli, approximately two kilometers down river from the town of Tipuani, a well-known gold mining center in Bolivia. We hired an independent geologist to evaluate the Cangalli area. This geologist reported that the area merited further study and was highly prospective for sizeable gold deposits.
(b) Contract for Exploration and Mining on the Cangalli Properties.
Based on this favorable report, along with other pre-existing reports on the Tipuani/Cangalli area, in January 1996 (through one of our subsidiaries) we entered into an agreement with United Cangalli Gold Mining Cooperative, Ltd. (“UCL”), a Bolivian cooperative consisting of 118 members. We operated under this contract from the date of its signing through July 2, 2002.
(c) Purchase of the Cangalli Properties from UCL.
On July 2, 2002, we purchased 100% of all right, title and interest in and to the mining concessions comprising the Cangalli properties. We actually ended up purchasing 5,125 acres. This purchase completely freed our Cangalli properties from any royalty whatsoever. We paid $300,000 in cash, 3,944,500 shares of Golden Eagle’s restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share, and assumed $175,000 of UCL’s existing debt payable by us over the course of 4 years to complete the purchase. The UCL debt has now been paid down to $93,871. These shares were issued for investment purposes pursuant to exemptions from registration found in Sections 4(2) and 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation S.
We also agreed in a separate lease agreement to lease the use of the 1,000-foot deep Cangalli shaft back to the UCL for a period of 99 years, with a 10% gross royalty on gold production back to Golden Eagle, so that the UCL members not working for us could remain involved in gold mining in their own community.
The UCL leadership distributed 35,000 shares of our common stock to each Coop member. This distribution was accomplished pursuant to the provisions of Regulation S, which allows offshore distributions to those who are non-residents of the United States, and which prevents the shares from flowing back into the United States markets for at least one year. After the expiration of the one-year holding period, the shares may only be traded in the United States markets pursuant to the requirements of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. During 2003, an additional 133,000 shares of Golden Eagle stock valued at $22,610 were issued to UCL members to satisfy additional claims.
Golden Eagle paid one-time transfer taxes of $9,000 in the purchase. We also pay $2,075 per year to the Bolivian government in mining patent (concession) fees. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation to be able to maintain our rights over these properties in perpetuity.
(d) The Tipuani Properties.
In November 1999 and October 2000, we acquired four mining claims in the Tipuani Gold Mining District, surrounding our Cangalli properties, 62 miles north of La Paz, Bolivia, with a total acreage of approximately 69,000 acres. Our geological reconnaissance studies indicated that these properties were highly prospective for gold deposits similar to that found on the Cangalli Properties. In exchange we committed to pay to the Bolivian government annual fees of $27,825. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation to be able to maintain our rights over these properties in perpetuity.
Subsequent to the 2003 year-end, Golden Eagle announced that as a result of geological reconnaissance work further identifying and mapping the gold bearing conglomerate material in the paleochannel of the ancient Tipuani River basin, we have reduced our landholdings in the Tipuani Gold District from 74,000 acres (116 square miles) to 49,000 acres (77 square miles). Concession patent fees were considerably reduced, however we do not believe that any decrease has resulted from its original expectations of mineralized material on its properties. We now have a more focused approach to its exploration activities in the paystreaks in the paleochannel found on its gold concessions in the area.
We received an investment of $1.3 million in early 2002 to initiate a scaled-down version (1,000 tonnes per day) of Dr. Ronald L Atwood’s projected plant, and to build out our interior mine infrastructure. On September 30, 2002, we commenced operations at our Cangalli gold mine at the rate of 1,000 tonnes per day from our open pit operation. By November, we had increased our production capacity to 2,000 tonnes per day. By the end of the fourth quarter, December 31, 2002, we had processed 92,700 tonnes of ore, and had recovered 43,847 grams, or 1,410 troy ounces, of gold.
On February 10, 2003, we announced the conversion from our open pit operations to more cost-effective underground block caving from our interior mine while maintaining a production capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day.
During the second quarter of 2003, we received the necessary funding in the amount of approximately $600,000 to expand our production capacity from 2,000 tonnes per day to 3,500 tonnes per day. In July 2003, we completed construction of our 3,500 tonne per day plant and began processing material at an increased rate. We have projected that once we have reached 3,500 tonnes per day on a sustained basis, our Cangalli gold operation will reach and surpass the break even point, and will enter into a sustained positive cash flow. While we have reached full capacity of 3,500 tonnes per day on a limited basis, we have been unable to continue to produce at that level as a result of weather delays during the fourth quarter of 2003 and subsequently. We did experience production delays during the first and fourth quarters of 2003 due to the rainy season in Bolivia as sterile waste material washed into our open pit operations.
(e) History of the Cangalli and the Tipuani Gold Mining District of Bolivia
Gold mining in the Tipuani Gold Mining District, in which the Cangalli and Tipuani properties are found, can be traced back to pre-Inca times (1000 to 1500 A.D.). During the Inca dominion, natives worked gold placers in the Tipuani River and her tributary rivers, the Ancoma and Yani, and also in the gold-bearing quartz veins of the Cordillera (in the high Andes mountains).
Early Spanish historians recorded that the province of Larecaja, in which the Tipuani Gold Mining District is located, contributed about 126 kg of gold per year to the Inca Emperor at Illabaya. For this and other purposes, the Incan natives constructed a network of roads in Bolivia and Peru, some of which are still in use today.
During the Spanish rule, after the “Conquest”, the Indians stopped all mining. They destroyed roads, blocked entrances to the mines, and established a death penalty for those disclosing to the conquerors the whereabouts of any mining centers.
After many hardships and loss of life, the Spaniards re-started their mining attempts from 1562 to 1566 at Roman Playa on the Tipuani River. Great amounts of gold were produced. The use of iron tools and gunpowder for mining was inaugurated about 1571. In 1602, the Spaniards reached the site where the town of Tipuani now stands (2 km upriver from Cangalli). For the first time, they met Portuguese expeditions in search of gold advancing up the Amazon tributaries from Brazil. During the years thereafter, several pitched battles were waged over these goldfields between the Spanish and Portuguese, and one was fought on the current site of the Cangalli Township. In 1620, workers were imported from Brazil into the Bolivian goldfields as large fortunes were being made with great success. In 1780, the revolt of mitayos, or slave workers, stopped the mining in the area for a few years.
In 1782, a miner named Rodriguez and the two Novos brothers successfully worked the Tipuani River terraces. Andres Coll and Idelfonso Villamil Blanco, and their descendants, worked in the area until 1867. Villamil was the first to exploit the rich lower terraces and river gravels below water level. Also during this period, several foreign-based companies arrived from Great Britain, the United States, Germany, and other countries.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Bolivian Gold Exploration Company (BOLGO) introduced the first methods of mechanized work. Acting as a modern large enterprise, BOLGO leased its large concessions to the Companie Aramayo de Mines en Bolivia in 1932, which in turn spent a lot of time, money and energy to efficiently mine the gold deposits in their concessions. They were the first to sink deep shafts into the Cangalli conglomerate to work the terraces in Unutuluni, some 15 km (9 mi) upriver from the town of Tipuani.
In 1952, the Bolivian government nationalized all of the BOLGO and Aramayo concessions. The government administered these properties through the Bolivian Miners’ Bank, which leased them to the Federation of Mining Cooperatives. This group preferred to work the river gravels using small vertical shafts and adits to make contact with the bedrock, even beneath the river itself. Some of the upper terraces were also worked by the cooperatives by booming and sluicing when sufficient water was available.
In 1956, a North American company, South American Placers, Inc. (“SAPI”), obtained large concessions in the lower Tipuani, Challana, Mapiri, Coroico, and Kaka Rivers. It began dredging at Teoponte on the Kaka River in 1959, and continued working successfully for nearly 30 years. This SAPI dredge set records for gold production for day, month and year during its active work period at the mouth of the Tipuani River. In the 1960‘s, the Tidewater Co. and Condor Mining, Inc. entered the same areas with some success.
Due to the perceived near-exhaustion of the best-known deposits of river gravels, many people have abandoned the Tipuani area. Lately, others have been trying to work the remaining river areas and terraces, while making some technical improvements such as deeper shafts and better underground workings.
Historical sources have estimated that the total production of gold from the Tipuani District may reach figures close to 200 tonnes of gold for each of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. It was near 200 tonnes for the 19th century and about 500 tonnes for the 20th century. For its known history of almost 1,000 years of mining, according to these historical sources, the Tipuani District may have produced no less than 1,000 metric tonnes of gold, or more than 32 million troy ounces. Based on information from Aramayo Company records from the 1930s and 1940s, the ore grades mined were usually very high, from a few grams to many troy ounces of gold per tonne.
(f) Cangalli Reserves
On February 24, 2004, we announced that we had estimated proven and probable gold reserves on our Cangalli mining concessions located in the Tipuani Gold District of western Bolivia. Those reserves were estimated in a report (the “reserve report”) dated February 2004, by Carlos Thompson, Reg. Eng., an independent economic geologist and consultant, as well as Giovanni Viscarra, Reg. Eng., a geologist and Golden Eagle’s Cangalli mine superintendent. The report states that the reserves were estimated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Guides for the Preparation of Registration Statements and with the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration’s “Guide for Reporting Exploration Information, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves” dated March 1, 1999. In preparing the reserve report and estimated mineral reserves, Mr. Thompson was acting as a consultant to Golden Eagle, and Mr. Viscarra was acting as an employee of Golden Eagle’s operating subsidiary. Messrs. Thompson and Viscarra have consented to the public release of the information contained in this Form 10-K and the accompanying financial statements with them.
Based on the reserve report, we estimated the following:

As used in the preceding table,
proven (or measured) reserves are reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well-established; and
probable (or indicated) reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
The in-place proven and probable gold reserves total an in situ metal quantity of 13,800 troy ounces. As stated in the reserve report, mining losses are estimated to be approximately 5%, and metallurgical losses are also estimated to be 5%, qualifying the in-place reserves pursuant to Industry Guide 7, and decreasing the quantity of metal to 12,420 troy ounces recoverable.
Golden Eagle’s Cangalli mining concessions in the Tipuani Gold District are found in the middle of a geological formation known as the Apollo-Caranavi Trench in a valley formed by the Tipuani River and its tributaries. The bedrock is undifferentiated Ordovician shales, covered by the Cangalli formation of conglomerates of the Late Tertiary age. Since the Quaternary, the Tipuani River has been creating its present course, mainly by cutting the conglomerates and re-concentrating the gold found in those conglomerates.
The stated scope of the reserve report was to report on a sampling program carried out over the course of three months at the end of 2003, and during the month of January 2004, on a 3.68-hectare (9.1 acre) recent Quaternary alluvial terrace deposited by the Tipuani River. This sampling program took place in the current open pit, and the surrounding undisturbed area, in which Golden Eagle is now mining.
The reserve report also reported on a sampling program in outcropping paystreaks, or horizontal bedded layers within the cemented conglomerate. These gold bearing paystreaks, or horizontal beds, also were sampled in Golden Eagle’s underground mine which penetrates over 330 meters (1,086 feet) into the conglomerate material at our Cueva Playa site. This underground mine has contributed ore to the Cueva Playa gold recovery plant through a mining method known as conal subsidence block caving. This mining technique opens draw points under the conglomerate and allows the ore to cave, or subside, to the draw points for extraction and processing. Our studies have shown that the bedded paystreaks contain a higher gold grade per tonne of ore, we have elected to focus our attention on the development of a more targeted mine plan. The technique that is being implemented is known as targeted planar subsidence (TPS), in which the paystreaks will be mined along their plane. Initially, this mining will take place along a 25-meter work face, and as the work face advances, the roof behind will be allowed to collapse, or subside, in a controlled manner similar to longwalling now being used in the coal industry.
Based on the reserve report, Golden Eagle proposes to develop the proven and probable open pit reserves in its ongoing operation, mining at a rate of 3,000 tonnes per day. With respect to our underground operation, we expect to mine and process 375 tonnes per day during the second quarter 2004 from our projected mining technique focused on our higher-grade paystreaks. Golden Eagle expects to process and recover all of the gold from both the open pit and underground mine through our existing plant.
Golden Eagle estimates that no further investment will be necessary to process and mine the proven and probable gold reserves in the open pit due to the fact that we are currently in operation there and have the required equipment. However, the underground operation was estimated in the report to require a $500,000 investment to build out the infrastructure to implement the projected mining method. We have already invested $400,000 of that requirement, which we received from accredited investors, or from our current operations in Cangalli. We do not foresee any obstacle to raising the additional $100,000 to finish the underground build out. Even though we are in production, as we have reported in our required reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we continue to have working capital shortages and cash flow difficulties that we are striving to remedy.
The reserve report discussed here is based on a number of assumptions, and its conclusions are sensitive to the world market for gold. According to the reserve report, the authors assumed a gold price per troy ounce of $360 based on a two-year historical average price. That price is less than the current price at the time of the filing of this report of approximately $400 per troy ounce of gold.
Among the other assumptions set forth in the reserve report is the fact that the geological and economic cutoff grades for gold is set at 0.2 grams per tonne in the open pit, and 0.66 grams per tonne in the underground mine, which are very sensitive to the price of gold. The report also assumes continued political and labor stability in Bolivia and the Cangalli area.
Golden Eagle has received all of it permits to operate in Cangalli regarding the environment, the use and transport of explosives, forestry issues and the use and transport of controlled substances in the mining industry. Golden Eagle also believes that it will be able to comply in the future with all requirements in those governmental permits, particularly for environmental protection and worker health and safety.
(g) The Precambrian Properties
In June of 2001, we acquired four mining claims in Bolivia’s Precambrian Shield with a total acreage of approximately 125,000 acres, as well as the existing reports on the area, for 10 million shares of our common restricted stock valued at $300,000 ($0.03 per share). These shares were issued for investment purposes pursuant to exemptions from registration found in Sections 4(2) and 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Regulation S. The size of our landholding in the Precambrian Shield of Bolivia has decreased and increased as we have reduced the size of our concessions with the Bolivian government, and as we have acquired new properties.
We pay $54,600 per year to the Bolivian government in mining patent fees for our Precambrian Properties. Pursuant to the Bolivian Mining Code, these annual government claims fees are our only obligation we have to be able to maintain our rights over these properties in perpetuity.
These properties were explored by our geologists and were found to be highly prospective for extensive near surface gold mineralization and deeper mineralized volcanogenic massive sulphides (“VMS”) systems potentially containing gold and copper.
(h) Buen Futuro
Golden Eagle announced May 30, 2003, that it signed a Letter of Intent to acquire 100% of the Buen Futuro mining claim located squarely in the heart of Golden Eagle’s 125,000-acre landholding in the Precambrian Shield 162 miles north of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and 11 miles east of the town of Ascension de Guarayos. The Buen Futuro claim consists of 2,500 acres and contains three well-identified gold/copper ore bodies. These ore bodies are found in an oxide zone 130 to 200 feet thick, as well as a supergene copper-enriched zone extending from the oxide zone to a depth of 320 feet, sitting on top of strata-bound volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralization. Golden Eagle exercised its rights to purchase the Buen Futuro property in June 2003. A private contract, as well as a recorded public contract, were signed and filed with the Superintendency of Mines of the Department of Santa Cruz on December 12, 2003.
We believe that the Buen Futuro gold/copper deposits, surrounded by Golden Eagle’s claims, are just part of a much larger trend of VMS clusters than runs both north and south onto Golden Eagle’s 125,000 acres. Dr. Michael H. Biste, a well-known geologist who is an expert on Bolivia’s Precambrian Shield, carried out exploration work over a 10-year period that identified two sizeable additional VMS exploration targets on Buen Futuro and three more similar targets on our concessions. However, this series of exploration targets, which we have characterized as the “Ascension Gold-Copper Trend,” is identifiable on Golden Eagle’s property for at least 10 miles.
We project that this acquisition, and our current landholding in the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend, provide us with several important opportunities for future development. Nevertheless, these opportunities would be contingent upon our ability to raise the needed development capital either through operations, equity funding, debt financing or by entering into joint venture relationships.
Golden Eagle purchased the Buen Futuro concession from Celia Calla de Arraya, a Bolivian, who is the mother in law of Dr. Michael H. Biste, in June 2003, with subsequent contractual amendments in December of 2003, in exchange for a 3% net smelter return, payments of $50,000 cash and shares of restricted Golden Eagle common stock valued at $75,000, and a promise to make the following additional payments:
Cash Shares (Value)
March 2005 $100,000 $25,000
September 2005 $100,000 $75,000
The Buen Futuro VMS mineralization was initially identified ten years ago by Dr. Biste through geochemical surveys, and subsequently confirmed using Induced Polarization (IP), and Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys. Eventually, between 1993 and 1997, 800 miles of exploration trails were cut through the jungle to take a total of 21,000 samples on the Buen Futuro and surrounding areas. A total of 8,400 feet of auger drilling was performed initially, with 11,000 feet of additional reverse circulation drilling and 27,000 feet of diamond core drilling. A total of 8 miles of trenches were dug and 5,500 trench samples were taken and analyzed.
Under the agreement with Mrs. Calla de Arraya and Dr. Biste, Golden Eagle undertook several obligations. These obligations included:
Our agreement to maintain an exploration program to replace mineral reserves as they are depleted through mining as long as the potential for feasible mineral reserves continues on the ore deposits found within the Buen Futuro concession.
Our agreement to invest $1 million in exploration by the end of June 2006. Golden Eagle has expended approximately $75,000 to date and (subject to financing) it expects to meet that commitment by the end of 2004.
Our agreement to enter into mineral production on the Buen Futuro concession by May 23, 2005, and to expend a minimum of $2,000,000 to initiate that production. To date, Golden Eagle has not met this commitment, and its ability to do so will be dependent on additional financing.
There are no stated penalties for failure to comply with these commitments, but we intend to use our best efforts to comply. The initial build out of the gold plant and other infrastructure improvements will require a capital investment of about $6,000,000.
(i) Cobra Claim
On December 22, 2003, we announced that we had completed the highly strategic acquisition of the Cobra claim, an additional 22,500 acres of prime ground in the Ascension Gold-Copper Trend in eastern Bolivia’s Precambrian Shield. The Cobra claim has proven positive for volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”) deposits containing gold and copper, as well as near-surface gold oxide deposits. Induced polarization (IP) and Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys, as well as scout auger drilling, have yielded positive results in an area extending to the northeast of Golden Eagle’s current 127,500-acre landholding.
Golden Eagle secured the Cobra claim through a Bolivian mining petition and only had to pay initial claims fees of $10,000. To maintain the property in perpetuity, Golden Eagle must pay annual concession patent fees to the Bolivian government of $9,000.
(j) Buen Futuro Reserves
Subsequent to our 2003 year-end, we estimated proven and probable gold reserves, and proven and probable copper reserves, on our Buen Futuro mining concession located in the Precambrian Shield of eastern Bolivia. Those reserves were estimated by Michael H. Biste, Ph.D, an independent economic geologist and consultant in a report dated February 2004. The report states that the reserves were estimated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Guides for the Preparation of Registration Statements and with the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration’s “Guide for Reporting Exploration Information, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves” dated March 1, 1999. In preparing the reserve report and estimated mineral reserves, Dr. Biste was acting as a consultant to Golden Eagle. Golden Eagle acquired the Buen Futuro property and related information from an unrelated Bolivian national in June 2003. At the time, Golden Eagle entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Biste by which Golden Eagle has paid him $3,000 per month and Golden Eagle common stock with a value of $2,000 per month. Dr. Biste has consented to the public release of the information contained in this Form 10-K.
Dr. Biste stated that the scope of his report was a recompilation of pertinent geological and sampling data obtained from mineral exploration on the Buen Futuro property since 1993, including trench, auger, diamond, and reverse circulation drilling performed under his supervision from 1993 through 1998. According to Dr. Biste’s report, the exploration work and his analysis indicates that three individual massive sulfide lenses exist in an area on the Buen Futuro prospect consisting of 0.7 by 1.0 kilometer in two different stratigraphic levels. Dr. Biste also determined that the primary sulfide mineralization consists mainly of chalcopyrite, pyrite, and minor amounts of sphalerite and galena. Dr. Biste identified a 45-meter thick chalcocite supergene blanket and a 40-meter thick oxide zone that overlie the primary mineralization. He found that gold is enriched in the oxide and copper in the supergene zone where base metals (such as lead and zinc) are leached out. There has not been any mineral production from the Buen Futuro concession to date.

(35.6 million pounds)
As used in the preceding table,
proven (or measured) reserves are reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well-established; and
probable (or indicated) reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
The in-place proven and probable oxide gold reserves total 2,528,000 tonnes @ 1.03 g/t gold, giving an in situ metal quantity of 83,715 troy ounces. As stated in the report by Dr. Biste, mining method losses are estimated to be negligible, however, metallurgical testing indicates a 4% recovery loss should be expected, which in any event is extremely low, qualifying the in-place reserves pursuant to Industry Guide 7, and decreasing the number to 80,366 troy ounces recoverable.
The in-place proven and probable supergene copper reserves total 2,162,000 tonnes @ 1.72% copper giving an in situ metal quantity of 37,186 tonnes (82 million pounds) of copper. Again, the mining method losses are estimated to be low compared to actual block ore estimates, however, the metallurgical losses are estimated to be in the range of 13%, qualifying the in-place reserves pursuant to Industry Guide 7, and decreasing the number to 32,352 tonnes (71 million pounds) recoverable.
The Buen Futuro mining concession is located 280 kilometers north of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and 18 kilometers east of the township of Ascension de Guarayos. It consists of a single claim of 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) in size. Golden Eagle also owns six contiguous claims in the area consisting of 55,420 hectares (136,500 acres).
Based on Dr. Biste’s report, Golden Eagle proposes to develop the proven and probable reserves in three open pit mines beginning at 7,733 tonnes per day, and ultimately mining 22,000 tonnes per day of gold ore, copper ore and waste. Golden Eagle expects to recover the gold through cyanide leaching in a CIP circuit, and the copper through leaching and solvent extraction, both metals will then be electro-won, all of which is permissible under Golden Eagle’s anticipated permits.
The initial build out of the gold plant and other infrastructure improvements will require a capital investment of about $6,000,000. Golden Eagle estimates that more than $12,000,000 will be necessary for construction of the copper plant and mining expansion. At the present time, Golden Eagle does not have the funds necessary to commence the plant construction on the Buen Futuro property, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such funds on reasonable terms. Golden Eagle is considering a number of alternatives to obtain the necessary funding, including entering into a joint venture with an industry partner or other experienced persons who wish to participate in a high-risk mining venture, or seeking other forms of debt or equity capital. As stated in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Golden Eagle has working capital shortages and cash flow difficulties.
Dr. Biste’s report is based on a number of assumptions, and his conclusions are sensitive to the world market for copper and gold. According to his report, he has assumed a gold price per troy ounce of $360 and a copper price per pound of $0.80. These prices are less than the current prices of approximately $400 per troy ounce of gold and $1.30 per pound of copper.
Among the other assumptions set forth in Dr. Biste’s report are that the geological and economic cutoff grades for gold is 0.2 grams per tonne, and for copper is 0.2%, and continued political and labor stability in Bolivia and the Buen Futuro area.
Based on advice from its counsel in Bolivia, Golden Eagle has received, or reasonably anticipates that it will receive, all required governmental permits for the continuation of exploration and the commencement of development and mining operations on the Buen Futuro prospect. Golden Eagle also believes that it will be able to comply with all requirements it expects to be contained in the governmental permits for environmental protection and worker health and safety.

This suite of offices consists of four executive offices, reception space, filing areas and copy and faxing facilities. We pay $1,920 per month on a one-year, renewable lease that expired in November 2003. We currently lease the offices on a month-to-month basis for the same rate.
In June 2003, we entered into a two-year office lease at Av. 16 de Julio, No. 1525, Edif. Mutual La Paz Penthouse in La Paz, Bolivia. These offices are in the heart of the La Paz business district in the city center and consist of 2,500 square feet at a cost of $1,700 per month, with no escalation during the term of the lease.
Golden Eagle’s operating subsidiary, GEII Bolivia, owns the mining and processing equipment which is located on the Cangalli properties under its control, or at its warehouse in El Alto, Bolivia, 15 kilometers from its La Paz offices. This equipment includes heavy earthmoving equipment and general support equipment for the mining industry. In addition, GEII Bolivia owns equipment acquired from UCL, which includes one Caterpillar 933 front-end loader, real property in proximity to the Cangalli shaft, as well as the dwellings found thereon, two warehouses, the mine shaft head frame, a mine hoist, assorted pumps, an electric generating set, all electrical installations, an inventory of parts, assorted tools, mine rail and cars, two double-deck shaker screens, and various other pieces of mining equipment. GEII Bolivia also owns various support vehicles and trucks. We believe that all of this equipment and the vehicles are in good condition, suitable for use in our mining operations.
