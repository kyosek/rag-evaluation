ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The MOB Properties consist of 21 high quality MOBs directly owned by the Company, three MOBs indirectly-owned by the Company, an adjacent parking facility and two retail facilities. The ALF and SNF Properties consist of five ALFs, seven SNFs, one hospital and two senior resident apartment complexes. As of January 31, 2001, the MOB Properties were 95.7% leased to over 425 tenants and the ALF and SNF Properties were 100% leased to operators or under contracts with management companies. The Company's MOB tenants are primarily established medical practitioners representing a cross section of medical practices.
Description of the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties
MOB Properties
The Company, through its MOB operations, acquires, develops, manages and leases MOBs, a parking facility and two retail facilities. Developing and managing MOBs differs from developing and managing conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of physicians and their patients. Because doctors now perform a variety of medical procedures in their offices, many MOBs have become sophisticated ambulatory centers that allow for outpatient surgery and procedures. In addition, MOBs generally have higher maintenance requirements in the public areas due to heavy foot traffic, many short appointments that increase demand on parking facilities, the use of sophisticated medical equipment requiring increased plumbing and electrical capacity and expanded environmental regulations that impose more stringent restrictions on the disposal of medical waste. The management of MOBs also generally requires experience in specialized tenant improvements and higher levels of responsiveness required by medical practitioners. Additional important management functions include the placement of tenants to accommodate increased space needs and managing the tenant mix at properties to facilitate referrals by practitioners with different specialties within the building. The Company stresses meeting these and other special demands of MOB tenants.
ALF and SNF Properties
The Company, as part of its overall strategy, acquires, develops and leases ALFs and SNFs. The Company leases its ALFs and SNFs to third party senior care operators. The operation of ALFs and SNFs requires a high level of experience and expertise due to the specific needs of the residents and the complex administrative functions surrounding the admission and care of residents and the administering of government programs. The operators of ALFs and SNFs must also maintain a positive relationship with local hospitals and other medical providers in order to attract new residents. The Company considers all of the above factors when leasing its facilities to third party operators or hiring managers to operate its facilities.
The health care industry is facing various challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure to reduce medical delivery costs. Substantially all of the Company's tenants are in the medical profession and could be or have been adversely affected by the new Medicare prospective payment system, cost containment and other health care reform proposals. In the past twelve months, the Company has changed managers at two of its ALFs and six of its SNFs in response to financial difficulties encountered by the managers or dissatisfaction with the operating results of the managers. Any future proposals that limit access to medical care or reduce reimbursement for physicians' services may also impact the ability of the Company's tenants to pay rent. However, the Company believes that the aging population in the United States, combined with other recent trends in the health care industry, such as the performance of non-acute procedures outside of hospitals, could spur increased demand for space in full service MOBs that contain surgery centers and out-patient facilities, such as those owned by the Company.
The following tables set forth certain information regarding each of the .OB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties as of January 31, 2001. All of the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties are held in fee by the Company or, in the case of jointly-owned properties, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company.

Leases
MOB Properties
As of January 31, 2001, the MOB Properties were approximately 95.7% leased. New leases and extensions are normally granted for a minimum of three to five years and provide for annual rent increases.

The Company was successful in obtaining lease renewals, achieving a weighted average renewal rate of approximately 85.2% on MOB leases that expired during 2000. Although there can be no assurance that this renewal level will be maintained, the Company believes this high renewal rate is due in part to the tendency of medical practitioners to continue to practice in the same space over a number of years. Also, the Company's tenants frequently invest large sums of money in equipment and fixtures for their offices. Furthermore, relocating a doctor's office can be disruptive to the patients who are familiar with the doctor's office location.
The following table sets forth the scheduled annual rent increases for the leases with respect to the MOB Properties in effect at January 31, 2001.

Senior Care Loans
Lending Operations
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had ten loans outstanding that total approximately $16.7 million before reserves of $5.5 million. The ten loans are described in the following paragraphs.
In October 1999, the Company provided $1.65 million of bridge financing for a $9.0 million apartment complex located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The apartment complex was purchased by G&L Realty Partners, LLC ("G&L Partners"), a company controlled by Joe Carroll, a former Company employee, in which the Company has no equity interest. G&L Partners sold the apartment complex in December 1999 through a tax-exempt bond offering to NVHF Park Chase, LLC ("NVHF"), a not-for-profit company. As part of its loan repayment, the Company received approximately $380,000 in cash. For the remaining balance, the Company received $1.26 million in tax-exempt, subordinated B-bonds from the offering. The tax-exempt bonds are due in December 2029 and bear interest at 8.75% per annum. In addition, the Company received a 10-year, 10%, $500,000 unsecured note from NVHF Affiliates, LLC, the parent company of NVHF. The Company is also the guarantor on a $500,000 letter of credit in favor of NVHF Affiliates, LLC.
On June 17, 1996, the Company funded a $6.1 million loan for the acquisition of a SNF in Hyattsville, Maryland (the "St. Thomas More facility") by Heritage Care, Inc. ("Heritage Care"), a non-profit corporation. The Company received a first deed of trust on that facility and Carroll Manor, Inc. ("Carroll Manor"), the seller, received a second deed of trust which secured its $500,000 loan to Heritage Care. In addition to the $6.1 million, the Company made additional advances in 1997, totaling $2.6 million, to enable Heritage Care to meet its payroll and other current expenses necessary to remain in operation and thereby protect the value of the Company's security interest in the St. Thomas More facility. On March 31, 1999, the Company refinanced the $6.1 million loan, the $2.6 million in additional advances and all accrued interest into a $7.3 million,10-year, 12% promissory note secured by a first deed of trust on the St. Thomas More facility and a $2.7 million, 10-year, 12% unsecured promissory note. In September 1999, the Company purchased the $500,000 second deed of trust from Carroll Manor for $503,000, including all unpaid interest and late fees. In December 1999, the Company consolidated the $7.3 million first deed of trust and the $500,000 second deed of trust into an $7.8 million promissory note with the same terms and conditions as the previous $7.3 million promissory note. Principal and interest payments on the $7.8 million and the $2.7 million promissory notes due monthly total $135,000. The facility is currently being operated by Future Care, an experienced Maryland operator of nursing homes.
In December 1997, the Company funded $4.6 million into an escrow, to be loaned to Aspen Paso Robles, Inc. ("Aspen") at the close of escrow. This loan was to be secured by (i) a 59-bed nursing and rehabilitation center in Chico, California; (ii) a 38-bed SNF in Paso Robles, California; and (iii) a 57-bed intermediate care center in Beaumont, California. The loan closed on February 25, 1998 although certain funds were held in escrow pending the close of the real estate in which the Chico and Beaumont facilities were located. The purchase of the Chico real estate subsequently closed. The funds for the Beaumont real estate remained in escrow until October 1998 at which time the Company secured the return of those funds and applied them to pay down the loan balance to $3.6 million. The borrower subsequently filed a Chapter 11 proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 1999, the remaining $3.6 million balance of the loan was in default and the two facilities securing the loan were closed. In March 2000, the Company obtained title to the two SNFs from the bankruptcy court. Because these two SNFs were not operating, the Company valued these two facilities at $1.2 million and an additional provision for doubtful notes receivable of $1.7 million was recorded. The Company is currently pursuing legal action against the borrower and other parties involved in the transaction in order to recover the remaining outstanding balance.
In addition to the notes on the Tulsa, St. Thomas More and Aspen facilities, the Company had five other loans outstanding at December 31, 2000, with an aggregate face value of $1.97 million, excluding approximately $0.1 million of additional accrued, unpaid interest. The following is a summary of the five other loans as of December 31, 2000:
. $675,000 note secured by a first deed of trust due June 30, 2001, interest payable monthly at a rate of 10% per annum.
. $150,000 note secured by second deed of trust, interest payable semiannually at a rate of 10.0% per annum. This note is currently in default.
. $44,000 unsecured promissory note due June 30, 1999, interest payable at 10.0% per annum. This amount is currently in default.
. $104,000 unsecured promissory note due July 1, 2000, interest payable at 10.0% per annum. This note is currently in default.
. $1,000,000 unsecured promissory note due September 1, 2000, interest payable at 10.0% per annum. This note is currently in default.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had reserves of $5.5 million for doubtful notes receivable. Management believes that $5.5 million is appropriate in relation to the status of the loans in the Company's portfolio as of March 24, 2001.
GLN
GLN was formed with Nomura Asset Capital Corp. ("Nomura") for the purpose of making short-term loans to third parties to purchase senior care facilities. Due to market conditions and other financial constraints, it does not appear likely that the Company or Nomura will use GLN to make future loans. As of December 31, 2000, GLN had one loan outstanding. In May 1997, GLN funded a secured loan of approximately $1.5 million to a limited partnership created to acquire a recreational vehicle ("RV") park in Florida for approximately $1.2 million. This loan bears interest at a rate of approximately 9.0% per annum and matured on May 1, 1999. The loan provided for monthly payments of interest only. As of December 31, 2000, the borrower was in default on the mortgage payments. Management is currently in the process of negotiating its exit strategy with the borrower with respect to this loan.
Insurance
The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties. There are certain types of losses that may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable; moreover, there can be no assurance that policies maintained by the Company will be adequate in the event of a loss. The Company carries earthquake and flood insurance for coverage of losses up to $35 million on the MOB Properties and the ALF and SNF Properties located in California and Arizona, which amount represents approximately 25% of the net book value of these properties. This coverage is subject to a 10% deductible up to the amount of insured loss. The ALF and SNF Properties located in Washington and Massachusetts do not carry earthquake or flood insurance. Thirty-two of the 45 properties directly or indirectly owned by the Company are located in Southern California, which has a history of seismic activity, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake that damaged the Holy Cross Medical Plaza property. Two ALF and SNF Properties owned by the Company are located in Phoenix, Arizona, in an area with a history of flood activity. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in, and anticipated earnings and cash flow from, a property.
