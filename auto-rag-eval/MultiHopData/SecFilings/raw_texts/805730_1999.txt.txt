Item 2 - Legal Proceedings," the Company has
incurred, and expects that it will continue to incur, significant costs for financial, advisory, legal, and other services. Through December 31, 1999, the Company had incurred approximately $4,548,000 of these related costs.
RESTRUCTURING
On March 18, 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company's plan to restructure its internal operations to outsource its property management function to third-party providers. The Company estimated and recorded in the first quarter of 1999 a restructuring charge of $1,500,000. This outsourcing is expected to benefit the Company in several ways. First, it enables the Company to more efficiently enter and exit selected markets and assets as opportunities present themselves. This ability is key to the Company's focus on maximizing the return on invested capital. Second, it allows the Company to establish strategic relationships with national property management companies as well as local providers. These relationships should benefit the Company with increased opportunities and improved services. Third, it allows the management team to focus more time on value-added activities that should help to improve the Company's financial position. The outsourcing resulted in an approximately 26% reduction in the Company's workforce and the closure of three of its property management offices. The anticipated monthly recurring costs of outsourcing to third-party providers are estimated to be approximately the same as the current recurring internal costs ($250,000).
The restructuring charge is primarily attributable to personnel related costs for the employees subject to the restructuring and the costs associated with reducing and eliminating offices, furniture and equipment. The personnel related costs include severance benefits, the Company's portion of related payroll taxes, insurance and 401(k) plan contributions. During the week of March 22, 1999, all 37 employees in the Company's property management department were notified of the terms of their benefits package. The personnel costs comprised approximately one-half ($750,000) of the total reserve.
The costs attributable to reducing and eliminating offices include lease termination fees, rental losses for vacated office spaces (offset by sub-leases) and tenant improvements, and design fees attributable to abandoned office space. The costs attributable to reducing and eliminating offices comprised approximately one-third ($500,000) of the total reserve. The costs associated with reducing and eliminating furniture and equipment included the write-off of the net book value of the furniture and equipment for terminated employees to the extent that these assets could not be redeployed in other functional areas of the Company. The costs attributable to eliminating the furniture and equipment were approximately one-sixth ($250,000) of the total reserve.
During the quarter ended September 30, 1999, the Company completed the hiring of its third-party providers, its planned reduction in workforce, and the process of closing its property management offices. It was determined during the third quarter of 1999 that $120,000 of the reserve estimated for personnel related costs was not necessary due to certain personnel leaving prior to earning severance benefits and that $127,000 of the reserve estimated for the write-off of furniture and equipment was not necessary due to the redeployment of certain computers to other offices of the Company. In addition, it was determined that $100,000 of additional reserve was needed for office closures due to a change in the future value of sub-lease payments. As a result of these changes in estimates, the Company reallocated $100,000 of reserves from personnel related costs to office closures and reversed $147,000 of reserve during the quarter ended September 30, 1999. At December 31, 1999, the remaining reserve for personnel related costs ($10,000) represented funds needed for consultants hired to assist with the transition to third-party managers. At December 31, 1999, remaining reserve for office closures ($317,000) represented future obligated lease payments for corporate offices which were closed, offset by
future receipts for sub-leases entered into with the Company for the related closed office spaces (See Note 15). The following table reflects the composition of the Company's restructuring reserve, the expenditures applied against it, and the portion of the reserve that was reversed at December 31, 1999:
YEAR 2000 ISSUES
Although we have not experienced any material problems related to Year 2000 issues, we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues, which may disrupt our operations.
Year 2000 computer issues concern the inability of computer systems to accurately calculate, store, or use data after December 31, 1999. These computer issues may cause our computer systems, or those of our business partners, to process financial and operational information incorrectly. We have taken action over the past year to identify and correct these problems.
We believe that our internal systems were Year 2000 compliant at December 31, 1999 and, to date, we have not experienced any problems related to Year 2000 issues. It is possible, however, that we may experience delayed effects of Year 2000 issues in the next several months. We cannot assure that our operations have not been, or will not be affected by Year 2000 issues in a manner that has not become apparent to us or that may arise in the future. If our efforts or the efforts of our business partners failed to adequately address Year 2000 issues, we could incur costs to correct affected systems. While our Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve additional costs, we believe that these costs would not have a material impact on our financial results. The Company incurred third-party costs of approximately $50,000 related to Year 2000 issues.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
Substantially all of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in these operating expenses resulting from inflation to the extent that its properties are occupied. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and may, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate loans.
CERTAIN CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this Annual Report may be deemed to be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, the competitive environment in the retail industry, national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates and in the availability of debt and equity capital, the illiquidity of real estate investments in general, bankruptcy and financial condition of tenants, and environmental risks. Reference is made to FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND CERTAIN RISK FACTORS contained elsewhere in this 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these and other factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES OF MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of the GE and Union Bank Facilities used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company's real estate investment portfolio. From time to time, the Company replaces borrowings under its credit facilities with proceeds from the sale of Common Stock, the sale of assets, or proceeds from long-term fixed rate mortgages secured by the Company's real estate. The Company's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The definitive extent of the Company's interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and financing requirements. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.
The Company's interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. At December 31, 1999, the Company's long-term debt primarily consisted of fixed rate secured mortgage indebtedness, variable rate Construction Facilities, variable rate secured mortgage indebtedness, fixed rate lease obligations, and two variable rate credit facilities. The average interest rate on the $335,596,000 of secured mortgage indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 1999 was approximately 7.48%, with maturities at various dates through 2028. The fixed rate lease obligations are in connection with the historic portion of the Company's 1000 Van Ness project, and at December 31, 1999, the present value of the related minimum lease payments was approximately $15,067,000. The weighted average interest rate on the $48,220,000 of borrowings under the Construction Facilities at December 31, 1999 was approximately 7.69%, with maturities at various dates throughout 2000. The balance outstanding and interest rate on the variable secured indebtedness at December 31, 1999 were approximately $1,528,000 and 8.00%, respectively, and is scheduled to mature in 2017. The weighted average interest rate on the GE Facility at December 31, 1999 was approximately 8.30%. The GE Facility, with an outstanding balance at December 31, 1999 of approximately $138,420,000, matures in November 2000. There was no outstanding indebtedness under the Union Bank Facility at December 31, 1999. The carrying value of the GE and Union Bank Facilities, Construction Facilities, and variable rate secured mortgage loan at December 31, 1999 approximate their fair values.
The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average rates by year of maturity for the Company's debt at December 31, 1999 (dollars in thousands):
As the table incorporates only those exposures that exist at December 31, 1999, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Moreover, because future commitments are not presented in the table above, the information presented has limited predictive value. As a result, the Company's ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Company's hedging strategies at that time, and interest rates. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial statements. As noted in the table above, the Company had approximately $188,168,000 in variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 1999. Based on these year-end debt levels, a hypothetical 1.0% increase in interest rates would increase the Company's interest expense by approximately $1,882,000 on an annual basis, and likewise decrease earnings and cash flows. The Company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt, nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long-term debt will be available to the Company at favorable rates, if at all. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated changes discussed above.
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Burnham Pacific Properties, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a). These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Burnham Pacific Properties, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1999 Burnham Pacific Properties, Inc. adopted the provisions of Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities", and reported it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the 1999 consolidated financial statements.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION
Burnham Pacific Properties, Inc. (the "Company") is a real estate operating company which acquires, rehabilitates, develops and manages retail properties nationwide. On November 14, 1997, the Company formed Burnham Pacific Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and subsequently transferred to the Operating Partnership legal or beneficial ownership of substantially all of the real property and related personal property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and of the beneficial interest owned by the Company and its subsidiaries in any partnership or limited liability company that owns a direct or indirect interest in real property and related personal property. The Operating Partnership is the vehicle through which the Company owns its current properties, will make its future acquisitions, and generally conducts its business.
At December 31, 1999, the Company owns an approximately 86.9% economic interest in the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner.
The Company, primarily through the Operating Partnership and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, owns interests in 62 retail shopping centers, 61 of which were fully operational, and one of which is being developed. Forty-seven of the properties are located in California, nine in Washington, three in Oregon, two in New Mexico, and one in Utah. At December 31, 1999, the Company also owned two office/industrial properties located in Southern California. The Company has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership and their direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The 13.1% limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company is reflected in these financial statements as minority interest.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes have not been provided because the Company believes that it has met all requirements in 1999, 1998, and 1997 to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code, including the distribution of at least 95%
of ordinary taxable income to stockholders. Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes principally because of differences in the timing of recognition of interest, depreciation, rental revenue, and sales of assets. The reported amount of the Company's net assets at December 31, 1999 was greater than its tax basis for federal income tax purposes by approximately $86,000,000.
REAL ESTATE
Real estate is stated at cost or, in the case of real estate which management believes is impaired, at the lower fair value of such properties. Additions, renovations, and improvements are capitalized. The Company reviews real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's book value exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be derived from that asset. Whenever undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the book value, the asset will be reduced to a value equal to the net present value of the expected future cash flows and an impairment loss will be recognized. Maintenance and repairs which do not extend asset lives are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 14 to 30 years for buildings, 2 to 17 years for improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.
REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE
Real estate classified as held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.
In the normal course of business, the Company will receive offers for sale of its properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters to arise which result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. As a result, real estate is not classified as "held for sale" until it is likely, in the opinion of management, that a property will be disposed of in the near term, even if sales negotiations for such property are currently under way. There was approximately $8,737,000 of real estate considered "held for sale" for this purpose at December 31, 1999.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and certificates of deposit with original maturities of less than 90 days.
RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash is required to be held in escrow accounts as specified by the terms of certain of the Company's notes payable at December 31, 1999 and 1998. The restricted cash is to be used to pay for insurance, taxes, and capital expenditures pertaining to the related real estate that collateralizes the notes payable.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $3,311,000 and $1,778,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
AMORTIZATION
Deferred loan fees, direct lease costs, and certain other costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the related estimated life.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1999 and 1998 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and line of credit advances. In making such assessment, the Company has utilized discounted cash flow analyses, estimates, and quoted market prices as deemed appropriate. At December 31, 1999, the Company estimated that the fair value of notes payable was less than their carrying value by approximately $10,116,000. At December 31, 1998, the Company estimated that the fair value of notes payable was greater than their carrying value by approximately $2,620,000.
REDEEMABLE SECURITIES
At December 31, 1997, the Company had a contingent obligation to redeem 1,126,386 shares of its 2,800,000 outstanding shares of Series 1997-A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") outstanding; therefore, the value of such potentially redeemable shares of approximately $28,160,000 was not included in Stockholders' Equity at December 31, 1997. During 1998, this contingent obligation was relieved and, as a result, $28,160,000 was reclassified into Stockholders' Equity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, maintenance expenses, and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recorded. Revenue based on a percentage of tenants' sales is estimated and accrued ratably over the year. In December 1999, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" was issued. SAB 101 provides the SEC staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues, including contingent rental income. Contingent rental revenue from tenants should be recognized as revenue only after the tenants exceed their sales breakpoint. The Company will be required to adopt SAB 101 in the first quarter of 2000. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 would have been reduced by approximately $236,000 if the Company reversed the percentage rent for the tenants which had not exceeded their sales breakpoint at December 31, 1999.
STRAIGHT-LINE RENT
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately $6,901,000 and $5,566,000, respectively, of straight-line rent is included in other assets.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. At December 31, 1997, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings Per Share (EPS). This statement requires the presentation of earnings per share to reflect both "Basic EPS" and "Diluted EPS" on the face of the income statement.
Basic earnings per share is calculated on the weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of all potential common shares.
The following table is the reconciliation from the basic to the diluted EPS computations for "net income" for 1999, 1998, and 1997 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
In 1999 and 1998, dividends and shares from conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and minority interest and shares from the conversion of Operating Partnership units were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations because they were anti-dilutive.
Options to purchase 3,371,750 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $11.31 to $18.88 per share were outstanding at December 31, 1999, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than the market price of the Common Stock of the Company.
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities". This SOP requires that entities expense the costs of start-up activities and organization costs as incurred. The Company was required to adopt the SOP in the first quarter of 1999 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The implementation of this SOP caused the Company to write-off unamortized organization costs of approximately $1,866,000.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain of the 1998 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1999 presentation.
2. REAL ESTATE
SUMMARY: Real Estate is summarized as follows (in thousands):
The Company's real estate is leased to tenants under leases expiring at various dates through 2047. Certain of these leases contain provisions for rent increases based on cost-of-living indices and certain leases contain renewal options of up to 55 years. Future minimum rental income to be received by the Company under the terms of these operating leases is as follows at December 31, 1999 (in thousands):
Fifty-nine properties, including the twenty-eight Bankruptcy Remote Properties described in the following paragraph, having a net book value of approximately $966,715,000 at December 31, 1999, are pledged as collateral for notes payable described in Notes 4 and 5. In addition, the notes are secured by assignments of rents on such real estate. Certain real estate is located on land which is subject to noncancelable ground leases expiring at various dates through 2089 with minimum annual lease payments of approximately $2,063,000.
BANKRUPTCY REMOTE PROPERTIES: Twenty-eight properties having a net book value of approximately $515,952,000 at December 31, 1999 (collectively the "Bankruptcy Remote Properties", and each a "Bankruptcy Remote Property") are wholly-owned by various "Bankruptcy Remote Entities". Each Bankruptcy Remote Entity is an indirect subsidiary of the Company. The assets of each Bankruptcy Remote Entity, including the respective Bankruptcy Remote Property or Properties owned by each, are owned by that Bankruptcy Remote Entity alone and are not available to satisfy claims that any creditor may have against the Company, its affiliates, or any other person or entity. No Bankruptcy Remote Entity has agreed to pay or make its assets available to pay creditors of the Company, any of its affiliates, or any other person or entity. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has agreed to pay or make its assets available to pay creditors of any Bankruptcy Remote Entity (other than any agreement by a Bankruptcy Remote Entity to pay its own creditors). No affiliate of any Bankruptcy Remote Entity has agreed to pay or make its assets available to pay creditors of any Bankruptcy Remote Entity.
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: During 1995, the Company and various persons affiliated with The Martin Group of Companies, Inc., a San Francisco-based real estate development firm owned by J. David Martin, president and chief executive officer of the Company, executed
definitive documents relating to the Company's acquisition of interests in certain retail properties in the San Francisco Bay area (the "Martin Properties"). Each of the Martin Properties is currently owned by a separate limited partnership, of which the Company is general partner, and Mr. Martin and various other persons affiliated with The Martin Group (collectively, including Mr. Martin, the "Martin Group Affiliates") are the limited partners. Each of the partnership agreements contemplates that the Company will acquire or develop a specified Martin Property through the relevant partnership and that upon completion and stabilization of rental revenues from the property, the limited partners will receive a number of limited partnership units determined as follows: (i) the annualized net operating income of the Martin Property will be multiplied by 10 in order to arrive at a hypothetical value of the completed property, (ii) the cost of construction and other project costs will be deducted from such hypothetical value in order to "value" the equity interests of the limited partners in the Martin Property, and (iii) such equity interest will be stated as a number of limited partnership units determined by dividing such limited partners' equity by $16. Each holder of limited partnership units will have the right to "put" such units to the partnership at a price equal to the then market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock. As a result, the actual value which a holder of limited partnership units would be entitled to receive upon exercise of such "put" option will depend upon the market value of the Common Stock at the time, which may be more or less than $16 per limited partnership unit. If such "put" is exercised, the Company has the option of either purchasing the limited partnership units for cash or issuing one share of Common Stock for each limited partnership unit.
Each partnership agreement specifies the maximum number of limited partnership units that may be issued to the limited partners of that partnership. If the hypothetical equity value of any such partnership is determined to be less than originally estimated (either because project costs are higher than estimated or because stabilized net operating income is less than estimated or both), then the number of limited partnership units and the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which may be exchanged for such units will be reduced. Other than to reflect a stock split or other capital adjustment of the shares of Common Stock, under no circumstances can the number of units be increased above the number specified in the applicable partnership agreement. Limited partnership units exchangeable for 118,403 shares of Common Stock have been issued to the Martin Group Affiliates at December 31, 1999. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, these partnership units had a cost basis of approximately $1,742,000 and are reflected as minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. A maximum of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance upon exchange of the maximum number of 1,000,000 limited partnership units that may be issued with respect to the remaining Martin Properties. In connection with each of the Martin Properties, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the limited partners of each limited partnership pursuant to which such limited partners will have the right to require the Company to register under the Securities Act the shares of Common Stock which are issued upon the exchange of limited partnership units for offer and sale to the public and to join in certain registrations of securities of the Company. The total remaining project costs (exclusive of partnership units representing the equity interest of the limited partners) for the Martin Properties are estimated at approximately $19,900,000 at December 31, 1999 (see Note 11).
On November 30, 1998, the Company, through a subsidiary, entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "Agreement") whereby the Company sold, at its cost, a portion of the improvements made by the Company to the historic commercial portion of its development project known as 1000 Van Ness (the "Project") to Historic Van Ness, LLC ("Historic Van Ness"). The purchase price of $15,118,000 was paid by Historic Van Ness by its assuming the same amount of the Company's construction loan on the Project and may be adjusted within sixty days after the completion of all improvements to the historic commercial portion of the
Project. This transaction was accounted for by the Company as a financing transaction. The improvements purchased by Historic Van Ness are considered to be Qualified Rehabilitation Expenditures ("QRE") for federal income tax purposes (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), which generates a rehabilitation tax credit (the "Historic Tax Credit"). The construction loan assumed by Historic Van Ness matures in December 2000. In this regard, the Company has committed to make a loan to Historic Van Ness to refinance the construction loan of up to $15,150,000 less the amount of any permanent loan (not to exceed $7,000,000) allocable to the historic commercial portion of the Project. The term of the loan by the Company would be for ten years, plus three ten year options. The rate of interest on the Company's commitment will be determined when the loan is finalized. This commitment expires on December 31, 2000.
The Company has an option (the "Option") during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006 to purchase the interest of the investor member of Historic Van Ness for an amount equal to the then fair market value (as defined in the Option Agreement) of such interest.
Simultaneously with the Agreement, the Company through two subsidiaries entered into a Master Lease Agreement and Master Sublease Agreement (the "Master Leases") with Historic Van Ness, whereby one of the subsidiaries leased the remaining historic commercial portion of the Project to Historic Van Ness and the other subsidiary subleased from Historic Van Ness certain retail space contained within the remaining historic commercial portion of the Project. The Master Leases commenced on December 1, 1998 and have a term of forty-five years and forty years for the Master Lease and Master Sublease, respectively. Both leases will terminate should the Company exercise the Option to buy the interest of the investor member of Historic Van Ness. The Agreement also stipulates that the Company's subsidiary pay Historic Van Ness $320,000 for each calendar year that the Master Lease is in effect for the use of the common area of the historic commercial portion of the Project (the "Common Area Lease").
Future net minimum lease payments to be made by the Company's subsidiaries under the terms of the Master Leases and Common Area Lease are as follows at December 31, 1999:
The present value of the minimum lease payments is reflected in notes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 4).
In connection with the above agreements, the Company has guaranteed completion of the historic commercial portion of the Project which is estimated to be approximately $1,547,000 at December 31, 1999. In addition, the Company has guaranteed, within certain circumstances and limits, the Historic Tax Credits of the investor member in Historic Van Ness, which maximum amount, depending on those certain circumstances and limits, is estimated to be between $3,300,000 and $4,400,000.

During 1998, the Operating Partnership and the State of California Public Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS") formed BPP Retail, LLC ("BPP Retail") for the purpose of entering into a joint venture to acquire neighborhood, community, promotional, and specialty shopping centers in the western United States. At December 31, 1998, the Company had not yet contributed equity to the joint venture.
At October 1, 1998, CalPERS made an initial contribution to BPP Retail of five retail properties in Colorado, Texas, and Oregon, valued at approximately $80,000,000, of which it had previously been the sole owner under arrangements with previous advisors. During the fourth quarter of 1998, BPP Retail completed the acquisition of interests in five additional retail shopping centers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $38,261,000 (see Note 11). In December 1998, the Operating Partnership and CalPERS entered into an Agreement Regarding Contribution of Certain Properties and Put Options, related to certain of the Operating Partnership's retail properties. The purpose of this option agreement was to permit the Operating Partnership to contribute certain properties into BPP Retail even though CalPERS had not received all the required information (such as appraisals) to approve or disapprove the contribution. As a condition of permitting this contribution, CalPERS was granted an option (the "Put Option") to require that BPP Retail rescind all or a portion of the contribution as CalPERS may have elected in its sole discretion, after receiving and reviewing all the information as required in the operating agreement of BPP Retail. Upon the signing of this option agreement, BPP Retail provided the Operating Partnership approximately $22,195,000 (the "Net Asset Value") in exchange for the economic interests in certain properties and the Put Option. Due to the Put Option, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company at December 31, 1998 included the net book value of the contributed properties, and the monies received for the Net Asset Value were included in accounts payable and other liabilities. Concurrent with the expiration of the Put Option during the second quarter of 1999, the Company contributed five retail properties to BPP Retail valued at approximately $51,600,000.
In June 1999, the joint venture agreement was amended to expand the permitted geographic scope of the joint venture from the western United States to nationwide. During 1999, the joint venture acquired interests in 26 shopping centers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $577,300,000. These acquisitions were funded through approximately $360,600,000 of unsecured indebtedness and approximately $216,700,000 of CalPERS contributed capital. As part of this amendment, the Company granted CalPERS an option expiring June 30, 2000 to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $15.375 per share.
In December 1999, the Company and CalPERS made certain modifications to the BPP Retail arrangement. As part of the modifications, the Company exchanged substantially all of its equity interest in BPP Retail for a consideration having a total value of approximately $39,400,000. In addition, as part of the modification, the Company contributed two properties to the joint venture at a value of approximately $18,900,000.
Concurrently with these contributions, the Company withdrew approximately $12,800,000 in cash from the joint venture, and the joint venture assumed approximately $6,100,000 in existing mortgage debt associated with one of the two contributed properties. The Company recognized a net gain of $609,000 as a result of the modifications, and cash proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness and for general working capital purposes. The Company will continue to serve as the manager of BPP Retail's assets and is entitled to receive fees for asset management, leasing, acquisitions, and dispositions activities, but will no longer be eligible for
the incentive fee attributable to increases in asset values. In addition, if the Company proposes to acquire ownership of a non-regional mall retail center (e.g., grocery store/drug store, neighborhood shopping center) that satisfies certain specified investment objectives of CalPERS, it must first be offered to BPP Retail and presented to CalPERS' staff for consideration and then rejected before the Company may undertake such opportunity.
Because the amount of potential fee receipts that the Company may earn through its arrangement with CalPERS could approach or exceed 5% of its gross revenues for calendar year 2000, to maintain its status as a REIT it was necessary for the Company to assign to BPP Services, Inc., a Maryland corporation, its rights and obligations to perform asset management services and leasing services on behalf of BPP Retail and its right to receive fees for the performance of such services. This assignment became effective as of March 1, 2000. In order to satisfy the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in calendar year 2000 the Company may not, directly or indirectly, own more than 10% of the voting stock of BPP Services, Inc. Accordingly, the Operating Partnership owns 1% of the outstanding voting stock of BPP Services, Inc. and the remaining 99% is owned equally by the Company's five senior executive officers. However, including the shares of non-voting stock, the Operating Partnership owns 95% of the outstanding equity and economic interest of the BPP Services, Inc. and the executive officers own a 5% interest. In accordance with recently enacted legislation, the Company anticipates that , on or after January 1, 2001, it will cause BPP Services, Inc. to elect to become a "taxable REIT subsidiary" in which case the Operating Partnership will have the option to acquire the remaining 5% of the equity that it does not currently own.
During 1999, all of the Company's acquisition activity took place in the joint venture with CalPERS. During 1998, the Company acquired interests in 14 shopping centers aggregating 1,017,000 square feet of Company-owned gross leasable area ("GLA") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $98,343,000. During the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Operating Partnership earned asset and property management, leasing, and acquisition fees from BPP Retail totaling approximately $4,900,000 and $624,000, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the acquisition of 42 retail shopping centers totaling approximately 5.6 million square feet of Company-owned GLA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $598,100,000. Included in this acquisition activity was the acquisition on December 31, 1997, of a portfolio of twenty shopping centers (the "Golden State Properties") containing approximately 2.6 million square feet of gross leasable area, all of which are located in California, and the related financing thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement to contribute dated at December 5, 1997 (the "Contribution Agreement") by and among the Company and certain investment funds (the "Contributors"), on December 31, 1997, the Contributors contributed the Golden State Properties to the Company's Operating Partnership in exchange for initial consideration of approximately $302,400,000. Of this consideration $50,000,000 was in the form of 2,000,000 preferred limited partner units of the Operating Partnership ("Series A Preferred Units") (see Note 8). The Company financed the cash portion of the acquisition price of the Golden State Properties through the privately negotiated sale of $70,000,000 of the Company's newly-designated and issued Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 8), the borrowing of first mortgage debt collateralized by nineteen of the Golden State Properties (see Note 4) and additional borrowings under its existing credit facility. The Contributors were given the right to receive additional consideration of up to $41,600,000 for additional value resulting from the lease-up of certain specified portions of the Golden State Properties and construction and lease-up of certain additional space through June 30, 1999. During 1999 and 1998, additional consideration of approximately $12,991,000 and $9,356,000, respectively, was paid out in cash to the Contributors. At December 31, 1999,
approximately $716,000 is recorded under the caption accounts payable and other liabilities for additional consideration earned but not paid.
4. NOTES PAYABLE
Notes payable are summarized as follows (in thousands):
Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 is reported net of capitalized interest totaling approximately $6,156,000, $6,518,000, and $3,242,000, respectively.
Principal maturities on the notes payable are summarized as follows (in thousands):
During February 1997, the Company paid off mortgage loans secured by one of its shopping centers with borrowings under the Company's credit facilities. In addition, the Company refinanced a variable rate mortgage loan secured by another property with a fixed rate mortgage loan. In connection with these extinguishments of debt, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $52,000.
On December 31, 1997, the Company, through a Bankruptcy Remote Entity (see Note 2), sold to Nomura Asset Capital Corporation an 8.33%, $135,040,000 mortgage promissory note due December 31, 2007 for $150,000,000, being the equivalent of a 6.76%, $150,000,000 mortgage
promissory note with the same maturity. The Company has accounted for the sale of the mortgage note and the payment of principal and interest thereon as if the note were a 6.76%, $150,000,000 mortgage promissory note. The first mortgage debt is collateralized by nineteen of the twenty Golden State Properties. The proceeds of this mortgage financing were used to finance, in part, the acquisitions of the Golden State Properties pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (see Note 3).
5. LINE OF CREDIT ADVANCES
In November 1999, the Company obtained a $202,800,000 credit facility from CMF Capital Company, LLC (a subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation) which is secured by various mortgages. Proceeds from this facility were used to repay an existing $205,000,000 credit facility. In December 1999, the Company repaid approximately $35,187,000 of the outstanding indebtedness, which reduced the commitment amount to $176,263,000. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. At December 31, 1999, the weighted average rate of interest on the advances under the line of credit was 8.30%, as compared to 7.07% on December 31, 1998, under the prior facility. At December 31, 1999, borrowings of approximately $138,420,000 were outstanding. The facility is scheduled to mature in November 2000 and is subject to various loan covenants. The Company intends to refinance the facility with either CMF Capital Company, LLC or replace the facility with another lender prior to the maturity date. In addition, the Company has a $5,000,000 revolving credit agreement with a lender. At December 31, 1999, there was no outstanding indebtedness under this facility. The facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% or prime and is scheduled to mature in September 2000.
6. SALES OF REAL ESTATE
In July 1999, the Company sold Wiegand Plaza, Mesa Shopping Center, Independence Square, and Poway Shopping Center for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately $44,400,000, resulting in an aggregate gain of approximately $8,620,000. In August 1999, the Company disposed of the Ruffin Village shopping center for approximately $3,500,000, resulting in a gain of approximately $1,149,000. In October 1999, the Company sold the Bergen Brunswig office building for approximately $19,250,000, resulting in a gain of approximately $71,000. In anticipation of this sale, the Company recorded an impairment write-down of $1,200,000 in the second quarter of 1999. In December 1999, the Company sold the Marcoa Publishing office building for approximately $2,800,000, resulting in a net loss of approximately $78,000. In anticipation of this sale, the Company recorded an impairment write-down of $1,000,000 in the third quarter of 1999.
In August 1998, the Company sold the parking garage of its 1000 Van Ness project for approximately $13,125,000. No gain or loss resulted from this sale. In December 1998, the Company disposed of the remaining portion of the Plaza Rancho Carmel shopping center for approximately $2,420,000, resulting in a loss of approximately $1,814,000.
In December 1997, the Company sold the Pacific West Outlet Center for approximately $38,500,000, resulting in a gain of approximately $5,896,000. Two other properties were disposed of without realization of gain or loss during 1997.
7. DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
The status of the Common Stock dividends distributed for 1999, 1998, and 1997 for federal income tax purposes is as follows:
8. ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES
SERIES 1997-A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK: On December 31, 1997, the Company issued 2,800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, in a privately-negotiated sale at a price of $25.00 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock has a cumulative dividend yield of 8% per annum. Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock currently has the right to convert all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held of record by the holder into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the stated value plus the amount, if any, of the per share amount of outstanding dividends as of the effective time of the conversion, divided by (ii) the conversion price, initially equal to $15.375. At December 31, 1999, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock. After the fifth anniversary of the date of the first issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company may give notice of mandatory conversion of all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock if the value of the Common Stock (both on the day prior to the notice of conversion and on a value weighted basis over a period of time prior to such date) is greater than the initial conversion price; and after such notice all such outstanding shares shall be mandatorily converted into Common Stock, except that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, prior to the date established for such mandatory conversion, instead to cause the Company to redeem such holder's Series A Preferred Stock at its stated value plus accrued dividends to the redemption date multiplied by a percentage equal to 105%, if the redemption date is prior to December 31, 2003, decreasing by 1% each year thereafter (but not less than 100% after December 31, 2007). The Company used the proceeds of the sale to finance, in part, the acquisition of the Golden State Properties (see Note 3).
COMMON STOCK: On March 30, 1998, the Company issued 7,475,000 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $14.125 per share. In addition, on March 30, 1998, the Company issued 965,518 shares of Common Stock to a Unit Investment Trust at a price based upon the March 25, 1998 market value of $14.50 per share. The combined shares were sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statements. The net proceeds from the combined offerings of approximately $112,471,000 were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's credit facility, pay off the balance outstanding under a construction loan agreement secured by one of the Company's development properties, and for general working capital purposes. On May 2, 1997, the Company issued 6,325,000 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $12.375 per share. The shares were sold pursuant to a previously filed $200,000,000 shelf registration statement. The net proceeds of the offering of approximately $73,125,000 were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's credit facilities.
PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS: On December 31, 1997, 2,000,000 Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership were issued at a price of $25.00 per unit. After approximately one year and subject to certain conditions, Preferred Units are exchangeable at the option of the holder for Series A Preferred Stock on a 1-for-1 basis. Each Preferred Unit has substantially identical distribution and liquidation rights as each share of Series A Preferred Stock. Such Preferred Units are classified as minority interest at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
The Company used the proceeds of the sale to finance, in part, the acquisition of the Golden State Properties (see Note 3). At December 31, 1999 and 1998, 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock were reserved for issuance upon the potential redemption of 2,000,000 Preferred Units.
ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP UNITS; "PUT" RIGHTS OF COMMON UNITS: Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, whenever the Company issues any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Company must contribute the proceeds of such issuance to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership will issue the same number of Common Units or Preferred Units to the Company, so that the Company will at all times own the same number of Common Units (including units held by the Company as general partner as well as limited partner units owned by the Company) and Preferred Units as there are outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, respectively, of the Company. Distributions by the Operating Partnership with respect to Preferred Units and Common Units provide the funds to enable the Company to make distributions to the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock. The partnership agreement also provides that, after the June 30 or December 31 next succeeding the first anniversary of any issuance of Common Units (or earlier in the event of certain extraordinary transactions), each holder of Common Units other than the Company will have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem its Common Units at a per unit redemption price equal to the then market value of a share of Common Stock. Such redemption will be in cash, except that the Company may assume the redemption obligation and pay the redemption in form of shares of its Common Stock. During 1999, approximately 297,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately 297,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During 1998, approximately 41,000 Operating Partnership Common Units were exchanged for approximately $596,000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for issuance upon the potential redemption of approximately 1,610,000 and 1,906,000 partnership units, respectively.
UNISSUED REGISTERED SECURITIES: At December 31, 1999, the Company had registered for issuance an aggregate of $202,144,000 of unissued securities under various shelf registration statements.
9. PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK
MARKET QUOTATIONS
Market quotations are from the New York Stock Exchange. At December 31, 1999, there were 2,156 holders of record of the Company's shares.
10. STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has a stock option and incentive plan which expires in 2006 and is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A maximum of 2,950,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options or other stock-based awards that may be granted under the plan. Options granted expire 10 years from the date of grant. The plan as revised in 1996 also provides for grants from such reserved shares to each non-employee director of the Company of restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock in lieu of cash compensation. Restricted stock vests evenly over a three year period or earlier upon such person's termination of service as director. At December 31, 1999, 265,251 shares had been purchased pursuant to the exercise of options under the plan, unexercised options for 2,371,750 shares are outstanding (of which 991,667 are subject to future vesting requirements), and options or other awards for 335,091 shares are available for future awards under the plan.
Activity under the stock option plan is summarized below:
The above disclosure does not include an option the Company granted to CalPERS to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. The option has an exercise price of $15.375 per share and expires on June 30, 2000. The value of the options as of the date of grant was estimated to be approximately $234,000.
During 1997, the Company repurchased 135,560 options for an average price of approximately $0.49 per option.
The following table summarizes information concerning options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 1999:
Financial Accounting Standards Number 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS No. 123"), requires either the recording or disclosure of compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of FAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation costs have been recognized in 1999, 1998, or 1997. Had compensation cost for the Company's Stock Option Plan been recognized based on the fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the provisions of FAS No. 123, the Company's income available to common stockholders and basic earnings per share would have been reflected as the pro forma amounts below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
The pro forma effect on net income for 1999, 1998, and 1997 is not representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years because it does not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to grants made prior to 1995. No options were granted during 1997. The estimated fair value of options granted under the Company's stock option plan during 1999 and 1998 were approximately $809,000 and $1,425,000, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 8.0% dividend yield, volatility of 25%, risk free rate of return of 6.00%, and expected lives of 5 years. The estimated fair value of options granted are subject to the assumptions made and if the assumptions changed, the estimated fair value amounts could be significantly different. The above weighted-average assumptions are an approximation of historical information and are not intended to represent future events or trends.
11. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
The Company, through a subsidiary, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Holliday Development, L.P. ("Holliday"), whereby the Company would be reimbursed by Holliday for all of the Company's costs and expenses (the "Reimburseable Costs") incurred at the direction of Holliday, in connection with the acquisition and construction of the residential portion of 1000 Van Ness (one of the Martin Properties, see Note 2). The agreement stipulated that the Reimbursable Costs were to be paid to the Company in several successive transactions which coincided with the sale of the residential units to third parties. During 1999, the Company was paid the remainder of the Reimbursable Costs, approximately $7,450,000. Upon receipt of the final payment of the Reimbursable Costs (which totaled approximately $18,200,000) the Company conveyed all of the unsold residential units. The Company's president and chief executive officer owned approximately 35% of the outstanding equity of Holliday. In addition, the Company's former director of development owned approximately a 14% interest in Holliday.
Included in accounts receivable at December 31, 1999 is approximately $94,000 due from a partnership in which the Company's president and chief executive officer has an interest.
In December 1998, the Company entered into an operating lease for a corporate office in Emeryville, California. The landlord is a partnership in which the Company's president and chief executive officer has an economic interest. The lease commenced on January 1, 1999 with a five-year term. Monthly lease payments are approximately $11,460, with a three percent annual increase. During 1999, as part of its restructuring plan (see Note 12), the Company sub-leased this space to a third party. The sub-lease commenced on August 1, 1999, with a four-year term and monthly payments of approximately $12,500.
During 1998 and 1997, the Company acquired three leasehold interests in 126,557 square-feet of former Ernst Home Improvement Stores ("Ernst Stores") for approximately $6,520,000 in cash. In addition, during 1998 BPP Retail (see Note 3) acquired a leasehold interest in a 44,875 square-foot former Ernst Store for approximately $2,000,000. The Company and BPP Retail acquired the Ernst Stores from the purchaser of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy proceedings involving the Ernst Home Improvement chain. One of the principals of such purchaser is a brother of the chief investment officer of the Company. The chief investment officer of the Company disclaims any personal interest in his brother's interest in the purchaser and has no
personal interest in any proceeds that the purchaser received in connection with the leasehold interests.
12. RESTRUCTURING
On March 18, 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company's plan to restructure its internal operations to outsource its property management function to third-party providers. The Company estimated and recorded in the first quarter of 1999 a restructuring charge of $1,500,000. This outsourcing is expected to benefit the Company in several ways. First, it enables the Company to more efficiently enter and exit selected markets and assets as opportunities present themselves. This ability is key to the Company's focus on maximizing the return on invested capital. Second, it allows the Company to establish strategic relationships with national property management companies as well as local providers. These relationships should benefit the Company with increased opportunities and improved services. Third, it allows the management team to focus more time on value-added activities that should help to improve the Company's financial position. The outsourcing resulted in an approximately 26% reduction in the Company's workforce and the closure of three of its property management offices. The anticipated monthly recurring costs of outsourcing to third-party providers are estimated to be approximately the same as the current recurring internal costs ($250,000).
The restructuring charge is primarily attributable to personnel related costs for the employees subject to the restructuring and the costs associated with reducing and eliminating offices, furniture and equipment. The personnel related costs include severance benefits, the Company's portion of related payroll taxes, insurance and 401(k) plan contributions. During the week of March 22, 1999, all 37 employees in the Company's property management department were notified of the terms of their benefits package. The personnel costs comprised approximately one-half ($750,000) of the total reserve.
The costs attributable to reducing and eliminating offices include lease termination fees, rental losses for vacated office spaces (offset by sub-leases) and tenant improvements, and design fees attributable to abandoned office space. The costs attributable to reducing and eliminating offices comprised approximately one-third ($500,000) of the total reserve. The costs associated with reducing and eliminating furniture and equipment included the write-off of the net book value of the furniture and equipment for terminated employees to the extent that these assets could not be redeployed in other functional areas of the Company. The costs attributable to eliminating the furniture and equipment were approximately one-sixth ($250,000) of the total reserve.
During the quarter ended September 30, 1999, the Company completed the hiring of its third-party providers, its planned reduction in workforce, and the process of closing its property management offices. It was determined during the third quarter of 1999 that $120,000 of the reserve estimated for personnel related costs was not necessary due to certain personnel leaving prior to earning severance benefits and that $127,000 of the reserve estimated for the write-off of furniture and equipment was not necessary due to the redeployment of certain computers to other offices of the Company. In addition, it was determined that $100,000 of additional reserve was needed for office closures due to a change in the future value of sub-lease payments. As a result of these changes in estimates, the Company reallocated $100,000 of reserves from personnel related costs to office closures and reversed $147,000 of reserve during the quarter ended September 30, 1999. At December 31, 1999, the remaining reserve for personnel related costs ($10,000) represented funds needed for consultants hired to assist with the transition to third-party managers. At December 31, 1999, remaining reserve for office closures ($317,000) represented future obligated lease payments for corporate offices which were closed, offset by future receipts for sub-leases entered into with the Company for the related closed office spaces
(See Note 15). The following table reflects the composition of the Company's restructuring reserve, the expenditures applied against it, and the portion of the reserve that was reversed at December 31, 1999:
13. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL AND PURSUIT OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES
On June 7, 1999, the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Schottenstein Stores Corporation ("Schottenstein") and certain of its affiliates to negotiate a business combination in which the Company would be merged into an acquisition affiliate of Schottenstein and the holders of the Company's Common Stock would receive $13 per share. The proposal was subject to a number of conditions, including completion of due diligence satisfactory to Schottenstein, obtaining new senior debt financing, and the assumption of certain outstanding indebtedness of the Company. The proposed transaction was also made conditional upon approval of the Company's stockholders and the holders of units in the Company's Operating Partnership. On July 12, 1999, Schottenstein increased its contingent proposal to $13.50 per share.
On July 23, 1999, after an extensive evaluation of the Schottenstein proposal and after receiving advice from Goldman, Sachs & Co., Inc., the Company's Board of Directors concluded that it would not be in the best interest of the Company's Common Stockholders to accept the proposal and unanimously voted to reject Schottenstein's proposal.
On November 12, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had instructed management and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Inc. to actively pursue a full range of strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value. The Company also announced that it had commenced the active marketing of certain properties to provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility.
On February 15, 2000, the Company announced that it had completed the initial phase of this process. In this regard, the Company has entered into numerous confidentiality agreements with potential bidders and the Company is exchanging additional information with certain parties that submitted preliminary proposals to engage in business combinations.
In connection with the evaluation of the Schottenstein proposal, the Company's pursuit of all of its strategic alternatives, and the Company's defending against certain litigation incidental to the foregoing, the Company has incurred, and expects that it will continue to incur, significant costs for financial, advisory, legal, and other services. Through December 31, 1999, the Company had incurred approximately $4,548,000 of these related costs.
14. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has a contributory Retirement Savings Plan. The maximum contribution is 15% of annual salaries of which up to 3% is matched by the Company up to 75% of employee contributions, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's contributions to this plan for 1999, 1998, and 1997 were approximately $124,000, $77,000, and $48,000, respectively.
15. OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases office space under various operating leases that expire at various times through 2007. Rental expense under these operating leases for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was approximately $985,000, $326,000, and $202,000, respectively. During 1999, in connection with its restructuring plan (see Note 12), the Company closed three of its corporate offices. Subsequent to the closing of these offices the Company sub-leased the spaces to third parties. These sub-leases expire at various dates through 2003.
Approximate minimum future lease payments, net of the related sub-lease payments, under these operating leases at December 31, 1999, are as follows (in thousands):
16. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited)
Summarized quarterly financial data for 1999 and 1998 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
17. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has two reportable segments: Retail Operating properties and Office/Industrial
properties. The Company focuses its investments on retail shopping centers located in major metropolitan areas. As discussed in Note 1, the Company owns interests in 62 retail operating properties, 61 of which were fully operational, and one being developed.
The Company also owns interests in two office and industrial properties which it considers non-strategic and therefore does not allocate a material amount of Company resources to this segment. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 there was no tenant of the Company that accounted for ten percent of the total revenues of the Company.
The Company's accounting policies for these segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance of its assets within these segments based on the net operating income of the respective property. Net operating income is calculated as rental revenues of the property less its rental expenses (such as common area expenses, property taxes, insurance, and other owner's expenses). The summary of the Company's operations by segment is as follows (in thousands):
The following table reconciles the Company's reportable segments' rental revenues and net operating income to consolidated net income of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 (in thousands):
The following table reconciles the total real estate for the reportable segments to consolidated assets for the Company at December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 (in thousands):
Other Real Estate includes assets related to the corporate offices of the Company, which are not included in segment information.
18. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
As discussed in Notes 3 and 6, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries acquired and disposed of interests in certain properties during 1998. The acquisitions have been accounted for as a purchase. The operating results of the acquisitions and disposals have been included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition and disposal.
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma operating data is presented for the year ended December 31, 1998 as if each of the following transactions had occurred as of the beginning of the respective period: (i) the acquisitions and dispositions by the Company of properties in 1998
and (ii) the completion of the sale by the Company of 8,440,518 shares of Common Stock in March 1998 (see Note 8).
The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and may not be indicative of what actual results of operations would have been had the transaction occurred as of January 1, 1998, nor does it purport to represent the results of future operations (in thousands, except per share amounts):
19. CONTINGENCIES
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS: In 1999, a lawsuit was filed against the Company by a tenant of a Company owned property. The complaint alleges, among other things, misrepresentation regarding the use of the property. The tenant is seeking to recover funds that it claims to have invested in the property of $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The Company believes this case is without merit and is vigorously defending itself against the allegations. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any loss provision relative to damages sought by the tenant. Although the outcome of this lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that the outcome of this case will have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial statements or its business.
Also in 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and its Board of Directors. The complaint alleged that the Board of Directors and the Company violated their fiduciary duties by adopting a shareholder rights agreement, responding to Schottenstein's proposal inappropriately (see Note 13), and adopting various severance arrangements. In February 2000, a derivative class action lawsuit was also filed asserting claims against the Company. The claims contained in this complaint are similar to the pending class action lawsuit described above. It names as defendants the Company's Board of Directors and four of its officers. The Company believes that both of these class action lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.
The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements or its business.
