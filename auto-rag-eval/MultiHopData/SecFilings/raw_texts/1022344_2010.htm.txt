Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 250.5 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 159.5 million square feet. Total estimated retail sales at the properties in 2010 was in excess of $60 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 161 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.4 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 709 anchors, which are mostly national retailers. For comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls acquired from The Mills Corporation in 2007, or the Mills Regional Malls, from the information on our other regional malls.
Premium Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 58 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Palm Springs, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
The Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The Mills Regional Malls typically range in size from 800,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 66 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 950,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 17 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA, are considered non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation and amortization.
As of December 31, 2010, approximately 94.2% of the owned GLA in regional malls and Premium Outlets and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 93.7% of the owned GLA for The Mills and 90.4% of owned GLA for the Mills Regional Malls was leased, and approximately 91.6% of owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.
We hold a 100% interest in 218 of our properties, effectively control 19 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 101 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 329 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.
The following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls and Premium Outlets, The Mills, the Mills Regional Malls and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2010.

European Investments
Gallerie Commerciali Italia, S.p.A., or GCI, is a fully integrated European retail real estate developer, owner and manager of 45 properties in Italy. At December 31, 2010, we had a 49.0% ownership interest in GCI. Our properties in Italy consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of these properties are anchored by the hypermarket retailer Auchan, who is also our partner in GCI. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan is one of the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe. These centers comprise over 10.1 million square feet of GLA and were 97.2% leased as of December 31, 2010.
On July 15, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, sold our collective interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owned seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners received net consideration of â‚¬422.5 million for their interests after the repayment of all joint venture debt, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe was approximately $281 million. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the â‚¬167.4 million (approximately $215 million) principal balance on the Euro-denominated tranche of our Credit Facility.
We and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.
Other International Investments
We also hold real estate interests in eight operating joint venture properties in Japan, one operating joint venture property in Mexico, one operating joint venture property and two joint venture properties under development in South Korea, and one joint venture property under development in Malaysia. The eight Japanese Premium Outlets operate in various cities throughout Japan and are held in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. These centers comprise over 2.5 million square feet of GLA and were 99.8% leased as of December 31, 2010.
The following summarizes our holdings in these international joint ventures and the underlying countries in which these joint ventures own and operate real estate properties as of December 31, 2010:
In July 2010, we completed construction and opened a 62,000 square foot expansion at Toki Premium Outlets in Toki, Japan.
Prior to May 7, 2010 we held a minority interest in Liberty International, PLC, or Liberty, a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust that operated regional shopping centers and owned other prime retail assets throughout the U.K. Effective May 7, 2010, Liberty completed a demerger in which it was separated into two companies, Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, or CSCG, and Capital & Counties Properties PLC, or CAPC. Liberty shareholders acquired the same number of shares of CSCG and CAPC as they owned in Liberty. CSCG operates regional shopping centers and is the owner of other retail assets primarily located in the United Kingdom. CAPC is predominantly focused on property investment and development in central London. Our interest in CSCG and CAPC is adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component. Our interests in CSCG and CAPC are less than 6% of their outstanding shares respectively.

Land
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 550 acres of land held in the United States for future development.
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency
Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, excluding new developments and expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 295 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 22% percent reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties and reflects an annual value of over $34 million in avoided operating costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 182,000 metric tons CO2e.
In 2010, Simon Property was awarded NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for the sixth year in a row and is the only company to have achieved the Leader in the Light distinction every single year since NAREIT launched the program in 2005. Simon Property was also included in the 2009 Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. The 2009 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index highlights 50 companies worldwide that have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance with respect to climate change disclosure practices. Simon Property was the only real estate company to be recognized.
