Gold and Copper Processing Methods
Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.
Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidization, generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidization, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.
Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to float attached to air bubbles to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.
At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters.
Production Properties
Set forth below is a description of Newmont’s significant production properties. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
Nevada
We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, the Lone Tree Complex near the town of Valmy, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corp. (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks. The Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, commenced commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Leeville underground mine, located on the Carlin Trend northwest of the Carlin East underground mine, also commenced commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.3 million ounces for 2007 with ore mined from nine open pit and five underground mines. At year-end 2007, we reported 29.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 84% in open pit mines and 16% in underground mines. Refractory ores require more complex, higher cost processing methods. Refractory ore treatment facilities generated 75% of Nevada’s gold production in 2007, compared with 72% in 2006, and 69% in 2005. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that 79% are refractory ores and 21% are oxide ores.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5), Twin Creeks (Juniper) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated
on heap leach pads at Carlin, Twin Creeks and Lone Tree. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade refractory ores are processed by a flotation plant at Lone Tree or either bio-oxidation/flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site. All milling at Lone Tree was completed in 2007.
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Western Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 2% to 5% of production.
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick to operate the Turquoise Ridge and Getchell mines. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold sales of 62,844 in 2007, 58,300 ounces in 2006 and 52,300 ounces in 2005 were attributable to Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.
We have ore sale agreements with Barrick and Yukon-Nevada Gold Corp. (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process some of the Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 58,624 ounces in 2007, 99,500 ounces in 2006 and 104,600 ounces in 2005 pursuant to these agreements.
We have sales and refining agreements with Gerald Metals, Peñoles, Yukon-Nevada, Johnson Matthey, Just Refiners and Glencore to process intermediate gold bearing product.
Yanacocha, Peru
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. We hold a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land position. Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable.
Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. In addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads and three processing facilities. Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2007 totaled 1.6 million ounces (0.8 million equity ounces). At year-end 2007, we reported 14.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Yanacocha.
The Yanacocha operations contain the Conga deposit, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2004. We continue to evaluate the optimum development plan for Conga.
Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, agreed with the central government in 2006 to contribute 3.75% of its net profits to fund social development projects for a period of up to five years, contingent upon metal prices remaining high.
Australia/New Zealand
In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land, such rights commonly referred to as native title. Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
We do not expect that native title claims will have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues and earnings.
Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites. The Tanami operations have been wholly-owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests.
The operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak, with mill feed supplemented by production stockpiles from the Dead Bullock Soak open pit. Ore from all of these operations is processed through The Granites plant. During 2007, the Tanami operations sold 439,000 ounces of gold. At year-end 2007, we reported 1.7 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Tanami.
Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2007, the Kalgoorlie operations sold 323,400 equity ounces of gold. At year-end 2007, we reported 4.6 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Kalgoorlie.
Jundee. The Jundee operation (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. During 2007 mining was conducted from both the underground and open pit deposits with the open pit operation ceasing production in November 2007. The milling operation was consolidated during the year with the relocation of the Nimary ball mill to the Jundee plant site. Jundee sold 298,200 ounces of gold in 2007. At year-end 2007, we reported 1.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Jundee.
Waihi. The Waihi operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and consist of the Favona underground deposit and the Martha open pit. The Waihi operation sold 92,900 ounces of gold during 2007. At year-end 2007, we reported 0.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Waihi. The Martha mine does not currently pay royalties. At Favona, Newmont pays a royalty of 1% of gross revenues from gold and silver sales, or 5% of accounting profit, whichever is greater.
Boddington. Boddington is a development project located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington is owned by Newmont (66.67%) and AngloGold Ashanti Limited (33.33%). Development of the Boddington project was approximately 62% complete as of December 31, 2007, with mill start-up expected in late 2008 or early 2009. At year-end 2007, we reported 11.1 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Boddington.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia
Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2007, copper sales were 427.5 million pounds (204.2 million equity pounds), while gold sales were 494,300 ounces (233,300 equity ounces). At year-end 2007, we reported 4.1 billion equity pounds of copper reserves and 4.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.
We operate Batu Hijau, a producer of copper/gold concentrates, and have a 45% ownership interest therein, held through a partnership with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation. We have a 56.25% interest in the partnership and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. The partnership, in turn, owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated Indonesian company. Because PTPI’s interest was a carried interest, and because PTPI had been advanced a loan by the partnership, we reported a 52.875% economic interest in Batu Hijau, which reflected our actual economic interest in the mine until such time as the loan was fully repaid (including accrued interest). On May 25, 2007, PTPI fully repaid the loan (including accrued interest) and as a result, our economic interest was reduced from 52.875% to 45% and we recorded a net charge of $25 (after-tax) against Minority interest expense in the second quarter of 2007.
In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian
government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008, 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in PTNNT, owner of Batu Hijau, could be reduced to 49%.
PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in 2007. A further 7% interest will be offered for sale in March 2008. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in 2007. While the central government declined to participate in the offer, local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. In January 2008, the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership agreed to sell, under a carried interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (DEMR) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT does not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by February 22, 2008. Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the Contract of Work for this notification and no grounds for terminating the Contract of Work, and are currently evaluating possible responses to the February 11, 2008 default notice, including filing for international arbitration as provided for under the Contract of Work. Newmont and Sumitomo are in discussions with officials of the Government of Indonesia to attempt to clarify or resolve this issue.
The Company has been in discussions to renew its forest use permit (called a pinjam pakai) for over two years. This permit is a key requirement to continue to efficiently operate the Batu Hijau mine. The permit renewal has not been received and in the event it is not received by May 2008, it could have an adverse impact on operating and financial results.
Ghana
The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Ahafo sold 445,600 ounces of gold in 2007.
We currently operate two open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 17 pits. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo reserves as of December 31, 2007, were 9.7 million equity ounces.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25%) not to exceed 32.5% and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection.
We have one development project in Ghana, currently the subject of further optimization studies. The Akyem project (100% owned) is approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In 2007, the Company continued optimization and engineering on alternative plans for the proposed operation. The Company also initiated environmental and social baseline data collection in preparation for submitting permit documents in 2008.
Other Operations
Bolivia. The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which we have an 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. The mill was closed in October 2003 and production continued from residual leaching. In 2005, additional material from the stockpiles and Lla Llagua pit were placed on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit was processed on a new leach pad. In 2007, Inti Raymi sold 76,300 equity ounces of gold. At year-end 2007, we reported 0.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Inti Raymi.
Mexico. We have a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Industriales Peñoles (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura sold 85,700 equity ounces of gold in 2007. At year-end 2007, we reported 1.6 million equity ounces of gold reserves at La Herradura.
Canada. During 2007, our Canadian operations included one underground mine. Golden Giant (100% owned) is located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon in Ontario, Canada, and began production in 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant sales continuing through the second quarter of 2007. In 2007, Golden Giant sold 12,000 ounces of gold.
Other Property
Hope Bay. With the successful acquisition of Miramar in December 2007, we now control the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. Hope Bay is consistent with the Company’s strategic focus on exploration and project development and was acquired with the intention of adding higher grade ore reserves and developing a new core gold mining district in a AAA-rated country.
Operating Statistics
The following tables detail operating statistics related to gold production, sales and production costs.
The following table details operating statistics related to Batu Hijau copper production, sales and production costs.
Proven and Probable Equity Reserves
We had proven and probable equity gold reserves of 86.5 million contained ounces as of December 31, 2007.
Reserves were calculated at a $575, A$750 or NZ$850 per ounce gold price assumption. Our 2007 reserves would decline by approximately 6%, or 5.6 million ounces, if calculated at a $550 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to $600 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 4%, or 4.0 million ounces, all other assumptions remaining constant.
As of December 31, 2007, our equity gold reserves in Nevada were 29.4 million ounces. Outside of Nevada, year-end equity gold reserves were 57.1 million ounces, including 19.4 million ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 17.4 million ounces in Ghana, 14.2 million ounces in Peru, 4.2 million ounces in Indonesia and 2.0 million ounces at Other Operations.
Our equity copper reserves as of December 31, 2007 were 7.6 billion contained pounds. Reserves were calculated at a price of $1.75 or A$2.00 per pound assumption.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for the licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable equity reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the several different processing methods that we use. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, metallurgical recoveries and operating costs.
The proven and probable equity reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience. Market price fluctuations of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and we will recalculate reserves as of December 31, 2008, taking into account metal prices, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions to reserves during 2008.
The following tables detail gold proven and probable equity reserves(1) reflecting only those reserves owned by Newmont as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:
(1)
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proven and probable equity reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material that can be included in the reserves in a given deposit. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold or copper extraction, and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2007 reserves were calculated at a $575, A$750 or NZ$850 per ounce gold price unless otherwise noted.
2006 reserves were calculated at a $500, A$675 or NZ$750 per ounce gold price unless otherwise noted.
(2)
Tonnages include allowances for losses resulting from mining methods. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
(3)
Ounces or pounds are estimates of metal contained in ore tonnages and do not include allowances for processing losses. Metallurgical recovery rates represent the estimated amount of metal to be recovered through metallurgical extraction processes. Ounces are rounded to the nearest 10,000.
(4)
Cut-off grades utilized in Nevada 2007 reserves were as follows: oxide leach material not less than 0.006 ounce per ton; oxide mill material not less than 0.040 ounce per ton; refractory leach material not less than 0.025 ounce per ton; and refractory mill material not less than 0.047 ounce per ton.
(5)
Includes undeveloped reserves at Castle Reef, North Lantern and Emigrant deposits for combined total undeveloped reserves of 1.5 million ounces.
(6)
Also contains reserves of 7.5 million ounces of silver with a metallurgical recovery of 88%.
(7)
Reserve estimates provided by Barrick, the operator of the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture.
(8)
In-process material is the material on leach pads at the end of the year from which gold remains to be recovered. In-process material reserves are reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000.
(9)
Stockpiles are comprised primarily of material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. Stockpile reserves are reported separately where tonnage or contained ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and contained ounces are greater than 100,000.
(10)
Deposit is currently undeveloped. Gold cut-off grade is not applicable due to reliance on copper credits.
(11)
Reserves include the currently undeveloped deposit at Corimayo, which contains reserves of 2.5 million equity ounces. Cut-off grades utilized in 2007 reserves were as follows: oxide leach material not less than 0.004 ounce per ton; and oxide mill material not less than 0.030 ounce per ton.
(12)
Deposit is currently being developed. Mill startup is expected in late 2008 or early 2009. Gold cut-off grade is not applicable due to reliance on copper credits.
(13)
Cut-off grade utilized in 2007 reserves not less than 0.020 ounce per ton.
(14)
Cut-off grade utilized in 2007 reserves not less than 0.026 ounce per ton.
