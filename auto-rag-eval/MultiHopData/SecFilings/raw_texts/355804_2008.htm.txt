On August 31, 2007, the Partnership obtained an additional mortgage loan in the principal amount of $2,100,000 on its investment property Post Ridge Apartments, located in Nashville, Tennessee. The additional mortgage bears interest at 5.93% per annum and requires monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $12,500 beginning October 1, 2007, through the January 1, 2020 maturity date. The additional mortgage has a balloon payment of approximately $1,644,000 due at maturity. If no event of default exists at maturity, the maturity date will automatically be extended for one additional year, to January 1, 2021, during which period the additional mortgage would bear interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus 250 basis points and would require monthly payments of principal and interest. The Partnership may prepay the additional mortgage at any time with 30 days written notice to the lender subject to a prepayment penalty. As a condition of the loan, the lender required AIMCO Properties, L.P., an affiliate of the Partnership, to guarantee certain non-recourse obligations and liabilities of the Partnership with respect to the new mortgage financing. In connection with obtaining the additional loan, the Partnership incurred loan costs of approximately $56,000 which were capitalized and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
In connection with the new additional mortgage loan, the Partnership also agreed to certain modifications on the existing first and second mortgage loans encumbering Post Ridge Apartments. The modification includes consolidating the existing loans, an interest rate of 6.665% per annum, monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $26,400, commencing October 1, 2007 through the maturity date of January 1, 2022, at which time a balloon payment of approximately $3,086,000 is due. The previous terms for the first mortgage were an interest rate of 6.63% per annum through the maturity date of January 1, 2022 and monthly payments of approximately $34,000 through the maturity date, at which date the loan was scheduled to be fully amortized. The previous terms for the second mortgage were an interest rate of 7.04% per annum through the maturity date of January 1, 2022 and monthly payments of approximately $3,000 through the maturity date, at which date a balloon payment of approximately $173,000 was due. The Partnership may prepay the modified mortgage loan at any time subject to a prepayment penalty. As a condition of the loan, the lender required AIMCO Properties, L.P., an affiliate of the Partnership, to guarantee certain non-recourse obligations and liabilities of the Partnership with respect to the modified loan.
On September 21, 2007, the Partnership refinanced the mortgage encumbering one of its investment properties, Citadel Village Apartments, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The refinancing replaced the existing mortgage, which at the time of refinancing had a principal balance of approximately $1,766,000, with a new mortgage loan in the principal amount of approximately $3,709,000. The new loan was refinanced under a secured real estate credit facility ("Secured Credit Facility") with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc., as agent for Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company, which has a maturity of October 1, 2010, with two one-year extension options. The new mortgage required monthly payments of interest only beginning on November 1, 2007, through the October 1, 2010 maturity date, at which date the entire principal balance of approximately $3,710,000 was due. The new loan had a variable interest rate of the one-month LIBOR rate plus 0.78%, which rate at December 31, 2007 was 6.01% per annum, and resets monthly. The variable interest rate was to increase to the one-month LIBOR rate plus 0.98% if the debt service coverage ratio of the investment property decreased below a prescribed threshold. The Secured Credit Facility provides mortgage loans on properties owned by other partnerships that are affiliated with the general partner of the Partnership. The Secured Credit Facility creates separate loans for each property that are not cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with the other property loans. The loans are prepayable without penalty. As a condition of the Secured Credit Facility, the lender required AIMCO Properties, L.P., an affiliate of the Partnership, to guarantee certain non-recourse obligations and liabilities of the Partnership with respect to the new mortgage financing. In connection with refinancing the existing mortgage, the Partnership incurred loan costs of approximately $64,000.

The new mortgage required monthly payments of interest only beginning on January 1, 2008, through the October 1, 2010 maturity date, at which date the entire principal balance of $3,100,000 was due. The new loan had a variable interest rate of the one-month LIBOR rate plus 0.78%, which rate at December 31, 2007 was 6.01% per annum, and resets monthly.

The Secured Credit Facility provides mortgage loans on properties owned by other partnerships that are affiliated with the general partner of the Partnership and Registrant. The Secured Credit Facility creates separate loans for each property that are not cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with the other property loans. The loans were prepayable without penalty. As a condition of the Secured Credit Facility, the lender required AIMCO Properties, L.P., an affiliate of the Partnership and Registrant, to guarantee certain non-recourse obligations and liabilities of the Partnership with respect to the new mortgage financing. In connection with refinancing the existing mortgage, the Partnership incurred loan costs of approximately $65,000. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the mortgage encumbering Village East Apartments was repaid with proceeds from the June 20, 2008 sale.
On January 12, 2009, the Partnership received a loan of approximately $11,125,000 from AIMCO Properties, L.P., an affiliate of the General Partner (the “Affiliate Loan”). These loan proceeds were then used to pay in full the existing mortgage loan encumbering 865 Bellevue Apartments, which at the time of the payoff had a principal balance of approximately $11,078,000 and matured on January 12, 2009. The Affiliate Loan was unsecured and bore interest at 6.0%. This loan was repaid with proceeds from the permanent loan obtained in February 2009 on 865 Bellevue Apartments.
On February 19, 2009, the Partnership obtained a mortgage loan in the principal amount of $19,350,000 on 865 Bellevue Apartments.

In accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, payment of the loan may be accelerated at the option of the lender if an event of default, as defined in the loan agreement, occurs. Events of default include nonpayment of monthly principal and interest by the due date; nonpayment of the matured balance of the loan on the maturity date; and the occurrence of any breach or default in the performance of any of the covenants or agreements made by the Partnership.
Rental Rates and Occupancy
The following table sets forth the average annual rental rates and occupancy for 2008 and 2007 for each property.
(1) The decrease in occupancy at 865 Bellevue Apartments is due to the redevelopment at the property. The redevelopment was complete at December 31, 2008.
During August 2006 the Partnership commenced with a phased redevelopment project for 865 Bellevue Apartments. The initial phase of the redevelopment project was initially estimated to cost approximately $7,500,000 and to be completed by the middle of 2007. The scope of the initial phase of the redevelopment project consisted of modifications to the electrical wiring, replacement of HVAC and water heaters, new siding, roof replacements, windows and doors, clubhouse renovations and major landscaping. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Partnership commenced with the second phase of the redevelopment project. The scope of the second phase of the redevelopment project consisted of the addition of 34 garages, a gated entry, renovations to the clubhouse, pool, leasing and business center, tennis courts, new playground equipment and renovations to apartment kitchens, baths and living spaces. The redevelopment project was completed at December 31, 2008 at a total cost of $18,139,000. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, approximately $3,245,000 and $8,028,000, respectively, of redevelopment costs had been incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2008 additional costs of approximately $6,866,000 have been incurred. The Partnership funded the redevelopment from operations, proceeds received in connection with the sales and financings of other investment properties and advances from AIMCO Properties, L.P, an affiliate of the General Partner, although AIMCO Properties, L.P. was not obligated to provide such advances. For more information on AIMCO Properties, L.P., including copies of its audited balance sheet, please see its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the construction period, certain expenses are being capitalized and will be depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $185,000 of construction period interest, $5,000 of construction period operating costs and $19,000 of construction period taxes were capitalized related to the redevelopment. During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $162,000 of construction period interest, $6,000 of construction period operating costs and $13,000 of construction period taxes were capitalized related to the redevelopment.
As noted under "Item 1. Business", the real estate industry is highly competitive. All of the properties are subject to competition from other residential apartment complexes in the area. The General Partner believes that all of the properties are adequately insured. Each property is an apartment complex which leases units for lease terms of one year or less. No residential tenant leases 10% or more of the available rental space. All of the properties are in good physical condition, subject to normal depreciation and deterioration as is typical for assets of this type and age.
