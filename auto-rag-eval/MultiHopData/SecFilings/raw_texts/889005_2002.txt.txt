ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
PROPERTIES -- PRINCIPAL AREAS OF OPERATIONS
Our operations are concentrated in the following divisions: Northern, which primarily includes properties in the Rocky Mountains, principally in North Dakota and Wyoming; Western, which includes the Acquired Properties in the Uinta Basin, Utah; Southern, which includes properties principally in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana; and Gulf of Mexico, which includes our offshore properties. We operate approximately 77% of the net present value of our reserves. We finance our exploitation, exploration and acquisition activities through cash flows from operations and through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing activities. Set forth below is summary information concerning average daily production during the fourth
quarter of 2002 and estimated reserves and a pre-tax SEC net present value of estimated proved reserves discounted at 10%, as of December 31, 2002 in our divisions.
- ---------------
(1) Mmbbls converted to Bcfe at a six to one conversion.
(2) Excludes value attributable to the gathering and compression assets of Westport Field Services, LLC, one of our subsidiaries.
(3) Includes production from the Acquisition closing date of December 17, 2002 through December 31, 2002.
NORTHERN DIVISION
The Northern Division conducts operations in the Rocky Mountain region which includes the Williston, Powder River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River Basins. The division represented approximately 21% of our net present value of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, and contributed approximately 28% of our fourth quarter 2002 net production. We have interests in 563,695 developed and 1,145,920 undeveloped gross acres in the division and in 2,111 gross (approximately 805 net) producing wells in this division.
Our strategy in the Northern Division is to exploit lower-risk infill, horizontal and secondary/tertiary recovery opportunities on existing properties, pursue gas-weighted exploration opportunities and make tactical acquisitions to enhance current operations.
On March 1, 2002, we completed the purchase of producing oil and gas properties located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana for approximately $39 million. The total acquired proved reserves were approximately 43 Bcfe, of which approximately 90% is oil. We operate over 70% of these properties. Our net production from these properties for the fourth quarter 2002 was approximately 1,550 bbl/d.
Williston Basin. Our activity in the Williston Basin continues to focus on horizontal field extensions, field deepenings to new horizons and growth of our secondary recovery projects. Our most active project continues to be the Wiley field. We operate this waterflood with a 54% working interest. In 2000, we initiated a horizontal drilling program and through December 31, 2002 have drilled 37 wells, all of which were successful. In addition to the horizontal drilling, we increased water injection capacity to expand our waterflood program. As a result of this activity, gross daily production has increased from approximately 600 bbl/d in April 2000 to over 3,000 bbl/d at the end of the fourth quarter 2002. Over the next 12 months, we plan to drill 10 to 15 additional wells in the Wiley field while continuing to increase water injection capacity. Additionally, we plan to drill horizontal development wells in our Horse Creek, TR and Bear Creek fields.
Greater Green River Basin. In the Greater Green River Basin we have interests in over 400,000 gross undeveloped acres. Over the next 12 to 24 months we expect to drill seven to 10 exploration wells. One of the primary operating areas within the basin is the Moxa Arch Complex. Production from Moxa Arch wells tends to be long-lived, with the potential for greater than a 25 year reserve life. In the Moxa Arch and Wamsutter areas of southwest Wyoming, we plan to drill 10 to 15 development wells over the next 12 months.
Powder River Basin. In the Powder River Basin, we currently have interests in approximately 50,000 gross acres, which we believe are prospective for coalbed methane drilling. From the beginning of 2000 through December 31, 2002, we participated in the drilling of 273 coalbed methane wells, 270 of which were successful. We operate 145 of these wells. In 2003, we expect to continue coalbed methane drilling in both the Wyodak and Big George coal-bearing areas of the Powder River Basin.
Big Horn Basin. The Gooseberry field is our most significant property in the Big Horn Basin. We own a 100% working interest (nearly 90% net revenue interest) in this field, which consists of two waterflood units. Since acquiring the field in February 1995, we have more than doubled the production from approximately 535 bbl/d to over 1,100 bbl/d in December 2002. In 2002, a larger pipeline was placed in service to accommodate the increasing production from the unit. During the next 12 months, we plan to drill three to four additional development wells and to expand water injection capacity. We currently have interests in over 200,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Big Horn Basin.
WESTERN DIVISION
On December 17, 2002, we closed the acquisition of producing properties, undeveloped leasehold, gathering and compression facilities and other related assets in the Greater Natural Buttes area of Uintah County, Utah for approximately $507 million. This division represented approximately 23% of our net present value of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002 and was producing approximately 68 Mmcfe/d on December 31, 2002. We have interests in 212,880 developed and 53,120 undeveloped gross acres and in 971 gross (approximately 755 net) producing wells in this division.
In addition to establishing a new core area, the Acquisition:
- increases our proved reserves by approximately 60%, or 596 Bcfe, replacing approximately 459% of our 2002 production and giving us nearly 1 Tcfe of proved reserves in the Rocky Mountains;
- raises pro forma production approximately 19%, to approximately 434 Mmcfe/d, placing us among the 20 largest domestic independent exploration and production companies, based on fourth quarter 2002 daily production;
- adds long-life, operated gas properties with a reserve to production ratio of over 20 years, extending our overall reserve life index from approximately 7 years to approximately 10 years and increasing the gas portion of both our proved reserves and production to approximately 70%;
- contains upside potential, with over 600 proved undeveloped locations;
- provides exploitation and exploration opportunities on 244,000 net acres of leasehold, including targets outside the producing areas and deeper formations within the producing areas; and
- allows us to control the gathering and marketing of our natural gas and affords us access to interstate pipelines flowing east, such as Colorado Interstate Gas, and west, such as Questar Pipeline.
Natural gas was first discovered in the Greater Natural Buttes field in 1955. Since that time, more than 900 Bcf of natural gas has been produced. Since 1991, development accelerated with more than 1,000 wells drilled in the field, approximately 98% of which were successful. The properties are characterized by established production profiles and long reserve lives. Producing horizons range from 5,000 to 14,000 feet, with production coming primarily from the Wasatch and Upper Mesa Verde formations.
The Natural Buttes Unit has undergone a series of downspacings from the original spacing of 320 acres per well to current spacing of 40 acres per well. In adjacent units, operators are currently proposing downspacing to 20 acres per well. Operators of adjacent units have also drilled successful gas wells to the Lower Mesa Verde and Mancos formations underlying the primary field production, which could be prospective on a portion of our acreage.
In the Greater Natural Buttes area, we operate approximately 650 net producing wells, or approximately 88% of the net present value of our proved reserves in the area. Through our high working interest and level of operations we can control the majority of drilling, completion and production of wells. We expect to drill 80 to
90 wells in 2003 and plan to expand the program to 120 to 150 wells per year for the next three to four years thereafter.
SOUTHERN DIVISION
The Southern Division conducts operations in the Permian Basin, onshore Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions. This division represented 36% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, and contributed 40% of our fourth quarter 2002 net production. We have interests in 540,429 developed and 88,196 undeveloped gross acres and in 3,393 gross (approximately 1,368 net) producing wells in this division.
Permian Basin. Our principal activity in the Permian Basin continues to be focused on development of the Andrews unit and the Shafter Lake San Andres unit waterfloods.
- Andrews Unit. The Andrews unit waterflood produces from the Wolfcamp/Penn formation at approximately 8,600 feet. We have a 98.6% working interest in this 3,230-acre unit. During 2002 we continued expanding the waterflood program by drilling additional wells, converting wells to injectors and performing workovers on existing wells. As a result, production continues to increase from an 855 bbl/d average in 2000 to over 1,200 bbl/d as of December 31, 2002. We believe that production from this waterflood unit can be further enhanced with the use of CO(2) flooding or other tertiary recovery methods.
- Shafter Lake San Andres Unit. The Shafter Lake San Andres unit is a 12,880-acre unit that produces from the Grayburg and San Andres formations at a depth of approximately 4,500 feet. We have an 81.4% working interest in this secondary recovery unit. In 2002, we drilled eight wells on 10-acre spacing and plan to drill 10 to 15 additional 10-acre wells in 2003. The unit was producing 655 bbl/d as of December 31, 2002. Operators of nearby San Andres fields have successfully drilled to 10-acre spacing before CO(2) injection. We believe the potential exists for CO(2) flooding as the field matures.
Onshore Gulf Coast. Our Gulf Coast operations are primarily focused in the Yegua trend of southeast Texas, and in Northern Louisiana where we are active in two fields, the Elm Grove field and the North Louisiana field complex.
- Southeast Texas Properties. We acquired these oil and gas properties on September 30, 2002. The total estimated proved reserves were approximately 67 Bcfe, of which 82% is natural gas. We operate essentially all of these properties. We also acquired approximately 10,000 net undeveloped acres and an interest in 120 square miles of 3-D seismic data. Since closing, we have participated in two shoots for an additional 185 square miles of 3-D seismic data, increased net production from approximately 28 Mmcfe/d to 35 Mmcfe/d and drilled two successful development wells and two exploration wells, of which one was successful. Currently, we have two rigs drilling in the area and expect to drill 15 exploration prospects over the next 12 to 24 months.
- Elm Grove Field. We maintained an active development drilling program in the Elm Grove field in 2002 by drilling 24 wells, all of which were successful. In 2003 we expect to drill 20 to 25 wells. Net production has continued to grow throughout the year to average approximately 17.4 Mmcfe/d in fourth quarter 2002.
- North Louisiana Field Complex. Development drilling in this four field complex continues to be active. In 2002 we drilled 16 wells, 15 of which were successful. Net production fourth quarter 2002 averaged 9.6 Mmcfe/d. We anticipate drilling between 15 and 25 wells in this region in each of the next two years.
Mid-Continent. Our Mid-Continent operations are currently focused in Oklahoma and Kansas. Oil production is concentrated in our operated waterfloods in Oklahoma, while natural gas production is primarily from third party operated wells in Oklahoma and in our operated wells in Kansas.
GULF OF MEXICO DIVISION
The Gulf of Mexico Division represented 19% of the net present value of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, and contributed 29% of our fourth quarter 2002 net production. As of December 31, 2002, we have interests in 318,469 developed and 312,245 undeveloped gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico and in 140 gross (approximately 39 net) producing wells.
In addition to a production base with numerous exploitation opportunities within our developed acreage, the Gulf of Mexico provides us with moderate-risk exploration targets. We drilled 16 exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2001, 11 of which were successful, and 12 exploration wells 2002, 3 of which were successful. We have under license 3-D seismic data covering approximately 19,500 square miles (approximately 2,500 blocks) and 2-D seismic data covering 150,000 linear miles within the Gulf of Mexico.
West Cameron Blocks 180/198. The West Cameron Blocks 180/198 complex is located 30 miles offshore in 52 feet of water. In 2002, we drilled 2 development wells, 1 of which was successful. Several recompletions were also done in 2002. The complex has produced approximately 1.7 Tcf of natural gas and 10 Mmbbl of oil from over 20 separate producing zones since its discovery. In fourth quarter 2002, the field produced 36.1 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
High Island Block 197. This field is located approximately 28 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001. We have a 25% non-operated working interest in the field. Four additional wells have been drilled, three of which were successful. The field commenced production in May 2002, from one well. In fourth quarter 2002 the field averaged 17.9 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
High Island Block 84. This field is located approximately 23 miles offshore in 50 feet of water and was discovered in the third quarter of 2001, with three development wells being drilled in 2002. We operate the field. Production commenced in June 2002 from two wells. We expect the two remaining wells to commence production in 2003. In fourth quarter 2002 the field averaged 8.3 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
South Timbalier Block 316. We discovered this field located approximately 66 miles offshore in 400 feet of water in the fourth quarter of 2001. We operate the field with a 40% working interest. Three wells have been drilled in the field. We expect to install a platform and commence production in the second half of 2003. Facility capacity on the platform will be 150 Mmcfe/d (47 Mmcfe/d net).
Galveston Block 352. We drilled a successful exploratory well in the spring of 2002 and put the well on production in August. We operate the well with a 67% working interest. In fourth quarter 2002 it averaged 2.2 Mmcfe/d net to our interest.
Green Canyon Block 640. We have a 3.5% overriding royalty interest in the Green Canyon Block 640, covering part of a 2002 discovery drilled by ChevronTexaco. Delineation drilling and evaluation within the field called Tahiti is ongoing.
PROVED RESERVES
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated:
- ---------------
(1) The difference in net present value from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 722.7 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the Williston Basin, Southeast Texas and Utah acquisitions, (ii) the addition of 58 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions and (iii) the increase in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $19.78 to $31.23 per bbl of oil and from $2.72 to $4.58 per Mmbtu of natural gas).
(2) The difference in net present value from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 resulted almost entirely from (i) the addition of 502.7 Bcfe of proved reserves acquired in connection with the merger between Westport Resources Corporation and Belco Oil & Gas Corp., (ii) the addition of 92 Bcfe as discoveries and extensions, (iii) the downward revision of 33 Bcfe due to revisions of previous estimates and (iv) the decrease in commodity prices used to determine net present value (from $26.83 to $19.78 per bbl of oil and from $9.52 to $2.72 per Mmbtu of natural gas).
(3) The standardized measure is the value of the future after-tax net revenues discounted at 10%. The difference between the net present value and the standardized measure is the effect of income taxes discounted at 10%.
Estimated quantities of our oil and gas reserves and the net present value of such reserves as of December 31, 2002 are based upon reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. and our engineering staff. Ryder Scott reports covered 81% of the total net present value of estimates of total proved reserves, evaluating 58% and auditing 23%. The internally generated report covered the remaining 19% of the net present value. At December 31, 2001 Ryder Scott audited 87% of the total net present value of estimates of total proved reserves and the remaining 13% of net present value of the reserves was unaudited. Estimates of total proved reserves at December 31, 2000 were prepared by Ryder Scott and Netherland, Sewell and
Associates, Inc. and our engineering staff. The Ryder Scott and Netherland Sewell reports covered approximately 85% of the total net present value of our reserves and the internally generated report covered the remaining 15% of the net present value for 2000.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of exploitation expenditures. The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly, and estimates of other engineers might differ materially from those shown above. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The present value shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is mandated by generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties that we operate, expenses exclude our share of overhead charges. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things, general and administrative costs and interest expense.
PRODUCTION AND PRICE HISTORY
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated:
- ---------------
(1) Does not include the effects of hedging transactions.
(2) Production and price history for the Western Division consisting of the Acquired Properties are included only for the period from December 17, 2002, the acquisition date, to December 31, 2002.
PRODUCING WELLS
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2002 relating to the producing wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. We also held royalty interests in 1,865 producing wells as of that date. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
ACREAGE
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2002 relating to acreage held by us. Developed acreage is assigned to producing wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage held under lease, permit, contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for exploitation or exploratory drilling. The term "gross acres" refers to the total number of acres in which we own a working interest. The term "net acres" refers to gross acres multiplied by our fractional working interest therein.
DRILLING RESULTS
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells drilled during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or
economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return.
As of December 31, 2002, 6 additional exploration and eleven development wells were in progress.
ITEM 3.
