Item 2. Properties). The actual rental rates at which available space will be relet will depend on prevailing market factors at the time.
At December 31, 2002, approximately 1.5 million square feet of projects were under development. Our policy is to prudently pursue projects where customer need is evident and market conditions warrant.
In addition to our current development pipeline, we own various undeveloped land parcels on which approximately 12 million square feet of office space could be developed, assuming our receipt of necessary permits, licenses and approvals. Our policy is to develop land only when market conditions warrant. Although we may develop some properties ourselves, a portion of this activity may also be conducted with joint venture partners. If we develop a property with a joint venture partner, we may not have the same degree of control over the property as if we owned it ourselves. In addition, if we develop a property with a joint venture partner, we will be required to share a portion of the economic benefits from such property with our joint venture partner.
EOPlus
In 2001, we initiated a comprehensive analysis of our operating structure with the help of a management consulting firm and our employees. The goal of the analysis was to significantly reduce operating expenses, improve customer service, reduce lease cycle time, increase occupancy and retain tenants. The analysis resulted in a significant reengineering effort called EOPlus. As part of this effort, most of the activities that occurred at the property level will eventually be centralized into core regional offices with a view towards allowing property managers to spend more time building customer relationships. The centralization of each region’s operations is designed to permit us to manage our Properties with fewer people. By the end of 2003, we expect to have 16% fewer employees than at the end of 2001 as a result of staff reductions and attrition. We expect the related severance expenses to be immaterial. By consolidating our property management offices, we expect to make available between 130,000 square feet and 160,000 square feet of office space for leasing. We anticipate this new model will be fully implemented in all of our markets by the end of 2003. We have also created a central purchasing function to review and analyze our goods and services expenditures. The goal of the central purchasing function is to obtain preferred pricing, reduce the number of our vendors and reduce the number of invoices we process. Beginning in 2004, after the new model is fully implemented, we expect annual cost savings of $75 million to $100 million. Since a significant portion of these savings will be passed on to our tenants, we expect to benefit from an ability to offer our tenants a lower cost of occupancy than our competition.
External Growth
As part of our long-term growth strategy, assuming that capital is available to us on reasonable terms, we intend to continue to acquire additional office properties. Properties may be acquired separately or as part of a portfolio and may be acquired for cash and/or in exchange for our debt or equity securities. These acquisitions may be individual asset transactions, joint ventures, mergers or other business combinations.
ACQUISITION ACTIVITY
Over the past five years, we have invested approximately $15.3 billion, calculated on a cost basis, in acquisitions of institutional quality office properties, industrial properties and parking facilities throughout the United States.
Management of Equity Office considers various factors when evaluating potential property acquisitions. These factors include:
•
the attractiveness of the property to existing and potential tenants;
•
the likelihood and relative attractiveness of competitive supply;
•
the anticipated demand for space in the local market;
•
the creditworthiness and diversity of risk in the current tenants occupying the property;
•
the ability to acquire the asset at an attractive going-in yield, as well as the potential to increase operating income over time by renewing leases for increasing rents;
•
the physical condition of the property, including the extent of funds required for its maintenance and for physical upgrades needed in order to establish or sustain its market competitiveness;
•
the ability to operate the property with a competitive cost structure; and
•
the property’s location in one of our target markets.
In determining whether to enter into a new development, the foregoing factors are considered as well as the additional risks of development, including the following:
•
the extent of lease-up risk in the context of the demand/supply characteristics of the local market;
•
the ability to minimize construction risks; and
•
the quality of local development partners, if relevant.
DISPOSITION ACTIVITY
Over the past five years, we have disposed of approximately $2.4 billion, calculated based on the sales price, of office properties, industrial properties and parking facilities throughout the United States. Management of Equity Office considers various factors when evaluating potential property dispositions. These factors include but are not limited to:
•
our ability to recycle capital into markets consistent with our long-term strategy;
•
exiting markets that are not core markets;
•
whether the property is strategically located;
•
tenant composition and lease rollover for the asset;
•
general economic conditions, including job growth in the local market;
•
the general quality of the asset; and
•
the long-term outlook for the market for which the asset is located.
FINANCING POLICIES
Equity Office conducts substantially all of its investment and debt-financing activities through us. To date, we have financed our investments through a combination of equity, which may be issued by either Equity Office or us, as well as secured and unsecured debt (which would be issued by us). The terms of our line of credit and unsecured notes contain various financial covenants which require satisfaction of certain total debt-to-asset ratios, secured debt-to-total-asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and unsecured debt-to-unencumbered-asset ratios, as well as other limitations. In addition, we have obtained investment grade credit ratings on our unsecured debt from each of Standard & Poors, Fitch and Moodys rating agencies. A primary objective of our financing policy is to manage our financial position to allow us to raise capital at competitive rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 97.9% of our outstanding debt had a fixed interest rate which limits the risk of fluctuating interest rates. In addition, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments at times to limit interest rate risk. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation.
To the extent that the Board of Trustees of Equity Office decides to obtain additional capital, Equity Office may elect to issue equity securities, cause us to issue additional Units or debt securities, retain our earnings (subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code requiring distributions of taxable income to maintain REIT status), or dispose of some of our properties or utilize a combination of these methods. Under the terms of our partnership agreement, the proceeds of all equity capital raised by Equity Office are contributed to us in exchange for additional interests in us.
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
Our primary business is the ownership and operation of office properties. Our long-term tenants are in a variety of businesses, and no single tenant is significant to our business. Information related to this segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 - Segment Information.
COMPETITION
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive. We compete for tenants in our markets primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. We also experience competition when attempting to acquire or divest ownership of desirable real estate, building sites or redevelopment opportunities, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors.
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on our Properties, properties that we have sold or on properties that may be acquired in the future.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2002, Equity Office had approximately 2,500 employees providing in-house expertise in leasing, property management, investments and dispositions, finance, tax, property development, marketing, accounting, information systems and law.
The nine executive officers of Equity Office have an average tenure of nine years with Equity Office or its affiliates or predecessors and an average of 19 years experience in the real estate industry.
