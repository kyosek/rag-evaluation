DISCLOSURE ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Corporation may, from time to time, make written or oral "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements contained in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Report on Form 10-K), its reports to shareholders and in other communications by the Corporation. These statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes", "expects", "intends", "may", "will", "should" or "anticipates" or similar terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on various assumptions. Although the Corporation believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, investors and prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only projections. Also, future results may differ materially from the Corporation’s historic results.
These risks and uncertainties are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere in this Report. These risks, among others, could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements or from our prior results.

OVERVIEW
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $7.7 million, an increase of $335 thousand or 4.6% from $7.3 million in 2006. Basic and diluted net income per share in 2007 were $1.49 and $1.47, respectively, as compared to 1.42 and 1.40, respectively in 2006. Return on average equity in 2007 was 11.84%, as compared to 11.85% in 2006. Return on average assets remained constant at 0.86% for 2007 and 2006.
During 2007, total assets increased 4.9% to $914.8 million; loans and leases grew 7.1% to $743.4 million; and deposits decreased 2.7% to $704.9 million. Offsetting the decrease in deposits was an increase in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and other borrowings, which increased 87.3% to $115.4 million at December 31, 2007. The decrease in deposits and the offsetting increase in Federal Home Loan Bank and other borrowings is the result of a strategic decision to replace higher cost brokered CDs with lower cost FHLB borrowings. Loan growth in 2007 reflects the Bank’s focus on growing quality loan relationships.
The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to 2006 was primarily the result of an increase in non-interest income, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense. Included in these results is the impact from several significant events that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. In the second quarter, the Bank recorded a gain related to the sale of a loan that had been on non-accrual status and, in the third quarter of 2007, the Bank recorded gains related to the sale of facilities.
The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in interest income, offset by an increase in interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2007 interest income benefited from a 7.1% growth in the loan portfolio and from increases in interest rates. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a 4.8% growth in average interest-bearing deposits combined with an increase in the average rate paid on these deposits mainly due to a shift in the deposit mix and strong customer demand for higher priced deposits.
The increase in non-interest income for year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to a $1.39 million pre-tax gain recorded in the third quarter of 2007 related to the sale of facilities. The increase was also attributable to higher Wealth Management revenue, higher service fee income on deposit accounts and a $225 thousand pre-tax gain related to the sale of a loan that had been on non-accrual status.
During 2007, the Bank entered into a sale-leaseback agreement on an administrative office facility known as the "Swope Building." The Bank leased back the Swope Building for a period of one year following the September sale date. The Bank recognized a $1.39 million pre-tax gain in connection with this transaction in 2007. The after-tax impact to net income from this gain was $915 thousand. Also in 2007, the Bank entered into a sale-leaseback agreement on an administrative office facility known as the "Operations Center." As disclosed in our Form 8-K dated September 28, 2007, the lease agreement for the Operations Center was for fifteen years with two optional five year renewal periods. The resulting $2.7 million gain was deferred and is being amortized into non-interest income over the fifteen year lease term. Rent expense on the lease is being recorded in the non-interest expense section of the income statement. The sale and lease back of the Swope Building and Operations Center fits into Management's overall facilities strategy and complements the
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
purchase of 1 North High Street, which was also completed in 2007. The purchase of the 1 North High Street building and the sale of the Swope Building and the Operations Center were structured as an IRS Code Section 1031 reverse like-kind exchange, effectively rolling the tax basis of the Swope Building and the Operations Center into the taxable basis of the 1 North High Street Building. Accordingly, the Bank was able to defer $772 thousand of taxes payable in the current year until such time as the 1 North High Street building is sold.
The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense, mainly due to a higher average employee headcount; specifically, staffing for new branches as well as new key employees in the Wealth Management Division, Commercial Lending and Leasing areas.
NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased 2.0% or $664 thousand from $32.6 million in 2006 to $32.0 million in 2007, compared to a 3.4% increase or $1.1 million from 2005 to 2006.
The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income for 2007 was primarily due to a larger increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 54 basis points, than the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, which increased by 23 basis points. The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income for 2007 was also due to an increase in interest-bearing liabilities that was higher than the increase in interest-earning assets. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $39.5 million while average interest-earning assets increased by $35.4 million. Accordingly, net yields on interest-earning assets, on a tax equivalent basis, were 3.75% and 3.99% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The increase in tax equivalent net interest income for 2006 was largely the result of an increase in interest-earning assets that was higher than the increase in interest-bearing liabilities. The average interest-earning asset growth during 2006 was approximately $33.4 million while average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $23.9 million. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income generated from this growth in 2006 was a larger increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 90 basis points, than the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, which increased by 69 basis points. Accordingly, net yields on interest-earning assets, on a tax equivalent basis, were 3.99% and 4.03% for 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Average interest-earning assets in 2007 was $852.3 million, an increase of $35.4 million or 4.3% from $816.9 million in 2006. The increase in average interest-earning assets for 2007 was primarily due to a $33.6 million or 4.9% increase in average loans and leases combined with a $5.6 million or 13.7% increase in federal funds sold and deposits in banks. These increases were partially offset by a $3.7 million or 3.9% decrease in investment securities. In 2006, average interest-earning assets was $816.9 million, an increase of $33.4 million or 4.3% compared to 2005. The increase in average interest-earning assets for 2006 was the primarily due to a $29.5 million or 4.5% increase in average loans and leases combined with a $18.9 million or 87.3% increase in federal funds sold and deposits in banks. These increases were partially offset by a $15.0 million or 13.5% decrease in investment securities.
Average interest-bearing liabilities in 2007 was $702.5 million, an increase of $39.5 million or 6.0% from $663.0 million in 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to a $28.0 million or 4.8% increase in average interest-bearing deposits combined with an $11.4 million or 17.6% increase in FHLB and other borrowings. In 2006, average interest-bearing liabilities was $663.0 million, an increase of $23.9 million or 3.7% from $639.1 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 was due to a $29.3 million or 5.3% increase in the average interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a $5.4 million or 7.7% decrease in FHLB and other borrowings.

FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
INTEREST INCOME ON FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND DEPOSITS IN BANKS
Interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks increased $352 thousand or 17.1% in 2007 to $2.4 million from $2.1 million in 2006. This follows an increase of 170.8% or $1.3 million from 2005 to 2006. The increases in interest income on these balances in 2007 and 2006 were partially due to increases in the average federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks balances. In 2007, these balances increased $5.6 million or 13.7% from $40.5 million to $46.1 million. In 2006, these balances increased $18.9 million or 87.3% from $21.6 million to $40.5 million. The increases in interest on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks for 2007 and 2006 are also the result of market increases in the rates earned on these funds. The yield earned on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks in 2007 was 5.23%, compared to 5.08% and 3.57% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our strategy to increase federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks in 2006, was intended to improve liquidity while at the same time remain in short-term funds during the rising rate environment. Also, in 2006 and the first half of 2007, the yield on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks, given the relatively flat yield curve, was very competitive with alternative short term investment securities. During the fourth quarter of 2007, as the yield curve became steeper, we began to reduce federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks and increase longer term investment securities. While the average 2007 federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks balance increased from 2006, the ending balance decreased, reflecting this strategy shift. Ending federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks at December 31, 2007 was $24.5 million, down $20.3 million from $44.8 million at December 31, 2006.
INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES
On a tax equivalent basis, interest income on investment securities decreased $137 thousand or 3.0% from $4.5 million in 2006 to $4.4 million in 2007, compared to a $146 thousand or 3.1% decrease from 2005 to 2006. The decrease in investment interest income in 2007 was primarily due to a $3.7 million or 3.9% decrease in average investment securities, partially offset by a 4 basis point increase in the yield on these assets from 4.73% in 2006 to 4.77% in 2007. From 2005 to 2006, the decrease in interest income on investment securities was primarily due to a $15.0 million or 13.5% decrease in average investment securities, partially offset by a 51 basis point increase in the yield on these assets from 4.22% in 2005 to 4.73% in 2006. The decrease in average investment securities for the year ended, December 31, 2006 from 2005 resulted from an increase in the amount of liquidity needed to provide for loan growth combined with management’s decision to invest in fed funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks, given the rising interest rate environment and the relatively flat yield curve. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Federal Reserve Board actions to reduce interest rates contributed to a steeper yield curve, prompting us to change our strategy and shift funds from federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks to longer term investments. While the average 2007 investment securities balance decreased from 2006, the ending balance increased, reflecting this strategy shift. Ending investment securities at December 31, 2007 was $98.0 million, up $9.3 million from $88.7 million at December 31, 2006.

This increase was partially due to a $33.6 million or 4.9% increase in average loan and lease balances from $680.5 million in 2006 to $714.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest income on loans and leases was also due to a 25 basis point increase in the tax adjusted yield earned on loans and leases during 2007, from 6.77% in 2006 to 7.02% in 2007. During 2006, interest income on loans and leases, on a tax equivalent basis, increased by $6.4 million or 16.1% from 2005. This increase resulted from an increase in average loan balances of $29.5 million or 4.5% from $650.9 million in 2005 to $680.5 million in 2006. The increase in interest income on loans and leases was also due to a 67 basis point increase in the tax adjusted yield earned on loans and leases during 2007, from 6.10% in 2005 to 6.77% in 2006. The yield increases for 2007 and 2006 are a direct result of market rate increases and increases in the Federal Reserve Rates over the course of 2006. There were four Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates in the first half of 2006 and four Federal Reserve actions to lower interest rates in the later part of 2007. The net impact of these actions to the Bank were higher average rates during 2007 as compared to 2006.

NOTES:
(1)
Determination of maturities included in the loan maturity table are based upon contract terms. This policy is used primarily in evaluating ongoing customer's use of their lines of credit with the Bank that are at floating interest rates.
(2)
Demand loans and overdrafts are reported maturing "Within 1 Year". Most construction real estate loans are reported maturing "Within 1 Year" because of their short term maturity or because they are indexed to the Bank's prime rate. An immaterial amount of loans has no stated schedule of repayments.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $4.3 million or 26.4% from $16.2 million in 2006 to $20.5 million in 2007. Increases in both the interest-bearing balances and the average rate paid on these balances contributed to the increase in interest expense. Average interest-bearing balances increased $28.0 million or 4.8% from $583.2 million in 2006 to $611.1 million in 2007. The average rate paid on these deposits increased 58 basis points from 2.78% in 2006 to 3.36% in 2007. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $6.2 million or 62.2% from $10.0 million in 2005 to $16.2 million in 2006. Increases in both the interest-bearing balances and the average rate paid on these balances contributed to the increase in interest expense. Average interest-bearing balances increased from $553.9 million in 2005 to $583.2 million in 2006, an increase of $29.3 million or 5.3%. The average rate paid on these balances increased from 1.81% in 2005 to 2.78% in 2006.
The increase in the average rate paid in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a customer driven shift from lower cost deposit products to higher cost deposit products coupled with an increase in many of our retail deposit product rates. In addition, market interest rate movements throughout 2005, 2006 and 2007 have contributed to the higher rates paid on deposits. Throughout 2005 and during the first half of 2006, the Bank increased rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to increases in Federal Reserve rates and the increase in competitive pressures in the Bank’s marketplace. In the second half of 2007, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates. The Bank responded with decreases in some deposit rates in the fourth quarter of 2007. The net impact to the Bank from the 2006 rate increases and the 2007 rate decreases were higher rates paid in 2007 than in 2006. The Bank will continue to respond with necessary rate decreases in 2008 as Federal Reserve actions, market competition and consumer demand warrant. The increase in the average rate paid on deposit balances was mitigated by a significant reduction in higher cost brokered CDs and replaced with lower cost FHLB borrowings in the second half of 2007.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Interest expense on FHLB and other borrowings increased $488 thousand or 19.6% from $2.5 million in 2006 to $3.0 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due to an $11.4 million or 17.6% increase in the average FHLB and other borrowings from $64.3 million in 2006 to $75.7 million in 2007.
Interest expense on subordinated debt increased $156 thousand or 11.96% for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $161 thousand charge for accelerated amortization of issuance costs related to the early redemption of the $5.2 million Trust I issuance. The redemption of the debentures was coordinated with the $5.2 million Trust III issuance on June 29, 2007. The new issuance bears an interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 140 basis points while the redeemed issuance had an interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 365 basis points.

ASSET QUALITY AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES
During 2007, the Corporation recorded an $80 thousand provision for loan and lease losses, compared to $3 thousand in 2006 and $1.4 million in 2005. Net charge-off’s in 2007 were $442 thousand, compared to $186 thousand of net recoveries in 2006 and $46 thousand of net charge-offs in 2005. The increase in the provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006 was determined in accordance with the Bank’s allowance for loan and lease loss policy. Non-accrual loans as a percentage of gross loans and leases was 0.16% at December 31, 2007, compared to 1.05% and 1.26% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases at December 31, 2007 was 1.05% compared to 1.18% and 1.22% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reduced provision for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 was a direct result of improved asset quality in 2006.
The allowance for loan and lease losses is an amount that Management believes will be adequate to absorb loan and lease losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based on Management's evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases. These evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio, overall portfolio quality, adequacy of collateral, review of specific problem loans and leases, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to pay.
Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on Management's assessment of probable estimated losses. The Bank’s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements. These elements include a specific allowance for loan and lease classified list loans and an allowance based on historical trends. The Corporation consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology.
The allowance for loan and lease losses addresses those loans and leases maintained on the Bank’s loan and lease classified list, which are assigned a rating of substandard, doubtful, or loss. Substandard loans and leases are those with a well-defined weakness, which jeopardizes the repayment of the debt. A loan or lease may be classified as substandard as a result of impairment of the borrower's financial condition and repayment capacity. Loans and leases for which repayment plans have not been met or collateral equity margins do not protect the Bank may also be classified as substandard. Doubtful loans and leases have the characteristics of substandard loans and leases with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of presently existing facts and conditions, is highly improbable. Although the possibility of loss is extremely high for doubtful loans and leases, the classification of loss is deferred until pending factors, which might improve the loan or lease, have been determined. Loans and leases rated as doubtful in whole or in part are placed on non-accrual status. Loans and leases, which are classified as loss, are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Loans and leases on the loan and lease classified list may also be impaired loans, which are defined as non-accrual loans and leases or troubled debt restructurings, which are not in compliance with the restructured terms. Each of the classified loans and leases on the watch list is individually analyzed to determine the level of the potential loss under the current circumstances. The specific reserve established for these criticized by management and impaired loans and leases is based on careful analysis of the loan's and lease’s performance, the related collateral value, cash flow considerations and the financial capability of any guarantor. The allowance for classified list loans and leases is equal to the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for the individual classified loans and leases on the classified list. Classified loans and leases are managed and monitored by management.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The allowance is based on historical trends and uses charge-off experience of the Bank to estimate potential unconfirmed losses in the balances of the loan and lease portfolios. The historical loss experience percentage is based on the charge-off history. Historical loss experience percentages are applied to all non-classified loans and leases to obtain the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses which is based on historical trends. Before applying the historical loss experience percentages, loan and lease balances are reduced by amounts of government agency guarantees. Installment loan balances are also adjusted for unearned discounts.
Since all identified losses are immediately charged off, no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans, or lease or groups of leases, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses.
The following tables present information regarding the Bank’s total allowance for loan and lease losses as well as the allocation of such amounts to the various categories of loans at the dates indicated:

FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Non-performing loans and leases include those on non-accrual status and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. The Corporation’s policy is to write down all non-performing loans to net realizable value based on updated appraisals. Non-performing loans are generally collateralized and are in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans reduce the Corporation’s earnings because interest income is not earned on such assets. There are fifteen non-accrual loans making up the $1.2 million total non-accrual loan and lease balances at December 31, 2007 as compared to seventeen non-accrual loans making up the $7.3 million total non-accrual loan and lease balances at December 31, 2006. Included in the December 31, 2006 balance was one commercial loan of $5.9 million that was sold during 2007. Management continues to take steps to reduce non-accrual loan and lease levels and correct and control current and future credit quality issues. The Credit Administration Department assists Management in improving the components of the allowance of loans and lease losses including the provision for loan and lease losses, recoveries, and charged-off loans. The following chart represents detailed information regarding non-performing loans:

Generally the Bank places a loan in non-accrual status when principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate based on its current assessment of probable estimated losses. OREO represents residential and commercial real estate owned by the Corporation following default by borrowers that has been written down to estimated realizable value (net of estimated disposal costs) based on professional appraisals. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no properties held by the Corporation as OREO.
Management is not aware of any loans or leases other than those included in the foregoing tables and mentioned in this section as well as the “Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” section that would be considered potential problem loans and cause Management to have doubts as to the borrower’s ability to comply with loan repayment terms.
NON-INTEREST INCOME
Total non-interest income increased $2.6 million or 28.0%, to $11.8 million in 2007, compared to a decrease of $113 thousand or 1.2% from 2005 to 2006. The various components of non-interest income are discussed below.
The largest component of non-interest income is Wealth Management revenue which increased $197 thousand or 5.8% to $3.6 million in 2007. This compares to an increase of $30 thousand or 0.9% from $3.4 million in 2005. The primary reason for the increases in Wealth Management revenue for 2007 and 2006 is an increase in the market value of Wealth Management assets under management. These balances increased 5.0% in 2007 from $563.0 million at December 31, 2006 to $591.3 million at December 31, 2007. Wealth Management assets under management grew 0.3% or $1.9 million in 2006 from $561.0 million.
Service charges on deposit accounts increased $355 thousand or 17.7% to $2.4 million in 2007 compared to an increase of $53 thousand or 2.7% in 2006 from 2005. Service charges on deposit accounts consists mainly of overdraft and insufficient funds charges, combined with periodic and transaction-based service charges. The increases for 2007 and 2006 over 2006 and 2005, respectively, were primarily due to increases in charges for insufficient funds and overdraft charges.
Gains on the sales of investment securities were $2 thousand in 2007 as compared to $79 thousand of losses in 2006 and $58 thousand of gains in 2005. The sales of investment securities throughout 2007, 2006 and 2005 were the results of normal portfolio management.
During 2007, 2006 and 2005 the Corporation had operating lease agreements with several customers. The income on these agreements increased $120 thousand or 10.4% from $1.2 million in 2006 to $1.3 million in 2007 and increased $155 thousand or 15.5% in 2006 from 2005. The increases in 2007 and 2006 are due to an increased volume in operating leases with one customer. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank is no longer funding operating leases. Instead, we are acting as an agent for a third party that does fund the lease and we collect an upfront fee. See the discussion of related depreciation expense in the “Non-Interest Expense” section.
Gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and OREO in 2007 was a $1.4 million gain as compared to a $19 thousand gain in 2006 and a $7 thousand loss in 2005. The $1.4 million gain recorded in 2007 was primarily related to the sales of facilities as discussed in the Overview section.
Gains and fee income generated from the sales of loans during 2007 increased by $241 thousand or 62.3% from $387 thousand in 2006 to $628 thousand in 2007. This compares with a decrease of $87 thousand or 18.3% from $474 thousand in 2005. Included in the $628 thousand gain in 2007 is a $225 thousand gain recorded related to the sale of a $5.9 million loan that had been on non-accrual status. Excluding this event, gains and fees on the sale of loans increased $16 thousand or 4% from $387 thousand to $403 thousand for 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The $87 thousand decrease from 2005 to 2006 was mainly driven by a decrease in volume. During 2006, the volume of refinancing and originations of saleable loans had substantially decreased from 2005, resulting in a lower amount of gains and fees being collected when compared to 2005. When a mortgage is sold, all unamortized fees collected are recognized as income for that period and any gain or loss based on the current market value is recorded at the time of the sale. The Corporation retains the servicing on a portion of the loans sold and earns a servicing fee.

Other non-interest income increased $175 thousand or 7.6% from $2.3 million in 2006 to $2.5 million in 2007. This compares with a decrease of $152 thousand or 6.2% from 2005. The primary components of other non-interest income over the past three years are as follows:
(Dollars in thousands)
Electronic Banking
$1,015
$ 994
$ 873
Wealth Advisory Services
Other
1,214
$2,477
$2,302
$2,454
Other includes rental income, safe deposit box fees, merchant services income, and other commission and fee income. The lower Other Non-Interest Income in 2007 and 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to a gain recorded in 2005 related to a forfeited deposit.
NON-INTEREST EXPENSE
Total non-interest expense increased $1.4 million or 4.5% from $31.2 million in 2006 to $32.6 million in 2007, compared to an increase of $596 thousand or 2.0% from 2005 to 2006. The various components of non-interest expense are discussed below.
Employee salaries and benefits increased $1.6 million or 9.1% from $17.4 million in 2006 to $19.0 million in 2007, compared to an increase of $1.6 million or 9.8% from $15.9 million in 2005. The increase during 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to a higher average employee headcount; specifically, staffing for new branches as well as new key employees in the Wealth Management Division and the Commercial Lending and Leasing areas. The increase was also due to higher employee medical insurance expense premiums. The increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily higher salary expense related to the adoption of a new performance-based incentive program in 2006 combined with higher base salaries and benefits due to higher employee head count during the year.
Net occupancy, equipment and data processing expense decreased $207 thousand or 3.9% from $5.4 million in 2006 to $5.2 million in 2007, compared to a decrease of $246 thousand or 4.4% from $5.6 million in 2005. The lower expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to core systems and equipment that became fully depreciated in 2006 as well as lower building depreciation expense from the sale of facilities during 2007. The lower expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 is also due to lower depreciation on core systems and equipment that became fully depreciated in 2006.
Depreciation on operating leases increased $69 thousand or 6.9% from $987 thousand in 2006 to $1.1 million in 2007. This compares to an increase of $118 thousand or 13.6% from $869 thousand in 2005. This depreciation expense is associated with the operating lease agreements the Bank had with several customers. The income associated with these operating leases are classified as Operating Lease Rental Income.
Professional services expense increased $183 thousand or 9.9% from $1.8 million in 2006 to $2.0 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of $753 thousand or 29.0% from $2.6 million in 2005. The higher professional services expense in 2007 as compared with 2006 is primarily the result of higher legal and consulting fees in 2007. The higher professional services expense in 2005 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the cost of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation recorded in 2005 combined with certain consulting fees for demographic and branch site analysis, real estate management, benefit plans and management planning also recorded in 2005.
Bank Shares Tax was $705 thousand, $726 thousand, and $549 thousand for the years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Bank Shares Tax represented 1.08%, 1.17%, and .97% of average stockholders’ equity for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax is based primarily on a six year average of the Bank’s stockholders’ equity, and is paid on an annual basis.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Total other non-interest expense decreased $173 thousand or 4.5% from $3.9 million to $3.7 million in 2007 compared with a decrease of $214 thousand or 5.2% from $4.1 million in 2005. The primary components of other non-interest expense over the past three years are as follows:
(Dollars in thousands)
Telephone, Postage, and Supplies
$1,125
$1,190
$1,004
Loan and Deposit Supplies
Other
2,026
2,178
2,514
$3,699
$3,872
$4,087
Other includes director fees, travel and mileage, Wealth Management processing fees, dues and subscriptions, FDIC Deposit Insurance premiums and assessments, and other general expenses. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in Wealth Management processing fees as well as a $125 thousand reimbursement for prior period overbilling by our third party Wealth Management processor.
Prior to March 31, 2006, the Bank was subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF"). On February 8, 2006, the President signed The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, and, on February 15, 2006, the President signed into law The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (collectively, the Reform Act). The Reform Act provides for various changes to the FDIC's insurance program, including the merger of the BIF and the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"), effective March 31, 2006. Prior to enactment of the Reform Act, the Bank was not required to pay any FDIC assessments. To help offset the new DIF assessment, the Bank received a one-time assessment credit. The assessment credit offset $416 thousand of deposit insurance premiums for 2007 and will partially offset the cost of such premiums for 2008. At December 31, 2007, $66 thousand of assessment credit remained available to offset 2008 premiums. Such increases in FDIC assessments will be an additional expense to the Corporation and, thus, will affect the Corporation's net income in 2008 and subsequent years.
In accordance with the Deposit Insurance Act of 1997 an additional assessment by the Financing Corporation ("FICO") became applicable to all insured institutions as of January 1, 1998. This assessment is not tied to the FDIC risk classification. The FICO assessment rates effective for the fourth quarter 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 were 1.30 basis points per $100 of DIF assessable deposits and 1.29 basis points, respectively. FICO deposit insurance expense was $87 thousand, $88 thousand and $91 thousand for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Corporation opened a newly designed full-service branch in the Oxford area. The Corporation also opened a mini-branch in the Wellington Retirement Community in late November 2005. In April 2006, the Corporation opened a new loan processing office in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation opened two new grocery store branches in Phoenixville and Royersford, Pennsylvania. These branches have a direct impact on all the components of non-interest expense. It is anticipated that the increases in costs will be offset over time by increases in net interest and fee income generated by business in the new marketing areas. We are continuously looking for new branch opportunities and may open new branches in the future as circumstances permit. In January and February of 2008, the Corporation opened two new full service branches in Downingtown and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense was $2.9 million in 2007 compared with $2.9 million in 2006 and $1.9 million in 2005, representing an effective tax rate of 27.7%, 28.2%, and 22.6%, respectively. The lower effective tax rates in 2007 as compared with 2006 and 2005 as compared to 2006 are primarily due to increases in permanent differences as a relative percentage of pretax income.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The Corporation is subject to Risk-Based Capital Guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The Bank is also subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the OCC. Under these requirements, the regulatory agencies have set minimum thresholds for Tier I Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage ratios. At December 31, 2007, both the Corporation's and the Bank's capital exceeded all minimum regulatory requirements and the bank was considered "well capitalized", as defined in the regulations issued pursuant to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1994. The Corporation's and Bank’s Risk-Based Capital Ratios, shown below, have been computed in accordance with regulatory accounting policies.
The Bank is not under any agreement with the regulatory authorities nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities that, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Corporation.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
The following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2007:
BRANCHING, TECHNOLOGY AND CAPITAL PROJECTS
The Corporation intends to open new branches throughout Chester County over the next several years. A new customer-focused branch design was introduced when construction was finished on the branch building in Oxford, Pennsylvania in 2005. The new "signature look" will be rolled out to new and certain current locations. Technological improvements, including enhanced security over customer information, a more proactive disaster recovery system, and an improved infrastructure to support more internet banking products are also expected in the future.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Corporation considers that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based on Management's review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience, the size and composition of the portfolio, current economic events and conditions, and other pertinent factors, including Management's assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries and losses. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from Management’s estimates, additional provisions for loan and lease losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.
Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are subject to Management’s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not. If Management determines that the Corporation may be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future, a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 110 (“SAB 110”), “Share Based Payment.” This bulletin expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a simplified method, as discussed in SAB 107, in developing an estimate of the expected term of share options in accordance with SFAS 123R. This interpretation gives specific examples of when it may be appropriate to use the simplified method of determining the expected term. SAB 110 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The Corporation is evaluating the impact that the implementation of SAB 110 will have on its financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations.” This Statement replaces SFAS 141, “Business Combinations.” This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This Statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. While the Corporation has not yet evaluated SFAS 141(R) for the impact, if any, that SFAS 141(R) will have on our consolidated financial statements, we will be required to expense costs related to any acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009, rather than capitalize such costs as currently required.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Corporation has not yet determined the impact, if any, that SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 109 (“SAB 109”), “Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings.” This bulletin expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings under GAAP. SAB 09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2007. The Corporation is evaluating the impact that the implementation of SAB 109 will have on its financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested equity-classified employee share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2007 (our fiscal year beginning January 31, 2008). The Corporation does not expect EITF 06-11 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2007, FASB issued Statement No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115." This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. The statement defines items eligible for the measurement option. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, FASB issued Statement No. 157 (“SFAS 157”), “Fair Value Measurements,” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and for interim periods within those years. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Corporation adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 and the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for business expansion. Liquidity management addresses the Corporation's ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. Liquidity is managed on a daily basis enabling Senior Management to monitor changes in liquidity and to react accordingly to fluctuations in market conditions. The primary sources of liquidity for the Corporation are funding available from growth of our existing deposit base, new deposits, FHLB, and cash flow from the investment and loan portfolios. The Corporation considers funds from such sources to comprise its "core" deposit base because of the historical stability of such sources of funds. Additional liquidity comes from the Corporation's non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts and credit facilities. Other deposit sources include a tiered savings product and certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000. Details of deposits, non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and other deposit sources are highlighted in the “Deposit Analysis” table.
The Corporation utilizes borrowings from the FHLB and collateralized repurchase agreements in managing its interest rate risk and as a tool to augment deposits and in funding asset growth. The Corporation may utilize these funding sources to better match its assets that are subject to longer term repricing (i.e., between one and five years). The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, maintains several credit facilities (overnight lines of credit, amortizing and non-amortizing fixed rate term and variable rate term advances with FHLB). As of December 31, 2007, the amount outstanding under the Bank’s line of credit with the FHLB was $0.
FHLB borrowings totaled $115.4 million compared to $61.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These borrowings consist of short and long term borrowings representing a combination of maturities. The average interest rate for 2007 and 2006 on these borrowings was approximately 4.2% and 3.9%, respectively. The Bank currently has a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $235.8 million.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The goal of interest rate sensitivity management is to avoid fluctuating net interest margins, and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. Such sensitivity is measured as the difference in the volume of assets and liabilities in the existing portfolio that are subject to repricing in a future time period. The Corporation's net interest rate sensitivity of its "gap position" within one year is a negative $168.2 million or -18.7% of total assets at December 31, 2007, compared with a negative $241.1 million or -27.6% of total assets at the end of 2006. The Corporation’s gap position is just one tool used to evaluate interest rate risk and the stability of net interest margins. The data in the following chart represents the gap position at a specific point in time and may not be indicative of future gap positions. Another tool that Management uses to evaluate interest rate risk is a computer simulation model that assesses the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, net-income under various interest rate forecasts and scenarios. Management has set acceptable limits of risk within its Asset Liability Committee policy and monitors the results of the simulations against these limits quarterly. Management monitors interest rate risk as a regular part of corporate operations with the intention of maintaining a stable net interest margin.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The Corporation’s gap position is one factor used to evaluate interest rate risk and the stability of net interest margins. Other factors include computer simulations of what might happen to net interest income under various interest rate forecasts and scenarios. The Corporation's Asset Liability Management Policy requires quarterly calculation of the effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income. The table below summarizes estimated changes in net interest income over the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2007 under alternative interest rate scenarios. The change in interest rates was modeled to simulate the effect of a proportional shift in asset and liability ratios (rate ramp). The prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal as of December 31, 2007 of 7.25% is used as the “driver rate” in these simulations.

Management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the Corporation's net interest income to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience; however, the interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income, could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based.
In the event the Corporation should experience a mismatch in its desired gap position or an excessive decline in its net interest income subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rates, it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such a mismatch. The Corporation could restructure its investment portfolio through sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes. It could also promote loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes. The Corporation could also solicit deposits or search for borrowings with more desirable maturities. However, market circumstances might make execution of these strategies cost prohibitive or unattainable.
The nature of the Corporation’s current operation is such that it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Additionally, neither the Corporation nor the Bank owns trading assets. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.

FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
First Chester County Corporation (the "Corporation"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Chester County (the "Bank"), has been serving the residents and businesses of Chester County, Pennsylvania, since 1863. The Bank is a locally managed community bank providing loan, deposit, cash management and trust and investment services from its twenty two locations. The Bank encounters vigorous competition for market share in the communities it serves from bank holding companies, other community banks, Internet banks, thrift institutions, credit unions and other non-bank financial organizations such as mutual fund insurance and brokerage companies.
The Corporation and the Bank, and their wholly-owned subsidiaries FNB Properties, LLC, FNB Insurance Services, LLC, Turks Head Properties, Inc, Turks Head II, LLC, First Chester County Capital Trust I (“Trust I”), First Chester County Capital Trust II (“Trust II”), and First Chester County Capital Trust III (“Trust III”) are subject to regulations of certain state and federal agencies. These regulatory agencies periodically examine the Corporation and the Bank for adherence to laws and regulations.
1.
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
The accounting policies followed by the Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation, the Bank, Turks Head Properties, Turks Head II, FNB Insurance Services, and FNB Properties. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
In preparing the financial statements, Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The principal estimate that is susceptible to significant change in the near term relates to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes an analysis of the individual loans and leases and overall risk characteristics and size of the different loan and lease portfolios, and takes into consideration current economic and market conditions, the capability of specific borrowers to pay specific loan and lease obligations, as well as current loan collateral values. However, actual losses on specific loans and leases, which also are encompassed in the analysis, may vary from estimated losses.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131 establishes standards for public business enterprises reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in subsequent interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess resources and performance. The Corporation has applied the aggregation criteria set forth in SFAS No. 131 for its operating segments to create one reporting segment, “community banking.”
The Corporation’s community banking segment consists of construction, commercial, retail, and mortgage banking. The community banking segment is managed as a single strategic unit, which generates revenue from a variety of products and services provided by the Corporation. For example, construction and commercial lending is dependent upon the ability of the Corporation to fund itself with retail deposits and other borrowings and to manage interest rate and credit risk. This situation is also similar for consumer and residential mortgage lending. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Corporation as one operating segment or unit.

Management had previously determined that Trust I, Trust II and Trust III (Trust I, Trust II and Trust III, collectively, the "Trusts") each qualify as variable interest entities under FASB Interpretation 46 (“FIN 46”). Each of the Trusts issued mandatory redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the Corporation. The Trusts hold, as their sole asset, subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation. Subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46, the FASB issued a revised interpretation, FIN 46(R), the provisions of which must be applied to certain variable interest entities. The Corporation adopted the provisions under the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 which required the Corporation to deconsolidate the Trusts.
2.
Financial Instruments
The Corporation follows SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," which requires all entities to disclose the estimated fair value of their assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. Financial instruments requiring disclosure consist primarily of investment securities, loans, and deposits and borrowings.
3.
Investment Securities
The Corporation follows SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which requires investments in securities to be classified in one of three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Debt securities that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost. As the Corporation does not engage in security trading, the balance of its debt securities and any equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Net unrealized gains and losses for such securities, net of tax effect, are required to be recognized as a separate component of stockholders' equity and excluded from the determination of net income.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") SFAS 115-1 and 124-1, "The meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." This FSP nullifies certain requirements of EITF-03-01 on this topic and provides additional guidance on when an investment in a debt or equity security should be considered impaired and when that impairment should be considered other-than-temporary and recognized as a loss in earnings. Specifically, the guidance clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made. The FSP also required certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of the FSP did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
The Corporation follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity,” as amended by SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives either as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Corporation did not have any derivative instruments at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

4.
Loans and Leases and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
Loans and leases that Management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by unearned discount and an allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense. Loan and lease principal considered to be uncollectible by Management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance is an amount that Management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio. The evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan and lease portfolio, overall portfolio quality, specific problem loans, loss experience, and current and future economic conditions which may affect the borrowers' ability to pay. The evaluation also details historical losses by loan category, the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan and lease total amounts. Loss estimates for specified problem loans and leases are also detailed. Interest on loans and leases is accrued and credited to operations based upon the principal amount outstanding. Certain origination and commitment fees and related direct loan or lease origination costs are deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the related loans and leases, resulting in an adjustment of the related loan's yield. Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when Management believes that the borrower's financial condition is such that collection of interest and principal is doubtful. Upon such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed.
The Corporation accounts for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended by SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures." SFAS No. 114 requires loan impairment to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, its observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If it is probable that a creditor will foreclose on a property, the creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral.
Residential mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value. Gains and losses and unamortized fees on sales of residential mortgage loans are included in non-interest income.
The Corporation accounts for its transfers and servicing of financial assets in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities”. SFAS No. 140 revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral.
The Corporation follows FASB Interpretation 45 (“FIN 45”) “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 requires a guarantor entity, at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of FIN 45, to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Corporation has issued financial and performance letters of credit. Financial letters of credit require the Corporation to make payment if the customer’s financial condition deteriorates, as defined in underlying agreements. Performance letters of credit require the Corporation to make payments if the customer fails to perform certain non-financial contractual obligations.
5.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, principally by the straight-line method.
The Corporation accounts for impairment of long-term assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The standard requires recognition and measurement of long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale. The Corporation had no impaired long-lived assets at December 31, 2007, 2006, or 2005.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
6.
Contributions
The Corporation accounts for contributions in accordance with SFAS No. 116, “Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made.” SFAS No. 116 specifies that contributions made by the Corporation be recognized as expenses in the period made and as decreases of assets or increases of liabilities depending on the form of the benefits given. In accordance with SFAS No. 116, the Corporation incurred contribution expenses relating to long-term commitments to local not-for-profit organizations of $171 thousand, $78 thousand and $192 thousand during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
7.
Income Taxes
The Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense and benefits are the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
8.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Corporation has certain employee benefit plans covering eligible employees. The Bank accrues such costs as earned by the employee.
9.
Share Based Compensation Plan
Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (R), “Share-Based Payment”. Statement 123 (R) requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. The cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Statement 123 (R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. Statement 123 established as preferable a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. However, that Statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in Opinion 25, as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair-value-based method been used.
Because the Corporation adopted Statement 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method, prior periods have not been restated. Under this method, the Corporation is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding as of the beginning of the period of adoption. As of January 1, 2006, there were no unvested options. The Corporation measured share-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock option grants prior to January 1, 2006 and anticipates using this pricing mode for future grants. Forfeitures did not affect the calculated expense based upon historical activities of option grantees.
The Corporation granted no stock options during 2007 and all grants prior to January 1, 2006 were fully vested.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has one stock-based employee compensation plan. Reported net income, adjusting for share-based compensation that would have been recognized in the adoption of Statement 123 (R) did not change the way that the Corporation has accounted for stock awards in prior periods and therefore no such change is reflected in the pro forma table below. The Corporation expenses the grant date fair value of stock awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the Corporation had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation prior to January 1, 2006.

The fair value of an option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2005: dividend yield of 2.74%; expected volatility of 0.66; risk-free interest rate of 4.34%; and an expected life of 2.14 years.

Wealth Management Division Assets and Income
Assets held by the Corporation in fiduciary or agency capacities for its customers are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since such items are not assets of the Bank or Corporation. Operating income and expenses of the Wealth Management Division are included under their respective captions in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and are recorded on the accrual basis.
11.
Net income per share
The Corporation follows the provisions of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" requires presentations of basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. All per share data has been retroactively adjusted for stock dividends.
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and federal funds sold and overnight investments. Generally, federal funds and overnight investments are purchased and sold for one-day periods. Cash paid for interest for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $24.1 million, $19.7 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $2.1 million, $3.7 million, and $2.3 million, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 110 (“SAB 110”), “Share Based Payment.” This bulletin expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a simplified method, as discussed in SAB 107, in developing an estimate of the expected term of share options in accordance with SFAS 123R. This interpretation gives specific examples of when it may be appropriate to use the simplified method of determining the expected term. SAB 110 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The Corporation is evaluating the impact that the implementation of SAB 110 will have on its financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations.” This Statement replaces SFAS 141, “Business Combinations.” This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This Statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. While the Corporation has not yet evaluated SFAS 141(R) for the impact, if any, that SFAS 141(R) will have on our consolidated financial statements, we will be required to expense costs related to any acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009, rather than capitalize such costs as currently required.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Corporation has not yet determined the impact, if any, that SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 109 (“SAB 109”), “Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings.” This bulletin expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings under GAAP. SAB 09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2007. The Corporation is evaluating the impact that the implementation of SAB 109 will have on its financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested equity-classified employee share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2007 (our fiscal year beginning January 31, 2008). The Corporation does not expect EITF 06-11 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2007, FASB issued Statement No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115." This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. The statement defines items eligible for the measurement option. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, FASB issued Statement No. 157 (“SFAS 157”), “Fair Value Measurements,” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and for interim periods within those years. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Corporation adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 and the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at December 31, 2007, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Proceeds from the sale of investment securities available for sale were $4.6 million, $13.6 million and $85.8 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Gains of $21 thousand, $76 thousand and $112 thousand and losses of $19 thousand, $155 thousand and $54 thousand were realized on sales of securities in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Corporation uses the specific identification method to determine the cost of the securities sold. The principal amount of investment securities pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law was $87.1 million and $78.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no securities held from a single issuer that represented more than 10% of stockholders' equity.

At June 30, 2006, the Corporation reclassified $523 thousand of the allowance for loan and lease losses as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. This amount represents an allowance for possible losses on unfunded loans and unused lines of credit. These loans and lines of credit, although unfunded, have been committed to by the
Bank. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total amount recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as an allowance for possible losses on unfunded loans and lines of credit is $559 thousand and $552 thousand, respectively.

The Bank identifies a loan as impaired when it is probable that interest and principal will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The accrual of interest is discontinued on impaired loans and no income is recognized until all recorded amounts of interest and principal are recovered in full.
The balance of impaired loans was $1.2 million, $7.3 million, and $8.4 million at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The associated allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans was $72 thousand, $840 thousand and $897 thousand at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
During 2007, activity in the allowance for impaired loan and lease losses included a provision of $11, chargeoffs of $1 thousand, recoveries of $0, and loans paid off or returned to performing status of $0. Interest income of $0 was recorded in 2007, while contractual interest in the same period amounted to $321 thousand. Cash collected on impaired loans in 2007 was $6.9 million, of which $6.4 million was applied to principal and $282 thousand was applied to interest income and $225 thousand was recorded as a gain on sale.
During 2006, activity in the allowance for impaired loan and lease losses included a provision of $0, chargeoffs of $11 thousand, recoveries of $0, and loans paid off or returned to performing status of $0. Interest income of $0 was recorded in 2006, while contractual interest in the same period amounted to $682 thousand. Cash collected on impaired loans in 2006 was $3.2 million, of which $3.2 million was applied to principal and $0 was applied to past due interest.
During 2005, activity in the allowance for impaired loan and lease losses included a provision of $365 thousand, chargeoffs of $122 thousand, recoveries of $0, and loans paid off or returned to performing status of $0. Interest income of $0 was recorded in 2005, while contractual interest in the same period amounted to $638 thousand. Cash collected on impaired loans in 2005 was $1.9 million, of which $1.9 million was applied to principal and $0 was applied to past due interest.
In the normal course of business, the Bank makes loans to certain officers, directors, and their related interests. All loan transactions entered into between the Bank and such related parties were made on substantially the same terms and conditions as comparable transactions with all other parties. In Management's opinion, such loans are consistent with sound banking practices and are within applicable regulatory lending limitations. The balance of these loans at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $31.1 million and $28.4 million, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, principal payments on these loans were $29.0 million and $26.8 million, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, new loans to these individuals and their related interests were $2.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively.

NOTE I - ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had one stock based compensation plan, pursuant to which, shares of the Corporation’s common stock could be issued, subject to certain restrictions. The plan, adopted in 2005, allows the Corporation to grant up to 150 thousand shares of restricted stock to employees. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Corporation granted 22,900 shares valued at $21.05 per share at the grant date. One third of these shares vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of the grant. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Corporation granted 1 thousand shares valued at $21.85 per share at the grant date. This award was fully vested as of December 31, 2006. A summary of the Corporation’s unvested restricted shares is as follows:

NOTE K - REGULATORY MATTERS
The Bank is required to maintain average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank based upon deposit levels and other factors. The required average amount of those reserve balances was $25 thousand and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Dividends are paid by the Corporation from its assets which are mainly provided by dividends from the Bank. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Corporation in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The Bank, without the prior approval of regulators, can declare dividends to the Corporation totaling approximately $8.8 million plus additional amounts equal to the net earnings of the Bank for the period from January 1, 2008 through the date of declaration of such a dividend, less dividends previously paid subject to the further limitations that dividends may be paid only to the extent the retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts and provided that the Bank would not become "undercapitalized" (as defined by Federal law).
The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Corporation's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier I Capital to average quarterly assets (Total Risk Based Capital ratio, Tier I Capital ratio, and Leverage ratio, respectively). Management believes that the Corporation and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject, as of December 31, 2007.
Federal banking agencies categorized the Corporation and the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for corrective action. To be categorized as adequately capitalized the Corporation and the Bank must maintain minimum Total Risk-Based, Tier I Risk-Based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table.
The Corporation's and Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented below:

NOTE L - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity's assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments. For the Corporation, as for most financial institutions, the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined in SFAS No. 107. However, many such instruments lack an available trading market, as characterized by a willing buyer and seller engaging in an exchange transaction. Also, it is the Corporation's general practice and intent to hold its financial instruments (other than certain Investment Securities) to maturity and not to engage in trading or sales activities. Therefore, the Corporation had to use significant estimations and present value calculations to prepare this disclosure.
Changes in the assumptions or methodologies used to estimate fair values may materially affect the estimated amounts. Also, Management is concerned that there may not be reasonable comparability between institutions due to the wide range of permitted assumptions and methodologies in the absence of active markets. This lack of uniformity gives rise to a high degree of subjectivity in estimating financial instrument fair values.
Fair values have been estimated using data which Management considered the best available and estimation methodologies deemed suitable for the pertinent category of financial instrument. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, deposits with no stated maturities, repurchase agreements and the fair value of commitments to extend credit, is estimated based upon the amount of unamortized deferred loan commitment fees. The fair value of letters of credit is based on the amount of unearned fees plus the estimated cost to terminate the letter of credit. Quoted market prices were used to determine the estimated fair value of investment securities held-to-maturity and available-for-sale. Fair values of net loans and deposits with stated maturities were calculated using estimated discounted cash flows based on the year-end offering rate for instruments with similar characteristics and maturities.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The estimated fair values and carrying amounts are summarized as follows:
NOTE M - SUBORDINATED DEBT
In 2007, Trust III issued $5.0 million (net proceeds of $4.82 million) of preferred capital securities in a pooled institutional placement transaction. These securities were issued through Trust III, a special purpose statutory trust created expressly for the issuance of these securities and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures of the Corporation. These subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption in the year 2037. The debentures and securities will each be callable by the Corporation or Trust III, as applicable, at their option, five years after the date of issuance. At December 31, 2007, the rate paid on these subordinated debentures, based on three-month London Inter-bank offering rate (“LIBOR”) plus 140 basis points, was 6.52%.
In 2003, Trust II issued $10.0 million (net proceeds of $9.79 million) of preferred capital securities in a pooled institutional placement transaction. These securities were issued through Trust II, a special purpose statutory trust created expressly for the issuance of these securities and investing the proceeds in subordinated debentures of the Corporation. These subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption in the year 2033. The debentures and securities will each be callable by the Corporation or Trust II, as applicable, at their option, five years after the date of issuance. At December 31, 2007, the rate paid on these subordinated debentures, based on three-month LIBOR plus 295 basis points, was 7.86%.
In 2002, Trust I issued $5.0 million (net proceeds of $4.82 million) of preferred capital securities in a pooled institutional placement transaction. These securities were issued through Trust I, a special purpose statutory trust created expressly for the issuance of these securities and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures of the Corporation. These securities were redeemed by the Corporation on July 7, 2007, and, accordingly, Trust I was dissolved. The redemption of the debentures was coordinated with the $5.0 million Trust III issuance on June 29, 2007. The new issuance bears an interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 140 basis points while the redeemed issuance had an interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 365 basis points. The Corporation recorded a $161 thousand charge to interest expense for accelerated amortization of issuance costs on the redeemed issuance.
For 2007, 2006, and 2005, interest expense for Trust I, II & III was $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an average interest rate of 9.35%, 8.43%, 6.56%, respectively.
In March 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that continues to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities in Tier I Capital, but with stricter quantitative limits. Under the final rule, after a five-year transition period, the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be

NOTE M - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE CORPORATION’S SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES - continued
limited to 25% of Tier I Capital elements, net of goodwill. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in Tier II Capital, subject to restriction. Based on the final rule, the Corporation includes all of its $15.5 million in trust preferred securities in Tier I Capital.
NOTE N - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS OF
CREDIT RISK
The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers and reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risks in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments.
The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
Unless noted otherwise, the Corporation does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. The contract amounts are as follows:
(Dollars in thousands)
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk
Commitments to extend credit
$ 193,777
$ 253,870
Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written
9,115
12,628
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on Management's credit evaluation.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Corporation holds residential or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The extent of collateral held for those commitments at December 31, 2007 and 2006, varies up to 100%. Standby letters of credit are collateralized within Management policies. Commercial and standby letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers.
Substantially all of the Corporation's loans, commitments, and commercial and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Corporation's primary market area, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Investments in state and municipal securities also involve governmental entities within the Corporation's market area. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note C - Loans. Although the Corporation has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon Chester County’s economy. The distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding.

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Appearing as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, and 31.3 (the "302 Certifications") to this Annual Report are three certifications, one by each of the Corporation’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (the Corporation’s principal executive, operating, and accounting and financial officer, and, collectively, the "Principal Officers"). This Item 9A contains information concerning the evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures and matters regarding its internal control over financial reporting that are referred to in the Section 302 Certifications. This information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented in the 302 Certifications.
Discussion of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The SEC requires that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation’s CEO and CFO/Treasurer evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation's "disclosure controls and procedures" and report their conclusions on the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures in this Annual Report.
"Disclosure controls and procedures" mean the controls and other procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. The Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to Management, including the Principal Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management, including the Principal Officers, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, of the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, the Principal Officers have concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Corporation's principal executive and principal financial officers and implemented by Management and other personnel, subject to the oversight of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
FIRST CHESTER COUNTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management's Assessment
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, audited the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 and their report dated March 12, 2008, expressing an unqualified opinion, is included following this item 9A.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, there were no significant changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.
Based upon this assessment, Management believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Stockholders and Board of Directors First Chester County Corporation
We have audited First Chester County Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based oncriteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A corporation's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the corporation’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, First Chester County Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of First Chester County Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated March 12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion.
