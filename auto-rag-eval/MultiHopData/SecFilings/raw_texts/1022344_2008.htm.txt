Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 246 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 152.8 million square feet. Total estimated retail sales at the properties in 2008 were approximately $62 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 164 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.3 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 19,300 occupied stores, including approximately 740 anchors, which are mostly national retailers. The 16 regional malls acquired in the Mills acquisition are identified in this section as the Mills Regional Malls. These malls typically range in size from 700,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers.
Premium Outlet Centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center. Our 40 Premium Outlet Centers range in size from approximately 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet Centers are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Palm Springs, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
The Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 70 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 900,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 14 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.
The following table provides representative data for our U.S. properties on a gross basis as of December 31, 2008:
As of December 31, 2008, approximately 92.4% of the owned GLA in regional malls and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 98.9% of owned GLA in the Premium Outlet Centers was leased, approximately 94.5% of the owned GLA for The Mills and 87.4% of owned GLA for the Mills regional malls was leased, and approximately 90.7% of owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.
We own 100% of 203 of our properties, effectively control 18 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 103 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 314 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are
subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.
The following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, the Mills portfolio, and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2008.

Our properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan, primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.
Other International Investments
We also hold real estate interests in seven joint venture properties in Japan, one property in Mexico, one property in Korea, and one property in China. The seven Japanese Premium Outlet Centers operate in various cities throughout Japan and are held in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. and Sojitz Corporation (formerly known as Nissho Iwai Corporation).
