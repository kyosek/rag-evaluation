ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
During 2002, the Company’s production averaged 190.2 MMcfe per day, of which 170.6 MMcfe per day or 90% was attributed to the Wattenberg Field of Colorado’s D-J Basin. Accordingly, the Company’s proved reserves at December 31, 2002 were concentrated primarily in Wattenberg. The Company also has proven reserves associated with its Elysium acquisition made in late 2000, the grassroots projects initiated in 2001, and the Le Norman and Bravo acquisitions made in late 2002 which comprise the Company’s Mid Continent assets. The following table sets forth summary information with respect to estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2002.
The following table sets forth summary information with respect to oil and natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Wattenberg
The Company’s reserves are primarily concentrated in the Wattenberg Field, which is located in the D-J Basin of north central Colorado. Discovered in 1970, the field is located approximately 35 miles northeast of Denver and stretches over portions of Adams, Boulder, Broomfield and Weld counties in Colorado. One of the most attractive features of Wattenberg is the presence of several productive formations. In a section only 4,500 feet thick, there are up to eight potentially productive formations. Three of the formations, the Codell, Niobrara and J-Sand, are considered “blanket” zones in the area of the Company’s holdings, while others, such as the D-Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman, are more localized.
Drilling in Wattenberg is considered low risk from the perspective of finding oil and gas reserves, with better than 95% of the wells drilled being completed as producers. In May 1998, the COGCC adopted new spacing rules for the Wattenberg Field that greatly enhanced the Company’s ability to more efficiently develop its properties. The rule also eliminated costly and time-consuming procedures required for certain development activities. All formations in Wattenberg can now be drilled, produced and commingled from any or all of ten “drilling windows” on a 320 acre parcel.
In 2002, development expenditures in Wattenberg totaled $82.2 million. The Company’s current Wattenberg activities are primarily focused on the development of J-Sand reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores and refracing existing Codell wells. A refrac consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. These projects and continued success with the production enhancement program allowed the Company to increase its production and to add proved reserves in 2002 in what is considered a mature field.
During 2002, the Company drilled or deepened 58 wells to the J-Sand formation in Wattenberg. The cost of drilling and completing a J-Sand well approximates $350,000 while a completed deepening within an existing wellbore costs roughly $200,000. The reserves associated with a typical J-Sand well are more prolific than those of a Codell/Niobrara, with over 95% of such per well reserves comprised of natural gas. Consequently, the economics of a J-Sand project are more dependent on gas prices. Finding and development costs for the J-Sand drilling and deepening projects for 2002 averaged $1.04 per Mcfe with projected rates of return in excess of 30% based on actual prices received through year-end and futures prices thereafter. At December 31, 2002, the Company had 273 proven J-Sand drilling locations or deepening projects in inventory. The Company plans to drill or deepen approximately 80 wells in the J-Sand in 2003.
The Company performed 447 refracs in Wattenberg during 2002. The refrac program continues to be focused primarily on the Codell formation. A typical refrac costs approximately $135,000. The finding and development costs associated with the 2002 refrac program averaged $1.01 per Mcfe with projected rates of return in excess of 125% based on actual prices received through year-end and futures prices thereafter. At December 31, 2002, the Company had over 1,500 proven refrac projects. Given the exceptional results of the refrac program, the budgeted activity has been increased to over 450 refrac projects in 2003.
The Company also performed 11 recompletions and drilled eight Codell wells in the D-J Basin in 2002. The finding and development costs associated with these projects averaged $1.20 per Mcfe with projected rates of return of approximately 50% based on actual prices received through year-end and futures prices thereafter. The Company had an additional 650 Codell / J-Sand / Sussex proven recompletion opportunities and 450 Codell new drill opportunities at December 31, 2002. During 2002, tubing was installed in three wellbores and numerous well
workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones were performed. These projects, combined with the new drills, deepenings and refracs, were an integral part of the 2002 capital development program and helped fuel the 22% increase in the Company’s production over the prior year. The Company estimates it had over 500 of these minor projects in inventory at year-end 2002.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had working interests in approximately 3,200 gross (3,050 net) producing oil and gas wells in the D-J Basin with estimated proved reserves of 783.5 Bcfe, including 34.6 million barrels of oil and 576.2 Bcf of gas. Based upon a capital development budget of $150.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $90.9 million in Wattenberg in 2003.
Mid Continent
In November 2002, Patina acquired the stock of Le Norman Energy Corporation for $62.0 million in cash funded with borrowings under the Company’s bank facility and the issuance of 205,301 shares of the Company’s common stock. Le Norman’s properties are located primarily in the Anadarko and Ardmore-Marietta Basins of Oklahoma. The Le Norman properties primarily produce oil. In December 2002, Patina acquired the stock of Bravo Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for $119.0 million in cash funded with borrowings under the Company’s bank facility. Bravo’s properties are primarily located in Hemphill County, Texas and Custer and Caddo Counties of western Oklahoma, within the Anadarko Basin. The Bravo properties primarily produce gas. Together the Le Norman and Bravo properties comprise the Company’s Mid Continent assets.
The Loco Field is comprised of fourteen contiguous sections located in Stephens and Jefferson Counties, Oklahoma. The Field was discovered in 1913, producing from shallow oil formations at depths ranging from 60 feet to 1,300 feet. Secondary recovery operations have been implemented in the Field beginning with the unitization of the Loco Unit in 1956. The sediments draped over this anticline include productive intervals on more than twenty lenticular sandstone intervals. A typical infill well will encounter in excess of 100 feet of net productive pay. The Company acquired interests in the Field as part of the Le Norman acquisition. A continuous infill-drilling program is under way with plans to drill approximately 80 wells in 2003. Simultaneously, an expansion of the secondary recovery operations will be pursued.
The Santa Fe Field, located in Stephens County, Oklahoma, was discovered in 1917. The Field covers approximately thirteen contiguous sections, targeting shallow oil formations with productive sediments at depths ranging from 100 feet up to 1,200 feet. Certain portions of the Field are under secondary recovery while others remain on primary production. The productive intervals are comprised of over twenty lenticular sands, routinely exhibiting porosities greater than 30% with an average well exhibiting approximately 90 feet of net pay. Interests in the Field were acquired as part of the Le Norman acquisition. The Company also holds various rights to certain deeper horizons in the Field. The Company plans to continue to evaluate additional exploitation opportunities there. Current plans include the drilling of approximately 40 wells in 2003, primarily to shallow horizons. The Company will continue to optimize and implement secondary recovery operations in the Field.
The Company acquired interests in the Buffalo Wallow Field as part of the Bravo acquisition. The Field is located in Hemphill County in the Texas Panhandle. The primary producing horizons, which generally produce natural gas, are comprised of various intervals in the Granite Wash sequence. The productive intervals are comprised entirely of a series of stratigraphically trapped sands with an average gross interval of 700 feet. An average well will contain 100 feet to 250 feet of net pay. The Field is currently being developed on 80 acre spacing. However, the Company believes the Field could be down spaced to 40-acre locations. The Company has identified potential improvements in stimulation methods to be applied on new completions as well as the restimulation of certain previously treated intervals. The Company plans to drill approximately 30 wells in the Buffalo Wallow Field during 2003.
The Eakley-Weatherford Field is located in western Oklahoma in Caddo and Custer Counties within the Anadarko Basin. Productive intervals include the Skinner, Red Fork, and Morrow producing sands ranging at depths of 10,000 feet to 13,000 feet. The deeper Springer series sands are also productive in the area at depths of approximately 15,000 feet. Interests in the Field were acquired as part of the Bravo acquisition. The Company plans to drill approximately six wells in the area during 2003 while continuing its evaluation of the acreage position. Various wells in the Field exhibit productive behind pipe intervals that will eventually be exploited.
During 2002, development expenditures for the Mid Continent region totaled $4.6 million for the drilling of 33 wells primarily in the Loco and Santa Fe Fields in Oklahoma. Estimated proved reserves attributed to the Mid Continent region totaled 231.9 Bcfe, including 14.8 million barrels of oil and 142.9 Bcf of gas. Based upon a capital development budget of $150.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $42.6 million in the Mid Continent region in 2003. This estimate includes $4.7 million of capital for the development of properties to be acquired in the Le Norman Partners (“LNP”) transaction which is expected to close in March 2003. However, there can be no assurance that the LNP acquisition will be completed.
Elysium
In November 2000, Patina acquired various property interests out of bankruptcy through Elysium Energy, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company, in which Patina holds a 50% interest. The Company proportionately consolidates its 50% interest in Elysium’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Elysium’s oil and gas properties are located in central Kansas, the Illinois Basin and the San Joaquin Field in California. The Elysium properties primarily produce oil. During 2002, development expenditures for Elysium totaled $11.5 million ($5.7 million net to Patina), for the drilling or deepening of 38 wells and performing 52 recompletions, primarily in the Illinois Basin, Kansas and California. Elysium sold certain properties in the Lake Washington Field in Louisiana for $30.5 million in March 2001 ($15.25 million net to the Company). Daily production from these properties (net to Patina) averaged 13,978 Mcfe, comprised of 2,195 barrels and 806 Mcf per day in 2002. Patina’s 50% share of Elysium’s estimated proved reserves totaled 51.8 Bcfe, including 7.9 million barrels of oil and 4.1 Bcf of gas. In January 2003, the Company acquired the remainder of the joint venture for $25.8 million, simultaneously divesting the remainder of Lake Washington and all California assets. Based upon a capital development budget of $150.0 million, the Company anticipates spending $8.7 million on the Elysium properties in 2003.
Grassroots Projects
In 2001, the Company earned a 50% non-operated working interest in a coal bed methane project (“Castlegate”) near Price, Utah. This interest included nine existing producing coal bed methane wells and 49,100 gross acres (21,500 net acres). The Company’s interest was earned through a capital expenditure commitment of $7.5 million, which was fulfilled during 2001 by drilling nine additional wells and installing various gas processing and water disposal facilities. During 2002, capital expenditures totaled $555,000 for completing the final stages of the water disposal facility. The project currently has 18 producing wells. At December 31, 2002, the Company had spent $8.9 million on this project, including the capital commitment and additional acquisition costs. Proved reserves at year-end totaled 26.4 Bcfe, all of which were natural gas.
In early 2001, the Company acquired 68,200 gross acres (68,200 net acres) in central Wyoming (“Antelope Arch”) for $3.6 million and formed a Federal unit over a portion of the acreage. There are up to eight potentially productive formations at various depths targeted on the prospect. The Company drilled its first well in December 2001 and completed it in the Frontier, the deepest target formation. The well was productive and is producing 200 Mcf per day. During 2002, capital expenditures totaled $1.6 million related to a horizontal sidetrack in the original Frontier well. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had expended $5.9 million on this project. No proved reserves associated with the project were booked as of year-end.
The Company also accumulated 23,200 gross acres (18,800 net acres) in the Piceance Basin of northwest Colorado (“Sugarloaf”) in 2001. The primary objective of the prospect is the shallow coal bed methane, with additional objectives in the tight-sand Mesa Verde and a deeper fractured shale interval. During 2002, capital expenditures were $2.7 million for the drilling of five wells as part of a coal bed methane pilot program. As of December 31, 2002, roughly $4.4 million had been expended on the project. As these wells are in the early de-watering stages, no proved reserves were recorded as of year-end.
In July 2001, the Company acquired 19,600 gross acres (19,400 net acres) with 95 producing gas wells in West Texas (“Adams Baggett”). During 2002, capital expenditures totaled $1.4 million for the drilling of four wells. Proved reserves at year-end totaled 7.9 Bcfe, all of which was natural gas. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has expended $5.4 million on this project. The Company anticipates spending $2.1 million for the drilling of approximately eight wells on the project in 2003.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth estimated net proved reserves for the three years ended December 31, 2002.
The following table sets forth the estimated pretax future net revenues as of year-end 2002 from the production of proved reserves and the pretax present value discounted at 10% of such revenues, net of estimated future capital costs, including an estimate of $132.0 million of future development costs in 2003 (in thousands):
______________
(a) The after tax present value discounted at 10% of the proved reserves totaled $1.0 billion at year-end 2002.
The Wattenberg Field represents 69% of the pretax PV10% value and 783.5 Bcfe or 71% of Patina’s proved reserves.
The quantities and values in the preceding tables are based on constant prices in effect at December 31, 2002, which averaged $30.51 per barrel of oil and $3.67 per Mcf of gas. These wellhead average prices were based on year-end NYMEX prices of $31.20 per barrel and $4.74 per MMBtu. Price declines decrease reserve values by lowering the future net revenues attributable to the reserves and reducing the quantities of reserves that are recoverable on an economic basis. Price increases have the opposite effect. A significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods under current economic conditions. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
Future prices received from production and future production costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be developed within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. There can be no assurance that actual production will equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections.
The present values shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The quantities and values shown in the preceding tables are based on oil and natural gas prices in effect on December 31, 2002. The value of the Company’s assets is in part dependent on the prices the Company receives for oil and natural gas, and a significant decline in the price of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate, and present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. For properties operated by the Company, expenses exclude Patina’s share of overhead charges. In addition, the calculation of estimated future net revenues does not take into account the effect of various cash outlays, including, among other things general and administrative costs and interest expense.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil and gas reserve engineering must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may justify revisions. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often materially different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
The proved oil and gas reserves and future revenues as of December 31, 2002 were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”). On an annual basis, the Company files the Department of Energy Form EIA-23, “Annual Survey of Oil and Gas Reserves,” as required by operators of domestic oil and gas properties. There are differences between the reserves as reported on Form EIA-23 and reserves as reported herein. Form EIA-23 requires that operators report on total proved developed reserves for operated wells only and that the reserves be reported on a gross operated basis rather than on a net interest basis.
Producing Wells
The following table sets forth the producing wells in which the Company owned a working interest at December 31, 2002. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream.
The Company had 231 wells (223 net) in Wattenberg, 1,438 wells (671 net) in Elysium, and 574 well (546 net) in the Mid Continent region that were shut-in at December 31, 2002. The Company’s average working interest in the Wattenberg wells was approximately 95% and the average working interest in the Elysium wells was approximately 94% (47% net to Patina), while the average working interest in the Mid Continent wells was 72%.
Drilling Results
The following table sets forth the number of wells drilled or deepened by the Company during the past three years. All wells in 2000 were development wells and drilled in Wattenberg. During 2001, the Company drilled or deepened 68 development wells (64 net) in Wattenberg, drilled 16 development wells (eight net) in the Illinois Basin (through Elysium) and drilled nine development coal bed methane wells (five net) in Utah. The Company drilled one exploratory well in Wyoming at the end of 2001. During 2002, the Company drilled or deepened 66 development wells (62 net) in Wattenberg, drilled 24 development wells (12 net) in the Illinois Basin, drilled or deepened 16 development wells (eight net) in Kansas, and two wells (one net) in California (through Elysium), drilled 33 development wells (31 net) in the Mid Continent region, and drilled four gas wells on its grassroots projects (four net). The Company also drilled five exploratory coal bed methane wells (five net) in the northwest Colorado. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had ten wells (ten net) in Wattenberg, 22 wells (20 net) in the Mid Continent region, and one well (one net) in Elysium waiting on completion. The Company drilled five (five net) exploratory coal bed methane wells in northwest Colorado. These wells are in the early de-watering stages pending further evaluation.
Acreage
The following table sets forth the leasehold acreage held by the Company at December 31, 2002. Undeveloped acreage is acreage held under lease, permit, contract or option that is not in a spacing unit for a producing well, including leasehold interests identified for development or exploratory drilling. Developed acreage is acreage assigned to producing wells.
