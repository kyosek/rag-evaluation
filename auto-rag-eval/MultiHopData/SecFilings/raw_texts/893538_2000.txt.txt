ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Domestic Operations
St. Mary's exploration, development and acquisition activities are focused in five core operating areas: the Mid-Continent region; onshore Gulf Coast and offshore Gulf of Mexico; the ArkLaTex region; the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana; and the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico. Information concerning each of our major areas of operations, based on our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, is shown below.
Mid-Continent Region. Since 1973 St. Mary has been active in the Mid-Continent region, where operations are managed by our 30-person Tulsa, Oklahoma office. We have ongoing exploration and development programs in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas. The Mid-Continent region accounted for 34% of our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, or 110.0 BCFE (84% proved developed and 91% gas). St. Mary participated in 63 gross wells and recompletions in this region in 2000, including 22 Company-operated wells.
St. Mary's development and exploration budget in the Mid-Continent region for 2001 totals $27 million. We plan to operate 32 drilling wells in the Mid-Continent region during 2001 and to utilize three to four drilling rigs throughout the year. We also expect to participate in an additional 10 to 15 wells to be operated by other entities.
Anadarko Basin. Our long history of operations and proprietary geologic knowledge enables us to sustain economic development and exploration programs despite periods of adverse industry conditions. We are applying state of the art technology in hydraulic fracturing and innovative well completion techniques to accelerate production and associated cash flow from the region's tight gas reservoirs. We also continue to benefit from a continuing consolidation of operators in the basin. St. Mary periodically seizes attractive opportunities to acquire properties from companies that have elected to discontinue operations in the basin. The $32 million acquisition of properties from JN Exploration and affiliates that closed in December 2000 is a good example of this type of opportunity.
St. Mary works aggressively to control its operating costs and to enhance its full cycle economics. In December 1998 we realized net proceeds of $22 million on the sale of our interests in eight fields in the Anadarko Basin. This sale was part of our ongoing strategy to enhance the return on our portfolio of assets through the opportunistic sale of non-strategic properties during periods in the market when such properties command premium valuations.
Drilling activities for 2001 will be focused on lower to medium-risk prospects in the Granite Wash, Osborne and Red Fork formations. In addition, St. Mary plans to devote approximately 22% of its 2001 Mid-Continent capital budget to deeper, higher potential development wells in the lower Morrow formation below 19,000 feet at the NE Mayfield Field and in various other fields within the Morrow and Springer formations at depths between 10,000 and 16,000 feet.
Carrier Prospect. Within its inventory of large exploration prospects, St. Mary holds an aggregate 11.2% working interest in 25,800 acres in Leon County, Texas in the Cotton Valley reef play. Our Carrier Prospect acreage is located approximately nine miles east of the trend of the industry's initial prolific reef discoveries, and targets potentially larger reefs that are postulated to have developed in the deeper waters of the basin during the Jurassic period. St. Mary and its partners completed a 52 square mile 3-D seismic survey in 1997. We are currently soliciting partner and industry participation for an initial test well.
Constitution / China Beach Prospects. The successful fracture stimulation in 1999 has led to additional drilling at this prospect. St. Mary participated in the drilling of the Apache Gas Unit #1 in 2000 where three Yegua sands were encountered, and the well was completed at 3,700 MCFE per day. Three additional wells are planned to be drilled in the Constitution field for 2001 that will test multiple Yegua sand objectives.
Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico Region. St. Mary's presence in south Louisiana dates to the early 1900's when St. Mary's founders acquired a franchise property in St. Mary Parish on the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. These 24,900 acres of fee lands yielded more than $7 million of gross oil and gas royalty revenue in 2000. St. Mary's onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico presence increased dramatically in 1999 with the acquisition of King Ranch Energy and is expected to be a major growth area in 2001 and beyond. This acquisition included 260,000 gross undeveloped acres (81,000 net acres) and 1,538 square miles of 3-D seismic data. The Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region accounted for 15% of St. Mary's estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, or 53.1 BCFE (82% proved developed and 87% gas).
St. Mary's diverse activities in the onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico are managed by its recently expanded 18-person regional office in Lafayette, Louisiana, and include ongoing development and exploration programs in Point Coupee, Cameron, Lafourche, Jefferson Davis, Vermilion and Calcasieu parishes as well as several offshore Gulf of Mexico blocks. Advanced 3-D seismic imaging and interpretation techniques are revitalizing exploration and development activities in the Miocene trend along the Gulf Coast. St. Mary is applying the latest technologies to unravel the region's complex geology and to extend exploratory drilling into deeper untested formations. Our exploration and development budget in the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region for 2001 is $37.5 million.
The Judge Digby Field is the largest field acquired in the King Ranch Energy acquisition and is located outside Baton Rouge in Point Coupee Parish. St. Mary has an 11.5% to 20% working interest in eight wells currently producing 185 MMcf per day. This ultra deep field produces from multiple Tuscaloosa reservoirs between 19,000 and 24,000 feet. The Parlange #11 was drilled to 23,480 feet and initially produced at 92,000 Mcf per day, the highest rate ever recorded for onshore Louisiana. This well is currently producing 55,000 Mcf per day. During late 2000 the J. Wuertelle #1 was drilled to a total depth of 22,200 feet and was completed in early 2001 at a rate of 25,000 Mcf per day. This well is currently producing 35-40,000 Mcf per day. We are currently participating in the drilling of the Parlange #12 which is scheduled to be drilled to 23,100 feet and test the C-4 and C-5 sands, which have never been tested at a structurally favorable position in the field. This well has already logged over 200 feet of pay and is currently drilling ahead to the C-4 and C-5 sands.
St. Mary and its partners are continuing to evaluate the 30 square mile 3-D survey on the western and northern flanks of the Edgerly salt dome in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana where a 16,000-acre leasehold position has been assembled. The Collingwood #24-1 was completed in 2000 for 2,700 Mcf and 425 Bbl per day. We have identified a number of other promising anomalies on the 3-D survey and expect to test two Hackberry prospects at shallow depths between 10,000 and 13,000 feet in 2001. St. Mary has an approximate 35% working interest in the Edgerly prospect.
St. Mary's acquisition of King Ranch Energy, its historical presence in southern Louisiana, its established network of industry relationships and its extensive technical database on the area have enabled us to assemble an inventory of prospects in the onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region.
In the Gulf of Mexico, St. Mary plans to test a large 3-D target at Matagorda 701 during 2001. Matagorda 701 is located 50 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas in 110 feet of water. We also plan to test a large fault block on the east flank of the Matagorda 700 field in 2001.
Fee Lands. St. Mary owns 24,900 acres of fee lands and associated mineral rights in St. Mary Parish located approximately 85 miles southwest of New Orleans. Since the initial discovery on St. Mary's fee lands in 1938, cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowners' royalties, to St. Mary from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle fields on its fee lands have exceeded $230 million. St. Mary currently leases 11,784 acres of its fee lands and has an additional 13,130 acres that are presently unleased. Our principal lessees are Vastar, Cabot, ExxonMobil, Badger and Sam Gary Jr. and Associates, a private exploration company headquartered in Denver.
We have encouraged development drilling by our lessees, facilitated the origination of new prospects on acreage not held by production and stimulated exploration interest in deeper, untested horizons. St. Mary's discovery on our fee lands at South Horseshoe Bayou in early 1997 and a subsequent successful confirmation well in early 1998 proved that significant accumulations of gas are sourced and trapped at depths below 16,000 feet.
Centennial Project. St. Mary is participating in a 51 square mile 3-D seismic survey over the Spindletop field near Beaumont, Texas, which should be complete in late March 2001. St. Mary and its partners have leased or optioned approximately 19,000 acres and intend to exploit a variety of formations, including the Miocene, Frio, Hackberry, Discorbis, Vicksburg and Yegua sands. We have a 21.25% working interest in the Centennial project, which is planned to be a multi-year exploration and development program. St. Mary and its partners plan to drill four to six wells in 2001 after evaluating the results of the seismic survey.
ArkLaTex Region. St. Mary's operations in the ArkLaTex region are managed by its 16-person office in Shreveport, Louisiana. The ArkLaTex region accounted for 15% of St. Mary's estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, or 51.7 BCFE (86% proved developed and 82% gas).
In 1992 St. Mary acquired the ArkLaTex oil and gas properties of T. L. James & Company, Inc. as well as rights to over 6,000 square miles of proprietary 2-D seismic data in the region. Much of the Shreveport office's successful exploration and development programs have derived from niche acquisitions completed since 1992 totaling $9.5 million. These acquisitions have provided access to strategic holdings of undeveloped acreage and proprietary packages of geologic and seismic data, resulting in an active program of additional development and exploration.
Our holdings in the ArkLaTex region are comprised of interests in approximately 556 producing wells, including 94 Company-operated wells, and interests in leases totaling approximately 88,000 gross acres and mineral servitudes totaling approximately 15,800 gross acres.
Activities in the ArkLaTex region during 2000 focused on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields as well as final development of several important field discoveries made by our geoscientists since 1994. We have expanded into southern Mississippi where the objective is to leverage our technical expertise in the Mississippi salt play.
St. Mary participated in two successful wells in 2000 at the East Bridges field where it completed the Jones #1 and Jones #2 wells as multi-lateral wells, each with initial production exceeding 4,000 Mcf per day.
The Shreveport office operates the Clarksville Field (44% working interest) in Red River County, Texas acquired as part of King Ranch Energy. The field currently produces 518 Bbl per day from 34 wells.
In 2001 we will continue to focus on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields in which to apply our proprietary geologic models and production techniques. The capital budget for the ArkLaTex region is $11 million, a 59% increase over 2000 expenditures. The Shreveport office anticipates participating in 35 wells in the ArkLaTex region and expects to operate 77% of its 2001 capital expenditures budget.
Williston Basin Region. Nance Petroleum Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Mary, has conducted operations in the Williston Basin in eastern Montana and western North Dakota on behalf of St. Mary since 1991. The Williston Basin region accounted for 25% of St. Mary's estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, or 88.1 BCFE (96% proved developed and 84% oil).
Our office in Billings, Montana includes a 22-person staff, some of whom have spent over 20 years and their entire careers in the Williston Basin. Exploration and development in the Williston Basin is based on the interpretation of 3-D seismic data. We have successfully used 3-D seismic imaging to delineate structure and porosity development in the Red River formation. Since 1991 we have successfully completed 24 out of 25 wells drilled and operated. Our prospect inventory continues to expand as results from current activity lead to additional areas to conduct 3-D seismic surveys. Six 3-D surveys are planned for 2001, exceeding the number of surveys conducted in any prior year.
St. Mary spent $12.6 million on exploration and development in the Williston Basin in 2000. Its only dry hole since 1991 was drilled early in 2000 followed by 11 successful wells, 5 of which were operated by us. The Federal 16-28X (56.25% working interest) drilled to the Duperow formation had an initial production rate of 640 barrels of oil per day and 450 Mcf per day. In addition to its exploration and development efforts, St. Mary acquired $13.3 million of oil and gas properties in 5 niche acquisitions that added 5,475 MCFE per day of production.
Our 2001 Williston Basin exploration and development capital program is budgeted for $12 million. We plan to drill nine operated wells with working interests ranging from 70% to 100%. Rig availability is limited in the Williston Basin. We have minimized the impact of the tight rig situation by committing to keep one drilling rig utilized throughout the year. St. Mary plans to operate 85% of its Williston Basin capital budget in 2001.
Permian Basin Region. The Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of eastern New Mexico and western Texas and is one of the major producing basins in the United States. The basin includes hundreds of oil fields undergoing secondary and enhanced recovery projects. 3-D seismic imaging of existing fields and state-of-the-art secondary recovery programs are substantially increasing oil recoveries in the Permian Basin.
Our holdings in the Permian Basin derive from a series of niche property acquisitions since 1995, which total $21.9 million. We believe that our Permian Basin operations provide us with a solid base of long lived oil reserves, promising longer-term exploration and development prospects and the potential for secondary recovery projects. The Permian Basin region accounted for 11% of our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2000, or 38.1 BCFE (84% proved developed and 66% oil).
St. Mary participated in drilling 9 wells in 2000 with a 67% success rate. The $1.7 million spent on exploration and development resulted in adding reserves of 2,317 MMCFE. The East Shugart Delaware Unit waterflood project was initiated in 2000. Although an initial response from the water injection is not anticipated until late 2001, we are hopeful the East Shugart waterflood will be an analog to the successful Parkway Delaware Unit waterflood that increased production from 450 Bbl per day in 1998 when the waterflood was initiated to 1,250 Bbl per day currently.
The Permian Basin capital expenditures budget for 2001 is $6.0 million. In addition to drilling four injection wells in the East Shugart Delaware waterflood, two Morrow tests are planned in the Parkway field and a Queen development well is planned at the Young North field. The HJSA toplease on 30,450 acres in Ward County, Texas became effective on August 5, 2000 and at year-end was producing 3,250 MCFE per day net to St. Mary. 3-D seismic data over the 50 square mile lease will be reprocessed during the first quarter of 2001 with exploitation drilling, based on the results of the 3-D seismic evaluation, anticipated during the year. We anticipate significant opportunities will develop with respect to our 21.4% interest in this lease.
Acquisitions
Our strategy is to make selective niche acquisitions of oil and gas properties within our core operating areas in the United States. We seek to acquire properties that complement our existing operations, offer economies of scale and provide further development and exploration opportunities based on proprietary geologic concepts or advanced well completion techniques. We believe that our success in acquiring attractively priced and under-exploited properties has resulted from our focus on transactions where we have specialized geologic knowledge or operating experience. In addition, we will pursue corporate acquisitions when they can be made on an accretive basis.
St. Mary completed $53.5 million in oil and gas property acquisitions in 2000, the largest dollar value in our history. In December 2000 we completed a $32.0 million acquisition of oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent region. We also made $13.3 million of niche acquisitions in the Williston Basin in five separate transactions. The remaining $8.2 million was comprised of niche acquisitions made in the ArkLaTex region, the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region and the Permian Basin. During the last five years we have closed over $151 million of acquisitions where proprietary geologic knowledge or operating expertise and an attractive stock and performance track record have afforded us a competitive advantage.
For 2001 St. Mary has reserved $60 million of its capital program budget for property acquisitions. However, we have the financial capacity to commit substantially greater resources to purchases should additional opportunities be identified.
Reserves
At December 31, 2000, Ryder Scott Company, independent petroleum engineers, evaluated properties representing approximately 82% of St. Mary's total PV-10 value and St. Mary evaluated the remainder. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated net proved oil and gas reserves owned by St. Mary. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated, but prices include the effects of hedging contracts.
The following table sets forth summary information with respect to the estimates of our net proved oil and gas reserves for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, as prepared by Ryder Scott Company and us:
The present value of estimated future net revenues before income taxes of our reserves was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2000. This present value is based on a benchmark of prices in effect at that date of $26.80 per barrel of oil (NYMEX) and $9.52 per MMBtu of gas (Gulf Coast spot price). Both of these prices are then adjusted for transportation and basis differential. These prices were 5 percent and 310 percent higher, respectively, than prices in effect at the end of 1999. If we used five-year declining strip pricing, resulting in average prices over the life of the properties of $3.96 per Mcf and $24.67 per barrel, our PV-10 value would be $550 million.
Production
The following table summarizes the average volumes of oil and gas produced from properties in which St. Mary held an interest during the periods indicated:
[FN] (1) Production from South Horseshoe Bayou and sold Oklahoma properties represented 18.1% and 6.5% respectively, or a total of 24.6% of the 1998 production total. (2) Includes the effects of St. Mary's hedging activities (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations").
St. Mary uses financial hedging instruments, primarily fixed-for-floating price swap agreements and no-cost collar agreements with financial counterparties, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We also employ the use of exchange-listed financial futures and options as part of our hedging program for crude oil.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information regarding the number of productive wells in which St. Mary held a working interest at December 31, 2000. Productive wells are either producing wells or wells capable of commercial production although currently shut in. One or more completions in the same wellbore are counted as one well. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced when it first commenced production, and such designation may not be indicative of current production.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth the wells drilled and recompleted in which St. Mary participated during each of the three years indicated:
[FN] (1) Does not include 4 gross wells and 1 gross well completed on St. Mary's fee lands during 2000 and 1998, respectively.
All of our drilling activities are conducted on a contract basis with independent drilling contractors. We do not own any drilling equipment.
Domestic Acreage
The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases, fee properties, mineral servitudes and lease options held by St. Mary as of December 31, 2000. Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests that may already have been classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves.
[FN] ----------- (1) Developed acreage is acreage assigned to producing wells for the spacing unit of the producing formation. Developed acreage in certain of St. Mary's properties that include multiple formations with different well spacing requirements may be considered undeveloped for certain formations, but have only been included as developed acreage in the presentation above. (2) Undeveloped acreage is lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains estimated net proved reserves. (3) Includes interests in Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah and Wyoming. St. Mary also holds an override interest in an additional 44,388 gross acres in Utah.
Other Assets
KMOC Stock. In February 2000 St. Mary exercised its option to convert its Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation production payment receivable into common stock of KMOC. In July 2000 we finalized a negotiated value for the receivable that equated to 21,583 shares of KMOC common stock under the terms of the original agreement. In December 2000 we sold 14,662 of these shares and recognized a net gain of $2.2 million.
ITEM 3.
