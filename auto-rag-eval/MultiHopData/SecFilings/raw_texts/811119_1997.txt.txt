ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
As of the last day of February 1997, the Company's network of 49 refrigerated warehouse facilities in 17 states provided a total storage capacity of approximately 245.0 million cubic feet (compared to approximately 228.9 million cubic feet of storage capacity as of the last day of February 1996). Included in the Company's total storage capacity at February 28, 1997 is approximately 4.2 million cubic feet of storage capacity added in Pasco, Washington in September 1996; 2.9 million cubic feet of storage capacity added in Burley, Idaho in October 1996; and 7.6 million cubic feet added in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania in February 1997. In addition, the Company completed in November 1996 the construction of a new warehouse facility in Park Rapids, Minnesota, which added approximately 1.9 million cubic feet. The Company is also leasing 1.9 million cubic feet of warehouse space at Park Rapids. Although negotiations for a joint venture ownership structure for the Park Rapids property are underway, the Company will continue to act as the operator of the facility. At the end of their respective leases, the Company vacated in February 1997 its Chicago (S. Blue Island Avenue), Illinois facility and, in March 1997, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, its Kent, Washington facility. The facilities totaled approximately 3.8 million cubic feet and were marginally profitable.
Although most of the facilities are owned by the Company, nine facilities comprising approximately 7.8% of the Company's total cubic feet of storage space are leased or subleased by the Company under operating-type lease arrangements. In addition, four facilities representing approximately 5.0% of the total cubic feet of storage space are leased, in whole or in part, under capitalized-type lease arrangements. Five facilities, or portions thereof, representing approximately 8.2% of the total cubic feet of storage space, are situated on leased land.
Capacity utilization at the Company's facilities varies from season to season, with an average annual capacity utilization of approximately 72%. All but seven of the Company's owned warehouses are currently encumbered as security for the senior secured debt of the Company.
The Company's facilities are typically single-story concrete or insulated panel buildings constructed at dock height elevation, with very heavy insulation and vapor barrier protection. Refrigeration is generally supplied by screw-type compressors in ammonia-based cooling systems. All facilities are served by truck and all but seven are served by rail. Many facilities also have room for expansion.
The following table lists the 49 refrigerated warehouse properties owned or leased by the Company as of February 28, 1997. It also shows the 31 facilities that presently secure the Company's first mortgage bonds, and two facilities that presently secure the mortgages payable.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
INTRODUCTION - ------------
This document contains certain "forward-looking" statements as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to the Company that are based on the beliefs of the Company's management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company's management. When used in this document, the words "expect", "believe", "estimate", "intend" and "anticipate" and words or phrases of similar import, as they relate to the Company or Company's management, are intended to identify "forward-looking" statements. Such statements should be considered in the context of the current risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to certain factors including, without limitation, substantial leverage, net losses, restrictions imposed by debt agreements, substantial payment obligations, dependence on significant customers, expansion of transportation management services, dependence on agricultural markets and frozen foods and competitive factors, as well as the factors discussed in Exhibit 99 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. Should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as expected, believed, estimated, intended or anticipated.
OVERVIEW - --------
Americold provides integrated logistics services for the frozen food industry consisting of warehousing and transportation management. These services are provided through the Company's network of 49 refrigerated warehouses and its refrigerated transportation management unit.
DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES - Over the past several years, the Company has experienced increased interest by customers in procuring transportation management services. In this regard, the Company entered into arrangements in the first half of fiscal 1996 pursuant to which it provides such services to three subsidiaries of one large customer. Transportation management services provided to these three customers account for substantially all of the Company's transportation management revenues in fiscal 1996 and 1997. The Company has made proposals to offer similar services to certain other potential customers by emphasizing its full-service logistics expertise and warehouse industry position which enable customers to obtain services to support the distribution of frozen food products from a single provider. The Company believes that its transportation management activities may lead to stronger customer relationships and increased revenues in the higher-margin warehousing business.
As the Company does not invest in or own transportation equipment, the Company has entered into contracts with independent carriers to provide freight transportation at negotiated rates. Accordingly, the margins that the Company earns in providing transportation management services are lower than for its warehousing services.
DEVELOPMENT OF REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSE PROPERTIES - The Company continually evaluates the need for warehouse space and intends to pursue growth of its refrigerated warehouse business both by expanding its network of warehouses and by expanding existing facilities in response to customer requirements. Since August 1994 (mid-fiscal 1995), the Company has added approximately 33.7 million cubic feet of storage capacity in six locations. Two of such facilities became operational in fiscal 1995, three in fiscal 1996 and one in fiscal 1997. Three additional facilities were expanded in fiscal 1997. The 33.7 million cubic feet increase, net of warehouse closures discussed below, represents an 7.1% increase in available warehouse space.
Since August 1994, the Company has reduced the amount of available refrigerated warehouse space by approximately 17.7 million cubic feet due to the sale of one property, termination of four operating leases in the Prepackaged Bankruptcy in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 and the non-renewal of four other operating leases. The Company expects that the effects of the closure of these facilities, which are considered non-strategic, will have a positive effect on future gross operating margin as a percentage of net sales.
PREPACKAGED BANKRUPTCY - During the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company solicited acceptance of a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the "Plan") under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Prepackaged Bankruptcy"). The principal purpose of the Plan was to reduce the Company's short-term cash requirements with respect to payments due on its subordinated indebtedness by extending the maturity on such indebtedness from May 1997 to November 2007 and to adjust certain restrictive financial covenants and certain other provisions contained in an agreement with one of its principal lenders. Each holder of the Company's 11% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 1997 ("11% Debentures") received a corresponding amount of the Company's new 15% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2007 ("15% Debentures") at par, plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Company believes that the effect of the Plan has been to improve the Company's financial position by postponing the maturity of its subordinated debt and increasing the likelihood that the Company will realize the benefits of its capital expenditures and the continuing expansion of its transportation management activities. The Company remains highly leveraged, however, and will continue to be subject to substantial principal and interest obligations with respect to its indebtedness.
For fiscal 1996 and 1997, the Company incurred approximately $7.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in reorganization fees and expenses related to the Prepackaged Bankruptcy. In addition, the write-off of unamortized original issue discount and unamortized issuance costs related to the exchange of the 11% Debentures and the repurchase of $10.0 million in principal amount of the Company's 11.45% First Mortgage Bonds, Series A due 2002 (the "Series A Bonds") in the Prepackaged Bankruptcy resulted in an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 1996.
OFFERING OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES - On April 9, 1996, the Company sold $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 12.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "12.875% Notes"). The Company used $115.0 million of the proceeds to redeem at par on May 9, 1996 all of the 15% Debentures.
EFFECT OF THE ACQUISITION - In December 1986, Kelso, certain institutional investors and the Management Group purchased the Company. The Company's operating results and cash flow have been and will continue to be materially affected by the indebtedness incurred to finance the Acquisition. For fiscal 1996 and 1997, interest expense, principally related to debt incurred to finance the Acquisition, totaled $56.6 million and $56.7 million, respectively.
HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION - ---------------------------------------
The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended the last day of February 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively, certain consolidated financial data for the Company, expressed as a percentage of net sales, and the percentage changes in the dollar amount as compared to the prior period.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------
NET SALES - The Company's net sales increased 11.1% from $279.8 million for fiscal 1996 to $310.8 million for fiscal 1997, reflecting a substantial increase in transportation management sales as well as a 0.1% decrease in warehousing sales.
Warehousing sales decreased from $201.4 million for fiscal 1996 to $201.2 million for fiscal 1997, principally due to a 2.8% decrease in storage revenue. Storage revenue decreased due to a decrease in storage volume from approximately 1.56 billion pounds stored on average per month for fiscal 1996 to approximately 1.51 billion pounds stored on average per month for fiscal 1997. Storage volume decreased 0.04 billion pounds stored on average per month for fiscal 1997 due to the closure of the Company's operations at four warehouse locations during the third quarter of fiscal 1996 and decreased 0.11 billion pounds at the continuing locations. The increase in storage volumes at the three facilities that were added in fiscal 1996 of 0.05 billion pounds stored on average per month and of 0.06 billion pounds stored on average per month for the fiscal 1997 additions helped offset such decreases. The Company's storage levels in fiscal 1997 were affected by the wet spring weather, primarily in the Northwest, which reduced or delayed the receipt of product, especially fruits and vegetables. In addition, due to the high price of fresh potatoes in late spring calendar 1996, potato processors extended their downtime, which reduced warehouse receipts and storage volumes at certain warehouses.
Handling revenue increased 5.6% from $76.2 million for fiscal 1996 to $80.5 million for fiscal 1997, resulting primarily from a 3.5% increase in volume of product handled, further affected by price increases and changes in product mix. For fiscal 1996, 20.9 billion pounds of product were handled by the Company compared with 21.6 billion pounds during fiscal 1997. The three new facilities added in fiscal 1996 handled an increase of approximately 0.4 billion pounds of product during fiscal 1997, while the continuing locations handled an increase of approximately 0.1 billion pounds of product. The fiscal 1997 additions handled approximately 0.6 billion pounds of product, which helped offset the approximately 0.4 billion pounds of product handled during fiscal 1996 at the four closed facilities. The increase in handling volume relative to storage volume is likely to continue as long as the Company's customers are able to successfully operate with lower inventories.
The Company anticipates that vegetable processors will continue to maintain lower inventories during early fiscal 1998. Expected storage levels for potatoes and other items for fiscal 1998 are also expected to be lower than the prior year. Overall, the Company anticipates that revenues and storage volumes at the existing facilities will be lower in the first two quarters of fiscal 1998 as compared to the same period in fiscal 1997. The Company expects such decrease will be offset in part by sales and storage volumes contributed by the new warehouse properties, including expansions, added in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1997.
Transportation management sales increased 41.0% from $74.2 million for fiscal 1996 to $104.6 million for fiscal 1997, due to the outsourcing to the Company of additional transportation management responsibilities by three customers in the first half of fiscal 1996.
Other non-logistics sales (quarry sales) increased 19.0% from $4.2 million for fiscal 1996 to $5.0 million for fiscal 1997.
Net sales increased 30.0% from fiscal 1995 to fiscal 1996. The increase in warehousing sales was primarily the result of increases in storage and handling revenue due to the increased storage prices and changes in mix along with increased handling volumes. Transportation management sales increased 312.2% in fiscal 1996 due to the outsourcing to the Company of significant additional transportation management responsibilities.
COST OF SALES - Cost of sales increased 17.4% from $194.5 million for fiscal 1996 to $228.8 million for fiscal 1997. The increased volume of transportation management services, which required increases in transportation capacity purchased from carriers and the addition of new employees, resulted in an approximately $29.8 million increase in cost of sales. In addition, cost of sales increased by approximately $3.3 million as a result of increased warehouse labor and related fringe benefits. A portion of the increased cost of sales was due to the increased handling volume offset by a decrease of approximately $2.2 million as the net result of the new warehouse openings and closings. During fiscal 1997, the Company also experienced operational difficulties at two of the Company's warehouse facilities due to higher than anticipated warehouse storage volumes and changes in product mix, which resulted in increased labor expense. The Company believes such difficulties have been resolved at one location and good progress made at the other.
Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 69.7% for fiscal 1996 to 73.6% for fiscal 1997, as handling and transportation management sales, which each have high variable cost requirements, increased from 53.7% of net sales in the prior period to 59.6% in the more recent period.
As the Company does not invest in or own transportation equipment, the Company has entered into contracts with independent carriers to provide freight transportation at negotiated rates. Accordingly, the margins that the Company earns in providing transportation management services are lower than its warehousing services. The Company believes, however, that its transportation management activities may lead to stronger customer relationships and increased revenues in the higher-margin warehousing business.
Cost of sales increased 41.1% from fiscal 1995 to fiscal 1996 as a result of the increased transportation management sales.
SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES - Selling and administrative expenses increased 9.2% from $28.5 million for fiscal 1996 to $31.1 million for fiscal 1997. The increase primarily reflects an increase of approximately $1.3 million in salaries and related fringe benefits and $0.8 million in professional fees. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 10.2% in fiscal 1996 to 10.0% in fiscal 1997 due to the increase in transportation management sales which did not require a corresponding increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Selling and administrative expenses increased 9.9% from $26.0 million for fiscal 1995 to $28.5 million for fiscal 1996. The increase primarily reflects an increase of approximately $1.4 million in salaries and related fringe benefits in the more recent period.
GROSS OPERATING MARGIN - As a result of the factors discussed above, gross operating margin decreased 9.4% from $52.8 million for fiscal 1996 to $47.9 million for fiscal 1997.
Gross operating margin increased 10.4% from $47.8 million for fiscal 1995 to $52.8 million for fiscal 1996 as a result of the increased warehouse business and transportation management sales.
INTEREST EXPENSE - Interest expense increased slightly from $56.6 million for fiscal 1996 to $56.7 million for fiscal 1997 as a result of the defeasance requirements related to the issuance in April 1996 of $120.0 million of the Company's 12.875% Notes. Proceeds from the issue were used in May 1996 to redeem at par all $115.0 million of the Company's outstanding 15% Debentures. Under the terms of the applicable indenture, the 15% Debentures remained outstanding for a period of thirty (30) days following issue of the 12.875% Notes, accounting for a major portion of the increase in interest expense. Excluding the increased cost due to the defeasance, interest expense decreased due to lower overall interest rates experienced by the Company despite slightly higher overall borrowings.
Interest expense increased from $55.3 million in fiscal 1995 to $56.6 million for fiscal 1996 as a result of higher overall interest rates.
GAIN ON INSURANCE SETTLEMENT - The one-time gain in fiscal 1995 of approximately $17.0 million reflects an insurance settlement related to the Company's settlement with the Company's insurance carriers of its first party claims for business interruption losses, property damage and out-of-pocket expenses incurred with respect to a fire in one of its facilities in fiscal 1992.
REORGANIZATION EXPENSES - Reorganization expenses in fiscal 1996 of approximately $7.3 million reflect the expenses incurred for professional services related to the Prepackaged Bankruptcy including investment banking, accounting and legal fees. The Company incurred reorganization expenses in fiscal 1997 of approximately $0.8 million as a result of the settlement of the lease rejection claim related to the Chicago, Illinois facility, and the cost of professional services related to the Non-Stop litigation in the Prepackaged Bankruptcy. See Section 3, "Legal Proceedings".
INCOME (LOSS) - The Company's loss before income taxes and extraordinary item for fiscal 1996 was $11.5 million, compared to a loss of $9.1 million for fiscal 1997. The decreased loss in fiscal 1997 is due to the approximately $7.4 million of reorganization expense incurred in fiscal 1996 offset in part by the lower gross operating margin realized in fiscal 1997.
The Company's income before income taxes and extraordinary item for fiscal 1995 was $10.8 million compared to a loss of $11.5 million in fiscal 1996, primarily the result of the insurance settlement and the reorganization expenses referred to above.
EXTRAORDINARY ITEM - In connection with the exchange of the Company's 11% Debentures for the 15% Debentures and the repurchase of the $10.0 million of Series A Bonds in the Prepackaged Bankruptcy, unamortized original issue discount of approximately $2.0 million and unamortized issuance costs of approximately $1.0 million were written off, resulting in an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 1996.
INFLATION - The Company's operations have not been, nor are they expected to be, materially affected by inflation or changing prices.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - Effective March 1, 1996, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." This statement generally requires assessment of recoverability of an asset after events or circumstances that indicate an impairment to the asset and its future cash flows. Any impairment loss would be recognized as a one-time charge to earnings affecting results of operations, but would not affect the cash flow of the Company. There was no impairment loss to report upon adoption.
Effective March 1, 1996, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 requires that, except for transactions with employees that are within the scope of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are to be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25. Entities electing to follow the accounting methods of APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
Pro forma disclosures required for entities that elect to continue to measure compensation cost using APB No. 25 must include the effects of all awards granted in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 1994. The Company has elected to continue using APB No. 25 and make the necessary SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosures. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997.
The Company has not implemented the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"), although it will be required to do so for fiscal years beginning March 1, 1997 and thereafter. This Statement establishes a different method of computing net income per share than is currently required under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15. Under SFAS No. 128, the Company will be required to present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS No. 128 will not have a material impact on its income per share.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - -------------------------------
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its needs related to the payment of interest expense, the continued operation and maintenance of its warehouses, the continued operation and planned expansion of its transportation management business and to fund limited growth in warehouse investments. Anticipated growth in the volume of transportation management services is not expected to consume significant capital resources. Although the Company's internal resources for new warehouse acquisition or construction are limited, the Company has arranged for up to $25.0 million in lease financing for new warehouse capacity from a finance company (the "Lease Line") of which approximately $7.3 million remained unused at February 28, 1997. See " - Capital Resources." While the Company currently has no projects in progress, the Company plans to finance its warehouse expansion program principally through lease financing, and the Company believes it has the ability to finance any fiscal 1998 expansion projects from the Lease Line, similar lease financing or mortgage financing. In light of the significant debt obligations due between fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2008, the Company continues to need to increase operating cash flow and seek external sources for refinancing. To the extent such operating cash flow growth will result from warehouse capacity growth, the Company will also be required to obtain additional sources of financing.
LIQUIDITY - ---------
OPERATING CASH FLOW - Net cash flow from operating activities, representing cash provided from operations, is used to fund capital expenditures and meet debt service requirements. Operating cash flow reported for any one period is sensitive to the timing of the collection of receivables and the payment of payables.
Net cash flow from operating activities as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements increased from $12.6 million for fiscal 1996 to $18.9 million for fiscal 1997. The increase is due to the reduction in reorganization fees and expenses associated with the Prepackaged Bankruptcy. The Company's operating cash flow would have been $19.9 million for fiscal 1996 and $19.6 for fiscal 1997 without reorganization fees and expenses of $7.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Funds provided from operations (gross operating margin plus depreciation, amortization and employee stock ownership plan expense) for fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997 totaled $71.6 million, $76.6 million and $72.1 million, respectively. Interest expenses, net of amortization of original issue discount, totaled $54.0 million, $56.2 million and $56.7 million, respectively. As a result of increased taxable earnings and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the Company anticipates that cash tax payments will increase. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997.
WORKING CAPITAL - The Company's working capital position at fiscal 1997 year end was a negative $12.5 million. This position compares to $3.2 million at fiscal 1996 year end. Working capital was reduced in fiscal 1997 due to the funding of approximately $22.4 million of warehouse expansions.
The Company's typical negative working capital position has not historically affected its ability to meet its cash operating needs. The Company, however, in fiscal 1995 experienced a shortfall in working capital necessary to make the fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1996 sinking fund payments required with respect to the 11% Debentures, leading to the Prepackaged Bankruptcy. See " - Overview - Prepackaged Bankruptcy".
CAPITAL RESOURCES - -----------------
The credit agreement ("Bank Credit Agreement") with the Company's primary bank provides an aggregate availability of $27.5 million, which may be used for any combination of letters of credit and revolving cash borrowings for general working capital purposes, subject to borrowing base limitations. The borrowing base for both cash borrowings and letter of credit amounts equals 85% of eligible accounts receivable pledged to the bank plus, at the option of the Company, 70% of the value of all real property mortgaged to the bank, up to a maximum of $27.5 million. The Company has not mortgaged any properties under the Bank Credit Agreement. The Bank Credit Agreement, which matures on February 28, 1999, requires two 30-day resting periods (during which there may be no outstanding borrowings) during each of fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999. The Bank Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants, including financial covenants.
Based on eligible accounts receivable as of February 28, 1997, the Company had an available credit line of $23.1 million, of which $8.7 million was used for letters of credit, principally related to leasing commitments and workers' compensation reserves. No cash borrowings were outstanding.
The Lease Line was used to finance, subject to meeting certain conditions, the construction or acquisition of new warehouses or the expansion of existing warehouses which were not pledged as collateral security for senior debt. While the Lease Line commitment was originally intended to expire December 31, 1996, based on discussions with the lender, the commitment expiration date is expected to be extended into the second quarter of fiscal 1998. In addition, the Lease Line is expected to be increased by approximately $10.0 million, to an available total of $17.3 million, in order to allow for the planned sale/leaseback of an existing facility. The first funding of approximately $5.7 million closed in late fiscal 1996 with respect to the Company's Grand Island, Nebraska facility. The Company also funded $12.0 million for the financing of the Pasco, Washington facility under the Lease Line during November 1996. In October 1996, the Company financed the Burley, Idaho facility expansion through a mortgage with its primary bank.
The Company was notified that in December 1996, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the "Met") sold its entire $140.0 million holdings of the Company's Series A Bonds. As a result of such transaction, the Second Amended and Restated Investment Agreement, dated May 9, 1995, between the Met and the Company, which included certain financial covenants and other restrictive covenants, was terminated.
On April 9, 1996, the Company sold $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 12.875% Notes. The interest rate on the 12.875% Notes can be increased from 12.875% to 13.875% if the 12.875% Notes are not rated "B- or higher" by Standard & Poor's, and "B3 or higher" by Moody's Investor Services, by November 1, 1997. The 12.875% Notes have been rated "B-" by Standard & Poor's since they were issued, and as of May 1, 1997, "Caa" by Moody's Investor Services.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES - Expenditures for property, plant and equipment for fiscal 1997 totaled $33.6 million, of which approximately $26.1 million related to warehouse expansions. Of the $26.1 million, all but approximately $3.7 million of the expenditures were funded from net cash flow from operations.
The Company has no expansion projects in progress. The Company plans to finance its warehouse expansion program principally through lease financing or mortgage financing.
Expenditures, including capital leases, for property, plant and equipment for fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997 totaled $14.3 million, $35.0 million and $33.6 million, respectively, as summarized in the following table:
Historical Capital Expenditures (In Millions)
SUBSEQUENT EVENT - Subsequent to the end of fiscal 1997, Heinz announced that it had entered into negotiations to sell several potato processing plants of Ore-Ida to McCain. The sale is expected to close in mid-calendar 1997. While the Company is not able to estimate the extent to which sales to McCain will replace sales to Heinz, the Company expects the total percentage of the Company's net sales to Heinz will decrease in fiscal 1998.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE - --------------------------
The following table sets forth information as to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other four most highly compensated executive officers of the Company as of the last day of February 1997 for services in all capacities to the Company for the years ended the last day of February 1995, 1996 and 1997.
OPTION GRANTS TABLE - -------------------
The following table sets forth information as to the options granted to the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other four most highly compensated executive officers of the Company during fiscal 1997.
AGGREGATED OPTION TABLE - -----------------------
The following table sets forth information as to the options held by the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other four most highly compensated executive officers of the Company through the end of fiscal 1997.
BENEFIT PLAN AND ARRANGEMENTS - -----------------------------
MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN - The Company has a Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP Plan") to provide additional compensation to participants, including executive officers, upon the achievement of certain financial objectives of the Company and individual personal objectives of the participants. The MIP Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") and is applicable to management employees of Americold and, at the option of the President of the Company, other employees of Americold. The financial objective award is 50% of the total award and is based on attainment of actual operating results as compared to financial targets. The financial targets were established and approved by the Company based upon the annual business plan. The personal objective award is 50% of the total award and is based on attainment of both quantifiable and nonquantifiable goals established at the beginning of the MIP Plan year. Incentive compensation earned under the MIP Plan is computed as soon as possible after the close of the Company's fiscal year and payment is generally made following approval by the Board unless a deferred payment election has been filed with the Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
The Board of Directors authorized the payment of approximately $1.4 million in total fiscal 1997 awards pursuant to the MIP Plan. These awards were paid in April 1997. Incentive compensation earned by the Company's executive officers for the fiscal year ended the last day of February 1997 is included in the Bonus column in the above Summary Compensation Table.
RETIREMENT PLAN - Americold has a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan for salaried employees, including executive officers (the "Retirement Plan"). The Retirement Plan provides retirement benefits based on credited years of service and average monthly compensation for the highest five calendar years of the final 15 calendar years of employment or, if higher, the highest 60 consecutive months in the last 120 months of employment. A participant's retirement benefits vest after the participant has completed at least five years of Vesting Service.
The following table shows the approximate annual retirement benefits payable to employees for life from normal retirement date pursuant to the Retirement Plan before reduction for Social Security payments. The actual retirement benefit to employees is offset by Social Security benefits. Service credited under a retirement plan of the Company's former owners will be recognized by the Retirement Plan for purposes of determining the pension benefits payable under the Retirement Plan.
Estimated years of credited service to date under the Retirement Plan for the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table are as follows: Mr. Dykehouse, 6 years; Mr. Smith, 18 years; Mr. LeNeveu, 5 years; Mr. Sena, 27 years; and Mr. Coxe, 3 years. Estimated years of credited service at normal retirement date (age 65) under the Retirement Plan for the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table are as follows: Mr. Dykehouse, 16 years; Mr. Smith, 26 years; Mr. LeNeveu, 20 years; Mr. Sena, 45 years; and Mr. Coxe, 12 years.
Years of Service ------------------------------------- Average Annualized Compensation 20 30 40 50 - ------------------ -------- -------- -------- ------
$100,000 $ 30,000 $ 45,000 $ 60,000 $ 75,000 125,000 37,500 56,250 75,000 93,744 150,000 45,000 67,500 90,000 112,500 175,000 45,000 67,500 90,000 112,500 200,000 45,000 67,500 90,000 112,500 300,000 45,000 67,500 90,000 112,500 325,000 45,000 67,500 90,000 112,500
In addition to the above, certain individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table are entitled to a benefit calculated by using additional years of service credited under supplements to the Retirement Plan. Years of credited service under the supplements for the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table as of the last day of February 1997 are as follows: Mr. Dykehouse, 0 years; Mr. Smith, 5 years; Mr. LeNeveu, 0 years; Mr. Sena, 0 years; and Mr. Coxe, 0 years. The annual amount to be received at normal retirement date pursuant to the supplements is estimated to be as follows: Mr. Dykehouse, $0 per annum; Mr. Smith, $5,906 per annum; Mr. LeNeveu, $0 per annum; Mr. Sena, $0 per annum; and Mr. Coxe, $0 per annum.
A participant's retirement benefits (excluding any incremental benefit earned under any supplement) under the Retirement Plan plus 50% of Social Security benefits may not exceed 60% of his compensation at retirement after 40 years of service, subject to maximum dollar limitations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN - Americold established, effective March 1, 1987, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as amended January 1, 1994 (the "ESOP"), in which all qualifying employees of the Company not covered by collective bargaining arrangements are able to participate. It is contemplated that contributions on an annual basis will not exceed 15% of the aggregate total compensation of any participating employee. The Company may contribute cash as well as or in lieu of its stock. The consent of the Company's Board of Directors is required to authorize any contribution by Americold to the ESOP. Contributions are allocated among participants based on the ratio of each participant's compensation to the total compensation of all such participants, subject to certain limitations. The ESOP is intended to provide retirement funds to participants in addition to present pension benefits.
Benefits under the ESOP vest based upon years of service as follows: 20% after three years of service, increased by 20% for each of the next four years with a maximum of 100% after seven years of service. A participant is 100% vested if employed by the Company on or after his 65th birthday, or if the participant incurs a total and permanent disability or dies while employed by the Company. The ESOP has the right to repurchase previously distributed shares from employees terminating their ESOP participation, using funds obtained through cash contributions by the Company. Participant forfeitures are allocated pro rata to remaining participants.
Participants are eligible for distribution of their capital accumulation in the ESOP at the normal retirement age of 65. The distribution will be made in whole shares of the Company's stock, cash or a combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee, provided the participant has not elected to be paid in stock.
Upon termination of the ESOP, the ESOP's trust will be maintained until the capital accumulations of all participants have been distributed.
Management anticipates recommending a $500,000 ESOP contribution for fiscal 1997.
KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN - In 1987, Americold established a Key Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). The Option Plan permits the issuance of nonstatutory options to purchase up to 300,000 shares of common stock of the Company to directors, officers and other key employees of the Company. Of these, options to purchase up to 150,000 shares were reserved for issuance to the Management Group and options to purchase the remaining 150,000 shares are reserved for issuance to all eligible employees (including the Management Group) of the Company.
The Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines the recipients of options granted, the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock subject to each option. Options to purchase common stock are granted at a price not less than 85% of the fair market value on the day that the option is granted. The Board of Directors may amend the Option Plan from time to time. The maximum term of each stock option is ten years. Options become exercisable at such time or times as the Compensation Committee may determine at the time of grant.
If the outstanding shares of common stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of the Company or other securities of the Company, by reason of any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, stock dividend or combination of shares, the Compensation Committee shall make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of shares as to which the unexercised portion of the option shall be exercisable, to the extent that after such event the optionee's right to a proportionate interest in the Company shall be maintained as if the option had already been exercised and the option shares were subject to such change or exchange. Such adjustment shall be made without change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of the option and with a corresponding adjustment in the exercise price per option share. Any such adjustment made by the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding upon the Company, the optionee and all other interested persons.
In the event of (i) dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (ii) a merger in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or (iii) a share exchange pursuant to which the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company are acquired by another corporation, then either (a) the Compensation Committee, upon authorization of the Board, shall make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kinds of securities covered by outstanding options, and such options shall be expressly assumed by the successor corporation, if any; or (b) in lieu of such adjustment, the Board shall provide a 30-day period immediately prior to such an event during which each optionee shall have the right to exercise the optionee's outstanding options, in whole or in part, without regard to the time the options have been outstanding or the vesting schedule provided for in any option agreement entered into pursuant to the Option Plan and all options not exercised shall expire at the end of the 30-day period.
Information with regard to the grant of options as of the last day of February 1997 under the Plan follows:
Number of Shares Subject to Exercise Number of Shares Expiration Option Price Exercisable Date - ---------- ------- ----------- ----------
65,148 $10.00 65,148 May 1998 160,000 $12.30 0 April 2006
See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997.
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS - In calendar 1995, the Board of Directors authorized employment agreements for certain executive officers of the Company.
On November 1, 1995, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dykehouse. The agreement expires on December 16, 1998 and may be extended for one-year periods by mutual agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Dykehouse agreed to serve as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company for a minimum base monthly salary of $25,000 and the right to participate in the MIP Plan (or any other senior management incentive program offered by the Company) and receive all customary employee benefits ("Benefits"). The agreement provides that if during the term of the agreement Mr. Dykehouse is terminated "without cause", as defined, the Company will pay his base compensation through December 16, 1998, employ him as a consultant at his base salary for 24 months beginning January 1, 1999 and provide to him all Benefits through the earlier of the date he obtains other employment and December 16, 2006. The Company is not required to make any such payments if the termination is "for cause," as defined. Among other termination provisions, the agreement provides that Mr. Dykehouse may terminate the agreement with 30 days' written notice if such termination is for "good reason" (as defined), and in such case, Mr. Dykehouse will receive the same treatment as if he were terminated "without cause." The employment agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
On August 1, 1995, the Company entered into two-year employment agreements with Messrs. Smith, LeNeveu, Sena and Coxe. Each employee agreed to serve in the position and at the minimum base monthly salary as follows: Mr. Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, $13,666.66; Mr. LeNeveu, Executive Vice President, $14,166.66; Mr. Sena, Executive Vice President, $13,666.67; and Mr. Coxe, Senior Vice President, Logistics, $12,500.00. The agreements provide, among other conditions, that if during the term of the employment agreement the employee is terminated "without cause," as defined, the Company will pay the employee any unpaid base compensation, any benefits accrued to the date of termination and, for 24 months, a monthly amount equal to the last monthly salary amount received. The Company is not required to make any such payment if the termination is "for cause," as defined. The employee may terminate employment upon 30 days' written notice, and the Company will pay such employee an amount equal to either 12 months' salary if such termination is without "good reason," as defined, or 24 months' salary if such termination is for "good reason." The employment agreements contain other customary terms and conditions.
On June 30, 1996, the Company and Messrs. Smith, LeNeveu, Sena and Coxe each entered into an Addendum to Employment Agreement whereby, unless a party provides notice of intent not to renew prior to the July 31 preceding the July 31 on which the employment agreement is scheduled to terminate, the term of such agreement is automatically extended for an additional year beyond the former termination date. For example, if neither party gives notice not to renew on or before July 31, 1997, the term of the employment agreement will extend to July 31, 1999.
Concurrently with the entering into of the employment agreements, Messrs. Dykehouse, Smith, LeNeveu, Sena and Coxe each also entered into a covenant not to compete and consulting and non-disclosure agreement with the Company. Under these agreements, each individual has agreed not to compete with the Company during the term of his employment with the Company, under the terms of an employment contract or otherwise. Mr. Dykehouse has agreed not to compete with the company for a period of 24 months following termination of employment or until October 31, 2000, whichever is earlier, while the other officers have agreed not to compete with the Company (1) for a 24-month period following termination of his employment or until July 31, 2000, whichever is earlier, if the termination is "for cause," as defined in the employment agreement, or (ii) for a 12-month period or until July 31, 2000, whichever is earlier, if the employee terminates employment with or without "good reason," as defined in the employment agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, each individual has further agreed to be available for employment as a consultant to the Company following termination of employment.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ----------------------------
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Americold Corporation:
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Americold Corporation as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations, common stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended the last day of February 1997. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Americold Corporation as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended the last day of February 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Last day of February 1996 and 1997
(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ------------------------------------------
Accounting policies and methods of their application that significantly affect the determination of financial position, cash flows and results of operations are as follows:
(a) Business Description --------------------
Americold Corporation (the "Company") provides integrated logistics services for the frozen food industry consisting of warehousing and transportation management. These services are provided through the Company's network of 49 refrigerated warehouses and its refrigerated transportation management unit. The Company has a wholly-owned warehousing subsidiary, Americold Services Corporation.
In addition, the Company operates a limestone quarry. This business is not significant to the Company as a whole and is not required to be reported as a separate industry segment.
(b) Principles of Consolidation ---------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Americold Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany transactions, profits and balances have been eliminated.
(c) Property, Plant and Equipment -----------------------------
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets ranging from 3 to 45 years for financial reporting purposes and on accelerated methods for income tax purposes where possible. Property held under capital leases (at capitalized value) is amortized on the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, limited generally by the lease period. The amortization of the property held under capital leases is included with depreciation expense. Estimated remaining useful lives are reviewed periodically for reasonableness and any necessary change is generally effected at the beginning of the accounting period in which the revision is adopted.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed in the year incurred; major renewals and betterments of equipment and refrigeration facilities are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset.
(d) Cost in Excess of Net Assets Acquired -------------------------------------
On December 24, 1986, all the outstanding capital stock of the Company was acquired by a private group consisting of affiliates of Kelso & Company, Inc., certain institutional investors and certain key employees and members of the Company's management. The acquisition of the Company was accounted for as a purchase. An allocation of the purchase price was made to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition. The unallocated purchase price is the Company's estimate of goodwill associated with the acquisition and is being amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 40 years.
The Company assesses the recoverability of the goodwill by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining useful life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future net income. The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net income using a discount rate reflecting the Company's current average cost of funds.
(e) Debt Issuance Costs -------------------
Debt issuance costs incurred are amortized over the term of the related debt.
(f) Income Taxes ------------
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
(g) Management Estimates and Assumptions ------------------------------------
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(h) Revenue Recognition -------------------
The Company's revenues are primarily derived from services provided to customers in both handling and storing frozen products and from freight services. Handling and storage revenue is based primarily upon the total weight of frozen product received into and held in storage and is recognized as earned, not as billed. Differences between revenue earned and revenue billed are recorded as deferred revenue. Approximately 50% of the handling revenue is deferred until the customer's products are released. The freight services revenues and direct costs are recognized upon delivery of freight.
(i) Income (Loss) Per Share -----------------------
Income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) less preferred dividend requirements, by the weighted average of common shares outstanding.
(j) Major Customers ---------------
Consolidated net sales to H. J. Heinz Company and subsidiaries amounted to approximately $45.5 million, $108.1 million and $149.9 million in the years ended the last day of February 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales.
(k) Cash and Cash Equivalents -------------------------
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. There were cash equivalents of $15.4 million and $10.0 million as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997, respectively.
(l) New Accounting Standards ------------------------
Effective March 1, 1996, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long- Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." This statement generally requires assessment of recoverability of an asset after events or circumstances that indicate an impairment to the asset and its future cash flows. Any impairment loss would be recognized as a one-time charge to earnings affecting results of operations, but would not affect the cash flow of the Company. There was no impairment loss to report upon adoption.
Effective March 1, 1996, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 requires that, except for transactions with employees that are within the scope of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are to be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25. Entities electing to follow the accounting methods of APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
Pro forma disclosures required for entities that elect to continue to measure compensation cost using APB No. 25 must include the effects of all awards granted in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 1994. The Company has elected to continue using APB No. 25 and make the necessary SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosures.
The Company has not implemented the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"), although it will be required to do so for fiscal years beginning March 1, 1997 and thereafter.
This Statement establishes a different method of computing net income per share than is currently required under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15. Under SFAS No. 128, the Company will be required to present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS No. 128 will not have a material impact on its income per share.

The Company has arranged for up to $25.0 million in lease financing of which approximately $17.7 million was used as of the last day of February 1997.
In November 1996, the Company entered into a sale/leaseback transaction of its Pasco, Washington facility. Of the approximately $6.8 million of net proceeds, the Company received approximately $1.5 million at closing and the remaining $5.3 million was placed in escrow with the Trustee under the indenture governing the Company's first mortgage bonds. The Company has until November 1997 to substitute the unencumbered property for the total amount of cash, or any portion thereof, held in escrow. Any escrowed funds remaining after the one year period will be used to repurchase outstanding mortgage bonds. The deferred gain resulting from the sale/leaseback transaction of approximately $2.7 million is being amortized over the approximate ten year life of the lease.

$ 461,667 $ 465,834 ======== =========
The Company has issued first mortgage bonds and the bonds are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on 31 of the Company's facilities. The Company entered into an indenture in connection with the issuance of the first mortgage bonds which, like the Company's revolving credit agreement with the Company's primary bank, requires the Company to meet certain affirmative and restrictive covenants. Significant restrictive items include, among others, limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, dividends, capital expenditures, asset dispositions, lease commitments and investments. Also, certain "pro forma debt service" ratios and senior debt to net worth ratios must be maintained. At February 28, 1997, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.
The Company was notified in December 1996 that the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the "Met") sold its entire $140 million holdings of the Company's Series A, 11.45% First Mortgage Bonds. As a result of such transaction, the Second Amended and Restated Investment Agreement, dated May 5, 1995, between the Met and the Company, which included certain financial covenants and other restrictive covenants, was terminated.
On April 9, 1996, the Company sold $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 12.875% Notes. The interest rate on the 12.875% Notes can be increased from 12.875% to 13.875% if the 12.875% Notes are not rated "B3 or higher" by Moody's Investor Services, and "B- or higher" by Standard & Poor's, by November 1, 1997. The 12.875% Notes have been rated "B-" by Standard & Poor's since they were issued, and as of February 28, 1997, "Caa" by Moody's Investor Services.
The available amount under the Company's revolving credit agreement was $23.1 million as of the last day of February 1997, of which $8.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding. No cash borrowings were outstanding at February 28, 1997.
As of the last day of February 1997, aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows (in thousands):
Year ended the last day of February -------------------
1998 $ 5,229 1999 2,463 2000 32,502 2001 38,642 2002 38,282 Thereafter 353,945 -------
$ 471,063 ========
(8) Employee Benefit Plans ----------------------
(a) Defined Benefit Pension Plans -----------------------------
The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees, other than union employees covered by union pension plans under collective bargaining agreements. Benefits under these plans are based on years of credited service and compensation during the years preceding retirement or on years of credited service and established monthly benefit levels.
Pension expense for all plans, including plans jointly administered by industry and union representatives, totaled $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $1.9 million for years ended the last day of February 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. Actuarial valuations for defined benefit plans are performed as of the end of the plan year. The most recent actuarial valuations are as of the last day of February 1997.
The funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans and the accrued pension expense amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements within other noncurrent liabilities, as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997, are as follows (in thousands):
Net periodic pension expense for the years ended the last day of February 1995, 1996 and 1997 includes the following components (in thousands):
Last day of February 1995 1996 1997 ---- ---- ----
Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 1,107 $ 1,165 $ 1,186 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 2,121 2,293 2,431 Actual return on plan assets (2,554) (4,301) (2,826) Net amortization and deferral (143) 1,541 109 -------- -------- --------

Plan assets are assigned to several investment management companies and are invested in various equity and fixed fund investments in accordance with the Company's investment policy.
(b) Employee Stock Ownership Plan -----------------------------
The Company established an employee stock ownership plan, effective March 1, 1987, which is intended to provide qualifying employees an equity interest in the Company, as well as potential retirement benefits. The trust established under the plan is designed to invest primarily in the Company's stock. Contributions by the Company, in the form of common or preferred stock of the Company, or cash, or a combination thereof, may be made to the trustee on behalf of eligible participants for each plan year as determined by the Company's Board of Directors. Participating employees with vested benefits, upon retirement or termination, have the option of retaining the stock or selling it back to the Company at its fair market value.
(c) Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions -------------------------------------------
In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These benefits are provided to substantially all employees other than certain union employees who have elected not to participate.
The total of accumulated postretirement benefits obligation (APBO), which is an unfunded obligation, is as follows:
Last day of February 1995 1996 1997 ---- ---- ----
Retirees $ 2,314 $ 2,375 $ 2,618 Active employees 1,511 1,832 2,209 -------- -------- --------
$ 3,825 $ 4,207 $ 4,827 ======== ======== ========
The components of net periodic postretirement expense for the years ended the last day of February are as follows (in thousands):
1995 1996 1997 ---- ---- ----
Service cost benefits earned in period $ 104 $ 114 $ 123 Interest cost on APBO 313 334 383 Amortization of unamortized prior service cost (22) (22) (8) ------- ------- ------- $ 395 $ 426 $ 498 ======= ======= =======
The discount rate used to determine the APBO and net periodic expense as of February 28, 1995 was 9.0%, and as of February 29, 1996 and February 28, 1997 was 8.5%.
For fiscal 1997, an 11% increase in the medical cost trend rate was assumed. This rate is projected to decrease incrementally to 5.5% after nine years. A 1% increase in the medical trend rate would increase the APBO by $0.2 million and increase the net periodic expense by a negligible amount.
9. Common Stockholders' Deficit ---------------------------
The Company has reserved 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance under a stock option plan established in 1987. Under the plan, options are granted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to purchase common stock at a price not less than 85% of the fair market value on the date the option is granted.
Stock options outstanding and transactions involving the stock option plan are summarized for the years ended the last day of February as follows:
The Company has computed the value of all options granted during fiscal 1997 using the minimum value method as prescribed under SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes. The following weighted average assumptions were used for the grants made in fiscal 1997: risk free interest rate at 6.875%; expected life of ten years; and dividend rate of zero percent.
The total value of options granted during fiscal 1997 was computed at $428,000. The options granted in fiscal 1997 have a five-year vesting schedule and compensation will be amortized on a pro forma basis over that period.
The options granted in fiscal 1997 had not vested as of the last day of February 1997 and therefore there would be no compensation cost in the current year under the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in the pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts.
As of February 28, 1997, options for 225,148 shares were outstanding with exercise prices between $10.00 and $12.30, and a remaining weighted average contractual life of 6.7 years.
10. Preferred Stock ---------------
The Company has contributed shares of its Series A, variable rate, cumulative preferred stock to the Americold Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The preferred stock is redeemable by participants of the plan. As of the last day of February 1996 and 1997, dividends not declared on the Company's cumulative preferred stock total approximately $477,000 and $458,000, respectively.
11. Income Taxes ------------
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
1995 1996 1997 ---- ---- ----
Federal: Current $ 2,867 $ - $ 250 Deferred 1,494 (2,858) (2,422) -------- -------- -------- 4,361 (2,858) (2,172) -------- -------- --------
State: Current 820 - 112 Deferred 46 (568) (544) -------- -------- --------
$ 5,227 $ (3,426) $ (2,604)
======== ======== ========
Following is a reconciliation of the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes (in thousands):
1995 1996 1997 ---- ---- ----
Computed income tax expense (benefit) at federal statutory rate $ 3,777 $ (4,027) $ (3,200) State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits 563 (369) (280) Amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired 887 970 876
-------- -------- --------

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the related amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities as of the last day of February 1996 and 1997 are as follows (in thousands):
1996 1997 ---- ---- Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment, due to differences in depreciation and prior accounting treatment $(110,574) $(109,099) -------- ---------

--------- ---------
$(102,041) $ (98,524) ========= =========
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of March 1, 1995 was $1.3 million. The valuation allowance is required to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets to an amount which will more likely than not be realized.
At February 28, 1997, the Company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $3.2 million available to offset future regular taxes in excess of future alternative minimum taxes.
12. Extraordinary Item ------------------
In conjunction with the exchange of the senior subordinated debentures and the repurchase of the $10.0 million of first mortgage bonds in fiscal 1996, as discussed in note 15, unamortized original issue discount of approximately $2.0 million and unamortized issuance costs of approximately $1.0 million were written off, resulting in an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of approximately $1.8 million.
13. Disclosures About The Fair Value of Financial Instruments ---------------------------------------------------------
Cash, Trade Receivables, Other Receivables, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses ------------------------------------------------------------
The carrying amount of these items approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-Term Debt --------------
The fair values of each of the Company's long-term debt instruments are based on (a) the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity; (b) in the case of the first mortgage bonds - Series B and senior subordinated notes, market price; or (c) in the case of the first mortgage bonds - Series A, at par, because there is not a market for such securities (in thousands).
As of the last day of February 1997 ------------------ Estimated fair Carrying market amount value ------ ------
Senior subordinated notes $120,000 $124,500 First mortgage bonds - Series A 140,000 140,000 First mortgage bonds - Series B 176,250 185,063 Mortgage notes payable 29,062 29,062
Limitations ----------- Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
14. Gain on Insurance Settlement ----------------------------
Gain on insurance settlement of approximately $17.0 million relates to the Company's settlement of its first party claims with its insurance carriers for business interruption, property damage and out-of-pocket expenses with respect to the December 1991 fire at the Company's Kansas City, Kansas warehouse facility. No previous income recognition was determinable until the Company had settled all of the lawsuits and claims related to the fire.
15. Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 ---------------------------------------
On May 9, 1995, the Company filed a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the "Plan") under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon (the "Court"). The principal purpose of the Plan was to reduce the Company's short-term cash requirements with respect to payments due on its subordinated indebtedness and to adjust certain restrictive financial covenants and certain other provisions contained in the Amended and Restated Investment Agreement, dated March 2, 1993, between the Company and the Met. On June 19, 1995, the Court approved the Company's Disclosure Statement dated April 14, 1995 and the Company's solicitation of votes to accept or reject the Plan, and confirmed the Plan. On June 30, 1995, the Plan became effective.
In connection with the Plan, the Company rejected certain lease agreements relating to four warehouse facilities at Watsonville, Oakland and San Francisco, California; and Chicago, Illinois. In February 1996, the Company settled all lease rejection issues with the lessor of three properties located in Watsonville, Oakland and San Francisco, California. Such settlement did not involve the payment of any damages by the Company. In September 1996, the Company settled all lease rejection issues with the lessor of the Chicago, Illinois property. Such settlement, representing one year's rent recovery by the lessor as provided by the Bankruptcy Code, required a payment of approximately $0.4 million.
The Company has expensed the settlement payment and related professional fees and all professional fees and similar expenditures incurred related to the prepackaged bankruptcy as "reorganization expenses."
