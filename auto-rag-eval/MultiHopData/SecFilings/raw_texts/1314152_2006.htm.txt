On March 28, 2006, we acquired a 100% interest in Metropolitan Park North, a 186,000 square-foot, multi-tenant office building with a five-level parking garage located in Seattle, Washington with lease expirations through 2016. The gross purchase price was approximately $89.2 million, funded at closing with a $61.0 million fixed-rate mortgage loan maturing in 2013 at 5.73%, interest-only for the first four years, a $7.0 million borrowing on the line of credit and cash on hand.
On December 14, 2006, we acquired a 100% interest in Stirling Slidell Shopping Centre, a 139,000 square-foot, multi-tenant retail center located approximately 35 miles northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, built in 1994 with lease expirations through 2020. The gross purchase price was approximately $23.4 million. The Fund assumed a $14.0 million fixed-rate mortgage loan maturing in 2014 at 5.15%, the remaining balance was funded with cash on hand.
On December 26, 2006, we acquired a 90% interest in 9800 Meridian, a 129,000 square-foot, multi-tenant office building located in suburban Denver, Colorado, built in 1994 with tenant lease expirations through 2009. The gross purchase price was approximately $14.7 million, funded at closing with a $8.3 million variable-rate acquisition and construction loan at LIBOR plus 1.60% maturing in 2009 with two one-year extension options. The loan allows for additional borrowings up to $18.5 million to fund building improvements and leasing costs. The building will undergo significant upgrades over the next two years which will involve increasing the rentable space by approximately 10,000 square-feet, may involve terminating certain tenant leases as allowed under the terms of those leases and leasing the building to new tenants. The remainder of the purchase price for our 90% interest was funded with cash on hand. We consolidated this property based on the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”
2005 Acquisitions
Consolidated Properties
On February 10, 2005, we acquired a 100% interest in Georgia Door Sales Distribution Center, a 254,000 square-foot, single-tenant industrial building in suburban Atlanta, Georgia built in 1994 and expanded in 1996. The tenant’s lease expires in 2009. The gross purchase price was approximately $8.5 million funded by two mortgage loans, a $5.4 million, 5.31% fixed-rate, maturing in 2015, interest-only for five years, and a $0.8 million variable-rate loan at LIBOR plus 140 basis points (5.69% at December 31, 2005) maturing 2010 with an option to extend the term two additional years at a market rate. The remaining balance was funded by cash on hand. The variable-rate loan was paid off in May 2006.
On June 30, 2005, we acquired a 100% interest in 105 Kendall Park Lane, a 409,000 square-foot, single-tenant industrial building in suburban Atlanta, Georgia built in 2002. The tenant’s lease expires in 2017. The gross purchase price was approximately $18.8 million, funded at closing by borrowings on our line of credit of $12.0 million and cash on hand. On August 15, 2005, we obtained a $13.0 million fixed-rate mortgage loan maturing in 2012 at 4.92%, interest-only for the first four years.
On August 1, 2005, we acquired a 100% interest in Waipio Shopping Center, a 137,000 square-foot, multi-tenant retail center in Hawaii, built in 1986 with lease expirations through 2034. The gross purchase price was approximately $30.5 million, funded at closing with borrowings on our line of credit of $15.0 million and cash on hand. On October 27, 2005, we obtained a $20.0 million fixed-rate mortgage loan, interest-only, maturing in 2010 at 5.15%.
On December 21, 2005, we acquired a 100% interest in Marketplace at Northglenn, a 439,000 square-foot, multi-tenant retail center located ten miles north of downtown Denver, Colorado, that was redeveloped between 1999 and 2001 with lease expirations through 2020. The gross purchase price was approximately $91.5 million, funded at closing with a $64.5 million fixed-rate mortgage loan maturing in 2016 at 5.50%, interest-only for the first two years, $7.0 million of borrowings on our line of credit and cash on hand. The acquisition included a $3.6 million Enhanced Sales Tax Incentive Program (“ESTIP”) note receivable from the local government that allows us to share in sales tax revenue generated by the retail center. This note is expected to be repaid in full during 2008.
On December 21, 2005, we acquired a 95% membership interest in a limited liability company that owns a portfolio of leasehold interests in fifteen medical office buildings encompassing 755,000 square-feet of space located throughout Southern California and the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, which we refer to as the Pacific Medical Office Portfolio. The buildings were built between 1979 and 1997 and have lease expirations through 2016. The total aggregate consideration paid for our 95% membership interest was approximately $132.8 million. Pacific Medical Office Portfolio was encumbered by four existing fixed-rate mortgage loans totaling $84.3 million maturing in 2013 and 2014 at a weighted average interest rate of 5.77%, interest-only until November 2006, and the remaining purchase price was funded with cash on hand. The other member, owning a 5% interest, is an unrelated third party, who also performs property management and leasing services for the portfolio of buildings. We consolidated this property based on the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”
Unconsolidated Properties
On March 29, 2005, we acquired an 80% membership interest in a limited liability company which owns 111 Sutter Street in San Francisco, California, a 284,000 square-foot, multi-tenant office building built in 1926 and renovated in 2001. The aggregate consideration paid for the 80% membership interest was approximately $24.6 million. Additionally, we extended a $6.0 million short-term second mortgage loan to the limited liability company. The purchase price and the short-term second mortgage loan were funded by cash on hand of $18.9 million and borrowings on our line of credit of $11.7 million. At the time of purchase, 111 Sutter Street was encumbered by a $48.9 million variable-rate mortgage loan at LIBOR plus 185 basis points. On June 22, 2005, the limited liability company closed a $56.0 million fixed-rate mortgage loan maturing in 2015 at 5.58%. The majority of the proceeds from the loan were used to replace the existing mortgage loan debt on 111 Sutter Street and pay back the $6.0 million second mortgage loan to us.
2004 Acquisitions
Consolidated Properties
On August 27, 2004, LUSHI acquired a 100% interest in Monument IV at Worldgate, a nine-story, 228,000 square foot, single tenant, Class A office building in Herndon, Virginia built in 2001. The gross purchase price for the property was approximately $59.6 million, which was financed in part by two mortgage loans, a $38.0 million 5.29% fixed rate, maturing in 2011 mortgage loan, interest-only for the first two years and a $9.3 million floating-rate loan at LIBOR plus 4.00%. The balance was funded from cash invested by LUSHI. The floating-rate loan was fully repaid on December 23, 2004 from the proceeds of the Initial Closing. On October 20, 2004, Monument IV at Worldgate and its related debt was transferred from LUSHI to us, at the $59.6 million cost basis (which included purchase price, closing costs, due diligence costs, acquisition fees and debt financing costs).
On December 3, 2004, we acquired a 100% interest in two single tenant industrial buildings in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Havertys Furniture was built in 2002 and contained 511,000 square feet at the date of acquisition, and Hagemeyer Distribution Center was built in 2001 and contains 300,000 square feet. The gross purchase price for the buildings was approximately $38.7 million, which was funded at closing by a series of four mortgage loans, two fixed-rate loans totaling $24.6 million at 5.23%, maturing in 2015, interest-only for the first five years, and two floating-rate loans totaling $4.3 million at LIBOR plus 140 basis points maturing in 2010 with an option to extend the term two additional years at a market rate. The balance of the purchase price was funded from cash on hand. The buildings are subject to 50-year ground leases with annual rent payments of $10 and contain $100 purchase options in 2007 and 2010 for Havertys Furniture and Hagemeyer Distribution Center, respectively. In 2005, Havertys Furniture exercised a lease option that required us to add on to the existing building (See “-Projects Under Development” below) and also signed a lease amendment that extended the term of the lease to 2021. The variable-rate loans were paid off in May 2006.
On December 31, 2004, we extended an approximate $24.8 million mortgage loan secured by a 722,000 square foot single-tenant industrial building, 25850 S. Ridgeland (formerly referred to as TNT Logistics), located in Monee, Illinois, and built in 2004. The tenant’s lease expires in 2014. The loan requires monthly interest-only payments equal to the base rent paid by the tenant. The loan matured on February 28, 2006. Simultaneous with the signing of the loan agreement, we entered into an option agreement to purchase 25850 S. Ridgeland between January 1, 2006 and February 17, 2006, with closing on the purchase to occur on or before February 28, 2006. On February 28, 2006, we extended the maturity date on the mortgage loan to March 31, 2006 to allow the seller of the property to complete physical issues on the property and work through an existing legal dispute with the tenant. On March 30, 2006, we acquired the 25850 S. Ridgeland property for the outstanding loan balance plus a $500,000 option payment. The property comes with a TIF Note issued by the Village of Monee, which will reduce real estate taxes on the property by approximately 90% for the next ten years. We consolidated this property based on the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” During 2005, homeowners adjacent to the 25850 S. Ridgeland property filed a complaint with the Illinois Pollution Control Board (“IPCB”) against TNT Logistics North America, Inc. (the “tenant”), alleging excessive noise pollution. The IPCB has not ruled on the homeowners’ complaint as of March 1, 2007. On December 27, 2005, the tenant filed a lawsuit against the developer of the property claiming, among other things, that the developer has the obligation to indemnify the tenant against damages attributable to the complaint filed by the homeowners. The lawsuit has not been ruled on by the Federal District Court as of March 1, 2007. The developer of the property is unrelated to us and we are neither a party to the complaint with the IPCB or the lawsuit. We hired legal counsel to evaluate the IPCB complaint and lawsuit prior to our acquiring the property to evaluate any potential risks to the Fund. Based on consultations with counsel, we concluded that the Fund had limited exposure from those claims. The value of this property could, however, be diminished if it were determined that the tenant could no longer use the property pursuant to its lease agreement. On January 10, 2007, the tenant exercised an option and assigned its lease to Michelin North America, Inc.
Unconsolidated Properties
On August 25, 2004, we acquired a 46.5% membership interest in a limited liability company that owns Legacy Village, a 595,000 square foot lifestyle center mall in Lyndhurst, Ohio, built in 2003. The aggregate consideration for the 46.5% ownership interest was approximately $35.0 million, which was funded at closing from capital invested by LUSHI. At the time we acquired our membership interest, Legacy Village was encumbered by an approximate $97.0 million amortizing mortgage loan at 5.625% maturing on January 1, 2014. On December 23, 2004, Legacy Village took out an additional $10.0 million amortizing mortgage loan at 5.625%, also maturing on January 1, 2014. Proceeds from the loan were distributed to the members pro rata in accordance with their ownership percentages. On October 24, 2004, we took out an $8.0 million variable-rate second mortgage loan, collateralized by our 46.5% ownership interest in Legacy Village, which was fully repaid on December 23, 2004.
PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Construction on the Havertys Furniture 297,000 square foot expansion commenced in May 2005 and was completed in April 2006. The rent from the expansion had a favorable impact on our cash flow in 2006 and is expected to increase cash flow going forward. The cost for the Havertys Furniture expansion was approximately $11.0 million. The tenant took occupancy and began paying rent on approximately 156,000 square feet on January 9, 2006, approximately 36,000 square feet on February 15, 2006, approximately 32,000 square feet on March 1, 2006 and took occupancy of the remainder of the building in April 2006. We obtained an $11.5 million construction loan on the expansion in late December 2005, which had an outstanding balance of $10.1 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The construction loan carries interest a fixed-rate of 6.19%. As part of the building expansion, the tenant extended its lease expiration from 2017 to 2021. We borrowed an additional $1.0 million on the construction loan in January 2007 at which time the construction loan was converted to a permanent mortgage loan. We do not expect to make any additional borrowings on the loan.
9800 South Meridian is undergoing certain building upgrades which will involve enclosing a four floor atrium to create approximately 10,000 additional rentable square-feet, may involve terminating certain tenant leases as allowed under the terms of those leases and leasing the building to new tenants. We estimate total costs for the upgrades, including construction costs, tenant improvements and lease commissions, to be approximately $5.0 million, which will be funded through draws on the acquisition and construction loan. We have not incurred any costs as of December 31, 2006.
We are subject to a lease option at Hagemeyer Distribution Center that could require us to engage in development activities. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the tenant has not exercised its option. The tenant of Hagemeyer Distribution Center has the right to exercise up to three options to expand the building. These options are exercisable at any time during the term of the lease, but must be for at least 80,000 square feet each and can not exceed an aggregate of 240,000 square feet.
PURCHASE OPTIONS
As part of the acquisition of the Pacific Medical Office Portfolio, the limited liability company in which we invested that owns the portfolio, entered into an option agreement that gives the seller the right to effect a put to sell two medical office buildings to the limited liability company between March 21, 2007 and June 21, 2007. During the same exercise period, the limited liability company also has the right to effect a call to buy the two medical office buildings. The purchase price will be equal to the net operating income of the two buildings (projected forward for twelve months, subject to adjustments) divided by a cap rate of 7.75%. No initial investment was required by the limited liability company for this option, but $500,000 was deposited as collateral for the contract. The purchase price is expected to be between $12.0 and $19.0 million depending on the buildings’ net operating income. If neither party exercises the option by the expiration of the agreement, the contract becomes null and void and the deposit will be returned to us. The deposit will be impounded by the seller if the limited liability company fails to purchase the buildings after the put option notice has been given. We expect the limited liability company to exercise the option to purchase the two buildings during 2007.
As part of the acquisition of the 25850 S. Ridgeland property, in exchange for $500 we were granted an option expiring in 2009 to purchase a portion of adjacent land if the tenant wishes to expand its facility. If the tenant wishes to expand its facility and we determine it is in the best interest of the Fund to expand the facility, then we can acquire the adjacent portion of land subject to the terms and conditions of that certain Expansion Option Agreement dated as of December 31, 2004. The agreement provides among other things the terms and conditions pursuant to which the purchase price for the adjacent land shall be determined. The purchase price of the adjacent land will not exceed fair market value.
PROPERTIES UNDER PURCHASE CONTRACT
The following section describes properties we have under contract to purchase. There can be no assurance that these properties under contract will eventually result in successful acquisitions.
In October 2006, we entered into a purchase contract to acquire a 100% ownership interest in 4001 North Norfleet Road , a 702,000 square-foot, single-tenant industrial building located in Kansas City, Missouri for approximately $37.3 million. The property is currently under construction and we expect to acquire the property once construction is completed during the first quarter of 2007. The building is subject to a ten-year lease to a musical instrument retailer and will be used as their midwest distribution center. As of December 31, 2006, we had placed a $2.5 million non-revocable letter of credit as security for our purchase of the property. In October 2006, we committed to and locked the interest rate on a $24.2 million, ten-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan, interest-only for the first five years. The interest rate is set at 5.60% for the first six years after which it will be reset to a market rate for the final four years.
In November 2006, we entered into a purchase contract to acquire a 100% ownership interest in a 137,000 square-foot, multi-tenant office building located in Calgary, Canada for approximately $39.0 million. The property is currently under construction. We expect to acquire the property once construction is completed during the third quarter of 2007. The building is currently 100% pre-leased to a number of tenants for between five and ten years. In December 2006, we placed a $3.1 million non-revocable letter of credit as security for the purchase of the property.
In February 2007, we entered into a contract to acquire a 90% interest in 18922 Forge Drive, a 91,200 square-foot, multi-tenant office building located in Cupertino, California. The purchase price for our 90% interest is approximately $22.9 million. On February 15, 2007, we acquired the property using a seven-year, $19.1 million fixed-rate mortgage loan, maturing in 2014 at 6.24%. The remaining purchase price for our 90% interest was funded by cash on hand. In February 2012, the mortgage loan will convert from fixed-rate to variable-rate at LIBOR plus 1.45%.
In February 2007, we entered into a purchase contract to acquire a 100% interest in two single-tenant office buildings totaling 141,000 square-feet located in St. Charles, Missouri for approximately $28.2 million. One of the buildings is currently under construction. The acquisition will include our assumption of an approximate $7.4 million, fixed-rate mortgage loan, maturing in February 2015 at 6.05%. We expect to acquire these buildings in the second quarter of 2007.
