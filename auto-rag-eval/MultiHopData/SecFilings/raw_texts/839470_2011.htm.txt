Item 2. Properties.
South Texas
We currently control three production properties and two exploration properties in the state of Texas. These properties are owned by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, URI, Inc. The Kingsville Dome, Rosita and Vasquez production properties and the Los Finados exploration property are shown in Figure No. 2.1 and are described below.
Figure No 2.1. Texas Properties Location Map
Kingsville Dome (Figure 2.2)
The Property. The Kingsville Dome property consists of mineral leases from private landowners on about 2,434 gross and 2,227 net acres located in central Kleberg County, Texas. The leases provide for royalties based upon a percentage of uranium sales of 6.25% to 9.375%. The leases have expiration dates ranging from 2000 to 2007, however we hold most of these leases through our continuing restoration activities; and with a few minor exceptions, all the leases contain clauses that permit us to extend the leases not held by production by payment of a per acre royalty ranging from $10 to $30. We have paid such royalties on all material acreage. Mineralization is found in the Goliad formation at depths of 600 to 750 feet.
Production History. Initial production commenced in May 1988. From then until July 1999, we produced a total of 3.5 million pounds. Production was stopped in July 1999, because of depressed uranium prices. We resumed production at Kingsville Dome in April 2006 and produced 94,100 pounds of uranium in 2006, 338,100 pounds in 2007, 252,000 pounds in 2008 and 56,000 pounds in 2009. We had no production in 2010 or 2011. We made approximately $159,000 in capital expenditures in 2009, $150,000 in 2010 and $141,000 in 2011.
Permitting Status. A radioactive material license and underground injection control permit have been issued. As new areas are proposed for production, additional authorizations under the area permit are required. See "Legal Proceedings."
Restoration and Reclamation. During 2011, we conducted restoration activities as required by the permits and licenses on this project spending approximately $940,000 on restoration activities. In 2010 and 2009, we spent approximately $903,000 and $963,000, respectively. Since we began our groundwater activities in 1998, we have processed and cleaned approximately 2.5 billion gallons of groundwater at the Kingsville Dome project.
Figure No. 2.2. Kingsville Dome Property
Rosita (Figure 2.3)
The Property, The Rosita property consists of mineral leases from private landowners on about 3,377 gross and net acres and the Rosita South property consists of mineral leases from private land owners on about 1,795 gross acres and 1,479 net acres located in north-central Duval County, Texas. The leases provide for sliding scale royalties based on a percentage of uranium sales. Royalty percentages on average increase from 6.25% up to 18.25% when uranium prices reach $80.00 per pound. The leases have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2015. We are holding these leases by payment of rental fees ranging from $10 to $30 per acre. Mineralization is found in the Goliad Formation at depths of 125 to 350 feet.
Production History. Initial production commenced in 1990. From then until July 1999, URI produced a total of 2.64 million pounds. Production was stopped in July of 1999 because of depressed uranium prices. Production from a new wellfield at Rosita wellfield was begun in June 2008. However, technical difficulties that raised the cost of production coupled with a sharp drop in uranium prices led to the decision to shut-in this wellfield in October 2008 after 10,200 pounds were produced. We had no production from Rosita in 2009, 2010 or 2011.
Our capital expenditures were approximately $167,000, $137,000 and $40,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Restoration and Reclamation. We are conducting restoration and reclamation activities at this project and are currently in stabilization in our first two Production Areas. During 2010, our primary groundwater activity consisted of collecting groundwater samples throughout the year for stability testing. We spent $0 in 2011 and 2010 and approximately $247,000 on restoration activities in 2009. Since we began our groundwater activities in 2000, we have processed and cleaned approximately 1.3 billion gallons of groundwater at the Rosita project.
Permitting Status. A radioactive material license and an underground injection control permit have been issued for the Rosita property. Production could resume in areas already included in existing Production Area Authorizations. As new areas are proposed for production, additional authorizations under the permit will be required.
Figure No. 2.3. Rosita Property
Vasquez (Figure 2.4)
The Property. We have a mineral lease on 872 gross and net acres located in southwestern Duval County, in South Texas. The primary term expired in February 2008; however, we held the lease by production and are currently in restoration. The lease provides for royalties based upon 6.25% of uranium sales below $25.00 per pound and royalty rate increases on a sliding scale up to 10.25% for uranium sales occurring at or above $40.00 per pound. Mineralization is found in the Oakville formation at depths of 200 to 250 feet.
Production History. We commenced production from this property in October 2004. Our capital expenditures in 2011 were approximately $97,000. We had approximately $78,000 in capital expenditures at Vasquez in 2010. We had approximately $194,000 in capital expenditures at Vasquez in 2009. We had no production from Vasquez in 2011, 2010, and 2009.
Restoration and Reclamation. We are conducting ongoing restoration and reclamation activities at this project and have spent $590,000, $470,000 and $591,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively for such activities. Since the commencement of groundwater restoration activities at the end of 2007, we have treated approximately 365 million gallons of groundwater.
Permitting Status. All of the required permits for this property have been received.

Los Finados Project (Figure 2.5)
On December 30, 2010, we entered into a three year lease option agreement with a large Texas landowner for the exploration of 53,524 acres in Kenedy County, Texas. The agreement includes an option to lease the acreage for future uranium production.
The property is located within the prolific South Texas uranium district which has been a major producer of uranium for half a century. Situated near uranium mining operations that produce from the Goliad Formation, the property also hosts several oil and gas fields and is bisected by a major depositional channel system. These provide the geologic, stratigraphic, and geochemical components for uranium deposition and water-saturated host sand with good rock permeability. Locally, water samples taken from a number of wells on the property contain levels of uranium or uranium decay products that indicate anomalously high concentrations of uranium in nearby rock.
The lease option agreement included a $1.0 million fee paid at signing. It requires a minimum exploration obligation of one hundred exploration wells or $1.0 million investment in the first year, an additional two hundred exploration wells or $1.5 million investment in the second year and, in the third year, an additional two hundred exploration wells or $2.0 million investment. Investment or drilling in excess of the minimum requirement in any year counts toward the following year's requirements. The uranium mining lease can be acquired at any time at a cost of $200 per acre. Royalties on uranium sales are determined by a sliding scale ranging from 10% to 20.5% based on the price received. In a separate letter agreement, the parties established guidelines for securing a major partner for the exploration projects, which is a condition for exercise of the lease option.
In May 2011, the Company entered into an exploration agreement with Cameco Texas, Inc. ("CTI"), a subsidiary of Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) on the Los Finados project. The agreement with CTI also includes a three phase exploration program. We completed Phase I of the project in November, 2011 and the Company and CTI committed to Phase II of the program and began drilling under this phase in December, 2011. Phase II drilling is expected to be completed in mid-2012 and after the completion of Phase II, CTI may within 60 days elect to continue to the next phase of the exploration program. Under this agreement, CTI will fund the majority of the exploration costs and can earn up to a 70% interest in the project in consideration for their investment. Upon execution of the exploration agreement, CTI paid the Company $300,000.
During the first year, or Phase I of exploration activities, a total of 19 exploration boreholes were completed totaling 24,560 feet of drilling. Based on the first year, or Phase I, results, the Phase II exploration drilling program is currently underway to continue assessing the exploration lease area.

Marshall Exploration Property (figure 2.6).
The Marshall Property is a Goliad and Oakville prospect consisting of 2,467 gross and net acres. It is located in Duval and McMullen counties, Texas. During 2008, we drilled 280 exploration holes and discovered significant mineralization. Further evaluation will need to be conducted to determine if this property can be mined using ISR methods.
Figure No. 2.6. Marshall Exploration Property
New Mexico
General. We have various interests in properties located in New Mexico, these properties are owned by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Hydro Resources, Inc. ("HRI") (Figure 2.7). We have fee lands, patented and unpatented mining claims, mineral leases and some surface leases. We have spent $13.3 million to date on permitting for New Mexico. Additional expenditures will be required and could be material. We are unable to estimate the amount. We expect that these costs will be incurred over multiple years.
Figure No. 2.7. Location of New Mexico Properties
Churchrock/Mancos (Figure 2.8)
The Property. The Churchrock project encompasses about 3,458 gross and net acres. The properties are located in McKinley County, New Mexico and consist of three parcels, known as Section 8, Section 17 and Mancos. None of these parcels lies within the area generally recognized as constituting the Navajo Reservation. See "Legal Proceedings."
The Churchrock Section 8 Uranium property is about 10 miles northeast of Gallup, NM. It north of Highway 40 on NM Highway 566. The land is best described as an open, slightly sloping canyon surrounded to the north, east, and west by talus slopes grading to table land or mesa.
The Company's access is expected to be by the proposed construction of a highway turnout from Highway 566. Due to our planned increases in construction and operational traffic, this turnout will provide safe access to the Project. This proposal has been submitted to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, the Navajo Tribal Nation, and the State Land Office and requires approval of rights-of-way for the turnout by the Land Office, Navajo Nation and Department of the Interior. Construction of the turnout will begin after the appropriate approvals are obtained. If this approval is not obtained, the Company will explore alternative means of access. Access to the Mancos project is via 4-wheel drive ranch roads west of State Highway 566.
We hold an NRC license for and own the mineral estate in fee for the 200 acres located in NE 1/4 and the SW 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of Section 17, T16N, R16W. The balance of the 440 acres of mineral Section 17, T16N,R16W is also held in fee. In Section 8, T16N, R16W, we own the SE 1/4 in fee and hold the minerals in the rest of the section with 26 unpatented federal mining claims (UNC1A thru UNC 26). For the Mancos Property, we own the minerals in Section 13, T16N, R17W, in fee, the minerals in the NW 1/4 of Section 7, T16N, R16W, in fee and hold the minerals in the E 1/2 of Section 12, T16N, R17W, with 20 unpatented federal mining claims (KP1A thru KP5A, KP19, KP36, 121617-14A thru 121617-18A, 121617-20A thru 121617-23A and 121617-32A thru 121617-35A). The federal unpatented mining claims are all held through the payment of a $140.00 assessment fee each year on each claim.
Mineralization occurs in the Westwater Member of the Morrison Formation at depths of 800 to 1700 feet.
The surface estate on Section 17, Mancos Section 13 and Mancos Section 7 is owned by the United States Government and held in trust for the Navajo Nation. On those sections we have royalty obligations ranging from 5% to 61/4% and a 2% overriding royalty obligation to the Navajo Nation for surface use agreements. The total royalties on Section 8 depend on the sales' price of uranium. Aggregate royalties are potentially as much as 39.25% at the current price of uranium.
Development Plan. We anticipate that Churchrock will be the first of our New Mexico properties we will develop. We spent about $59,000, $139,000 and $219,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for permitting activities and land holding costs. In December 2006, we entered into a joint venture with Itochu to jointly develop this property and in March 2009 the joint venture was terminated.
Water Rights. The State Engineer approved our water rights application in October 1999 and granted us sufficient water rights for the life of Churchrock.
Permitting Status. We have the radioactive material license for Section 8. This license is subject to the continuing proceedings described under "Legal Proceedings." With respect to the UIC permits, see "Legal Proceedings." We do not plan to pursue permits for Mancos at this time.

Crownpoint (Figure 2.9)
The Property. The Crownpoint properties are located in the San Juan Basin, 22 miles northeast of our Churchrock deposits and 35 miles northeast of Gallup, New Mexico, adjacent to the town of Crownpoint, New Mexico. The properties consist of 640 gross and 556 net acres. We hold the minerals in the NW 1/4 of Section 9, T17N, R13W with 9 unpatented federal mining claims (CP-1 thru CP9) and the minerals in the SW 1/4 of Section 24, T17N, R13W with 10 unpatented federal mining claims (CP-10 thru CP-19). In the SE 1/4 of Section 24, T17N, R13W we own in fee a 40% interest in the minerals on approximately 140 acres and hold 100% of the minerals on 20 additional acres with two unpatented federal mining claims (Consol I and Consol II). In the NE 1/4 of Section 25, T17N, R13W we hold the minerals with eight unpatented federal mining claims (Hydro-1 thru Hydro-8). The federal unpatented mining claims are held through the payment of a $140.00 assessment fee each year on each claim. Access is via paved road from State Highway 371, through the town of Crownpoint to Church Road to the main gate of the property.
Mineralization is found in the Westwater Member of the Morrison Formation at a depth of from 2,100 to 2,300 feet. Three pilot shafts were commenced on the property in the early 1980's but were never completed. Surface facilities dating from those activities including buildings and their associated electrical/water infrastructure are still in-place and are currently used as offices and storage facilities.
Development Plan. We spent about $9,000, $3,000 and $3,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for permitting activities and land holding costs.
Water Rights. The State Engineer approved our water rights application in 2004 and granted us sufficient water rights for ISR operations for the life of Crownpoint Section 24 mining. We have two additional pending applications for appropriations of water, which give us the first two "positions in line" on the hearings list for the San Juan Basin. These additional pending water rights applications may involve a claim of jurisdiction by the Navajo Nation.
Permitting Status. The surface estate on Section 19 and 29 is owned by the United States Government and held in trust for the Navajo Nation and may be subject to the same jurisdictional dispute with respect to the UIC permit as for Section 8 and 17 in Churchrock.
Figure No. 2.9. Crownpoint Property Mineral Ownership
Nose Rock (Figure 2.10)
The Nose Rock property consists of approximately 6,400 acres and is located about 12 miles northeast of Crownpoint, New Mexico. The minerals are held in fee on Sections 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 29, 30 and 31 all in T19N, R11W. Access to the property is via a 41/2 mile private paved road north of Tribal Road 9. The property was developed by Philips Uranium Corporation in the early 1980's and includes two circular concrete-lined shafts that have been completed to a depth of 3,300 feet. Both shafts have been plugged at surface and just above the Westwater. There is no usable surface infrastructure on site. Mineralization occurs in the Westwater Member of the Morrison Formation.
Figure No. 2.10. Nose Rock Property Mineral Ownership
West Largo (Figure 2.11)
The West Largo property is comprised of six contiguous sections of land located in McKinley County, New Mexico about 21 miles north of the town of Milan, New Mexico and about three miles west of State Highway 509. Access is via a nine-mile 4-wheel drive road from State Highway 509. The minerals on sections 17, 19, 21 and 29 T15N, R10W are held in fee and the minerals on sections 20 and 28 T15N, R10W are held by 75 unpatented federal mining claims (ID21 thru ID91 and ID95 thru ID98). The federal unpatented mining claims are held through the payment of a $140.00 assessment fee each year on each claim.
Mineralization occurs in the Westwater Member of the Morrison Formation at depths ranging from 2,000 to 2,750 feet depending on surface topography. Over 1,000 drill holes were used to define the mineralization in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Other than this exploration drilling, there has been no development on this property.
Figure 2.11. West Largo Property Mineral Ownership
Roca Honda (Figure 2.12)
The Roca Honda property is comprised of four sections of land totaling approximately 2,560 acres located about 4 miles northwest of the town of San Mateo in McKinley County, New Mexico. Sections 13, 15 and 17, T13N, R8W are held in fee and Section 8, T13N, R8W is held by 36 unpatented federal mining claims (Roca Honda 55 thru Roca Honda 63, Roca Honda 82 thru Roca Honda 90, Roca Honda 109 thru 117 and Roca Honda 136 thru Roca Honda 144). The federal unpatented mining claims are held through the payment of a $140.00 assessment for each year on each claim. The property is accessed over various 4-wheel drive ranch roads north of State Highway 605.
Mineralization occurs in the Westwater Member of the Morrison Formation at depths ranging from 1,700 on Section 17 to over 3,300 feet in Section 13. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, various operators drilled 620 exploration holes on the property. In the late 1980's, Kerr-McGee sank a shaft to a depth of 1,475 feet on Section 17 to develop the property, then known as the Lee Mine. The shaft was stopped short of the ore zone and the mine closed down when uranium prices fell in 1983. There is no useable infrastructure on surface.
Figure No. 2.12. Roca Honda Property Mineral Ownership
Potential ISR and OSL areas (Figures 2.13 & 2.14). Several areas in T13N R 9 W and T14 N R 10W are being considered for application of ISR methods (Sections 13 and 17 of T13N R9W and Sections 5 and 27 of T14 N R 10W). All land described is owned in fee.
In November 2008, we received an exploration permit from the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division on Section 13. The permit allowed URI to drill up to ten holes for the purpose of extracting core samples. The drilling was completed in September 2010, and we received preliminary results from a third-party laboratory analysis which demonstrated low organic carbons. This result indicates that some of the 860,000 pounds of in-place mineralized material at this property may be amenable to ISR mining. This property is not yet licensed or permitted. Although further leaching studies will be required to establish recovery percentages in a full scale mining scenario, we do not currently plan such additional work until after the completion of the feasibility study currently underway on our Churchrock/Crownpoint ISR project.
Two other sections in T14N R10W (Sections 23 and 25) have been the site of extensive development and mining in the past and could provide targets for the application of Old Stope Leaching operations. Mineral on these two sections is owned in fee.

Insurance
Our properties are covered by various types of insurance including property and casualty, liability and umbrella coverage. We have not experienced any material uninsured or under insured losses related to our properties in the past and believe that sufficient insurance coverage is in place.
Reclaimed Properties
We have completed production and groundwater restoration on our Benavides and Longoria projects in South Texas. We completed the final stages of surface reclamation on these projects and received full and final release for these sites in 1999.
We acquired the Section 17 leases in the New Mexico Churchrock district from United Nuclear Corporation who had conducted underground mining for uranium on Section 17 and had reclaimed these properties. In the acquisition, we assumed any liability of United Nuclear Corporation for any remaining remediation work that might be required. The New Mexico Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department has not determined what, if any, additional remediation would be required under the New Mexico Mining Act. If more remediation work is required, we believe it would not involve material expenditures as required by the New Mexico Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department regulation.
In January 2008, the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency notified the Company of their analysis that indicated potentially uranium contaminated materials present on the Churchrock Section 17 mine site. In response, the Company has performed a comprehensive characterization of the Churchrock Site at Section 17 and lands adjacent to the site area and completed the field work during the spring/summer of 2009. This study was completed in September 2009 and we believe that any off-site mine-related impacts at Section 17 and adjacent lands are minor. The jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation to require additional remediation at the Section 17 site, and their criteria for further remediation, are unknown.
See "Legal Proceedings" for a description of the status of the Navajo EPA letter and UNC/GE Demand for Indemnity in New Mexico.
