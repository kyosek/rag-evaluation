At December 31, 1997, the Trust held investments in apartments and/or commercial properties in each geographic region of the continental United States. However, the Trust's apartments and commercial properties are concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest regions, as shown more specifically in the table under "Real Estate" below.

The percentage of the Trust's assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of the Trust's assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.

lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. The Trust may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Trust's Board of Trustees may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of shareholders to the extent such policies are not governed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust.
Although the Trust has typically invested in developed real estate, the Trust may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with nonaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees).

Mortgage Loans

It may, however, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. The Trust intends to service and may either hold for investment or sell any or all of the mortgage notes currently in its portfolio. The Trust's mortgage notes receivable consist of first mortgage loans and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. The Trust has originated its own mortgage loans as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers.

In addition to restricting the types of collateral and priority of mortgage loans in which the Trust may invest, the Declaration of Trust imposes certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS".
At December 31, 1997, the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio included six mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $5.0 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Southeast, and five mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $332,000 secured by single-family residences located in the Southwest region.

First Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in first mortgage notes, with either short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the Trust's policy is to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Trust may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Trust.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1997.
At December 31, 1997, one of the Trust's mortgage notes receivable with a principal balance of $700,000 was in default. The note matured in July 1993. The Trust continues to receive partial interest payments monthly on the note from the borrower. The Trust is evaluating its options with respect to foreclosure of the collateral property and the Trust does not anticipate incurring a loss beyond the established reserve.
One of the Trust's mortgage notes receivable with a principal balance of $1.4 million, matured in November 1995. In February 1997, the Trust received a payment of $470,000 from the borrower, $305,000 being applied against accrued but unpaid interest and $165,000 being applied to reduce the principal balance of the note. In September 1997, the Trust received $1.4 million in full payment of principal and all accrued but unpaid interest.
As discussed above in "Real Estate," ten of the Company's mortgage notes receivable, with a combined principal balance, at the time, of $2.8 million were pledged as additional collateral on a $4.0 million loan, primarily secured by the AMOCO Building. In June, August and November 1997, three of the mortgage notes receivable, with a combined principal balance of $1.3 million, were paid in full. Such payments were remitted to the lender as a paydown of the mortgage debt. In March 1998, the AMOCO loan was refinanced and the collateral loans were released.
In June 1997, the Trust obtained financing in the amount of $1.4 million secured by the mortgage note receivable secured by the Cypress Creek Office Building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The financing bears interest at a variable rate, currently 9.0% per annum, requires monthly principal and interest payments of $14,126 and matures in June 2009. The Trust paid a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee of $14,000 to BCM based on the $1.4 million financing.

Mortgage Loans (Continued)
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage loan having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan(s) plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Trust's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make first mortgage loans. At December 31, 1997, the Trust's mortgage notes receivable portfolio contained no wraparound mortgage loans.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Trust has invested in junior mortgage loans. Such loans are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Trust's Declaration of Trust restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of the Trust's assets. At December 31, 1997, less than 1% of the Trust's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
Other. In July 1996, the Trust agreed to fund up to $500,000 on a promissory note secured by a contract to purchase land in Frisco, Texas. At December 31, 1996, the Trust had funded the entire $500,000. The note bore interest at 13% per annum and all accrued interest and principal were due at the note's December 31, 1996 maturity date. The note's maturity date was subsequently extended. The note and all accrued but unpaid interest was paid in full in June 1997.
