Pan Gold Project
The Pan gold project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit located along the prolific Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend. Gold mineralization occurs in shallow oxide deposits, along a two-mile strike length of a faulted anticline. We have targeted this project for development of an open pit, heap leach mining operation. The NEPA portion of the permitting is complete and initial mine construction is underway. Production is planned for 2014 depending on obtaining adequate financing.
Location and Means of Access
The Pan property is located at the northern end of the Pancake mountain range in western White Pine County, Nevada, approximately 22 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada, and 50 miles west of Ely, Nevada. Access is via a seven mile dirt road running south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Eureka has a population of about 2,000. Water is readily available from wells on the property. Permits have been received to extend power lines to the property.
Title
We have controlled the property since April 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. Our land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 9,794.5 acres containing federal lode mining claims.
We acquired our interest in a January 7, 2003 mineral lease agreement with Nevada Royalty Corp., Inc (“NRC”), formerly Newark Valley Mining Corp., formerly Gold Standard Royalty Corporation and formerly the Lyle Campbell Trust as a result of its acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5th of each year we must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of US$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 174 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing price for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. On January 1, 2013 we paid $283,194 (US$287,448). Subsequent to the year-end we paid $245,768 (US$231,072) on January 2, 2014. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. We must incur a minimum of US$65,000 a year of work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease.
We have staked additional claims adjacent to the Pan property, some of which fall within the one mile area of interest of the NRC mining lease and will be subject to the production royalty to NRC. We have staked additional claims around the project, increasing the total land holdings to over 16 square miles. Our land position containing federal lode mining claims, placer mining claims and patented fee properties encompasses a gross area of approximately 10,372.6 acres.
We have prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of its ownership or interest in the property, describes its interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.

Mineral Resources
In October 2011, we reported an updated resource estimate for the Pan gold project based on results from 2011 drilling received up to the date of the resource estimate. The updated Measured and Indicated mineral resource estimate exceeds one million ounces of gold. The 1.13 million ounces of gold are contained in 37 million tonnes of 0.49 grams per tonne (gpt) gold in the Measured category and 43 million tonnes of 0.40 gpt gold in the Indicated category using a 0.14 gpt gold cutoff grade. The updated resource was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC, an arm’s length party to the Company. The mineral resources are summarized below. “NI 43-101 Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada, dated November 1, 2011,” which is available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com. The report was prepared to the standards of National Instrument 43-101 and was filed on SEDAR on November 2, 2011.
Updated Resource Estimate, Pan Gold Project, Nevada
Note: The tonnage and total ounces of gold were determined from the statistical block model. Average grades were calculated from the tonnage and total ounces and then rounded to the significant digits shown. Calculations based on this table may differ due to the effect of rounding.
On November 15, 2011, we announced completion of a Feasibility Study showing robust economics for the Pan gold project. Mineral Reserves were based upon a design pit using Lerchs Grossmann generated pit surfaces that maximize revenue based on a $1,200 per ounce three-year trailing average price of gold. Cutoff grades of 0.21 gpt in the South pit and 0.27 gpt in the North & Central pits produced the project’s highest NPV. “NI 43-101 Technical Report Feasibility Study for the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada, dated November 15, 2011,” which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. The feasibility Study was prepared by Guastavson Associates LLC, to the standards of National Instrument 43-101 and was filed on SEDAR on December 21, 2011. An updated report “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report, Feasibility Study for the Pan Project, White Pine County, Nevada” dated November 29, 2012 was filed to clarify responsibilities of the Qualified Persons. This updated report made no changes in the feasibility study numbers.
			
		
Table 2: Total Pan Mineral Reserves, November 2011
Note: The tonnage and total ounces of gold were determined from the statistical block model. Average grades were calculated from the tonnage and total ounces and then rounded to the significant digits shown. Calculations based on this table may differ due to the effect of rounding. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
We believe that there is no material difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed above under our NI 43-101 Feasibility Study and those disclosable under SEC Industry Guide 7, and therefore no reconciliation is provided. Since the Pan project has known reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 and has received its Record of Decision, the project is considered by us to be in the development stage.
Mining and Production
The Pan gold deposit contains near-surface mineralization that can be extracted using open pit mining methods. Results from mineral extraction tests indicate that the ore can be processed by conventional heap leaching methods. Ore from the South Pan pit will be processed ROM, while ore from the North Pan pit will be crushed before being placed on the leach pad. Pregnant solutions will be treated in an adsorption/desorption recovery (ADR) plant.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we incurred expenditures of $2,151,355 and $1,415,189 at the Pan Project, respectively. These expenditures were primarily for salaries and labor, which were 71% and 62% of mineral exploration expenditures during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized into property, equipment and mine development $8,454,762 and $6,057,111 of Pan expenditures, respectively, for permitting, mitigation, engineering, site characterization, metallurgy, mine planning, and detailed design.
Geology
The Pan gold project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit on the prolific Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend in Nevada. It is an oxide deposit exposed on the surface. Host rocks are Devonian-Mississippian marine siltstone and limestone of the Pilot Formation and the Devils Gate Formation. Breccias developed along the Pan fault are the primary host of gold mineralization. Argillic alteration and silicification are the dominant alteration types associated with gold. At North Pan, gold mineralization is primarily hosted by silicified breccia in the Pilot Formation. At South Pan, gold occurs primarily in argillic altered breccia in the Devils Gate Formation. Gold occurs as stratabound mineralization outside of the breccias particularly in the Wendy zone adjacent to South Pan.
Exploration and Development
The Pan mineralization was discovered in 1978 and over 860 holes have been drilled by 10 different exploration companies. These include: Amselco, Hecla, Echo Bay, Alta Gold, Pan Nevada Gold, and a number of other junior exploration companies.
			
		
In 2007, we drilled 35,510 feet in 113 exploration holes outside of the known resource. Drill results at Boulders extended gold north for 1,300 feet under volcanic outcrop at North Pan. Drill results at Barite and Wendy extended gold at South Pan by 400 feet south and 300 feet east respectively. The Nana zone, 4,000 feet northwest of North Pan, represents a new exploration opportunity. A large scale soil survey identified four previously unknown gold-arsenic anomalies with no previous exploration drilling.
In 2008, we completed 26,245 feet of drilling in 49 reverse circulation holes. Fourteen new holes in the resource area were drilled to verify results from previous operators. Most intercepted higher grades and greater thicknesses than previously reported (see our Press Release dated July 9, 2008). Preliminary investigations suggest that assay techniques used by a previous operator may have under-estimated gold values in some of the holes. A higher-grade gold zone was found at North Pan with true widths of 10 to 25 feet and grades from 0.07 to 0.51 ounces per tonne (“opt”) gold over 800 feet in length. Additional near surface oxide gold was discovered at South Pan where the Wendy zone was expanded to the east under volcanic cover. Three targets outside the resource were tested with no significant results.
In 2009, we completed an internal mineral resource update and we announced it in November 2009.
In 2010, we commissioned a preliminary economic assessment (the “Pan PEA”) that included an independent review of the resource. Results of the Pan PEA encouraged us to move the project toward production at an accelerated pace. A total of 5,764 feet of core in 14 holes was completed to obtain samples for additional metallurgical testing, geotechnical studies of potential pit walls, and waste rock characterization studies. The gold grades in these core holes were higher than expected based on previous analyses from nearby holes. Insights into the geology and alteration based on the core holes resulted in reassessing the geological constraints of the deposit. Engineering studies were initiated in support of a pre-feasibility study planned for 2011. Environmental base line studies were initiated to support a mining permit.
In 2011, we completed a 33,055 foot reverse circulation drilling program and reported drill intercepts from 37 reverse circulation drill holes, including drill hole PN11-09 which contained the longest and highest grade gold intercept yet encountered at the project. The 98 foot intercept of 0.092 opt gold includes a zone of 45 feet of 0.169 opt gold which also includes a 5 foot interval of 0.295 opt gold. In addition, we completed 3,817 feet of core drilling on six core holes. As expected, drilling to test for mineralization beneath proposed mine facility sites produced no significant results.
In addition, in November 2011 we announced completion of a Feasibility Study showing strong economics for the Pan gold project. The Feasibility Study showed NPV of the project to be robust at a range of gold prices, increasing from $123 million at $1,200/oz gold to $344M at $1,900/oz gold. The IRR grows from 32% to 79% using the same range of gold prices. Both use a 5% discount rate and are after tax figures. According to the 2001 Feasibility Study, the capital costs to build the mine are estimated to be $99M which includes $8.2M working capital and a $6.8M contingency. The operating cash cost is projected to be $585/oz which includes royalties, state taxes, and a 5% contingency. The total production cost including capital is projected to be $824/oz. For further information on this project, please see the report entitled “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report Feasibility Study for the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada, dated December 29, 2012”, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. The Feasibility study was prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC, to the standards of National Instrument 43-101 and was originally filed on SEDAR on December 21, 2011.
A detailed discussion regarding Sampling and Analysis as well as Security of Samples is included within the National Instrument 43-101 which is available through www.sedar.com.
During 2012, we completed the scoping phase of the federal permitting process, completed the construction of a new access road Jacobs Engineering Group completed front-end engineering of mine related infrastructure, SRK Consulting completed engineering for the heap leach pad and ponds, Summit Valley Technologies was contracted to provide gold recovery equipment for the processing plant, large scale column leach tests were initiated to determine gold recovery from larger size material. We completed 8,170 feet of reverse circulation drilling in 14 holes and 2,156 feet of core drilling in 7 holes for crusher site characterization, testing deep exploration targets, and follow-up condemnation drilling beneath proposed mine facilities. Water rights for mineral processing were acquired and a production water well and five monitor wells were completed.
2013 Program
A trial blast provided material for large column tests to evaluate the potential for Run of Mine leaching at South Pan. Test result showed that ROM is a viable option at South Pan. Our engineers have been optimizing mine plans and re-evaluating operating and capital costs for the project. The NEPA permitting process was completed with a Record of Decision for the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued on Dec 20, 2013. We also received confirmation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no surface waters are present at the project that would fall under the jurisdiction of Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. We received our Water Pollution Control Permit and our Air Quality Operating Permit to Construct. Construction began with a groundbreaking in January 2014. A construction management contract has been awarded to Jacobs Engineering.
			
		
To date we have incurred total costs of $16,921,984 relating to the exploration and $14,511,873 relating to the development of the Pan gold project.
The Pan gold project has known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is developmental in nature.
Gold Rock Project
Gold Rock is a sediment-hosted gold deposit located along the prolific Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend 8 miles from the Pan gold project. The property includes the Easy Junior Mine, which reportedly produced approximately 2.9 million tons at a grade of 0.026 opt for 74,945 ounces of gold by 1994. Additional drilling was completed in 2013 to expand the resource. Surface work was completed to identify additional exploration targets on the property.
Location and Means of Access
The Gold Rock property is situated in the eastern Pancake Range in western White Pine County, Nevada. The property is 8 miles southeast of the Company’s Pan gold project. Access is via the Green Springs road from US Highway 50 approximately 65 miles from Ely, Nevada. Water for exploration purposes is available from wells in the region under temporary grant of water rights. It is anticipated that power will be available from the line being extended to serve the nearby Pan gold Project.
Title
We have controlled the property since April 13, 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode and placer mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. Our land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 11,607.8 acres containing federal lode and placer mining claims.
We acquired our interest in the March 20, 2006 mineral lease agreement with NRC as a result of our acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5 of each year we must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of US$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 108.05 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing price for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. On January 2, 2013 we paid $175,857 (US$178,499). Subsequent to the year-end we paid $152,616 (US$143,490) on January 2, 2014 in respect of our 2014 obligations under this agreement. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale NSR production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. We must incur a minimum of US$75,000 annual work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease.
We have entered into or acquired four additional agreements for claims adjacent to and contiguous with the NRC claims:
·
On January 8, 2013, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of $66,579 (US$67,476) to Anchor Minerals, Inc. to maintain its mineral lease for 80 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner holds a 3.5% gross production royalty.
·
On January 1, 2013, we paid the annual option payment of $49,335 (US$50,000) to Brian Peart to maintain our option to purchase 13 unpatented lode and placer mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for US$5,000,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Peart holds a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2 and 6% from commercial production on these claims
·
On January 8, 2013, we paid the annual option payment of $7,647 (US$7,750) to Jerry Pankow to maintain our option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for US$775,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Pankow holds a sliding scale NSR royalty of between 2 and 5% from commercial production on these claims
·
On January 8, 2013, we paid the annual payment of $14,801 (US$15,000) to Ronald “Ronny” Jordan to maintain our option to purchase 10 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for US$2,500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Jordan holds a 2.5% NSR from commercial production on these claims. The assignor of this lease agreement to us also holds a 0.5% NSR royalty
Over the years we have staked additional claims outright adjacent to and contiguous with the Gold Rock property, which are outside of any area of interest.
We have prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership area.

Geology
Gold Rock is a sediment-hosted gold system in highly prospective host rocks within a 20 square mile land position along the Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend. Gold was mined at the Easy Junior pit from siltstone and limestone of the Joanna and Chainman Formations. Additional gold anomalies occur in the Pilot and Devils Gate Formations, the same host rocks as found at the nearby Pan gold project. These potential host rocks are exposed along 6 miles of strike length and may have been repeated by east verging thrust faulting. Exposures in the Easy Junior pit show mineralization associated with the crest of a tight anticline cut by a high angle reverse fault. Gold is associated with silicification and argillic alteration of the host rocks along the structure. Historic drill data and geologic mapping suggests additional folds and thrust faulting around and along strike of the pit.
Exploration
The Easy Junior Mine, in the center of the Gold Rock property, reportedly produced 2.9 million tons of 0.026 opt gold (74,945 ounces gold contained) during operations by Alta Gold and the Alta Bay joint venture (Alta Gold-Echo Bay). The mine was shut down in 1994. A historic database of 794 holes containing 269,446 feet of drilling was acquired in 2008. Analysis of this drill data by us outlined a gold zone in the walls of the pit and along a strike extending south into the Decker Flat area. The gold zone is defined by 300 holes and extends for 9,200 feet along the strike of the Easy Junior anticline. This zone appears to be oxide, above the water table, and open in all directions.
Our exploration work has included drilling, data compilation and surface exploration. Data compilation has included historic drill hole data, rock and soil geochemical data, geologic mapping, and geophysical surveys generated by previous exploration companies. We have generated new geology and alteration mapping and additional rock and soil sampling. A gravity survey was conducted over the property position.
In 2008, we drilled 3,525 feet in 11 reverse circulation holes on the Anchor target at the south end of the property. The target was gold bearing Pilot shale. Five holes found strongly anomalous gold in the Pilot formation, a regionally favorable host rock. Several targets were not tested due to large voids in the rock above the targets. The drill rig in use at that time was not equipped to get past these areas. Follow up drilling is planned when appropriate equipment is available.
			
		
In 2011, we drilled 26,125 feet in 25 reverse circulation holes and 5,180 feet in 6 core holes to confirm the historic data, verify locations and grades, and test expansion potential. Initial results were positive; verifying the grade, width, and location of historic results in those areas drilled to date. A technical report was completed by Gustavson Associates, LLC to review geological and historical drill data prior to the 2011 drilling program. Historic drill results include 673 drill holes within and surrounding the Easy Junior open pit mine. Gustavson’s initial evaluation confirmed that Gold Rock contains a gold system that warrants additional exploration and evaluation. The lithology, alteration, and mineralization are similar to other sediment hosted Carlin-type systems such as Alligator Ridge, Bald Mountain, Rain, and our Pan Gold Project, 8 miles to the northwest.
In 2012, we completed 38,950 feet of reverse circulation drilling and 5,361 feet of core drilling in 2012. Drill results include intercepts of 30 feet of 0.095 opt gold in GR12-02c including 10 feet of 0.266 opt gold. Drilling also intercepted 348 feet of 0.036 opt gold in GR12-17. Full results are reported in a press release dated January 7, 2013. An independent engineer, Gustavson Associates, LLC of Lakewood, Colorado (“Gustavson”) reviewed all drilling results to provide a new resource update. The new resource included an Indicated mineral resource of 310,000 ounces of gold and an Inferred mineral resource of 331,000 ounces. The Indicated mineral resource is contained in 12,968,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.74 grams per tonne (gpt) gold. The Inferred mineral resource is contained in 17,894,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.58 gpt gold. The resource includes results from 466 verified historic drill holes and 31 verification holes we drilled in 2011. The resource extends for 8,200 feet north and south from the historic Easy Junior open pit gold mine. See “NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources, Gold Rock Project, White Pine County, Nevada” prepared by Gustavson Associates LLC and dated April 10, 2012. An updated report “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources Gold Rock Project, White Pine County, Nevada” prepared by Gustavson Associates and dated November 29, 2012 was filed to clarify responsibilities of the Qualified Persons and to clarify language regarding capping, density, and cut-off values. This updated report made no changes to the resource estimate.

2013 Exploration Program
2013 drilling, surface work
A mine permit was submitted to the BLM and has been declared complete. Initial scoping public meetings have been completed and a Draft Environmental Impact Statement is currently underway. Exploration permit approval has been received for an expanded drill plan that will allow both in-fill and step-out drilling.
To date we have incurred total costs of $8,896,401 relating to the exploration of the Gold Rock project. We have budgeted approximately $500,000 for the 2014 exploration program.
The Gold Rock project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Spring Valley Project
Spring Valley is a diatreme/porphyry hosted gold system covered by gravel. Gold has been intercepted over an area 5,200 feet long by 3,500 feet wide that extended to a depth of 1,400 feet, suggesting the presence of a large mineral system. The Spring Valley project is under an exploration and option to joint venture agreement with Barrick Gold Exploration Inc. Barrick funded 100% of the costs to earn an interest in this project. Barrick has informed us and we have confirmed that, as of November 15, 2013, it has completed the expenditure requirement of $38 million to earn a 70% interest in the Spring Valley project.
			
		
Location, Means of Access and State of Property
The Spring Valley property is located in the Spring Valley Mining District, Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 20 miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The property is accessed from Nevada State Highway 50, which extends eastward from US Interstate 80 and is paved to the Rochester turn-off; thereafter it is a dirt road. Water for exploration purposes is available from water wells drilled on the property under temporary grant of water rights. Power is accessible from existing power lines; however capacity is unknown and may be limited.
Agreement with Barrick Gold
On March 9, 2009, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Midway Gold US Inc. (“MGUS”), executed an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement, effective March 9, 2009 (the “EDM Agreement”), with Barrick, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, regarding the exploration, development and possible joint venture of our Spring Valley Project.
Exploration Period
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, MGUS granted to Barrick the exclusive right to explore and develop the Spring Valley Project. During this exploration period, Barrick had the exclusive right to earn a 60% interest in the Spring Valley Project by spending US$30.0 million on the property over a five-year period ending December 31, 2013. During this five-year period Barrick had the sole right to determine the nature, scope, extent and method of all operations in relation to the property, without having to consult or gain our approval. Barrick was required to provide us with certain information and reports and access to the Spring Valley Project to conduct inspections of operations during this period.
After vesting at 60%, Barrick increased its interest by 10% (to 70% total) by spending an additional US$8.0 million, which we confirmed as of February 23, 2014. At our election, Barrick may also earn an additional 5% (75% total) by carrying us to a production decision and arranging financing for our share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by Barrick once production has been established. We have until July 14, 2014 to elect the carry option, if so elected; our portion of the development and operating costs incurred by Barrick in the election period will be treated as our development costs.
To date, Barrick has conducted and reported funding exploration totaling US$38.8 million. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, Barrick reported spending US$5.8 million, US$7.6 million, US$10.1 million and US$11.0 million, respectively. Barrick’s reported spending through 2013 has increased their interest in the Spring Valley property to 70%.
Joint Venture
Under the terms of the third amendment to the EDM Agreement, we exercised our option to enter into a joint venture with Barrick as of February 23, 2014. With the formation of the joint venture agreement with Barrick, initial capital accounts will be established in accordance with Barrick’s earned interest in the Spring Valley Project and Barrick will be the manager of the joint venture.
The EDM Agreement also provides for the adjustment of a party’s participating interest in the joint venture upon default in making agreed-upon contributions to adopted programs and budgets or upon contributing less to a program and budget than a percentage equal to the party’s participating interest.
Further, the EDM Agreement provides that if our participation interest falls below 10%, we shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and all of our participating interests will be assigned to Barrick, we will reserve a 2% NSR.
Under the EDM Agreement, a party’s whose recalculated participating interest is reduced to 10% shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and shall relinquish its entire participating interest. Such relinquished participating interest shall be deemed to have accrued automatically to the other party. The reduced party shall have the right to receive 10% of net proceeds, if any, to a maximum amount of 75% percent of the reduced party’s equity account balance as of the effective date of the withdrawal. Upon receipt of such amount, the reduced party shall thereafter have no further right, title, or interest in the Spring Valley Project or under the EDM Agreement.
			
		
Title
We have controlled the property since 2003 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. As of February 28, 2014, we conveyed a 70% interest, under the terms of the Joint Venture, in the Joint Venture area of interest. Unpatented mining claims are kept active through payment of a maintenance fee due to the BLM and each county the claims are located in on August 31st of each year. Certain areas of the Spring Valley project are subject to NSR royalties ranging from 1% to 7% on different claim groups within the project package. Our land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 11,022.5 acres containing federal lode and placer mining claims and patented fee properties.
We have prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of its ownership or interest in the property, describes its interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.
			
		
			
		
			
		
In 2013, Barrick, on behalf of our Company, paid the following lease payments or fulfilled work commitments to maintain certain mineral leases and options for the Spring Valley project:
·
On March 1, 2013, Barrick paid our annual payment of US$36,000 to Lamonte J. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 12 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner retained a 3% NSR royalty. Alternatively, we can purchase these claims for US$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
During 2013, Barrick paid on or prior to the first day of each month on our behalf US$1,000 option payment totaling US$12,000 to George D. Duffy, MS Duffy Mine Properties LLC and the Estate of Margaret Suverkoop Duffy to maintain its option to purchase two unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for US$500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.

·
In 2011, Barrick acquired a sub-lease and option agreement with Newmont Mining Company for mineral rights underlying certain surface rights acquired by the Company in 2006, which would become part of the Spring Valley joint venture between us and Barrick. The agreement requires Barrick to spend a cumulative amount of US$2,000,000 in work expenditures on the ground leased over a period of six years, and to make advance royalty payments in the amount of US$100,000 per year thereafter, up to a cap of US$2,500,000. The advance royalty payments may be credited against a 3% NSR royalty payable from production on the area of ground leased. Barrick has maintained the sub-lease and option agreement and is in good standing as of December 31, 2013.
			
		
Over the years, we have staked additional claims and purchased rights to additional claims outright within and adjacent to the Spring Valley property.
Geology
The Spring Valley gold deposit is hosted in Permo-Triassic Koipato Group rocks made up of rhyolite flows, breccias, and volcaniclastic sediments. These volcanics were intruded by fine grained feldspar porphyry. Hydrothermal alteration includes quartz-sericite + pyrite alteration associated with gold, argillic alteration in hydrothermal breccias, and lesser secondary potassium feldspar, iron carbonate, and hematite-quartz alteration. Gold mineralization occurs in sheeted quartz veins, hydrothermal breccias, and open fractures. The gold is distributed along the top of the intrusion, and in overlying volcanic rocks, commonly at stratigraphic contacts, fracture zones, and in the remains of a diatreme breccia. Gold is found as grains of free gold up to 3 mm across, and has been observed along the edges of sulfide grains, indicating gold deposition is later than the sulfides.
Exploration Completed by the Company
During 2004 and 2005, we evaluated previous drill results by Kennecott Utah Copper and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. to generate new targets. These were subsequently tested by drilling 90 reverse circulation holes totaling 44,965 feet and 21 diamond drill holes totaling 10,008.7 feet resulting in discovery of the Porphyry and Sill zones. At the end of the program, the mineralized zone covered an area 3,200 feet long by 1,600 feet wide with mineralization to a depth of 984 feet.
In 2006, we completed 66,616 feet of drilling in 90 holes to expand the resource to the north and west, as well as to test a much larger porphyry gold target at depth. At the end of the program, the mineralized zone covered an area 4,500 feet long by 3,000 feet wide that is mineralized to a depth of 1,400 feet. Surface exploration including a 3,000 soil sample grid survey, gravity and self-potential geophysical surveys, geologic mapping and rock chip sampling over the 17 square miles of claim holdings resulting in the identification of 12 new targets for follow up work.
In 2007, we drilled 102,000 feet to expand the west and north zones and to test the deep porphyry potential. Limited infill drilling was completed. An additional 10,850 feet was drilled on the Limerick, American Canyon, King David and Golden Gate satellite targets. In August 2007, we completed the purchase of the key Schmidt lease in Spring Valley by paying the final US$3,000,000 due. This payment was the final advance royalty payment for the first 500,000 ounces of gold to be produced from the Schmidt claim package.
Based on drilling results through 2007, an updated inferred mineral resource estimate was made by AMEC E&C Services Inc. and reported in January, 2008. The resource model showed a large number of grade blocks outside of the L-G optimization shell that were not included in the resource.
In 2008, we completed 87 holes including 63,565 feet of reverse circulation and 8,985 feet of core drilling. The drilling identified a coherent gold mineralization zone 5,200 feet long by 3,500 feet wide that extended to a depth of 1,400 feet. Two outlying targets, the Fitting and Limerick areas, were tested with a total of 22 exploration drill holes with no significant results.
By January 1, 2009, a total of 318,510 feet of drilling from 450 holes has been completed in six drilling campaigns in the Spring Valley resource area. Based on these results, we completed an in-house resource update that was reported in March 2009.
Exploration Completed by Barrick
In 2009, Barrick drilled 34 holes totaling 29,002 feet of reverse circulation drilling and 8,738 feet of core drilling. Barrick’s drilling focused on confirmation of previous drill results, infilling defined mineralized areas and initial metallurgical test work.
Barrick completed a scoping level metallurgical study on 13 composites from drill core. Results indicated no significant difference in recovery between oxide and sulfide material. Bottle roll test results ranged from 86% to 98% gold recoveries from oxide, sulfide and transition composites. Column leach tests indicated a 60% to 90% gold recovery over an average 260-day leach period. Gravity separation tests showed gold recoveries of 91% to 50.6% of the calculated head grade. The majority of gravity recoverable gold was released with the coarsest grind and gravity tails were found to be amenable to leaching of the remaining gold.
In 2010, Barrick completed 30,565 feet of reverse circulation drilling in 15 holes and 20 pre-collars and 21,760 feet of core drilling in 19 holes. A hydrology study to assess de-watering requirements determined that pump rates would be in the 650-1,100 gallon per minute range.
			
		
In 2011, Barrick drilled 47,435 feet in 32 reverse circulation holes, 15,361 feet in 4 core holes and 10 pre-collared core holes. Barrick informed us that the 2011 drill plan was focused on expanding the resource and evaluating property acquired south of the current resource area. Drill results included widely spaced drilling south of the current resource and holes that tested the northern extent of the known resource. Results indicate that the deposit remains open to the north and new gold assays extend the gold zone at least 1.7 kilometers to the southwest of the previously known resource area. Barrick has increased participation of their Project Development group and Mine Site Exploration group as part of the initial stages of transitioning from a pure exploration project to a mine development project. To accommodate a planned increase in operations, Barrick has expanded the project office in Lovelock. Additionally, Barrick has initiated cultural and biological studies to support an environmental assessment for an expanded drilling area.
We engaged an independent engineer, Gustavson Associates, LLC of Lakewood, Colorado (“Gustavson”) to review the drilling results and provide a new resource update that incorporated all Barrick drilling through May, 2011. The updated mineral resource estimate includes Barrick drilling results from its 2009 and 2010 drill campaigns. The resource estimate has 2.16 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated mineral resource categories, consisting of 0.93 million ounces in the Measured category and 1.23 million ounces in the Indicated category at a cut-off grade of 0.14 grams per tonne (g/t). There was an additional Inferred mineral resource of 1.97 million ounces of gold at the same cut-off grade. The Measured resource is contained within 59.0 million tonnes grading 0.49 g/t, the Indicated mineral resource is contained within 85.8 million tonnes grading 0.45 g/t and the Inferred resource is contained within 103.9 million tonnes grading 0.59 g/t. The report was prepared by William J. Crowl, Donald E. Hulse, Donald J. Baker, Terre A. Lane, and Deepak Malhotra, under the supervision of Gustavson, who are “independent” and "qualified persons" under NI 43-101. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion regarding Sampling and Analysis as well as Security of Samples, please see the report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Spring Valley Project Pershing County, Nevada" dated effective May 24, 2011, which is available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com. An updated report “Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Spring Valley Project, Pershing County, Nevada” dated November 29, 2012 was filed to clarify responsibilities of the Qualified Persons and to clarify language regarding capping, density, and cut-off values. This updated report made no changes to the resource estimate.
During 2012, Barrick reported drilling 38,845 feet in 33 reverse circulation holes and, 21,573 feet in 21 core holes. The 2012 drilling program was completed with one reverse circulation rig and one core rig. Barrick also reported completing studies of hydrology, biological baseline, initial site engineering, pit slope geotechnical, and initiated additional metallurgical testing. An internal Barrick scoping study is underway.
2013 Exploration Program
During 2013, Barrick reported drilling of 39,357 feet in 24 reverse circulation holes and, 29,003 feet in 26 core holes. The 2013 drilling program was completed with two reverse circulation rigs and two core rigs. Barrick also reported continuing work on hydrology, biological baseline, initial site engineering, pit slope geotechnical, and initiated additional metallurgical testing. An internal Barrick scoping study is underway.
To date the Company has incurred total costs of $20,604,845 relating to the exploration of the Spring Valley project.
The Spring Valley project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Tonopah Project
Tonopah is a high-grade epithermal quartz-gold vein system, on the Round Mountain - Goldfield gold trend. A core drilling program was conducted at Tonopah during 2012 to define the true width and continuity of gold grade in veins and wall rock. A total of 13,000 feet was drilled in 26 holes to test areas of the Discovery, 121, Dauntless, and 63-77 areas. No drilling was done in 2013.
Location and Means of Access
The Tonopah property is located in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles northeast of the town of Tonopah, 210 miles northwest of Las Vegas and 236 miles southeast of Reno. The property is over the northeastern flank of the San Antonio Mountains and in the Ralston Valley. Water for exploration purposes is available from water wells drilled on the property under a temporary grant of water rights. Power is accessible from existing power lines crossing the property, however capacity is unknown and may be limited.
The Tonopah project is located at the intersection of the well-known Round Mountain/Goldfield trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon vein clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization.
			
		
Title
We have controlled the property since 2001. Through a series of agreements, amendments and payments we acquired a 100% interest in the Tonopah property subject to a sliding scale on NSR royalty from any commercial production of between 2% to 7%, based on changes in gold prices, and we must pay an advance minimum royalty, recoverable from commercial production, of US$300,000 per year, payable on August 15.
In addition, the surface rights to 560 acres in Section 32 are held by the Town of Tonopah. The remaining 80 acres of surface rights in Section 32 are held as two 40-acre parcels by two owners. We hold federal mineral rights for the entirety of Section 32 in unpatented claims.
We have prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of its ownership or interest in the property, describes its interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.

Geology
The Tonopah project is located at the intersection of the Round Mountain/Goldfield gold trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Host rocks are Ordovician black argillite of the Palmetto Formation and unconformably overlying Tertiary rhyolitic volcanics. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization.
Exploration
Veins in the Discovery zone were discovered by Kennecott Utah Copper in 1992. Prior to this the property was explored by Houston Oil and Minerals, Coeur d’Alene Mines, and Rio Algom. Tombstone Exploration and Golconda Resources explored the property after Kennecott Utah Copper.
In 2002, we completed 26,689.5 feet of core drilling in 69 holes. Intercepts such as 2.5 feet of 119 opt gold in 17 feet that averaged 34.7 opt gold in the vein encouraged Newmont Mining Company to enter into a joint venture on the property in September 2002. Newmont Mining Company completed extensive regional exploration programs including airborne magnetic, EM, and radiometric surveys and ground radiometric, gravity and CSAMT surveys. From 2002 to 2003 the joint venture with Newmont Mining Company drilled a total of 67,703.5 feet in 121 holes in the greater Discovery area and other targets.
From 2003 to 2004, the joint venture drilled 10,195 feet in 7 reverse circulation holes and 5,847 feet in 16 core holes. Five holes were drilled in the 121 Zone and the others in a largely untested area south of the Discovery zone. Newmont Mining Company terminated the joint venture in June 2004.
In 2005, we drilled 8,987 feet in 16 reverse circulation holes to test for extensions adjacent to the known resource areas. The program resulted in the discovery of the Dauntless Zone with hole MW399 which encountered 175 feet of 0.349 opt gold including a vein assaying 15 feet of 3.163 opt gold. An independent resource estimate was completed based on a model of disseminated, strataform mineralization in the Tertiary volcanics using open pit mining methods. We no longer believe this business case is optimal for this property and are evaluating a model that would support underground mine development.
In 2006, we drilled 26,450 feet in 56 holes. The Dauntless zone was extended 650 feet along strike with true width varying from 23 to 66 feet. Grades vary from 0.029 to 1.16 ounces per ton starting within 165 feet of the surface. Drilling identified 58 veins with at least one intercept greater than 0.15 ounces of gold per ton that are not yet defined. Plans were proposed for a decline that would allow bulk sampling of the Discovery and Dauntless gold zones for metallurgical testing and allow better access for exploration of the gold bearing quartz veins. Fourteen monitor wells were installed to study the dewatering costs for the decline. Four of the monitor holes encountered new gold mineralization.
In 2007, pump tests from a 450-foot water well in the Discovery area were conducted to determine dewatering needs for a decline. This program estimated the need to pump 2,000 gallons per minute to dewater the decline and mine workings. Engineering was initiated for a decline to provide access 200 feet below high grade portions of certain veins and to then take a 50,000 ton bulk sample.
In 2008, we drilled 1,234 feet in 12 reverse circulation holes and 2,321 feet in 9 core holes for hydrology and geotechnical testing along the planned route of the decline. Two new vein intercepts were discovered (see our Press Release dated, May 14, 2008). No gold was noted in five holes drilled to test proposed waste rock storage sites. Metallurgical testing by SGS Lakefield Research Limited (Canada) showed up to 94% gold recovery using gravity and cyanide from a 73-lb. composite sample of Discovery vein material grading 0.188 opt gold. Further work by Gekko Systems Metallurgical Laboratory (Australia) showed that gravity and flotation could achieve 86.7% gold recovery and 66.3% silver recovery without using cyanide, based on a 242-lb composite sample, grading 0.662 opt gold and 0.475 opt silver.
In 2009, we worked with the Town of Tonopah, Nevada to negotiate a plan to properly dispose of mine water to the standards required by the State Water Engineer. In early 2011 we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Town of Tonopah for continued cooperation with regards to development of the Tonopah project nearby to Tonopah’s municipal water well fields. The memorandum of understanding provides for mutual information sharing between us and Tonopah’s engineers for baseline studies and designs, development of water rights for the benefit of Tonopah, and cooperation to reduce redundant facilities.
			
		
In 2011, an initial resource estimate was completed on select veins of the Discovery and Dauntless zones that could possibly be developed using underground mining methods. In April, 2011 a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was completed by Gustavson Associates, LLC to evaluate a limited number of vein-like structures primarily in the Discovery Zone. Mineralization was modeled using Indicator Kriging to analyze zones of potential high grade mineralization. This indicator model was calibrated by comparison with veins modeled on cross sections, and appears to have identified higher grade areas with continuous gold mineralization that could possibly be mined by underground methods.
Tonopah Project Initial Inferred Mineral Underground Resource*
* - Inferred mineral resources are estimated pursuant to Canadian industry standards. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
The report was prepared by William J. Crowl, Donald E. Hulse, Donald J. Baker, and Terre A. Lane, under the supervision of Gustavson who are “independent” and "qualified persons" under NI 43-101. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion regarding Sampling and Analysis and Security of Analysis, please see the report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Tonopah Project Nye County, Nevada" dated effective April 1, 2011, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com.
Following the resource estimate, core drilling was conducted at Tonopah to define the true width and continuity of gold grade in veins and wall rock. A total of 13,000 feet was drilled in 26 holes to test areas of the Discovery, 121, Dauntless, and 63-77 areas. Initial assay results included high grade intercepts such as 1.3 feet of 9.768 ounces per ton (opt) gold and 5 feet of 2.287 opt gold within a zone of 150 feet of 0.224 opt gold in drill hole MW11-09c as well as lower grade intercepts such as 145 feet of 0.033 opt gold in MW11-06c. See our press release dated December 8, 2011 for full results.
In 2012, we continued efforts to model the veins based on the 2011 drill results.
No drilling was done in 2013 as the company focused its efforts at the Pan and Gold Rock projects. Minimal activity is planned for the property during 2014 in addition to maintaining the claims.
To date we have incurred total costs of $10,751,676 relating to the exploration of the Tonopah project.
The Tonopah project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Other Nevada Properties
Our Pinyon project is an exploration project that we do not consider to be a material property at this time. We abandoned the Burnt Canyon property in fiscal year 2011 and the Thunder Mountain property in fiscal year 2013. These projects are without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7.
Pinyon
Pinyon is a disseminated gold target near the Gold Rock and Pan projects. Exposed mineralization is hosted in similar rock types with similar alteration as seen at Pan and Gold Rock. A portion of the claims were acquired in 2012 as part of an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement with Aurion Resources, which is subject to a Joint Venture agreement. Additional claims were staked in the surrounding area. The Pinyon property is located in White Pine County, Nevada approximately 20 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. It is 10 miles north of the Gold Rock project and 6 miles east of the Pan project. Access is by 5 miles of dirt road running south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Water is available from wells that service the Pan and Gold Rock projects. Power is expected to be available from the Pan or Gold Rock projects. On January 2, 2013 we paid $41,265 (US$41,884). Subsequent to year end, we paid $73,202 (US$68,824) on January 2, 2014.
			
		
Washington Property
The map below shows the location of our property located in Washington, USA. This property is described in further detail below.
Golden Eagle Project
Golden Eagle is a volcanic hosted, epithermal gold system with disseminated gold in quartz veins and extensive breccia bodies. Previous operators defined a large area of gold mineralization on the property. We have commissioned a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the economics of different mining options at current higher gold prices. Metallurgical issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting continue to be assessed.
Location and Means of Access
The Golden Eagle property is located on private land in the Eureka (Republic) mining district in Ferry County, Washington. The property is two miles northwest of the town of Republic, Washington and is accessed by the Knob Hill county road. Power is available at the nearby (< 1 mile) Knob Hill Mine. Water availability has not yet been determined.
Title
On August 1, 2008, we issued 600,000 common shares at US$2.50 per common share for proceeds of US$1,500,000 by way of a private placement to Kinross Gold USA Inc. (“Kinross”) and concurrently purchased a 75% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Kinross at a cost of US$1,500,000 ($1,537,950). We then purchased a 25% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Hecla Limited at a cost of US$483,333 ($500,200). Kinross retained a 2% net smelter returns royalty and was granted a first right of refusal to toll mill ore from the Golden Eagle property at their Kettle River Mill. We completed the acquisition of the Golden Eagle property through a wholly-owned subsidiary created to hold the property.
In the year ended December 31, 2009, we staked additional claims and purchased two additional blocks of land at a cost of $177,393 to expand its Golden Eagle land property package.
Our land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 339.5 acres containing federal lode mining claims and patented lode mining claim and fee properties.
We have prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of its ownership or interest in the property, describes its interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.

Mineral Resources
On June 25, 2009, we announced an indicated mineral resource estimate of 31,400,000 tons at a grade of 0.055 opt containing 1,744,000 ounces of gold based on drilling by previous operators. There is an additional inferred mineral resource estimate of 5,100,000 tons at a grade of 0.038 opt containing 192,000 ounces of gold. Both estimates are reported at a cutoff grade of 0.02 opt gold and constrained within a Lerchs-Grossman pit shell using a $750 per ounce gold price and 85% gold recovery. The estimated metal content does not include consideration of any other mining, mineral processing, or metallurgical recoveries. The most likely cut-off grade for this deposit is not known at this time and must be confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Mineral reserves have not been estimated. For further information on this project including a detailed discussion of Sampling and Analysis as well as Security of Samples, please see the report entitled "Golden Eagle Project, Washington State, USA, Technical Report", prepared by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, an arm’s length party to the Company, dated effective July, 2009, which is available under our profile at www.sedar.com. See “Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates” above.
Geology
The Golden Eagle project is a volcanic hosted, epithermal gold system with gold in quartz veins and disseminated in extensive breccia bodies. The host rocks are andesite flows and volcaniclastics of the Eocene age Sanpoil Formation along the western margin of the Republic Graben. Gold occurs primarily in silicified and argillized hydrothermal breccia that is 2,500 feet long and 1,000 feet wide. The gold zone is roughly east-west. It is exposed at the surface at the historic Mountain Lion mine to the west and plunges to the northeast. Locally the breccia is cut by quartz veins carrying higher grades of gold. Gold and silver mineralization is often found in solid solution with sulfide minerals and is considered refractory. Historical underground mining extracted gold and silver rich quartz veins adjacent to and beneath Golden Eagle.
			
		
Exploration
Exploration was conducted on the property from 1940 to 2000 by Knob Hill Mining, Day Mines Inc., Hecla Mining Company, Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation, and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. Hecla and Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation defined a large gold resource on the property and conducted pre-feasibility studies including numerous metallurgical tests. After Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation was acquired by Newmont Mining Company, the property was traded to Echo Bay Mines Ltd. during a time of low gold prices. Kinross acquired Echo Bay and focused their efforts elsewhere.
In 2008, we acquired the Golden Eagle project and began compiling and reviewing the historic database of 835 drill holes containing 165,775 feet of mostly core drilling. Many of the older shallow holes could not be verified, leaving 126,591 feet in 164 holes that could be verified for use in creating a new gold model. Dr Thom Seal was contracted to review the numerous metallurgical reports and summarize the results for us. Our geologists mapped the historic pits and sampled pit walls and dumps.
In 2011, we commissioned a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the economics of different mining options at current higher gold prices. Issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting continue to be assessed.
In 2012 and 2013, we did not work on the project as we are focusing our efforts on the Pan and Gold Rock projects.
To date we have incurred total costs of $577,493 relating to the exploration of the Golden Eagle project. We have a minimal budget for 2014 relating to the Golden Eagle project.
The Golden Eagle project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Office Facilities
In anticipation of growth, we signed an extension to our existing lease agreement with an independent third party, on December 18, 2012. Under this agreement we currently lease approximately 12,000 square feet. Monthly rent payments under this lease, including parking and operating expenses, will average approximately $23,000 per month for fiscal years 2014 through 2020 when the lease expires. We believe this space is adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that substitute space would be readily available, if needed.
