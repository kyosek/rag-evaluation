The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Johnson Matthey Building was $6.67 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, the first year of occupancy. The occupancy rate at year-end was 100% for 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Gartner Building
On September 20, 1999, the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture acquired the Gartner Building, a two-story office building with approximately 62,400 rentable square feet on a 4.9-acre tract of land located at 12600 Gateway Boulevard in Fort Myers, Lee County, Florida for a purchase price of $8,320,000 plus acquisition expenses of approximately $27,600. The purchase was funded by capital contributions of $106,554 by the Partnership, $2,800,000 by Wells Fund XII and $5,441,064 by Wells OP.
The entire 62,400 rentable square feet of the Gartner Building is currently under a net lease agreement with Gartner dated July 30, 1997 (the "Gartner Lease"). The landlord's interest in the Gartner Lease was assigned to the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture at the closing. The initial term of the Gartner Lease is ten years which commenced on February 1, 1998 and expires on
January 31, 2008. Gartner has the right to extend the Gartner Lease for two additional five-year periods. The annual base rent payable for the remainder of the Gartner Lease term is $642,798 through January 2000, $790,642 through January 2001, and thereafter will increase by 2.5% through the remainder of the Gartner Lease.
Gartner also has two expansion options for additional buildings under the Gartner Lease. The two option plans are described in the Gartner Lease as the "Small Option Building" and the "Large Option Building."
The "Small Option Building" expansion option allows Gartner the ability to expand into a separate, free-standing facility on the property containing between 30,000 and 32,000 rentable square feet to be constructed by the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture. Gartner may exercise its expansion right for the "Small Option Building" by providing notice in writing to the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture on or before April 15, 2002.
The "Large Option Building" expansion option allows Gartner the ability to expand into a separate, free-standing facility on the property containing between 60,000 and 75,000 rentable square feet to be constructed by the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture. Gartner may exercise its expansion right for the "Large Option Building" by providing notice in writing to the Fund XI-XII-REIT Joint Venture on or before April 15, 2002.
The average effective annual rental per square foot at the Gartner Building was $13.68 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, the first year of occupancy. The occupancy rate at year end was 100% for 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Because of the requirement for fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to ERISA to determine the value of the assets of such retirement plans on an annual basis, the General Partners are required under the Partnership Agreement to report estimated Unit values to the Limited Partners each year in the Partnership's annual Form 10-K. The methodology to be utilized for determining such estimated Unit values under the Partnership Agreement is for the General Partners to estimate the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Partnership's properties were sold at their estimated fair market values as of the end of the Partnership's fiscal year and the proceeds therefrom (without reduction for selling expenses) were distributed to the Limited Partners in liquidation of the Partnership. Utilizing this methodology, the General Partners have estimated Unit valuations, based upon their estimates of property values as of December 31, 2001, to be approximately $8.74 per Class A Unit and $11.52 per Class B Unit, based upon market conditions existing in early December 2001. In connection with these estimated valuations, the General Partners obtained an opinion from David L. Beal Company, an independent MAI appraiser, to the effect that such estimates of value were reasonable; however, due to the inordinate expense involved in obtaining appraisals for all of the Partnership's properties, no actual appraisals were obtained. Accordingly, these estimates should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of the Partnership's properties, nor do they represent the amount of net proceeds which would result from an immediate sale of the Partnership's properties. The valuations performed by the General Partners are estimates only, and are based a number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete. In addition, property values are subject to change and could decline in the future. Further, as set forth above, no appraisals have or will be obtained. For these reasons, the estimated Unit valuations set forth above should not be relied upon for any purpose other than required ERISA disclosures.
