ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO BUILDING
On February 26, 1991, the Company purchased a commercial building, located in Huntington Beach, California.
Constructed in 1991, the building is one-story, has a total of 5,200 rentable square feet and is located on an 18,225 square foot parcel of land. The building is located in Orange County, California, which has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in California, based on its stable base of employers ranging from big businesses to smaller retailers.
The building was originally acquired for cash in 1991 for a total acquisition cost of $1,676,210. In February 1994, the Company financed the Building by incurring mortgage debt secured by the building for $600,000. The principal and interest payment is calculated based on a twenty-five year period with a balloon payment due February 1, 2004. The monthly payment is $4,934 per month with a fixed interest rate of 8.25%.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 31.5 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes.

The property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. ("WCRM" or "the Property Manager"), an affiliate of the Company.

This is equivalent to $2.58 per rentable square foot. The lease requires the tenant to pay insurance, taxes, maintenance, and all other operating costs. The Advisor believes the tenant has the ability to meet its lease obligations. An extension of the lease, which originally terminated March 2001, is currently being negotiated.
FRESNO VILLAGE SHOPPING CENTER BUILDING
On May 14, 1993, the Company purchased a free standing commercial building located in a shopping center in Fresno, California.

Monthly payments $5,244 are made at the rate of 8.25% and are based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The loan matures on August 1, 2003. In July 1998, the interest rate on the loan was adjusted to 3.00% above the five-year Treasury Bond yield at that time.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 39 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. In the opinion of the Advisor, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by WCRM.
The Fresno Building is 67% occupied by Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc. ("The Wherehouse" -- a music and video retailer). The remaining 33% of the building is available for lease.
The Wherehouse is dependent upon the vitality of the consumer market in the general area. Although there are other shopping centers in the area, being located in a densely populated area north of downtown Fresno, and near a large community college, the high daily traffic count provides a large customer base for all the retail and service businesses in the general area.
The Wherehouse entered into a ten year lease which commenced April 1, 1993 and was to continue through March 31, 2003. The Wherehouse occupies approximately 6,000 square feet of the Fresno Building. As possible additional rent The Wherehouse was scheduled to pay the Company 3% of gross sales after applying a formula that involves recapture of rent and expenses that The Wherehouse would pay as a triple net lease tenant.
On August 2, 1995, The Wherehouse filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Wherehouse continued to pay its rent under the terms of the original lease through January 1997. In November 1996, the Company and The Wherehouse agreed to the terms of a new lease. Under the terms of the First Amendment to Lease (the "Amendment") dated November 30, 1996, commencing February 1, 1997, The Wherehouse's lease was converted from a "net" lease to a "gross" lease and the minimum rent was reduced.
The Company currently receives $82,800 ($6,900 per month) in rental income or $1.15 per square foot per month, or a percentage rent of 8.2% of gross sales per quarter, less certain allowances, minus the rent paid for such period, whichever is greater. The Company received $181 in percentage rent for the year ended December 31, 2000.
During July of 1999 the Rent-to-Own tenant ceased operations and vacated the building. As such the Company signed an agreement with the tenant for which the Company collected $92,187 of prepaid monthly rental and reimbursable expenses (which equates to $4,609 per month). The portion of the building that was occupied the tenant is currently vacant and the Company is in the process of locating a new tenant.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the Company determined that the total expected future cash flows from operations and ultimate disposition of the Fresno property was less than the carrying value of the property, due to overbuilding of commercial properties in the Fresno area. Therefore the property was deemed to be impaired. As a result, an impairment loss of $300,000 was recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeded its fair value. Fair value was determined based on a recent appraisal.
RIVERSIDE MARKETPLACE
On November 29, 1994, the Company purchased a six-plex cinema located in the Riverside Marketplace in Riverside, California.

The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled JOHN LONBERG; RUTHEE GOLDKORN V. SANBORN THEATERS, INC.; SALTS, TROUTMAN AND KANESHIRO, INC.; WEST COAST REALTY INVESTORS, INC., in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. (Case #CV-97-6598AHM(JGx)
The Company was added as a defendant in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint filed May 7, 1998, apparently due to the Company's status as landlord for a movie theater known as the Riverside Market Place Cinema.

Sanborn is the tenant and theater operator. Troutman is the architect who designed the theater and its interiors.
The plaintiffs seek actual damages of $1,000 for each violation of law; three times actual damages; and attorneys fees, expenses and costs. The plaintiffs also seek mandatory injunctive relief requiring the defendants to make the theater accessible to and useable by disabled individuals.
The plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their claims under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
The U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division ("DOJ") filed a Motion to Intervene in the case on March 1, 1999. DOJ has sued Sanborn Theaters only and preliminary discussions have been held between the DOJ and Sanborn. Sanborn intends to vigorously defend against the DOJ.
The Company believes it has complied with all applicable provisions of law and intends to vigorously defend the allegations contained in the lawsuit. The Company believes that the lawsuit will not have a material impact on the Company's continuing operations or overall financial condition.
