ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Companies' respective first mortgage indentures constitute, in the opinion of the Companies' counsel, direct first liens on substantially all of the respective Companies' physical property, subject only to excepted encumbrances, as defined in the indentures. See "Leases" and "Capitalization" notes to the respective financial statements for information concerning leases and financing encumbrances affecting certain of the Companies' properties.
The Companies own, individually or together as tenants in common, and/or lease, the generating units in service as of March 1, 2000, shown on the table below.
Prolonged outages of existing generating units might make it necessary for the Companies, depending upon the demand for electric service upon their system, to use to a greater extent than otherwise, less efficient and less economic generating units, or purchased power, and in some cases may require the reduction of load during peak periods under the Companies' interruptible programs, all to an extent not presently determinable.
The Companies' generating plants and load centers are connected by a transmission system consisting of elements having various voltage ratings ranging from 23 kilovolts (kV) to 345 kV. The Companies' overhead and underground transmission lines aggregate 8,752 miles.
The Companies' electric distribution systems include 55,932 miles of overhead pole line and underground conduit carrying primary, secondary and street lighting circuits. They own substations with a total installed transformer capacity of 50,456,000 kilovolt-amperes.
The Companies' transmission lines also interconnect with those of AEP, The Dayton Power and Light Company, Duquesne, Monogahela Power Company, West Penn Power Company, Detroit Edison Company and Pennsylvania Electric Company. These interconnections make possible utilization by the Companies of generating capacity constructed as a part of the CAPCO program, as well as providing opportunities for the sale of power to other utilities.

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the consolidated financial statements included in FirstEnergy Corp.'s Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and have issued our report thereon dated February 11, 2000.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Pennsylvania Power Company:
We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the financial statements included in Pennsylvania Power Company's Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and have issued our report thereon dated February 11, 2000. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. The schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts listed in Item 14 is the responsibility of the Company's management and is presented for the purpose of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
