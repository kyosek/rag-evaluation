Item 2. Properties
Our producing fields are located in federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7,300 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, with high initial production rates. The following map provides the locations of our 10 largest fields as of December 31, 2017, based on quantities of proved reserves on an energy equivalent basis. At December 31, 2017, these fields accounted for approximately 80% of our proved reserves.
The following table provides information for our 10 largest fields determined using quantities of proved net reserves on an energy equivalent basis as of December 31, 2017. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water. Our interests in several of our offshore fields are owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, “drilling” or “drilled” in the field descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth, as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SEC’s definition for completion:
(1)
The conversions to barrels of oil equivalent and cubic feet equivalent were determined using the energy equivalency ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.

Our Fields
On December 31, 2017, we had two fields of major individual significance (which we define as having year-end proved reserves of 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on an energy equivalent basis): the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and the Fairway Field, located in the Mobile Bay area of Alabama, which includes the associated Yellowhammer gas processing plant located onshore in Alabama. Following are descriptions of these fields.
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany).
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349 in 375 feet of water. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation (“Apache”) and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2017 is approximately 46.4 MMBoe gross. This field is a sub-salt development with nine productive horizons below salt at depths up to 18,000 feet. As of December 31, 2017, 28 wells have been drilled and 23 were successful. Since acquiring an interest and subsequently taking over as operator, we have directly participated in drilling 14 wells with a 100% success rate. During 2017, one well was completed which had been drilled to target depth during 2016. Three additional wells were drilled during 2017, two of which were completed in 2017 with the third expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. All of the wells drilled under a plan developed in 2010 have been successful. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 21.6 MMBoe at December 31, 2017, 19.8 MMBoe at December 31, 2016 and 22.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2015.
The following table presents our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes (net to our interests) from the Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three years:

Fairway Field.
The Fairway Field is comprised of Mobile Bay Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our initial 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship, in the Fairway Field and associated Yellowhammer gas processing plant, from Shell Offshore, Inc. (“Shell”) in August 2011 and acquired the remaining working interest of 35.7% in September 2014. Cumulative field production through 2017 is approximately 131.8 MMBoe gross. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2017, six wells have been drilled, one of which was a replacement well. This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 13.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2017, 13.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2016 and 14.0 MMBoe at December 31, 2015.

Proved Reserves
Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant, and amounts provided in this Form 10-K are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below and the mix by product was 46% oil, 11% NGLs and 43% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below:
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet of gas equivalent
(1)
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2017. The WTI spot price and the Henry Hub spot price were utilized as the referenced price and after adjusting for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials, the average realized prices were $46.58 per barrel for oil, $22.65 per barrel for NGLs and $2.86 per Mcf for natural gas. In determining the estimated realized price for NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the crude oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the crude oil price using SEC guidance. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2)
Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3)
We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10, or PV-10 after ARO, from our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown above represent a current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 74.2 MMBoe compared to 74.0 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, representing an overall increase of 0.2 MMBoe. After accounting for 14.6 MMBoe of 2017 production, total revisions were a positive 14.8 MMBoe. Increases from extensions and discoveries were 5.2 MMBoe, positive technical revisions (including increased well performance) were 6.2 MMBoe and increases due to higher commodity prices were estimated to be 3.4 MMBoe. Due to successful drilling and recompletion projects, our proved developed producing reserves increased from 47.3 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016 to 54.5 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017, after accounting for 2017 production.
See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2017. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our estimates of proved reserves, PV-10 and the standardized measure as of December 31, 2017 are calculated based upon SEC mandated 2017 unweighted average first-day-of-the-month crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices, and adjusting for quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional price differentials, which may or may not represent current prices. If prices fall below the 2017 levels, absent significant proved reserve additions, this may reduce future estimated proved reserve volumes due to lower economic limits and economic return thresholds for undeveloped reserves, as well as impact our results of operations, cash flows, quarterly full cost impairment ceiling tests and volume-dependent depletion cost calculations. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2017 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultants, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2013 and has over 14 years of prior industry experience. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Director of Reservoir Engineering has over 28 years of oil and gas industry experience and has managed the preparation of public company reserve estimates the last 14 years. He joined the Company in mid-2016 after spending the preceding 12 years as Director of Corporate Engineering for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. He has also served in various engineering and strategic planning roles with both Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas and with Conoco, Inc. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University in 1989 and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Houston in 1999.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert barrels to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one barrel of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2017 were estimated at $119.5 million.
The following table presents our PUDs by field (in MMBoe):
The following table presents a reconciliation of our PUDs (in MMBoe):
Activity related to PUDs in 2017:
•
During 2017, we drilled and converted one PUD location described below, which resulted in 2.3 MMBoe reclassified from PUDs to proved developed reserves (“PDs”). Approximately $17.8 million of capital expenditures were incurred in 2017 related to developing this one PUD location to PD and related to activities in progress at December 31, 2017 to develop another PUD location to PD if drilling results are successful. This development activity in 2017 resulted in reclassification of approximately 25% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2016 to proved developed status measured on a Boe basis.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), we converted one PUD location to PD with the successful drilling and completion of the A-8 BP1 well. Subsequent exploration drilling in the field resulted in the addition of one new extension PUD location that is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.
•
Successful exploratory drilling in Main Pass block 286 resulted in the addition of one PUD location in a new field. Development planning is ongoing with plans to complete the well in late 2018 or early 2019.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), a rig has been mobilized to the platform during the first quarter of 2018 and drilling is expected to commence during the first half of 2018.
Activity related to PUDs in 2016:
•
During 2016, we drilled and converted one PUD location and 1.9 MMBoe to PDs. Approximately $25.7 million of capital expenditures were incurred related to developing this PUD location to PD. Development activity in 2016 resulted in reclassification of approximately 26% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2015 to proved developed status.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), PUD reserves were added due to drilling the A-18 well to target depth and beginning completion activities. Although the A-18 well was not completed by year-end 2016, the data available from the drilling activity and initial completion activities led to the conversion of the A-18 well from PUD to PD and resulted in the recognition of one additional offsetting PUD location.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), PUDs were added as two locations were reclassified from probable to PUD, which we plan on drilling in 2018.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), reserves associated with existing PUD locations were added due to performance evaluations of adjacent PDs and economic field life extension resulting from ongoing success in managing and reducing lease operating expenses.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend), updated field performance data demonstrated that all proved reserves could be recovered from the producing SS1 well and that an additional take point previously classified as a PUD was unnecessary. These proved reserve volumes were reclassified from PUD to PDP and the associated future development capital was eliminated.
Activity related to PUDs in 2015:
•
During 2015, we completed five offshore wells which affected the conversion of PUDs to PDs and affected additional PUDs to be recognized. Three of the five wells were drilled prior to 2015. Approximately $141.0 million of capital expenditures was incurred related to these five wells during 2015. Activity, divestitures and development assessments in 2015 resulted in reclassification of approximately 88% of the PUDs existing at December 31, 2014.
•
At our Spraberry field (Yellow Rose), our interests were divested and we were assigned an ORRI.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 698 field (Big Bend), we completed one well which moved PUDs to PDs.
•
At our Viosca Knoll 823 field (Virgo), one well was removed from PUDs as the development timing was beyond the five year limitation and another well was removed from PUDs as it was determined to be uneconomic.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 782 field (Dantzler), we completed two wells which moved PUDs into PDs.
•
At our Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany), PUD reserves were added based on performance, remapping and technical changes.
•
At our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn), PUDs were added due to the assessment related to two wells.
See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 -Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
We believe that we will be able to develop all but 1.8 MMBoe (approximately 15%) of the total 12.0 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31, 2017, within five years from the date such reserves were initially recorded. The lone exceptions are at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn) where the field is being developed using a single floating tension leg platform requiring an extended sequential development plan. The platform cannot support a rig that would allow additional wells to be drilled, but can support a rig to allow sidetracking of wells. Two sidetrack PUD locations in this field will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. Based on the latest reserve report, these PUD locations are expected to be developed in 2023.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2018 is $130 million, which excludes potential acquisitions, and has over 50% allocated for development. Four of the eight wells that comprised our PUD locations as of December 31, 2017 are scheduled to be developed in 2018.
Acreage
The following table summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2017. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water:
Approximately 80% of our net acreage is held by production. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
Regarding the undeveloped leasehold, 21,870 net acres (29%) of the total 75,096 net undeveloped acres could expire in 2018, 27,719 net acres (37%) could expire in 2019, 11,912 net acres (16%) could expire in 2020, 5,760 net acres (8%) could expire in 2021, and 7,835 net acres (10%) could expire in 2022 and beyond. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2018 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage. For the leaseholds that may expire in 2018, a substantial amount is on prospects that would not be economical to develop at current prices, the probability of successful drilling is estimated to be low or were acquired as part of an acquisition with no intent to develop by the acquiring party.
Our net acreage decreased 80,876 net acres (18%) from December 31, 2016 due to sales, lease expirations and relinquishments.
Production
For the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net daily production averaged 39,921 Boe, 41,980 Boe and 46,709 Boe, respectively. Production decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to natural production declines, pipeline and platform outages, and tropical storm activity, partially offset by production from four completed wells, which came on-line during various months throughout 2017. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three years:
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
Refer to the descriptions of our 10 largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Ship Shoal 349/359 field (Mahogany) and the Fairway Field over the past three fiscal years, which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 in this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2017 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest:
(1)
Includes 13 gross (10.0 net) oil wells and six gross (4.9 net) gas wells with multiple completions
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity increased in 2017 as compared to 2016. As the Yellow Rose properties were divested during 2015 and we do not currently have any onshore drilling activities, historical data for onshore drilling was excluded from the table below.
The table below is based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine productive wells drilled.
Development and Exploration Drilling
The following table summarizes our development and exploration offshore wells completed over the past three years:
Our success rates related to our development and exploration wells drilled was 80% in 2017 and 100% in 2016 and 100% in 2015. One exploration well drilled during 2017 was non-commercial, of which we had a 39% working interest.
Recent Drilling Activity
During January 2017, we completed the A-18 offshore development well at the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany). We also drilled and completed two other wells at Mahogany, one of which began production in April 2017 and the other began production in July 2017. The fourth successful well was at the Ship Shoal 300 field and began production in November 2017.
During the first two months of 2018, we mobilized a rig to the Viosca Knoll 823 (Virgo) platform and drilled the Viosca Knoll 823 A-10 ST1 well to target depth. The A-17 well at Mahogany and the #1 well at Main Pass 286 have both been drilled to target depth. Completion operations are in progress for the A-17 well at Mahogany. The Main Pass 286 #1 well was successful and logged pay as a new field discovery. The Main Pass 286 #1 well has been cased and is waiting for development sanction, which is expected during 2018. First production is expected in early 2019.
Capital Expenditures
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; acquisition opportunities; liquidity and financing options; and the results of our exploration and development activities. We have set our 2018 capital expenditure budget at $130 million, which excludes potential acquisitions, and is similar to the level of capital expenditures incurred in 2017. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional capital expenditure information.
