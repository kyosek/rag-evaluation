Production and Development Properties
Newmont’s significant production properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
North America
Nevada, USA. We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.0 million ounces for 2009 with ore mined from eight open pit and six underground mines. At December 31, 2009 we reported 28.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 84% of those ounces in open pit mines and 16% in underground mines. We are pursuing several development opportunities in Nevada with significant reserve expansion potential.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 77% of Nevada’s gold production in 2009, compared with 72% in 2008, and 75% in 2007. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately 82% are refractory ores and 18% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores are processed at Carlin by either bio-oxidation/flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site.
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold sales of 39,000 ounces in 2009, 50,100 ounces in 2008 and 62,800 ounces in 2007 were attributable to Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.
We have ore sale agreements with Barrick and Yukon-Nevada Gold Corporation (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process the Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 700 ounces in 2009, 8,000 ounces in 2008 and 58,600 ounces in 2007, pursuant to these agreements. During 2008, Yukon-Nevada discontinued operations; however, during the second half of 2009, they resumed operations on a limited basis.
We have sales and refining agreements with Gerald Metals, Peñoles, Johnson Matthey, Just Refiners and Glencore to process intermediate gold bearing product.
Mexico. We have a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura sold 112,500 ounces of gold attributable to Newmont in 2009 and at December 31, 2009 we reported 1.8 million equity ounces of gold reserves at La Herradura. La Herradura is currently developing two new deposits, Soledad and Dipolos, for production scheduled to begin in 2010.
Hope Bay, Canada. We own 100% of the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. Since acquiring this property in early 2008, we have made significant
infrastructure improvements and identified an additional 45 new drilling targets. The Company is currently evaluating an underground operation to advance production.
South America
Yanacocha, Peru. The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. We hold a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable.
Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. Reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2009 totaled 2.1 million ounces (1.1 million equity ounces) and at December 31, 2009 we reported 5.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Yanacocha.
Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, agreed with the central government in December 2006 to contribute 3.75% of its net profits to fund social development projects for a period of up to five years, contingent upon metal prices remaining high.
Conga, Peru. The Conga project (51.35% owned) is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. Feasibility studies on our preferred development option were completed in late 2009 and a construction decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010 assuming government approval. The project is progressing into the development stage with production expected in late 2014 to 2015. At December 31, 2009 we reported 6.1 million equity ounces of gold reserves and 1,660 million equity pounds of copper reserves at Conga.
Asia Pacific
Australia/New Zealand. In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other
conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
We do not expect that native title claims will have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues and earnings.
Boddington. Boddington (100% owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold on September 30, 2009, commenced commercial production in November 2009 and expects a 12 month ramp-up period to design capacity. Boddington sold 103,300 ounces of gold, including 8,200 incremental start-up ounces, and 9.0 million pounds of copper and at December 31, 2009 we reported 21.0 million equity gold ounces and 2,040 million equity copper pounds of reserves at Boddington.
Jundee. Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from underground sources in 2009, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee sold 412,300 ounces of gold in 2009 and at December 31, 2009 we reported 1.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Jundee.
Kalgoorlie. Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2009, the Kalgoorlie operations sold 335,800 equity ounces of gold and at December 31, 2009 we reported 4.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Kalgoorlie.
Tanami. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2009, the Tanami operations sold 290,900 ounces of gold and at December 31, 2009 we reported 1.6 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Tanami.
Waihi. Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and consists of the Favona underground deposit and the Martha open pit. The Waihi operation sold 118,200 ounces of gold in 2009 and at December 31, 2009 we reported 0.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Waihi.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in
late 1999. In 2009, copper sales were 497.7 million pounds (217.0 million equity pounds), while gold sales were 550,500 ounces (239,700 equity ounces) and at December 31, 2009 we reported 4,520 million equity pounds of copper reserves and 4.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.
We own 35.44% of the Batu Hijau mine through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 63% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner’s 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the assignment of its voting rights to the Company. As a result, PTPI was determined to be a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) as it has minimal equity capital and the voting rights to its 20% interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% to 52.44% at December 31, 2009. The remaining 17% interest in PTNNT is owned by PTMDB, a consortium comprised of regional and local governments near the Batu Hijau mine, and PT Multicapital, an unrelated Indonesia company. We are currently the operator of Batu Hijau.
In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, such portion equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, the ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable equity reserves may be reduced in the future to as low as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. In addition to affecting our level of control over operations over PTNNT, such loss of control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore NTP (the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership) was required to offer a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Following notifications from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (the “DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT was in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, the matter was submitted to an international arbitration panel. That panel ruled in March 2009 that the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares were required to be transferred by
the end of September 2009, a deadline that was extended until November 23, 2009 by agreement between PTNNT and the Indonesian Government. In July 2009, the Company reached agreement with the Indonesian government on the price of the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest and reoffered the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest to the Indonesian government at this newly agreed price. In November and December 2009, sales agreements were concluded pursuant to which the 2006, 2007, and 2008 shares were transferred to PTMDB and 2009 shares were committed to be transferred to PTMDB. Although the Indonesian government has acknowledged that PTNNT is no longer in breach of the Contract of Work, future disputes may arise as to the further divestiture of the shares. It is uncertain who will acquire any future divestiture shares, and the nature of our relations with the new owners of the 2006-2009 shares and any future divestiture shares remain uncertain.
As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement becomes effective upon the completion of the sale of the 2009 shares and continues for so long as NTP owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we will likely lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by NTP.
The forest use permit was received on September 1, 2009 and the permit renewal is valid until 2025. We have been in discussions with the Indonesian government to obtain an additional forest use permit necessary to make certain amendments to the Batu Hijau environmental management plan and environmental monitoring plan, including modifications with respect to the mine’s pit slope stability. These permits are key requirements to continue to operate Batu Hijau efficiently and to the ultimate life of the mine and recoverability of reserves. However, the additional forest use permit has not been received as of the date of this Annual Report. No assurances can be made regarding when or whether the permit and any related plan amendments will be approved. The resulting delay may adversely impact the Batu Hijau mine plan, and may adversely impact future operating and financial results, including deferment or cancellation of future development and operations.
Africa
Ahafo. Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate three open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 17 pits. Development of a fourth pit, Amoma, is underway and production is expected to begin in late 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo sold 546,400 ounces of gold in 2009 and at December 31, 2009 we reported 9.1 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Ahafo.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009 the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal Stabilization levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are pending, we have paid and included $3 in Income tax expense to date under the levy.
Akyem, Ghana. Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We recently received the Environmental Permit and the Mining Lease for Akyem and we are advancing the project towards a development decision in the second half of 2010, which could result in production in late 2013 to 2014. At December 31 2009 we reported 7.7 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Akyem.

Proven and Probable Equity Reserves
We had proven and probable gold reserves of 91.8 million equity ounces at December 31, 2009, calculated at a gold price assumption of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce, respectively. Our 2009 reserves would decline by approximately 7% (6.6 million ounces), if calculated at a $750 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to $850 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 3% (3.1 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2008, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $725, A$850 or NZ$1,000 per ounce, respectively.
At December 31, 2009 our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 30.3 million equity ounces. Outside of North America, year-end proven and probable gold reserves were 61.5 million equity ounces, including 32.9 million equity ounces in Asia Pacific, 16.8 million equity ounces in Africa and 11.8 million equity ounces in South America.
Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2009 were 9,120 million equity pounds. For 2009, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound, respectively, unchanged from 2008.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable equity reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the several different processing
methods that we use. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable equity reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and we will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2010, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions to reserves during 2010.
The following tables detail gold proven and probable equity reserves(1) reflecting only those reserves owned by Newmont at December 31, 2009 and 2008:
(1)
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely
resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
References to “equity ounces” or “equity pounds” mean that portion of gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves that is attributable to our ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable equity reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold or copper extraction, and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2009 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2008 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $725, A$850 or NZ$1,000 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
