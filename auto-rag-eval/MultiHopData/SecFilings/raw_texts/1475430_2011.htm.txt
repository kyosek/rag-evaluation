The foregoing summary of the Acquisition Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Acquisition Agreement which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission on December 23, 2010.
Mineral rights were acquired at the Carson Property location through claim staking. The Carson Property mining claims are an area of open Crown land or Crown minerals rights that a licensed prospector marked out with a series of claim posts and blazed lines. The mining claims were staked in square or rectangular share with boundaries running north, south, east and west astronomically. Claim posts are erected at the corner of each mining claim, and claim boundaries between each post are marked by blazes cut into trees and by cut underbrush. Claim corner post tags identifying the individual claim number are affixed by nails to each corner post.
The Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations Territorial Lands Act (the “Mining Act”) authorizes the staking of mineral claims (such as those claims comprising the Carson Property) where the Crown owns the minerals and the carrying out of assessment/exploration work on the mining claims by the claim holder. Mining (i.e. extraction of the minerals) cannot take place until the claims are brought to lease. Mining leases are issued for the express purpose of undertaking mineral, development or mining. The claim holder is entitled to a lease upon fulfilling the requirements of the Mining Act. Currently, the surface and mineral rights are leased by J. Rapski.
The claim comprising the Carson Property is a mining lease. A lease is issued for the express purpose of undertaking mineral development or mining. The lease is a Federal lease.
The claim is identified as mining lease 3446, District 215 of the Northwest Territories, Lease NTS Sheet no. O86B03. The lease was granted on June 30, 1993 and expires on June 30, 2024. Prior to the expiry date, the lease holder can apply to have the lease renewed for an additional 21 year period.
To maintain the claim in good standing, annual lease payments by the lease holder of $1,141 must be paid to the Chief of Financial Analysis for the Federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.
The Carson Property is 1,812 acres in area and is most directly accessed via Damoti Lake by float or ski based fixed wing aircraft or helicopter directly from Yellowknife. The Colomac seasonal road runs along the Indin Lake located approximately 5 kilometers to the west. This road originates in Yellowknife and is maintained through the winter months.
The Company must meet the following payments to 2214098 Ontario Ltd. in order to retain title to the Carson Property: CDN $ 25,000 on or before April 30, 2011; at total of CDN $40,000 payable in increments of CDN $10,000 on or before each of September 30, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014; a further payment of CDN $35,000 on or before September 30, 2015; and delivery of the 1,000,000 common shares of Joshua registered to the Vendor on or before March 30, 2011.
Additionally, annual lease payments by the leaseholder of $1,141 must be paid to the Chief of Financial Analysis for the Federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.
The Carson Property is underlain by mafic a lesser felsic metavolcanic and subordinate metasedimentary rocks of the Yellowknife Supergroup. Felsic metavolcanic rocks occur at the metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact. Eight major rock assemblages at the property have been delineated by historical exploration work and range from feldspar crystal tuffs, rhyolite, andesite and feldspar porphyry intrusives.
Gold associated with quartz veins (shear zones) or with silicification are found in the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Yellowknife Supergroup. In the Indin Lake Supracrustal belt shear-hosted mineralized systems generally occur at or near volcano-sedimentary contacts. Specifically, mineralization on the property occurs as: gold-bearing quartz veins and lenses with pyrite-pyrrohtite and trace chalcopyrite and galena in mafic shear zones; pyrite-pyrrohtite horizons near the contact of the Lovang tuff and Snowden andesite; or as pyritic argillites associated with shear zones in the Oti rhyolite. These gold bearing shear zones occur on the property as three principal northeast-trending shear zones called the Pond, Chuck vein and Hilltop. The potential economic significance of the gold bearing formation and structures on the property is presently unknown.
To date, exploration work conducted by the Company has been limited to the preparation of a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report entitled: “Technical Report, Carson Property, INTS: 086G/03, Mackenzie Mining District, Northwest Territories” prepared by Aurora Geosciences Ltd. of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
The report summarized and evaluated all the publically available historical work completed in the immediate area of the property. As part of the terms of reference for the report, Aurora also conducted a site visit of the property. Based on the analysis of the historical work at the property, the report recommended additional exploration work be conducted including geological mapping, detailed compilation and interpretation of all historical work, updated VLF and magnetic surveying of the entire property, and diamond drilling. The estimated budget for the additional recommended work is CDN $857,703.
Prior to the preparation of the Aurora technical report, diamond drilling in 1947 and prospecting and ground geophysical work completed in 1947, 1981 and 1985 have been reported at the Carson property.
As the property is a “grass roots” exploration prospect, no plant equipment is present and no subsurface improvements are required at the property. Further, no infrastructure or facilities are found on the property and no exploration work is presently underway.
Exploration cost on the Carson Property is limited to the preparation of the Technical Report and is $13,744. The report recommended additional exploration work be conducted including geological mapping, detailed compilation and interpretation of all historical work, updated VLF and magnetic surveying of the entire property, and diamond drilling. The estimated budget for the additional recommended work is CDN $857,703.
Sources of water locally are from abundant local creeks, rivers and small lakes. Local power sources are not available presently. Power (when required) can be provided via portable generators transported to the property. The Carson Property is presently without known mineral reserves and the proposed work program is exploratory in nature. The location and access to the Carson Property, as well as its mineral claims and geology, are shown in the small-scale maps provided below.
Garrett Property
On June 25, 2011, the Company entered into a mineral property acquisition with Firelake Resources Inc. (“Firelake”) whereby the Company agreed to purchase certain mineral interests located in the townships of Eric and Huffman in the Province of Ontario, Canada (the “Huffman Property”, later renamed the “Garrett Property”) in consideration for the sum of $52,220 ($50,000 CDN) and 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company to be paid by Company to Firelake as follows: $26,102 CDN on or before January 31, 2012; $25,000 CDN on or before January 31, 2013; and delivery of the shares on or before January 31, 2012. Additionally, upon commencement of commercial production of the Garrett Property, the Company will pay to Firelake a royalty equal to 2% of all net smelter returns on minerals from the Property.
Mineral rights were acquired at the Garrett Property location through claim staking. The Garrett mining claims are an area of open Crown land or Crown minerals rights that a licensed prospector marked out with a series of claim posts and blazed lines. The mining claims were staked in square or rectangular share with boundaries running north, south, east and west astronomically. Claim posts are erected at the corner of each mining claim, and claim boundaries between each post are marked by blazes cut into trees and by cut underbrush. Claim corner post tags identifying the individual claim number are affixed by nails to each corner post.
The Ontario Mining Act authorizes the staking of mineral claims (such as those claims comprising the Huffman property) where the Crown owns the minerals and the carrying out of assessment/exploration work on the mining claims by the claim holder. Mining (i.e. extraction of the minerals) cannot take place until the claims are brought to lease. Mining leases are issued for the express purpose of undertaking mineral, development or mining. The claim holder is entitled to a lease upon fulfilling the requirements of the Mining Act. Currently, Fire Lake is the holder of the mineral rights to the Garrett Property, and the Crown is the holder of the surface rights.
Upon recording of the mineral claims with the provincial mining recorder’s office, the claims will remain good standing for a period of two years. The claims can be renewed by performing the minimum specified assessment work within 2 years of the recording date for the claim. Specifically, the claims for the Huffman property will remain in good standing until the dates set out below:

The Garrett Property is located in the northwest portion of Huffman Township, and the southwest corner of Eric Township, Porcupine Mining District, Province of Ontario, Canada. The Garrett Property can be accessed via pickup truck by travelling 81 kilometers along bush/logging roads west and north of the intersection of Highway 144 and Regional Road 560 in north central Ontario. The City of Sudbury is located approximately 140 kilometers south of this highway intersection along Highway 144. The approximate centre of the Huffman property has UTM co-ordinate 412156 m E and 5277530 m N, Zone 17.
The rock formations on the Garrett property are predominantly composed of Early Archean supracrustal rocks, dominantly of greenschist facies metamorphic rank, and are deformed by an east-southeast trending syncline or synclinorium. These rocks are part of larger belt of greenschist metamorphic rocks referred to as the Swayze Greenstone Belt, which is the southwestern extension of the prolific Abitibi Greenstone Belt that is host to several world-class mining camps.
Locally, rock formations strike generally at 300 degrees, and dip steeply to the southwest. Rocks within the central claim area are predominantly composed of tholeiitic metavolcanics that structurally vary from massive to foliated flows. Quartz veins or “pods” within flow units are common. Bordering the tholeiitic metavolcanics along southwest boundary of the property are calc-alkalic metavolcanics frequently containing quartz veins and felsic lapilli.
Bordering the tholeiitic metavolcanics to the northeast are the Late Archean orthogneissic rocks of the Kenogamissi Granitic Complex. These rocks are quite heterogeneous and are of amphibolite metamorphic rank. Numerous batholiths and plutons of tonalite, granodiorite and granitic composition are found with the complex. The complex was emplaced into the greenstone rocks of the Swayze belt as a dome and caused a deformation aureole of severe flattening and recumbent folding. It is within these highly strained rocks that the gold mineralization of the St. Jerome mine immediately southwest of the Garrett property, and the gold mineralization of the Trelawney Corporation Chester complex to the southeast is found.
The company has completed exploration work on the property, inclusive of 60 kilometers of line cutting, Geophysical Survey in the form of both Very Low Frequency - Electro Magnetic Survey and MAG Survey in the areas that have been subject to line cutting to establish a visible grid for data interpretation. The present condition of the property is “grass roots” in that much of the property area is covered by undisturbed boreal forest and muskeg typical of the Canadian north. At present infrastructure exists on the property in the form of an exploration camp for housing workers on the property, inclusive of a power generation station, semi permanent exploration camp with housing for up to 24 individual workers at a time, a dining and sanitary tent, complete with indoor bath facilities and satellite communications equipment. The property contains a logging road with structural improvements, including bridges and culverts to make the area easily accessible (apart from these improvements, no other subsurface improvements are required at the property to complete additional exploration work). Exploration work is currently underway and drill targets will be determined and recommended, subject to interpretation of surface sampling and interpretation of geophysical surveys. An estimate of diamond drilling cost is unknown at this time and can only be determined based on a review of data generated from the initial prospecting and geophysical surveying work.
Sources of water locally are from the abundant local creeks, rivers and small lakes. Local power sources are not available presently. Power (when required) can be provided via portable generators transported to the property. The Huffman Property is presently without known mineral reserves and the proposed work program is exploratory in nature. A map of the property is provided below:

Description of Elijah Property
The Elijah Property consists of four (4) unpatented mining claims (38 units - approximately 1,520 acres) in Asquith and Churchill Townships, Larder Lake Mining District, Ontario, Canada. The property lies approximately 3km northeast of the hamlet of Shining Tree along Regional Highway 560, which is a paved road. Access to the property is well maintained throughout all seasons, with former lumber gravel roads intersecting the property.
The Elijah Property is located in the south central portion of Asquith Township, with claim 4251805 located in contiguous Asquith Township in the north central portion, Larder Lake Mining District, Province of Ontario, Canada. The Elijah Property can be accessed via motor vehicle by travelling 136km North Northwest from The City of Sudbury on Highway 144, then travelling 56 km North Northeast on Highway 560 in north central Ontario, Canada. The approximate centre of the Elijah Property has UTM co-ordinate 479000 m E and 5271000 m N.
There has been no historical work on the Property. The property is a “grass roots” exploration prospect, no infrastructure or facilities are found on the property, apart from the gravel logging road providing access to the property.
The Elijah Property is located within a mineral rich portion of Shining Tree Greenstone Belt that forms the southern portion of the Abitibi Sub-Province of the Superior Province. The Larder lake dominant structural feature is the Larder Lake Cadillac Fault, which extends through the Shining Tree area, the Kirkland Lake area and into the neighboring eastern Province of Quebec, Canada. Due to the strong special relationship between gold deposits and regional faults, numerous world class gold deposits are found along the Kirkland Lake - Cadillac Fault system.
Calc-Alkaline Tholeiitic volcanic rocks and minor Komatiitic rocks are interpreted to underly the immediate property area. The most significant geological feature is the gold bearing “Gosselin Rift Zone”. The Gosselin Rift Zone is a southwest trending feature along claim number 4251803 and runs westward, northwestward into claim 4251801, which are in the Elijah Property. It includes an extensive quartz vein system, altered mafic-ultramafic rocks and altered felsic intrusive and extrusive rocks. Extensive faulting fracturing and shearing are evident in this zone over widths of approximately 200 meters. Gold mineralization in the Gosselin Rift Zone tends to be erratic and is associated with Pyrite mineralization varying in concentrations from trace to levels of 4-5% in the altered volcanic rocks and quartz vein systems.
Glossary of Terms:
Calc-alkalic: Said of a series of igneous rocks in which the weight percentage of silica is between 56 and 61 when the weight percentages of CaO and of K2O + Na2O are equal.
Tholeiite: A silica-oversaturated (quartz-normative) basalt, characterized by the presence of low-calcium pyroxenes (orthopyroxene and/or pigeonite) in addition to clinopyroxene and calcic plagioclase. Olivine may be present in the mode, but neither olivine nor nepheline appear in the norm.
Komatiite: Magnesium-rich ultramafic volcanic rock of high temperature origin. The term was originally applied by Viljoen and Viljoen (1969) to basaltic and ultramafic lavas near the Komati river, Barberton Mountain Land, Transvaal, South Africa. Nickel-copper sulfide mineral deposits may be associated with komatiites.
Mafic: Pertaining to or composed dominantly of the ferromagnesian rock-forming silicates; said of some igneous rocks and their constituent minerals.
Ultramafic: Said of an igneous rock composed chiefly of mafic minerals, e.g., monomineralic rocks composed of hypersthene, augite, or olivine.
Felsic: A mnemonic adj. derived from (fe) for feldspar, (l) for lenad or feldspathoid, and (s) for silica, and applied to light-colored rocks containing an abundance of one or all of these constituents. Also applied to the minerals themselves, the chief felsic minerals being quartz, feldspar, feldspathoid, and muscovite.
