Operating Policies Construction
The Company has historically designed its own products as well as supervised the development and building of its projects. When the Company constructs units, it acts as a general contractor and employs subcontractors at specified prices for the installation of site improvements and construction of its residential units. Agreements with subcontractors provide for a fixed price for work performed or materials supplied and are generally short-term.
The Company does not manufacture any of the materials or other items used in the development of its projects, nor does the Company maintain substantial inventories of materials. Standard building materials, appliances and other components are purchased in volume. The Company has not experienced significant delays in obtaining materials needed by it to date and has long-standing relationships with many of its major suppliers and contractors. None of the Company's suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total purchases in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.
Sales and Customer Financing
The Company conducts a marketing program that is directed to purchasers of primary residences. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, A.P. Orleans Inc., an affiliate of the Company controlled by Jeffrey P. Orleans, is the exclusive sales agent. The Company believes that the compensation arrangement with A.P. Orleans, Inc. is no less favorable to the Company that could be obtained from an unaffiliated sales agent. This compensation includes payment to A.P. Orleans, Inc. of $25.00 for each house settled in its Pennsylvania and New Jersey communities.
Model homes and sales centers are constructed to promote sales. A variety of custom changes are permitted at the request of purchasers. The Company advertises extensively using newspapers, billboards and other types of media. The Company also uses brochures to describe each community.
The Company's customers generally require mortgage financing to complete their purchases. The Company offers assistance to its customers in obtaining mortgage financing on the basis of the credit of the purchasers. The Company believes adequate sources of financing are available for qualified customers.
The Company applies for project financing approvals from the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration and the Federal National Mortgage Association for many of its moderately priced communities. These approvals assist customers in their ability to obtain competitive fixed and adjustable rate mortgages with moderate down payments and liberal underwriting requirements. The Company has obtained approvals for most projects and anticipates additional approvals during fiscal 1996; however, there can be no assurance that additional approvals will be obtained.
Land Policy
The Company acquires land in order to provide an adequate and well-located supply for its residential building operations. In evaluating possible opportunities to acquire land, the Company considers such factors as the feasibility of development, proximity to developed areas, population growth patterns, customer preferences, estimated cost of development and availability and cost of financing.
In conjunction with the OCC acquisition, the Company obtained the right to acquire real estate in East Brunswick, New Jersey through an option agreement with Orleans Builders and Developers ("OB&D"). OB&D is owned by Jeffrey P. Orleans and the trust of Selma Orleans. The agreement, which has no stated expiration date, provides for the purchase of 342 residential units in total.
Subsequent to June 30, 1995, the Company purchased two (2) tracts of land in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. One tract consists of 76 lots for townhomes. The other tract of 72 lots consists of 15 large single-family lots and 57 small single-family lots.
The Company will continue to monitor economic and market conditions for residential units in each of its various communities in assessing the relative desirability of constructing units or selling parcels to other builders.
The Company engages in many phases of development activity, including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, construction of roads, sewer, water and drainage facilities, recreation facilities and other amenities.
Joint Ventures
From time to time, the Company has developed and owned projects through joint ventures with other parties.
As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is the General Partner in Versailles Associates, L.P., a limited partnership with private investors to purchase and develop a 102 multi-family unit community in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Construction of the development began in 1993.
As also discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, OCC has entered into a joint venture with Bridlewood Associates, L.P. OCC is the managing general partner in this limited partnership formed to develop an 85 acre parcel of land in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.
Determinations by the Company to enter into joint ventures have traditionally been based upon a number of factors, including principally an alternative source for land acquisition financing. At the present time joint venture activities do not constitute a material portion of the Company's operations.
Building Regulation
The Company and its subcontractors are subject to continuing compliance requirements of various Federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding zoning, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems, building permits and similar matters. The intensity of development in recent years in areas in which the Company is actively developing real estate has resulted in increased restrictive regulation and moratoriums by governments with respect to density, sewer, water, ecological and similar matters. Further expansion and development will require prior approval of Federal, state and local authorities and may result in delay or curtailment of development activities and costly compliance programs.
In January 1983, the New Jersey Supreme Court rendered a decision known as the "Mount Laurel II" decision, which has the effect of requiring certain municipalities in New Jersey to provide housing for persons of low and moderate income. In order to comply with such requirements, municipalities in that state may require the Company, in connection with its future residential communities, to contribute funds, on a per unit basis, or otherwise assist in the achievement of a fair share of low or moderate housing in such municipalities.
In recent years, regulation by Federal and state authorities relating to the sale and advertising of condominium interests and residential real estate has become more restrictive and intense. In order to advertise and sell condominiums and residential real estate in many jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the Company has been required to prepare a registration statement or other disclosure document and, in some cases, to file such materials with a designated regulatory agency.
Despite the Company's past ability to obtain necessary permits and authorizations for its projects, more stringent requirements may be imposed on developers and home builders in the future. Although the Company cannot predict the effect of such requirements, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and substantial expenditures for environmental controls which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Company. In addition, the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to many factors, including changes in policies, rules and regulations and their interpretation and application, which are beyond the Company's control.
Environmental Regulation and Litigation
Development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on the part of the developer, owner or any mortgage lender for its own acts or omissions as well as those of current or prior owners of the subject property or adjacent parcels. If hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of the Company's properties, the owner or operator of the property (including the prior owners) may be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances. Environmental studies are undertaken in connection with property acquisitions by the Company.
All testing required by Phase 1A of the phased remedial investigation ("RI") to be performed at Colts Neck Estates, a single family residential development built by the Company in Washington Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey ("Colts Neck"), has been completed. The results of such testing have been submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") for its review and comment. At NJDEP's request, James C. Anderson Associates, Inc. ("JCA"), Washington Township's consultant, submitted a proposal to NJDEP to delineate three alleged pig manure areas on other portions of Colts Neck. The cost of the delineation is estimated at approximately $34,000; no agreement has been reached with NJDEP over the Company's obligation, if any, to fund this work. The Company continues to fund the cost of the phased RI testing, which is not expected to exceed materially the original estimate of $136,000. Approximately 145 homeowners at Colts Neck have commenced three lawsuits against the Company, which were separately filed in state and Federal courts between April and November, 1993, and now have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiffs in the consolidated action allege that the Company and other defendants built and sold them homes which had been constructed on and adjacent to land which has been used as a municipal waste landfill and a pig farm. The complaints assert claims under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the New Jersey Sanitary Landfill Facility Closure and Contingency Act, the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, as well as under theories of private nuisance, public nuisance, common law fraud, latent defects, negligent misrepresentation, consumer fraud, negligence, strict liability, vendor liability, and breach of warranty, among others.
In September, 1993 the Company brought a state court action against more than 30 of its insurance companies seeking indemnification and reimbursement of costs of defense in connection with the three Colts Neck actions referred to above. That action has since been stayed and the Company's claims against its insurers have also been brought as third-party claims in the consolidated Colts Neck litigation in Federal court along with third-party claims against the former owners and operators of the Colts Neck property as well as claims against the generator of the waste allegedly disposed on the property.
Although the Company has vigorously defended the claims brought by the plaintiff homeowners, the Company and other parties in the Colts Neck litigation agreed to mediation which resulted in a settlement agreement. The implementation of the agreement is subject to a number of conditions, including a determination by the court to accord class action status to the litigation. Under the settlement agreement, if implemented, a judgment of $6,000,000 would be entered against the Company, of which $650,000 would be paid in cash promptly. Except as noted, the balance of the judgment would be payable solely out of the proceeds, if any, of recoveries under the litigation against the insurance companies, and the Company would have no liability itself for the balance of the judgment not satisfied from such recoveries. The Company would fund the litigation against the insurance companies, subject to reimbursement of amounts in excess of $100,000 (subject to a limitation on reimbursement of $300,000) from recoveries, if any, from the insurance companies, including pretrial settlements. In the event that the insurance recoveries (whether through settlements or judgments) are less than $500,000, the Company would pay the difference to the homeowners.
The Company has accrued estimated costs of environmental testing as well as all other reasonably estimable future investigatory, engineering, legal and litigation costs and expenses. Since the Company has not received NJDEP's comments on the testing results of Phase 1A of the RI, it is unable to predict whether any further testing or remediation will be required and, if so, the cost and allocation thereof. The Company reserves the right to opt out of the settlement agreement if there is no satisfactory resolution with NJDEP over its claims. The Company increased its recorded reserves to give effect to its estimate of the net amount payable under the settlement agreement, if implemented, and the unreimbursed costs to the Company of the insurance litigation. The Company believes that neither the implementation of the settlement agreement nor the resolution of this contingency through further litigation will have a material effect on its results of operations or its financial position, although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation. Since there are conditions to the implementation of the settlement agreement, there is no assurance that the litigation will not recommence.
The Company is not aware of any other environmental liabilities associated with any of its other projects.
Competition
The real estate industry is highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of its reputation, location, design, price, financing programs, quality of product and related amenities, with regional and national home builders in its areas of development, some of which have greater sales, financial resources and geographical diversity than the Company. Numerous local residential builders and individual resales of residential units and homesites provide additional competition.
Employees
The Company, as of June 30, 1995, employed 194 persons, 63 of whom were executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 37 were sales personnel, and 94 were construction supervisory personnel and laborers.
The level of construction and sales employees varies throughout the year in relation to the level of activities at the Company's various developments. The Company has had no major work stoppages and considers its relations with employees to be good.
Economic Conditions
The Company's business is affected by general economic conditions in the United States and its related regions and particularly by the level of interest rates. The Company cannot predict whether interest rates will be at levels attractive to prospective home buyers or whether mortgage and construction financing will continue to be available. Further, the current economic climate and lack of consumer confidence within the Company's customer base have lessened the demand for new housing. In response to these conditions, the Company has continued to offer incentives to increase sales activity. These actions have reduced gross profits and cash proceeds from residential sales.
Lease of Executive Offices
The Company leased executive offices at 2507 Philmont Avenue, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. The owner of the property is Orleans Investment Land Associates, an affiliated limited partnership controlled by the trust of Selma Orleans and Jeffrey P. Orleans, which has leased approximately 16,400 square feet to the Company at an annual rental rate of $11.50 per square foot, plus utilities and cleaning service. The lease would have expired on June 30, 1996. On August 20, 1995, the building was severely damaged from a fire. The Company is currently leasing office space comprising approximately 12,000 square feet at One Greenwood Square at 3333 Street Road, Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The annual rent is $211,000 with a lease expiring in eighteen months.
