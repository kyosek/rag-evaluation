Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium OutletÂ® centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. Our Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 200 million square feet of GLA, of which we own approximately 121.7 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2005 were approximately $51 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 171 regional malls range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.0 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 700 anchors, which are mostly national retailers. Our regional mall totals include certain lifestyle centers when the center contains a traditional department store anchor.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 71 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain at least two anchors and other tenants that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets. These tenants generally occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
Premium Outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturer's outlet centers. Our 33 Premium Outlet centers range in size from approximately 200,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet centers are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Sacramento, Atlanta, and Dallas; or within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
We also have interests in 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These other Properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 300,000 square feet of GLA. The combined other Properties represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

We own 100% of 197 of our 286 Properties, effectively control 20 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 69 Properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 276 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

Our properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan, primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of these properties are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.

(6)Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we acquired additional ownership interests and now hold a 50% ownership interest in ERE.
Land Held for Development
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in ten parcels of land held in the United States for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately 560 acres located in five states.
On December 28, 2005, we invested $50 million of equity for a 40% interest in a joint venture with Toll Brothers, Inc. (Toll Brothers) and Meritage Homes Corp. (Meritage Homes) to purchase a 5,485-acre land parcel in northwest Phoenix from DaimlerChrysler Corporation for $312 million. Toll Brothers and Meritage Homes each plan to build a significant number of homes on the site. We have the option to purchase a substantial portion of the commercial property for retail uses. Other parcels may also be sold to third parties. Initial plans call for a mixed-use master planned community, which will include approximately 4,840 acres of single-family homes and attached homes. Approximately 645 acres of commercial and retail development will include schools, community amenities and open space. Initial home sales are tentatively scheduled to begin in 2009. The joint venture, of which Toll Brothers is the managing member, expects to develop a master planned community of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 residential units.
Energy Costs Conservation
In 2003, we began monitoring and benchmarking our energy consumption and initiated a process to assess energy efficiency across our enclosed mall Properties. In 2004, we implemented a comprehensive strategy to improve energy efficiency. This included the launch of our Energy Best Practices Program which challenged managers of our enclosed mall Properties to examine their operating practices in an effort to reduce energy costs without affecting comfort, safety or reliability, and to develop strategic relationships for investing in cost-effective, energy- efficient projects. In 2005, we enhanced our monitoring capabilities with the implementation of a web-based energy tracking tool enabling management to review energy usage and costs on a real time basis.
Through the energy management efforts implemented at comparable mall properties, we reduced electricity usage by 133 million kWh's for 2004 and 2005 combined, as compared to 2003. This represented a 6.8 percent reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties. The EPA estimates this reduction in electricity usage further translates to the avoidance of 84,038 metric tons of carbon dioxide. In addition, the EPA also calculates that this is equivalent to 18,190 cars not driven for one year, 689 acres of forest preserved from deforestation or saved electrical energy to power 10,788 US homes for a full year.
As a result of these efforts, we were named a finalist for the 7th Annual Platts Global Energy Award for Industry Leadership. In their nominating letter, Platts said "Simon Property Group has illustrated tremendous leadership through its outstanding achievements." In addition, we received the Bronze Leader for the Light Award from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) in recognition of excellence in energy efficiency and is awarded in collaboration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Simon Property was the only retail REIT to receive this award.
