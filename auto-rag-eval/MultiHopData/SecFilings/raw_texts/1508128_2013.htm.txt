Description of Mineral Properties
Holbrook Basin
Our principal asset is the Holbrook Basin property, a potash exploration project located in the Holbrook Basin of east-central Arizona (the “Holbrook Basin Project”). The project is comprised of 78 Arizona State Land Development (“ASLD”) exploration permits, full or partial interests in 132 private land sections and 4 prospecting permits on federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, which are all located within the Holbrook Basin.
Notice to Readers
The mineral resources referred to herein have been estimated in accordance with the definition standards on mineral resources of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101 and are not compliant with SEC Industry Guide 7 guidelines. In addition, measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources, while recognized and required by Canadian regulations, are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Accordingly, we have not reported them in the United States. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves. These terms have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. In particular, it should be noted that mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of the measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources referred to herein are economically or legally mineable.
Location, Access and Infrastructure
Our Holbrook Basin Project is situated in the Holbrook Basin of east-central Arizona, which spans Coconino, Navajo and Apache Counties. The Holbrook Basin Project is located approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) southeast of the town of Holbrook in the County of Navajo, Arizona. The town of Holbrook provides capacity for personnel, supplies, equipment and accommodation. The I-40 to the north of the project area is a major west-east interstate highway and intersects with eight north-south interstate highways. Therefore, there is full service truck transport and support system throughout the southwest U.S. by way of route I-40. The U.S. Routes 77 and 180 run from I-40 into the project area. The project is also accessible by way of a number of unpaved roads which cut through the project area. The entire area is accessible off-road by four-wheel drive vehicles.
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (the “BNSF”) mainline is located to the north of the project area. This dual track is a main rail track for heavy duty service. The BNSF is part of the southwest system and runs through Fort Worth, Texas, BNSF headquarters, to the west through New Mexico, Arizona and into California. The ports of Stockton, Long Beach and the Mexican ports of Guymas and Topolabampo are easily accessible and suitable for international shipping.
A coal-fired power station, the Cholla Plant, which is located just west of Holbrook near Joseph City, provides electricity to the area. Water for drilling can also be obtained from range tanks, wells, and the Little Colorado River. The project area is covered by an electrical distribution network and a gas supply system.
We currently hold lands with a cumulative area of 122,879.08 acres within the Holbrook Basin. The landholdings are located within Township 15 to 19 North, Range 21 to 26 East, along the Gila and Salt River Meridian and Base Line. The figure below illustrates the location of our Holbrook Basin Project.

Property Titles
The Holbrook Basin Project consists of full/partial interests in 132 sections of private land covering a total of 70,098.19 acres, 78 Arizona State Land Department (“ASLD”) exploration permits covering an area of 45,726.33 acres and 4 prospecting permits on federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management covering a total of 7,054.56 acres all within the Holbrook Basin. Our ownership interest in each of the properties and exploration permits comprising the Holbrook Basin Project are described above under “Item 1. Business - Recent History.”
Private Land
Through a four-year lease purchase agreement with Twin Buttes Ranch, LLC, we control five parcels of private land totaling 28,534.06 acres in Navajo County. The lease ends on August 28, 2013.
Through a purchase agreement with the Fitzgerald Living Trust we control 41,564.13 acres of private land in Navajo County. The closing of the purchase agreement is expected to take place on December 18, 2013.
Bureau of Land Management
We have submitted four prospecting permit applications with the Bureau of Land Management on federal land totaling 7,054.56 acres through the Southwest Option Agreement with Southwest Exploration, Inc., dated September 30, 2008. The land is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and our prospecting permit applications are currently being reviewed.
Arizona State Trust Land
As a Canadian corporation, we are unable to hold any ASLD exploration permits on our own behalf. Therefore, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, PPI Holding Corp., an Arizona corporation, to hold all exploration permits. The ASLD permits, which we acquired through lease options with Southwest Exploration, Inc., Mesa Uranium Corp. and Sweetwater River Resources, LLC/American Potash, LLC, were acquired contractually by PPI Holding Corp. An option agreement with Ringbolt Ventures Ltd., Potash Green, LLC, and others was made to acquire another 25 mineral exploration permits on State Trust land. The nature of each agreement is listed above in “Item 1. Business -Recent History.” All ASLD fees and work expenditure requirements are current with respect to the 78 permits. We can apply for and acquire state leases on that acreage once a potential resource has been sufficiently demonstrated.

Permits
Permits necessary to carry out exploration on private, ASLD and federal lands in Arizona are as follows:
The Arizona Oil & Gas Conservation Commission is responsible for granting the permits necessary for drilling on private, State and federal lands in the Holbrook Basin, Arizona. Furthermore, a “Surface Use Plan” and the posting of a bond (US$25,000) are required before starting any drilling activities.
A Mineral Exploration Permit must be obtained from the ASLD in order to drill on State trust land. Requirements to obtain this permit include:
A non-refundable filing fee of US$500
An environmental disclosure questionnaire
An Exploration Plan of Operation
A bond - US$3,000 for a single permit; US$15,000 for a blanket bond - for five or more permits held by an individual company
Annual rental fees, work expenditure requirements and an annual renewal fee of US$500/permit.
If the permittee discovers a feasible mineral deposit, it will have to apply for a mineral lease prior to the start of any mining activities.
Permission to perform exploration drilling on federal lands has been granted by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Therefore, either a Notice of Intent (<5.0 acres/ 0.02 km² surface disturbance; obtainable within 30-60 days) or a Plan of Operations (>5.0 acres/ 0.02 km² surface disturbance) has to be submitted, depending on the amount of surface disturbance that is planned (43 CFR 3809.11 and 43 CFR 3809.21). Depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of required reclamation bonding, the need for archeological surveys and other factors determined by the BLM, a Plan of Operations can take several months for approval.
Expiry Date of Permits
ASLD Exploration Permits
BLM Prospecting Permits
BLM prospecting permits are effective for an initial term of two years and may be extended for an additional two year period. The Company has submitted four prospecting permit applications with the BLM but has not yet been granted permission to begin exploration activities as the applications are currently being reviewed.
Annual Payments and Work Requirements
ASLD Exploration Permits
ASLD exploration permit expenses are our responsibility and include renewal fees, rental fees and exploration expenditure requirements. The following table sets out the aforementioned fees and expenditures on the ASLD exploration permits to which we hold or to which we have an interest in or have the right to earn an interest:

We will have expenses for the BLM prospecting permits, however, those expenses have not yet been determined by the BLM as the BLM has not yet granted us such permits to begin exploration.
Climate
The climate in the Holbrook Basin Project area is semi-arid with high temperatures between 11 to 35°C (51 to 95°F) during summer and low temperatures in the winter ranging between -6 to 14°C (21 to 59°F). Temperatures in spring and fall vary between -3 and 30°C (28 to 86°F). The average annual precipitation is 224 mm (9 in) with maximum rates in July to October of 27 to 38 mm per month (1.1 to 1.5 inches per month). (U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE NATIONAL OCEANIC & ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICE (2004): Climatography of the United States, No. 20, 1971-2000, Station: HOLBROOK, AZ http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/az/024089.pdf, last accessed on 03/02/2012.).
Physiography
The landscape is generally flat with minor low lying, rolling hills, supporting ranching, light industry and areas of historical mining. The vegetation in the range land is limited and consists of minor salt cedar and scrub grasses. In the valley bottoms, there is some hay production and there are numerous ranches scattered throughout the Project Area. The Little Colorado, a permanent stream, and the Puerco River, an intermittent stream, run through the area. These streams merge about three miles east of Holbrook and tend to generally produce fresh water, which is reported to be brackish to saline in the surrounding areas. The area between the rivers is characterized by generally low grassland ridges, broad drainage areas and ledge form buttes and mesas. South of the Little Colorado, a similar topography is present, but with considerable pinon and cedar cover. A regional aquifer is located within the Coconino Sandstone, which is called C-aquifer. Furthermore, the Moenkopi and Chinle Formations might contain undefined/unreported aquifers. South of the Holbrook Basin Project area, there are extensive areas of sink holes reaching the land surface, which suggests major salt dissolution that likely contributes to the salinity of the water in the Coconino Sandstone. Ground level elevations across the Project Area range in average from 1,600 to 1,700 m (5,300 to 5,600 ft) Mean Sea Level.
Geology
The sedimentary Holbrook Basin is approximately 13,000 km² in size and is located in east-central Arizona at the southern margin of the Colorado Plateau Province. It is orientated approximately NE-SW and bounded by the Mogollon Rim to the southwest and the Defiance Uplift to the northeast.
The stratigraphic succession of the Holbrook Basin (see Table 1 and Figure 3 below) starts with the coarse-grained Cambrian Tapeats Sandstone (0-101 meters thick), which is overlain by the Devonian Martin Formation consisting of limestone and dolomitic limestone (0-91 meters thick). This unit is followed by the massive Mississipian Redwall Limestone (0-18 meters thick), which is occasionally overlain by interbedded shale and thin bedded limestone (Pennsylvanian Naco Formation, 0-152 meters thick).
Above that lies the Permian Supai Formation, which can be sub-divided into four members -equal five halite deposition cycles (WINTERS, S. (1963): Supai Formation (Permian) of Eastern Arizona. Geological Society of America Memoirs.):
Amos Wash Member - reddish brown siliciclastics,
Big A Butte Member - reddish brown siliciclastics intercalated with gypsum and limestone (Cycle 1),
Fort Apache Member - fossiliferous limestone (Cycle 1),
and Corduroy Member - similar to Big A Butte Member’s lithology, but containing thick evaporite/halite horizons and hosting the potash deposit (Cycle 2 to 5; extension: approx. 160 km E-W and approx. 60 km N-S).
The overlying Coconino Sandstone represents the top of the Permian deposits. According to LORENZ & COOPER (LORENZ, J. C. & COOPER, S. P. (2001). Interpreting Fracture Patterns in Sandstones Interbedded with Ductile Strata at the Salt Valley Anticline, Arches National Park, Utah. Retrieved from All U.S Government Documents (Utah Regional Depository), http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/govdocs/9, last accessed on 05/03/2012) this unit shows regional fracturing and often causes drilling issues and circulation losses. The following Triassic formations contain the Moenkopi Sandstones and the overlying redbed and lacustrine Chinle Formation. The uppermost section of the geological succession consists of scattered outcrops of the Tertiary Bidahochi Formation with thin bedded limy shales, minor thin sandstone beds and interbedded ash-fall tuff deposits.

Historical Work
The first salt was discovered in the Holbrook Basin in 1920 during petroleum exploration drilling near Holbrook (PEIRCE, W. (1981): Major Arizona Salt Deposits. Field Notes, 11(4), 4 p). Based on promising results from oil tests, potash exploration in the Holbrook basin was started in the 1960s and 1970s. Historical drilling was performed almost in the entire Holbrook basin, within and outside of our properties. In total, 142 historical drill holes with records are available, with 110 of those holes being drilled by Arkla Exploration and Duval Exploration. The following table contains all historical drill holes which are located within our properties (Coordinates in WGS 84 UTM Zone 12N):
Well logs, samples and core descriptions as well as assay reports are available from the Arizona Oil and Gas Conservation Commission at the Arizona Geological Survey (Tucson, Arizona).
The historical drill hole data already shows the depth, thickness and K2O (potassium oxide) content of the potash horizon. However, for creation of the geological model as well as any resource estimation as required by Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101, only historical drill holes were considered which had at least two independent methods for determination of K2O: (i) chemical assay data; and (ii) geophysical downhole logging data (i.e. Natural Gamma Ray Log). Only drill holes, which showed consistent results in assaying and Natural Gamma Log were used for the resource modelling.
In the course of the cross-check sampling of our 2012 exploration drilling samples, a mineralogical analysis was performed additional to chemical assaying. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) allows a quantitative analysis of the mineral content of a sample and therefore provides the possibility for an independent data verification of the calculated mineralogy from the chemical assay data - which is ultimately the base for the mineralized material mass calculation of the resources. For all 45 analyzed samples the discrepancy is less than 0.25 wt% for Sylvite and less than 1.0 wt% for Carnallite with coeffecients of determination for all samples of 99.99% and 99.97%, respectively.
The following steps were performed to verify the data:
Chemical assay data was compared with geophysical drill hole data. Due to the radioactive isotope 40 K, there is a correlation between the potassium content and the signal strength in the natural gamma log. As a result, inconsistent assay data or incomplete sampling intervals could be identified.
Comparison of assay results of different laboratories The charge balance between positive ions (Mg2 +,Ca2 +, Na+, K+) and negative (Cl-, SO 2 -) ions is 4 determined for each full salt analysis, recent as well as historic ones. If the absolute difference 2*(cations -anions)/(cations+anions) * 100% is larger than 5.0%, the analysis is classified as an outlier and should be considered suspect.
The mineralogical composition of the sample was calculated based on the chemical analysis, which included re-calculating the elements from weight % to mol and re-arranging them to the basic salts. Subsequently the mineralogy was recalculated to masses of elements, including the crystal water content. The sum of these elements together with the insoluble content should be close to 100.
The Natural Gamma Ray Log and assay result of every single drill hole was compared to those of adjacent drill holes. In a normal case, a correlation in the number of mineralized beds or combined thickness is visible. If there are discrepancies, the drill hole data has been considered suspect and the usability of this data for resource estimation was evaluated individually.
We and HNZ Potash, LLC conducted confirmation drilling in our 2009 - 2012 drilling campaign. Seven recent boreholes were drilled in a distance of max. 250 m to historical wells. All of the drill holes in the following table correlate very well in the Natural Gamma Log. Slight differences occur in the assaying results but they are generally consistent. Consequently, this fact, in addition to the procedures described before, supports the usage of historical drill hole data.

Current Exploration
We started our exploration activities in 2009, and have carried out the following activities to date:
We drilled four exploration drill holes in 2009, undertook two drill holes drilled by Potash Green in 2010, completed 23 holes in 2011, completed 23 holes in 2012 (22 cored; 1 rotary drilled)
Chemical assaying of core split samples (sampling interval: 0.15 m)
Geophysical logging of four 2009 drill holes (Southwest Exploration Services, LLC, Gilbert, Arizona) and twenty-six 2011 drill holes (Geophysical Logging Services, Prescott, Arizona & Century Geophysical Corporation, Tulsa, Oklahoma) and twenty-three 2012 drill holes that ran immediately after hole completion
Conversion of historic drill logs to equivalent K O values (eK O8 , Geophysical Logging Services, 2 2 Prescott, Arizona & Century Geophysical Corporation, Tulsa, Oklahoma)
Approx. 80.5 km of 2D seismic lines conducted by Zonge International, Inc. (Tucson, Arizona; 11 profiles; January/February 2011) to the east of Holbrook town showing faults with vertical offsets of 10-90 m (32 295 ft).
Furthermore, two drill holes were adopted from Potash Green, LLC, which included geophysical logging and chemical assaying of core split samples.
According to the joint exploration agreement with HNZ Potash LLC (“HNZ”), HNZ and us are sharing all data in the possession or control and agreed to plan future exploration activities with mutual knowledge. HNZ’s exploration activities included:
Drilling 23 exploration wells
Chemical assaying of core split samples (sample interval: 0.15m)
Geophysical logging of all 23 drill holes immediately after hole completion (Southwest Exploration Services, LLC, Gilbert, Arizona)
ERCOSPLAN conducted a schematic comparison between historical gamma ray logs and chemical assays. It was found that the eK2O value cannot be used to determine the potash salt content due to partly high insoluble contents which potassium content is also included in the eK2O (equivalent K2O) value.
Recent Drill Holes
As part of our exploration program, we drilled four exploration drill holes in 2009. Two adopted drill holes were drilled by Potash Green, LLC in 2010. 23 drill holes were completed by us in 2011, an additional 23 drill holes were completed in 2012, and finally 5 drill holes have been completed to date in 2013. In 45 of the holes drilled between 2009 and April 2013, the potash section was cored, this includes the eight joint Passport Potash and Hopi Tribe drill holes completed from November 2012 through April 2013 were cored. The remaining 14 holes are rotary drill holes without any core. HNZ carried out a 23 drill hole exploration drilling program in 2011.
Drilling Procedures
We conducted vertical rotary drilling and coring, which was done by the Boart Longyear Company and K.M. Drilling, Inc. according to industrial standards. The 1st drilling stage included drilling through the overburden and through unconsolidated silts within the Chinle Formation that had a tendency to collapse and inhibit drilling. During the 2nd stage, drilling was continued down to the Marker Bed, where an 8-inch casing was set. Further drilling was conducted down below the Marker Bed with a 5 7/8- inch bit and a 6-inch casing was set down to the final depth or the section below the Marker Bed was cored and casings with sizes that gradually reduced down hole were set (8 to 3.5 inches - depending on down hole conditions and total depth).
HNZ also conducted vertical rotary drilling and coring (contract: Stewart Brothers Drilling Co, Milan, New Mexico). Stand pipes were set at approximately 20 ft using a 16-in bit and a 13-3/8-in casing. The second section was normally drilled with a 12-1/4-in bit to approximately 100 feet into the Coconino Formation sandstone. If mud loss was observed, a 9-5/8-inch casing was set. The third section was drilled with an 8-3/4-inch bit until anhydrite was reached in the Supai Formation. A 7-inch casing was set and cemented. After drilling additional 30 feet with a 6-inch bit, the borehole assembly was changed to continuous coring. Continuous 4-inch cores were collected throughout the Supai Formation evaporates and 30 to 40 feet beneath the lowest potash bed.
Drilling Results
The basic data for our drill holes are listed in Table 2. All of them were drilled vertically and intersected the potash horizon. Due to varying contents of clay (which also contains potassium and therefore also generates amplitude in natural gamma ray log) within the potash horizon, an unaltered determination of potash salts containing K2O is not possible from only the natural gamma log. Therefore the K2O grade was determined only by chemical assay data.
Table 2 Basic Data for PASSPORT Exploration Campaign Drill Holes and HNZ Exploration Campaign Drill Holes (Coordinates are given in UTM Format, WGS 84 Datum).
All rotary drill holes were drilled with fresh, unsaturated water, which affected the geophysical borehole logs. However, for most of the drill holes, a clear indication for potash mineralization is visible in the Natural Gamma Log. The exceptions are PPI-1101, PPI-1105, PPI-1109 and PPI-1110, in which stronger dissolution within the potash section probably took place.
As for all rotary drill holes (see Table 2) no drill cores/assay data was available, and therefore, no reliable declaration of the potash horizon was possible. However, the natural gamma ray log shows, due to the high amplitudes, in most of the drill holes an indication for potash salts. Table 3 shows only drill holes for which a reliable determination by chemical assay data of top, base, thickness and K2O grade were possible.
Since the assay data for historical as well as recent holes was already provided in the common form of K2O, it was not necessary to convert or use any conversion to K2O. If the assay data had been provided in KCl (potassium chloride), then a conversion would have been necessary.
The depths of mineralized intervals as well as grades are summarized in Table 3.
Table 3 Overview of Depth, Thickness and Grade of our Drill Holes
Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
The standard operating and quality assurance procedures followed by our employees have been instituted to make sure that all sampling techniques and results meet international reporting standards.
During the exploration program, we took split core samples. Coring started when the first significant gypsum interval (Upper Supai Formation) was intersected. Information about the drill holes and the on-site core descriptions were given/conducted according to international standards (depth intervals, recovery-%, lithology, structure, alteration, rock type, weathered profile, sample intervals, remarks). On site, our field geologists collected the cuttings, bagged and labeled them and placed a small sub-sample into a chip tray for further treatment (not sent for chemical analysis). Rotary cuttings coming from below the anhydrite were generally logged by the on-site geologists. Directly after being retrieved, the cores were measured, cleaned, field logged, packed in plastic poly sheeting and were placed into sequentially numbered and labeled (drill hole name, land location, depth interval, core number) core boxes. The material was then temporarily stored prior to transfer to the laboratories at our core facilities. A chain of custody prepared by the well site geologist accompanied the delivery. In the laboratory, the cores were split in two halves and one half was crushed, pulverized and assayed. For all 2012 and the last 2011 core sections, the core was cut at our core storage facility. The sampling interval was 0.15 m. The laboratories commissioned for the performance of the chemical analysis of the K2O content were ALS Chemex (Reno, Nevada - ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 17025:2005 certificates), Skyline (Tucson, Arizona - ISO/IEC 17025 certificate), Apex Environmental Laboratory (Tempe, Arizona) and SRC Laboratories in Saskatoon, Canada (SCC accredited, ISO/IEC 17).
ALS analyzed the cores from the four 2009 drill holes. The cores were sent in full and, afterwards, split in half with one half being crushed and pulverized before going into 35 Element Aqua Regia ICP-AES and Whole Rock Package ICP-AES. Internal standards, blanks and duplicates were included. After a year, part of the core was sent back to us and the other part was permanently stored in Apache Junction in July 2011.
Skyline did the analysis on ten 2011 drill holes by splitting, crushing, pulverizing and assaying the cores at their laboratory. They used 34 elements Aqua Regia Digestion (ICP-OES, TE-2 program) and the Volumetric Chloride Analysis method for Total Chlorine.
Apex analyzed 89 samples of PPI-1115 via ICP-MS and Silver Nitrate Titration for Total Chlorine. Apex included internal blanks, standards and Laboratory Control Samples (LCS).
Chemical analyses for PPI-1131 and all subsequent 2012 assaying works were carried out primarily by SRC.
During the recent exploration program in 2011, HNZ took samples from cores that were cut in half. Coring started when the first significant gypsum interval (Upper Supai Formation) was intersected. Information about the drill holes and the on-site core descriptions were given/ con-ducted according to international standards (depth intervals, recovery-%, lithology, structure, alteration, rock type, weathered profile, sample intervals, remarks). Directly after being retrieved, the cores were measured, cleaned, field logged, packed in plastic poly sheeting and were placed into sequentially numbered and labeled, 2-ft long (drill hole name, land location, depth interval, core number) core boxes. The material was then shifted to the HNZ core lab facility at the Milky Ranch. There, the cores were split in two halves and placed in plastic bags. The sampling interval was 6 in (0.15 m). Sampling started approximately 2 to 4 ft above the mineralized zone and ended approximately 2 to 4 ft below the mineralized zone, based on down hole logging. After completion of core logging and sampling, the core was photographed. A chain of custody prepared by the well site geologist accompanied the delivery to the laboratory. In total, 1,151 samples were delivered to SRC.
SRC crushed the core samples to a 6 mm grain size and stored one half of each sample. Afterwards, the samples were pulverized and placed in a tray. Samples were analyzed using ICP-OES together with determinations of % Insolubles and % Moisture. The chloride ion is not measured directly, but calculated from the ion balance afterwards.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control
National Instrument 43-101 and Exploration Best Practices Guidelines state that a program of data verification should accompany an exploration program to confirm validity of exploration data. Furthermore, the guidelines require a quality assurance quality control (QA/QC) program to be in place.
Concerning chemical analysis no outside standards, duplicate samples or blanks were sent by us, which leaves only the internal standards and own checking procedures of the different laboratories as quality control of the chemical assays.
All 2011 core samples were prepared by Skyline. We then sent the unused crushed cores to SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC; Saskatoon, Canada; SCC accredited, ISO/IEC 17) for duplicate analysis. SRC was commissioned to perform duplicate chemical analysis on 434 out of a total of 1650 samples tested by Skyline, ALS and Apex. Samples from drill hole PPI-1131 and all subsequently following 2012 drill holes were analyzed by SRC. SRC includes blanks, duplicates and their internal potash 003/ 004 standards into the analysis. The purpose of duplicate measurements was to ensure that only quality geochemical datasets were generated from the sampling process by demonstrating the accuracy, precision, and repeatability of the analyzing party. Two different powdered reference materials (“POT003” and “POT004”) of varying mineralogical composition and potash grade were systematically inserted as standard samples into the mineralized sample batches as internal standard procedure of SRC. The “POT003” standard is a compositionally homogeneous lower grade (19.5% K2O) potash material while the “POT004” standard has higher grade (60.4%K2O) potash values. Measurements of blank and standard samples were intended to verify that the instruments used for analysis at the SRC Laboratories were correctly calibrated and cleaned.
For the 2012 drill holes, we added one blank and one standard at either 10%, 21% or 62% K2O for approximately every 20 samples. The results are in the specific tolerance levels.
HNZ collected, as part of the drill site sampling procedure, one duplicate sample, one standard, and one blank sample for approximately every 20 samples. Additional cross check analysis was carried out by Huffman Laboratories, Inc. (Golden, Colorado) on 67 samples plus their own internal blanks and standards. These results generally correlate with the results of analyses carried for HNZ by SRC.
For about 10% of all samples of our 2012 exploration phase cross-check analyses were carried out at ERCOSPLAN’s independent reference lab. The pulp and reject samples showed a good correlation with generally less than 2% discrepancy for the K2O value and a coefficient of determination of 99.6%.
In order to check the chemical analysis results for consistency the charge balance between positive ions (Mg2+,Ca2+, Na+, K+) and negative (Cl-, SO42-) ions is determined for each full salt analysis, recent as well as historic ones. If the absolute difference 2*(cations - anions)/ (cations+anions) * 100% is larger than 5.0%, the analysis is classified as an outlier and should be considered suspect.
The mineralogical composition of the sample was calculated based on the chemical analysis, which included recalculating the elements from weight % to mol and rearranging them to the basic salts according to the following scheme:
1.
Combine cations and anions to simple salts according to the following scheme
a.
combine with Cl, in the following order: Na, K, Mg, Ca
b.
combine with SO4 in the following order: Ca, Mg, K, Na
c.
Based on experience with potash deposits, the analyses should be either MgCl2 or K2 SO4 normative, meaning if CaCl2 or Na2 SO4 results from these combinations, the analysis is suspect.
2.
Combine the simple salts to salt mineralogy according to the following simplified scheme:
a.
All NaCl is Halite.
b.
If CaCl2 is present combine with MgCl2 to Tachyhydrite.
c.
The remaining MgCl2 is combined 1:1 with KCl to Carnallite.
d.
If MgCl2 > KCl, remaining MgCl2 to Bischofite.
e.
If KCl > MgCl2 and MgSO4 available, combine remaining KCl 1:1 to Kainite.
f.
If K2 SO4 > MgSO4 or CaSO4 /2, Arcanite, otherwise with CaSO4 and MgSO4 to Polyhalite.
g.
If remaining KCl > MgSO4, remaining KCl after Kainite to Sylvite, otherwise remaining MgSO4 to Kieserite.
h.
Remaining CaSO4 to Anhydrite.
The mineralogy was re-calculated to masses of elements, including the crystal water content. The sum of these elements together with the insoluble content should be close to 100.
For mostly all available drill holes Natural Gamma Ray and Neutron Logs are present. In terms of a consistent database all assaying data was checked against the Natural Gamma Ray Log for every single drill hole1. In an ideal case the interval of sampling as well as the K2O-content determined by assaying should match with the natural gamma ray log concerning interval of increased values and signal strength with certain accuracy. In an example for the historical drill hole DH 624 is given, which shows a clear correlation and coverage by sampling.
Additionally in order to achieve a higher level of confidence the Natural Gamma Ray Log and assay results of every single drill hole was compared to adjacent drill holes. In a normal case a correlation regarding the number of mineralized beds or combined thickness is visible. If there are discrepancies, the drill hole data will be considered suspect and the usage for resource estimation is evaluated individually.
Security
The core material was under supervision of a Passport/HNZ well site geologist starting from retrieval and ending with the delivery to the respective laboratory. Whenever there was no direct supervision by the well site geologist, the core was stored under lock and key. Prior to transfer to the respective laboratory, the core material was sealed in plastic liner was temporarily stored within the core boxes at our drill site.
Planned Exploration Program
Our engineering firm, ERCOSPLAN, has recommended a two phase development of the project consisting of:
____________________________
1 Due to the radioactive isotope 40K, which emits gamma rays there is a correlation of the potassium content and the natural gamma log.
Phase 1
Studies to confirm and verify the assumptions made for the Preliminary Economic Assessment Report and further exploration potentially in order to delineate more Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. These studies consist of:
Detailed hydrogeological investigations to determine the quantity and quality of groundwater available for the project
Rock mechanical test work and modelling to optimize the present room and pillar configuration and potentially increase recovery, and to obtain information about the water protective horizon in the hanging wall of the potash layer
Flotation test work on potential potash ore to test the feasibility of a flotation process, which could provide a less energy-intensive alternative processing route
Exploration consisting of infill exploration drilling, including 2D seismic surveys to potentially convert present Inferred Mineral Resources to Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as well as exploration in the north-western property of PASSPORT to potentially extend the resource base
Preparation of a market study to determine the type and amount of MOP product saleable on the market
Preparation of a processing residue disposal concept (especially disposal brine) in cooperation with the authorities.
Upon completion of the studies, an updated resource report with the target of potentially delineating adequate resources for a 30-year 2.5 MTPA MOP production and the input data required for a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) is expected to be issued.
This phase is expected to end with a PFS delineating the best mining option and the best processing method option and is expected to allow for an updated resource/reserve estimate using typical mining and processing recovery factors, since not all required information for that has been available for this study. The costs for the studies of Phase 1 are estimated at about $7,500,000. We expect Phase 1 to be completed by the end of 2013.
Phase 2
Conditional upon a favorable outcome of Phase 1, we expect to start a Feasibility Study (“FS”) which will use the geological model of the updated resource estimate and the results of all investigations that are not yet available in the PFS phase to produce a detailed mining and processing design.
Based on the results of the PFS, further laboratory investigations might be necessary to optimise the chosen mining and processing methods. At this stage, the costs for this second phase are estimated at $15,000,000, but they depend on the requirements for further investigations that cannot be defined in detail at present. We expect this phrase to be completed by the end of 2014.
