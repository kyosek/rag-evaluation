ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
Summary of Timberline’s Mineral Exploration Prospects
As of December 2009, Timberline has acquired mineral prospects for exploration in Montana, Nevada and Idaho mainly for target commodities of gold, silver, zinc and copper. The prospects are held by both patented and unpatented mining claims owned directly by the Company or through legal agreements conveying exploration and development rights to the Company. Most of our prospects have had a prior exploration history and this is typical in the mineral exploration industry. Most mineral prospects go through several rounds of exploration before an economic ore body is discovered and prior work often eliminates targets or points to new ones. Also, prior operators may have explored under a completely different commodity price structure or technological regime. Mineralization which was uneconomic in the past may be ore grade at current market prices when extracted and processed with modern technology.
Montana Gold Properties
Butte Highlands Gold Project
In July 2007, Timberline closed its purchase of the Butte Highlands Gold Project. The project is located approximately 15 miles south of Butte, Montana in Silverbow County. The property covers 1,142 acres consisting of a combination of patented and unpatented mining claims situated within Sections 31 and 32, Township 1 North, Range 7 West; Sections 5 and 6, Township 1 South, Range 7 West; and Section 1, Township 1 South, Range 8 West, Montana Principal Meridian. The property can be accessed utilizing motor vehicle via State Highway 2 and County and US Forest Service maintained, improved surface roads. The project is within a favorable geologic domain that has hosted several multi-million ounce gold deposits.

All of the unpatented claims are exploration lode claims legally located under federal and state guidelines whereas each claim is 600 feet by 1500 feet encompassing 20 acres. Each claim is clearly marked with a 4 inch by 4 inch post or equivalent tree at each corner and a location monument is erected along the center line of the long direction of the claim. All BLM maintenance requirements have been met.
All of the private lands within the Butte Highlands property are historic lode and placer claims which were patented through the U.S. Government patent process. Timberline Resources is responsible for paying yearly BLM maintenance fees on all unpatented mining claims and Montana State property taxes on all patented lands. All associated taxes and fees are paid up to date as of September 30, 2009. Electricity and water are readily available on the property. If necessary, additional electricity requirements may be met by augmenting the currently available electrical supply with generator power.
Gold mineralization at Butte Highlands is hosted primarily in lower Paleozoic Wolsey shale with higher-grade mineralization occurring within the sediments proximal to diorite sills and dikes. Between 1988 and 1996, prior operators Placer Dome, Battle Mountain, ASARCO, and Orvana Minerals demonstrated the presence of a wide and continuous mineralized zone by drilling 46 core holes (36,835 feet) and 132 reverse-circulation holes (61,338 feet) within the district. The vast majority of this drilling was conducted in the Nevin Hill area which is included in the Timberline property. Best gold intercepts achieved at Butte Highlands include 49.8 feet of 0.651 ounces per ton (oz/t) and 11.5 feet of 1.996 oz/t from surface and 31.0 feet of 1.060 oz/t from underground.

In 1997, Orvana Minerals used recent and historic drilling data to prepare a report on the Butte Highlands property. The report provided a preliminary technical review of feasibility issues, identifying no fatal flaws to mine development. The report also noted that suitable sites for a mill and tailings pond are present on the property, custom milling at existing nearby facilities was feasible, and access to the deposit could be achieved with a decline from either of two existing portals.
Since signing the Purchase Agreement for Butte Highlands in May 2007, Timberline has expanded its land position to cover additional drill targets and has retained Klepfer Mining Services (Eric Klepfer, as affiliate of Klepfer Mining Services, is also a director to Timberline) to perform the environmental and permitting services necessary to advance the project. Timberline management believes that there is excellent potential to increase the historic resource estimates at Butte Highlands, both along strike and down-dip, as well as a realistic opportunity for near-term production.
Timberline purchased the Butte Highlands property in 2007, including 100-percent ownership of mineral rights, from Butte Highlands Mining Company for $405,000 cash and 108,000 shares of Timberline common stock.
In 2008, Timberline completed the first four holes (totaling 6,757 feet) of its planned 17-hole surface core drilling program before the early onset of heavy snowfall forced the cessation of exploration activities for the season. Assays have been received for the first three holes with results confirming known mineralized zones and identifying a new high-grade gold zone to the northwest. The program was designed to validate and expand the historic estimates, to obtain material for petrographic and metallurgical evaluation, and to assess 3-D control for planning and permitting the exploration decline and, ultimately, a producing mine.
The most encouraging hole to-date, BH-DDH 08-03, was drilled 100 feet northwest of previously-tested mineralization boundaries. The hole returned several mineralized gold intervals, including 2.0 feet of 0.62 ounces per ton (oz/t), 37.0 feet of 0.22 oz/t, 5.0 feet of 0.26 oz/t, 9.0 feet of 0.43 oz/t, and 35.0 feet of 0.14 oz/t. These results demonstrate the northwest extension of the Upper, Middle, and Lower zones, while the latter two intervals comprise a new discovery at depth or a potential offset portion of previously-identified zones. Both the extension and the discovery have the potential to greatly increase mineralization estimates at Butte Highlands.
Results for BH-DDH 08-02, intended to test a narrow gold zone proximal to a diorite dike, were also positive and encouraging. In addition to a 7.2-foot interval grading 0.11 oz/t gold within typical Wolsey shale host rock, the hole also intercepted a 267-foot zone of mineralized diorite , including 25.0 feet grading 0.10 oz/t gold. It is important to note that the identification of slightly higher-grade diorite material, or the delineation of similarly wide zones of lower-grade material with underground bulk mining potential, could have a significant positive impact on mineralization estimates as they do not currently include diorite-hosted gold. Additional testing of diorite targets will be considered for future drilling phases, most likely from underground.

In October 2008, the Company announced that it had agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture with Small Mine Development (“SMD”) at the Butte Highlands project. In July 2009, the Company finalized the joint venture agreement with Highland Mining, LLC (an affiliate of SMD) to create Butte Highlands JV, LLC (“BHJV”). Under terms of the joint venture agreement, Timberline will be carried to production by Highland Mining, LLC (“Highland”), which will fund all mine development costs and began development in the summer of 2009. Both Timberline’s and Highland’s 50-percent share of costs will be paid out of proceeds from future mine production.
BHJV has continued the exploration plan and geologic modeling of the Butte Highlands project with Timberline’s assistance. During the year ended September 30, 2009, a permit to perform additional exploration, consisting of installing an underground exploration ramp to access mineralization for underground drilling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing was approved by the State of Montana. Upon approval, construction of the underground ramp and associated development on the project began in August 2009. Completion of the underground ramp, underground drilling and bulk sampling will take approximately 12 to 18 months in total. During this time BHJV will be submitting an application for an Operating Permit with the state of Montana to commence gold mining operations. BHJV will be conducting or contracting all base line studies to facilitate the permit. The state of Montana has indicated to Timberline that this process and regulatory approval will take approximately 12 to 18 months. Therefore, Timberline expects to transition directly from exploration to gold mining operations within the specified time frame.
As of September 30, 2009 BHJV has completed four drill holes of a five hole core drill program totaling 5,759 feet of drilling. Assays for the first three holes have been received. The first three drill holes were drilled to the northwest of the main mineralized body in the hopes of extending mineralization in that area. The first hole (BHDDH09-01) encountered mineralization before abruptly intersecting an unexpected fault which removed the favorable Wolsey Formation. The second and third holes also encountered an additional fault and no mineralization was encountered in these two holes. The fourth hole (BHDDH09-04) was drilled in the central part of the mineralized area with the intention of infill drilling near known mineralized intercepts. The hole encountered a significant amount of skarn mineralization although geologically it appears it could be similar to lower grade material encountered in previous holes.
BHJV also initiated a Hydrologic Reverse Circulation Drill program during the year ended September 30, 2009. Three holes have been completed for a total of 2,300 feet. Data collected during this program will be used to model the hydrologic character of the mineralized area. As of September 30, 2009 the Company has incurred exploration costs to date of approximately $750,000. Ongoing exploration costs are being incurred by BHJV.
Highland, our 50/50 joint venture partner on the project, will carry all costs incurred on the project until mining operations commence. The Company expects that the total costs incurred on the project to reach this milestone will be between $12 and $18 million.
Nevada Gold Properties
The East Camp Douglas Prospect
In August 2006, Timberline exercised its option to lease the East Camp Douglas Project, along the prolific Walker Lane Mineral Belt in south-central Nevada. It is approximately four miles southwest of the town of Mina in Mineral County, Nevada. The property is comprised of 115 unpatented mining claims (totaling 2,300 acres) and represents a “district-scale” project with multiple targets of low-sulphidation quartz-adularia and high-sulphidation quartz-alunite gold-silver mineralization. In August 2007, the Company exercised its option to lease an additional 8 unpatented claims (totaling 155 acres).
The property is structurally well-located at the intersection of the northwest trending Walker Lane Structural Belt (Rawhide, Paradise Peak, Tonopah, and Goldfield mines) and the regional west-northwest trending Cerro Duro Lineament (Bodie, Aurora, and Borealis mines). The Miocene age gold-silver mineralization at East Camp Douglas is related to an extensive intermediate to felsic eruptive volcanic center including early andesitic and later dacitic flows and dikes.
During the year ended September 30, 2009 the Company determined that, despite the property’s geologic potential, it would continue to hold only the 8 unpatented claims acquired in 2007, and terminated the lease on the other 115 unpatented claims. We have written down $40,000 in associated capital costs of the project to reflect this termination.
As of September 30, 2009, Timberline does not consider the East Camp Douglas prospect to be a material property. No future expenditures are planned on the prospect at this time.
Idaho Copper-Silver Property
The Snowstorm Prospect
The Snowstorm Project is located in north Idaho’s “Silver Valley” and features the Snowstorm Mine, a historic operation that produced 800,000 tons of ore averaging 4-percent copper and 6 ounces per ton (oz/t) silver. Snowstorm mineralization occurred as disseminated copper and silver found in the same Revett Formation quartzites that host the Troy, Rock Creek, and Montanore deposits on the Montana Copper Sulfide Belt, but was of a much higher grade. The Snowstorm property, which is 2 miles northeast of the Lucky Friday Mine near Mullan in Shoshone County, Idaho, lies in the southwest corner of the Montana Copper Sulfide Belt where it overlaps the northeast corner of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. Timberline controls 100-percent of the Snowstorm Project.
Exploration work has been conducted in the project area for decades. U.S. Borax conducted a program focusing on the nearby Military Gulch area during the 1980s. Later, Silver Mountain Lead Mines, The Bunker Hill Company, and Hecla held the project area and also conducted significant exploration. Timberline has obtained access to most of this data, which represents hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work. This data was reviewed and assembled to aid in the development of the 2005 exploration program.
In late-2005, Timberline completed a Phase I exploration program at Snowstorm, designed as an initial evaluation of the potential for copper-silver mineralization in Upper Revett quartzite within the large project area. The program consisted of 10 core holes totaling 4,104 feet, drilled at nine widely-spaced sites along the projected mineralized horizon at depths ranging from 149 to 712 feet.
Mineralization was found to occur within the lower unit of the Upper Revett quartzite, with all ten drill holes encountering the quartzite in thicknesses varying from 37 to 57 feet. Although the continuity of the stratigraphy and the mineralized horizon was demonstrated, bulk grades across the horizon were sub-economic, with copper values typically less than 0.3-percent and silver values typically less than 0.25 oz/t. Much of the mineralization in the shallower intercepts was oxidized with leaching contributing to the lower grades. In the sulfide zones, chalcopyrite was the predominate sulfide rather than bornite or chalcocite. Results of the drilling were reported in the Company’s 8-K report dated January 3, 2006.
Timberline submitted a technical report on the Phase I exploration program at Snowstorm, along with a Phase II exploration proposal, to Hecla as required by an earn-in agreement. Hecla has subsequently elected not to participate in future expenditures at Snowstorm and thus retains a 4-percent net smelter returns (NSR) royalty on any future production from the project. Timberline now controls 100-percent of the Snowstorm prospect.
The mineralized horizon at the Snowstorm Mine was discovered in outcrop and subsequently developed with four adits, each driven at lower elevations to access its nearly vertical structure. The horizon appears to have been offset by a structure near the lowest adit and little systematic exploration has been conducted for this lower portion of the ore body. No stratabound copper-silver deposit has since been discovered that approached the grades of the Snowstorm.
In May 2005, the Company signed a Mineral Lease Agreement with Snowshoe Mining Co. for additional ground adjacent to the Snowstorm project area. The property subject to the Snowshoe Agreement includes the patented claims of Mineral Survey 2224, encompassing an area of approximately 76 acres, just west of the Snowstorm claims. The Agreement calls for an initial payment of $8,000, with annual payments increasing to $15,000 by May 2009, and remaining at that level thereafter. The Company will pay a 3-percent NSR royalty on any production from the Snowshoe property, and will perform a minimum of $10,000 worth of exploration work upon it annually. The work may be performed on or for the benefit of the Snowshoe claims. Hecla previously elected to include the Snowshoe claims within the area of interest, and will consequently receive a 1-percent NSR royalty on any production from the Snowshoe property.
As of September 30, 2009, Timberline does not consider the Snowstorm prospect to be a material property. No material future expenditures are planned on the prospect at this time.
Idaho Gold Property
The Spencer Prospect
The Spencer prospect covers 640 acres on the western end of the Kilgore-Spencer Trend, a northeast-trending belt of rhyolite volcanics known to host epithermal gold-silver mineralization, just south of a privately-held opal mine about nine miles northeast of near the town of Spencer, Idaho. The Company believes that the property has the potential to host both open-pit and underground gold deposits.
The geochemistry at Spencer is consistent with the upper levels of an epithermal system. Although there was considerable interest in the region during the 1980s and 1990s, the Spencer property has never been drill tested.
The Company has performed a phase-one exploration program consisting of reconnaissance-scale geological mapping along with rock chip and soil geochemical sampling. Future work may include more detailed mapping and sampling, and possibly a geophysical survey to help define drill targets.
The Spencer Prospect is held by State of Idaho Department of Lands Mineral Lease No. 9347. The Mineral Lease was issued to a prior Director of Timberline, who assigned it to the Company for consideration of common stock and approximately $3,000 in expenses.
The prospect is located in Section 16, Township 12 North, Range 37 East, in Clark County, Idaho. The lease covers an area of approximately 640 acres and calls for annual payments to the State of Idaho of $640. Royalties on production of previous metals are 5-percent of the gross receipts from the sale of minerals produced, less reasonable transportation, smelting and treatment costs.
As of September 30, 2009, Timberline does not consider the Spenser prospect to be a material property. No future expenditures are planned on the prospect at this time.
Montana Copper-Silver Properties
The Minton Pass, East Bull, Standard Creek, Lucky Luke, Clear Peak and Copper Rock Prospects
In 2004, Timberline acquired four properties on the Montana Copper Sulfide Belt in Lincoln and Sanders counties. All four properties are interpreted as sediment-hosted copper-silver occurrences located in the Revett Formation of the Montana Copper-Silver Belt and are considered early-stage exploration prospects. The properties were held by U.S. Borax and its successor company, Kennecott Exploration, during the 1980s and early-1990s. Timberline has acquired the mapping and sampling data from the U.S. Borax program. There has been no documented activity in these areas since 1992.
In the 1970s and 1980s, major exploration companies identified several copper-silver occurrences within the Montana Copper Sulfide Belt, and successfully outlined three world-class ore bodies, including Troy, Rock Creek and Montanore. These quartzite-hosted deposits are characterized by their lateral extensive size and continuity of mineralization. The Troy Mine produced 390 million pounds of copper and 44 million ounces of silver from 1981 to 1993, and the undeveloped Rock Creek deposit is reported to contain 137 million tons of ore averaging 0.72-percent copper and 1.67 oz/t silver. Many of the copper-silver occurrences, including those held by the Company, were evaluated in only a cursory manner during previous exploration.
Metasedimentary rocks of the Precambrian Belt Supergroup underlie the area. Outcropping rocks consist of a sequence of argillites, siltstones, and quartzites representing the basal portion of the Wallace, St. Regis, and Revett formations, along with the upper portion of the Burke Formation. Locally, these rocks strike northwest with a shallow westerly dip. Major faulting associated with the mineralization is generally north-northwest. Disseminated bornite with secondary chrysocolla and malachite is reported to occur within a specific quartzite horizon of the Revett Formation.
In 2008, Timberline acquired two additional prospects in the same favorable mineralized geology, Clear Peak and Copper Rock. These properties have the same geologic description as the properties described above. Both Clear Peak and Copper Rock were previously explored by Asarco Exploration Company, Inc.
All claims were staked by Timberline and are not subject to any underlying production royalty. All of these claims have been filed with the BLM.
The State of Montana has banned the use of cyanide in mining activities within the state. Cyanide is used in the mining of gold. Since Timberline’s Montana prospects are for silver and copper only, this ban does not affect our plans for this property in Montana.
As of September 30, 2009, Timberline does not consider any of the Minton Pass, East Bull, Standard Creek, Lucky Luke, Clear Peak or Copper Rock prospects to be material properties. No future expenditures are planned on the prospects at this time.
Overview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues
Hard rock mining and drilling in the United States is a closely regulated industrial activity. Mining and drilling operations are subject to review and approval by a wide variety of agencies at the federal, state and local level. Each level of government requires applications for permits to conduct operations. The approval process always involves consideration of many issues including but not limited to air pollution, water use and discharge, noise issues, and wildlife impacts. Mining operations always involve preparation of an environmental impact statement that examines the probable effect of the proposed site development. Federal agencies that may be involved include: The U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Individual states also have various environmental regulatory bodies, such as Departments of Ecology and so on. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. An example of such regulation is the State of Montana’s recent ban on the use of cyanide in mining activities within the state. Cyanide is used in the mining of gold. However, since some of our prospects in Montana are for silver and copper this ban does not affect those properties. Our Butte Highlands project in Montana is partially on patented ground and is an underground gold prospect. It is anticipated that any production from this property would be shipped to nearby mills for processing as opposed to building our own mills and processing facilities, thus this ban would not affect our plans in Montana. The Elkhorn project is nearby and similar to Butte Highlands and is following a similar plan with public support. We are not aware of any other states that plan to enact similar legislation.
Gold, silver and copper are mined in a wide variety of ways, both in open pit and underground mines. Open pit mines require the gold deposit to be relatively close to the surface. These deposits tend to be low grade (such as 0.01-0.03 ounces per ton gold) and are mined using large, costly earth moving equipment, usually at very high tonnages per day.
Open pit operations for gold usually involve heap leaching as a metallurgical method to remove the gold. Heap leaching involves stacking the ore on pads which are lined with an impenetrable surface, then sprinkling the gold with a weak cyanide solution to extract the gold. The particle impregnated solution is collected and the gold recovered through further processing.
Underground metal mines generally involve higher grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the washing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process.
Capital costs for mine, mill and tailings pond construction can easily run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Thus changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation.
Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. In some cases, particularly in Montana, with its concern for its grizzly bear population, mining companies have been required to acquire and donate additional land to serve as a substitute habitat for this endangered species.
Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million dollar bonds from mining companies prior to granting permits, to insure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies.
Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
Every mining activity has an environmental impact. In order for a proposed mining project to be granted the required governmental permits, mining companies are required to present proposed plans for mitigating this impact. In the United States, where our properties are located, no mine can operate without obtaining a number of permits. These permits address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the operation and include numerous opportunities for public involvement and comment.
We intend to focus on exploration and discovery of mineral resources, not their production. If we are successful, the ore bodies discovered will be attractive to production companies. The mining industry is, like agriculture, a fundamental component of modern industrial society, and minerals of all sorts are needed to maintain our way of life. If we are successful in finding an attractive ore body, be it gold, silver or copper, sufficient value will be created to reward the Company’s shareholders and allow for all production and reclamation expenses to be paid by the actual producer to whom we convey, assign or joint venture the project.
