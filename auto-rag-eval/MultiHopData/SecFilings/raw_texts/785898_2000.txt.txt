Item 2. Properties.
Monterey Park Building (formerly American Color Building and GE Medical Systems Office Building)
On July 10, 1986, Registrant acquired the Monterey Park Building, located in Monterey Park, California, for approximately $4,182,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Monterey Park Building and its 90,000 square feet of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan (See Item 1. - "Business-Fleet Bank Loan"). The property was built in 1985 and contains 22,250 net rentable square feet (increased from 20,250 square feet for previous tenancies). The property had been a unique combination of office space (approximately 71%) and warehouse space, but the building is being reconfigured solely for use as office, design and development space for use pursuant to a net lease for the entire premises.
The building is 100% leased to LightCross, Inc. pursuant to a lease dated as of November 17, 2000. The initial term of the lease is ten (10) years from the earlier of completion of construction or September 17, 2001, subject to two five-year renewal options.
The lease requires approximate annual net rent of $433,915 for the first two years ($19.50 per square foot), increasing to $446,197 in the third and fourth years ($20.05 per square foot), $458,970 in the fifth and sixth years ($20.63 per square foot), $472,254 in the seventh and eighth years ($21.22 per square foot), and $486,070 in the ninth and tenth years ($21.85 per square foot). The lease shall require payment of a fair market rental during any renewal periods. This lease is a net lease and, except for certain structural and mechanical conditions, the tenant is responsible for all costs, expenses, and obligations relating to the premises and the use, operation, occupancy, management, maintenance, and repair of the building, including insurance and real estate taxes. LightCross is expected to be a large user of electricity. Electric rates in this area have recently risen by approximately 46%, the effect of which could adversely affect LightCross's financial condition.
Registrant has agreed to expend approximately $1,390,000 in capital improvements in connection with this lease. The improvements include enclosing the rear loading bays, converting warehouse space to office space, building a new entrance area, improving distribution of electricity, and contributing to the tenant's construction of a dust-free "clean room." Construction is expected to be completed in or about June 2001.
The tenant has been granted a right of first offer to purchase the Monterey Park Building on the same terms and conditions on which Registrant may be willing to sell the building to a third party.
Upon expiration of its lease in November 2000, the General Services Administration vacated the approximate 45% of the building it had occupied at a gross rent of $21.15 per square foot. In July 1999, American Color Graphics, Inc. ("American Color") terminated its lease for 9,650 square feet in the building, upon payment of a lease cancellation fee of $140,000. This fee represented approximately 50% of American Color's lease obligations for the then remaining lease term of two years. American Color had paid a net rent of $9.00 per square foot, plus reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating expenses.
During 2000, Registrant expended approximately $51,300 in capital expenditures at the building.
Market conditions in the Monterey Park area have improved in recent years. The vacancy rate for commercial properties in such area approximates 5.9% for office buildings. Net rents (like the LightCross lease) for office space approximate $13.50 to $15.75 per square foot and gross rents approximate $20.00 to $22.00 per square foot in this area.
The Directory Building (formerly, the IBM Building)
On October 27, 1986, Registrant acquired the Directory Building, located in Las Colinas, Texas, for a purchase price of approximately $24,580,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Directory Building and its 6.67 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The Directory Building was built in 1982 and contains approximately 152,100 net rentable square feet (reduced from 154,300 square feet during IBM's tenancy).
The building is 100% leased to GTE pursuant to a lease dated as of April 20, 1994, as subsequently amended by amendments dated as of July 29, 1994 and as of February 22, 1995 and as extended by an Extension Agreement and Supplement dated as of March 31, 2000. The renewed initial term of the lease expires on September 30, 2003, subject to two (2) five-year renewal options at a rate equal to the then market rate.
The renewed lease requires approximate monthly rent of $259,873 through September 30, 2003 ($20.50 per square foot). GTE must also pay additional rent equal to excess electric charges and operating expenses over base levels. Registrant has agreed to cap most operating expenses at cumulative increases of five percent (5%) per annum for purposes of this lease.
In connection with the lease extension, Registrant agreed to complete certain deferred maintenance projects. Registrant incurred approximately $462,800 in capital expenditures at the building during 2000. Registrant has expended an aggregate of approximately $3,281,900 in capital expenditures and tenant improvements at the building. Improvements made pursuant to the renewed lease include ADA renovations to the common areas and certain bathrooms, fire alarm and panel replacement, bathroom lighting and other upgrades, correction of water leaks, and sidewalk and gutter repairs.
The Las Colinas office market includes approximately 12,120,463 square feet of Class "A" office space, of which approximately 86.8% was leased as of December 31, 2000. Weighted average rental rates for new leases at such properties are approximately $24.69 per square foot.
Tumi Building (formerly Austin Place Building)
On December 30, 1986, Registrant acquired the Tumi Building, a two-wing office building located in South Plainfield, New Jersey, for a purchase price of approximately $16,473,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Tumi Building and its underlying five acres of land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property was built in 1986 and contains approximately 107,900 net rentable square feet for use as a multi-tenant facility (reduced from 108,000 square feet as a single tenant facility, but subsequently increased from 106,600 square feet due to tenant expansion into common areas).
As of March 15, 2001, the property is approximately 78.2% leased, with 45,700 square feet leased to Tumi, Inc. (as discussed below) and the remainder at an average current rent of approximately
$18.30 per square foot. Such other leases expire in August 2001 (approximately 2,700 square feet), October and November 2005 (approximately 17,400 square feet), and June 2006 (approximately 18,600 square feet).
Tumi's lease is for 45,700 square feet and expires on January 19, 2009. It requires rent payments equal to $15.00 per square foot until January 2002, $16.00 per square foot from February 2002 to January 2006, and $17.00 per square foot from February 2006 to January 2009. The lease includes two 5-year renewal terms, the first at a base rent of $20.00 per square foot and the second at a then fair market rental. Tumi is also obligated to pay for its electric current consumption and its proportionate share (42.3%) of increases in operating expenses, taxes, and insurance over base year 1999 levels. In 1999, Tumi's lease was amended to increase Registrant's obligation for tenant improvements to $1,045,000 (from $350,000) in return for increasing rent payments to $15 per square foot (from $9.00) until January 2002 and to $16 per square foot (from $15) from February 2002 to January 2006.
Registrant has also entered into five year leases with AT&T Wireless PCS, LLC and Sprint Spectrum L.P. to permit installation and operation of cellular telephone towers on the roof of the Tumi Building. Each lease provides for annual rental payments of $19,800, automatic five-year renewal periods (five for AT&T and four for Sprint) and a three percent (3%) increase in rental payments at the commencement of each renewal period.
On March 9, 1999, Gdynia America Line, Inc., a tenant occupying approximately 21,650 square feet (20.3%) in the Tumi Building filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Polish Ocean Lines, a Polish corporation owned by the Polish Government, is jointly and severally obligated under this lease. On or about April 30, 1999, the lease, with a term expiring in May 2007 and annual rental payments of approximately $446,000, was rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding. During 1999, Registrant wrote off approximately $718,000 of deferred rent and other receivables attributable to this lease. In July 2000, Registrant obtained a judgment in an action in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division; Middlesex County against Polish Ocean Lines in the approximate amount of $618,653, representing the amount of rent then unpaid under this lease, with interest thereon. Registrant has made a motion to increase the judgment to $4,080,200 plus interest thereon (estimated to be approximately $500,000), which motion is scheduled to be heard in May 2001. There can be no assurance that Registrant will succeed in collecting any part of this judgment.
South Plainfield is included in the Route 287 submarket (approximately 6,830,000 square feet of which approximately 7.7% is vacant) of Middlesex County (approximately 16,700,000 square feet, of which 6.4% is vacant). Average rents for office space in the Route 287 submarket and Middlesex County approximate $19.69 and $21.74 per square foot, respectively. Registrant has expended approximately $3,110,000 for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, of which approximately $107,600 was incurred in 2000.
Marathon Oil Building (formerly, the Tenneco Building)
On March 21, 1988, Registrant acquired the Marathon Oil Building (formerly the Tenneco Building), an office building located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for approximately $10,736,000, inclusive of acquisition fees. Registrant owns fee title to the Marathon Oil Building with its 6.1 acres of underlying land, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan. The property contains approximately 90,925 net rentable square feet on two floors, plus a 10,016 square foot basement.
Marathon Oil Company leases approximately 65,700 square feet (including approximately 4,300 in the basement) in the building. Marathon renewed its lease to extend the term from February 2001 for an additional five-year term that expires in February 2006. The lease is subject to an additional renewal
option for another five-year term. Marathon's lease also was amended in February 2001 to expand its space by approximately 700 square feet.
Annual rent under Marathon's lease is approximately $716,488 ($11.25 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space), increasing to approximately $793,201 ($12.50 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space) in the third year and $869,915 ($13.75 per square foot, plus $6.00 per square foot for basement space) in the fourth and fifth years. Marathon must also pay additional rent equal to its proportionate share of any increases in operating costs of the building after 1996.
Registrant has leased approximately an additional 17,240 square feet in the building at an average current rent of approximately $12.72 per square foot. These leases expire in December 2001 (approximately 5,900 square feet) and February 2002 (approximately 11,300 square feet). The remaining space (approximately 17.1% of the space) is vacant and Registrant is seeking a tenant for such space.
Market conditions in the northwest section of Oklahoma City have continued recent improvements from the declines experienced after Registrant acquired the building. Such market contains approximately 4.9 million square feet of commercial space of which approximately 15.2% is vacant. Average rents for commercial space range from $8.50 to $21.00 per square foot, with an average rate of $14.48 per square foot. Although the vacancy rate increased slightly during 2000, rental rates continued the increases of recent years. Registrant has expended approximately $441,000 on capital and tenant improvements at this building, none of which were spent in 2000.
475 Fifth Avenue
On December 6, 1996, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as 475 Fifth Avenue, and situated in New York, New York, for approximately $27,440,000 including capitalized costs and related costs. The property contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 240,000 square feet and is located on the southeast corner of 41st Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City; the Subsidiary Partnership owns fee title to 475 Fifth Avenue, subject to the lien of the 475 Loan.
475 Fifth Avenue is a 23-story office building with approximately 19,700 square feet of retail space on the first floor and basement, 215,400 square feet of office space, and 5,100 square feet of basement storage space. As of March 15, 2001, approximately 96.6% of the rentable square footage in the building was leased (including approximately 98.5% of the office space, 85.0% of the retail space, and 60.0% of the basement space), at an average current rent (base rent plus electric charges and prior year adjustments) of approximately $36.07 per square foot (approximately $34.25 per square foot of office space and $59.01 per square foot of retail space). Following is a schedule of the expirations of such leases.
Approximate Avg. Current Expiration Year Square Feet % of Total Rent/Sq. Ft. - --------------- ----------- ---------- ------------ 2001 24,893 10.5% $37.45
2002 6,799 2.9% $33.40
2003 11,416 4.8% $37.11
2004 18,783 7.9% $45.85
2005 30,714 13.0% $44.28
2006 22,243 9.4% $29.97
2007 14,537 6.1% $47.58
2008 47,399 20.0% $26.81
2009 52,095 22.0% $34.96
Registrant's leases generally provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of a porter's wage and real estate tax escalation factors; Registrant may increase the electricity charge if a review demonstrates that Registrant's cost of obtaining such electricity exceeds the charge imposed on tenants. Certain tenants (leasing approximately 20% to 25% of the space in the building) have leases that provide for a base rent, inclusive of an electricity charge, plus additional rent in the form of operating expense and real estate tax escalation factors. In 1997, Registrant commenced a capital improvement program, designed to increase rental rates and the value of the building. In connection with obtaining the 475 Loan, a capital reserve schedule was prepared for 475 Fifth Avenue, detailing improvements aggregating approximately $1,840,000 over a 12-year period. Registrant has prepared an updated plan scheduling renovations at the building (including those in the capital reserve schedule), projected to cost approximately $3,915,000, of which approximately $487,000 had been completed before February 2001. These and other improvements that Registrant intends to make include the following: structural repairs, including roofing, facade, parapet, drain and drain line replacement and repairs (approximately $1,500,000); upgrading electric service and closets, relocating additional AC service, purchasing electrical equipment, and installing fuse panels on each floor (approximately $290,000); elevator modernization, including mechanical cables, security system, and interiors (approximately $575,000); continuing window replacement (approximately $205,000); installation of a sprinkler system, including main distribution and on each floor (approximately $800,000); continuing installation of hot water heating system (approximately $330,000); lobby and entrance renovation (approximately $150,000); security systems (approximately $50,000); and renovation of restrooms to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements (approximately $15,000). In 2000, Registrant funded capital improvements and tenant improvements aggregating approximately $1,437,400 at 475 Fifth Avenue. Certain capital improvements can only be made as tenancies expire. Capital improvements and tenant improvements have been, and are expected in the future to be, funded from working capital, the repair reserve under the 475 Loan, and from anticipated increases in rental income.
475 Fifth Avenue is situated in the Grand Central district of the New York City midtown market. Such district includes approximately 49,980,000 aggregate rentable square feet (vacancy rate of approximately 1.6%), of which approximately 43,177,000 are Class A buildings (1.5% vacancy rate) and
6,804,000 are Class B buildings (2.5% vacancy rate). Asking rents in this district average approximately $61.55 per square foot ($62.71 for Class A buildings and $54.22 for Class B buildings). The entire midtown market includes approximately 243,940,000 aggregate rentable square feet (188,717,000 in Class A buildings and 55,223,000 in Class B buildings), an approximate 1.9% vacancy rate (1.7% for Class A buildings and 2.7% for Class B buildings), and average asking rents of approximately $62.65 per square foot ($66.08 for Class A buildings and $50.92 for Class B buildings).
Alamo Towers
On March 17, 1997, Registrant purchased the land, building and other improvements commonly known as the Alamo Towers, and situated in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $12,002,000, including capitalized closing and related costs. The Alamo Towers contains a multi-tenant office building comprised of approximately 191,000 square feet (reduced from approximately 196,000 square feet when Registrant acquired the property). Registrant owns fee title to the Alamo Towers, subject to the lien of the Fleet Loan.
The Alamo Towers is an office building consisting of two stand-alone 8-story towers with approximately 182,700 square feet of office space and 8,300 square feet of basement space. As of March 1, 2001, approximately 83.0% of the rentable square footage of office space in the Alamo Towers was leased, at an average current rent (base rent plus escalation adjustments) of approximately $14.77 per square foot. Following is a schedule of expiration of such leases.
Approximate Avg. Current Expiration Year Square Feet % of Total Rent/Sq.Ft. - --------------- ----------- ---------- ------------ 2001 41,073 22.7% $15.27
2002 26,240 14.5% $14.65
2003 15,124 8.4% $14.88
2004 22,140 12.2% $14.86
2005 11,767 6.5% $14.23
2006 31,213 17.3% $14.35
2007 2,553 1.4% $14.00
The Alamo Towers has yet to achieve sustainable increases in occupancy rates, primarily because of the absence of a covered parking garage. Registrant's planned significant capital improvements for this Building were delayed in large part because of the capital improvements made at 475 Fifth Avenue. Registrant now intends to fully implement its program at Alamo Towers. In 2000, it neared completion of renovation of the lobby in the West Tower at an approximate cost of $460,000, of which $50,000 has yet to be spent. Registrant also relocated the building's mechanical plant, including replacement of all heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, and upgraded the electrical capacity and distribution, at an approximate cost of $2,225,000, of which approximately $500,000 remains to be spent. Relocation of this plant will enable Registrant to construct a covered parking garage at an estimated cost of $6,000,000. Construction of the garage is tentatively scheduled for late in 2001 or in 2002 and is expected to take six to eight months to complete. Registrant has also been separating the heating and air conditioning systems to better regulate temperature through the building (estimated to cost $40,000) and may recaulk glass walls and windows (approximately $200,000). Registrant may install sprinklers on all
floors of the towers, at an estimated cost of $250,000, but any such installation is unlikely to occur in the near future. Registrant intends to finance these capital improvements from the proceeds of loan drawdowns and/or from proceeds from any sales of properties. In 2000, Registrant expended approximately $2,890,100 in tenant improvements and capital improvements to the Alamo Towers.
The San Antonio office market includes approximately 21,700,000 aggregate rentable square feet, of which approximately 11.9% is currently vacant. Asking rents in this market now average $17.52 per square foot. The north-central San Antonio market includes approximately 7,875,000 aggregate rentable square feet, of which approximately 9.7% is vacant and for which asking rents average approximately $18.26 per square foot. Class B buildings, including the Alamo Towers, feature an approximate 9.0% vacancy rate and an average asking rental rate of $16.97 per square foot.
