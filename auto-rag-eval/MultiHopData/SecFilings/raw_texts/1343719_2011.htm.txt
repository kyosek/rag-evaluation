Item 2. Properties Our properties are primarily located in the Gulf of Mexico waters and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Below are descriptions of our significant properties at June 30, 2011 which represent approximately 81% of our net proved reserves and 87% of our future net revenues, discounted at 10%.
General Information on Properties Main Pass 61 Field. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the Main Pass 61 field, located near the mouth of the Mississippi River in approximately 90 feet of water on OCS blocks Main Pass 60, 61, 62 and 63. The field was discovered by Pogo in 2000, and has produced in excess of 48 MMBOE since production first began in 2002, from four Upper Miocene sands. The primary producer is the J-6 Sand, which consists of a series of stratigraphic traps, located along regional south dip, in a normal pressure environment. The two larger J-6 Sand stratigraphic pods are black oil reservoirs that are being waterflooded to maximize recovery. There are 23 producing wells and three major production platforms located throughout the field. Since acquiring the field in mid 2007, we have drilled five wells and three sidetracks, performed three rig recompletions, and added acreage via the OCS lease sale. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 of 7.6 MBOED, accounted for approximately 18% of our net production for the quarter. Net proved reserves for the field, which is our largest based upon net proved reserves, were 90% oil at June 30, 2011.
West Delta 73. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the West Delta 73 field, located 28 miles offshore of Grand Isle, Louisiana in approximately 175 feet of water on OCS. The field, which was first discovered in 1962 by Humble Oil and Refining, is a large low relief faulted anticline. The field produces from Pleistocene through Upper Miocene aged sands trapped structurally on the high side closures over the large anticlinal feature from 1,500 feet to 13,000 feet. The field has produced in excess of 315 MMBOE. There are six production platforms and 27 active and 46 shut-in wells located throughout the field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 1.8 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 82% oil at June 30, 2011.
West Delta 30. We operate and have a 75% working interest in the West Delta 30 field, located 21 miles offshore of Grand Isle, Louisiana in approximately 45 feet of water on OCS. The working ownership varies based on unit ownership from 100% to 50% with Maritech being the operator in some wells on the West flank. The field, which was discovered in 1948 by Humble Oil and Refining, is a large salt dome. Pleistocene through Upper Miocene sands are trapped structurally by radial faulting on the flanks of the salt piercement. Productive sands range from 2,000 feet to 17,500 feet in depth and generally produce using moderate water drive. Minor faulting that is secondary to the major normal fault separates hydrocarbon accumulations into individual compartments. The field has produced in excess of 780 MMBOE. There are 12 production platforms and 46 active wells located throughout the field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 3.5 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 72% oil at June 30, 2011.
South Pass 49 Field. We have a 100% working interest in and operate the South Pass 49 field Unit, which is located near the mouth of the Mississippi River in approximately 300 feet of water. The field was discovered by Gulf Oil in 1977. The field produces from Lower Pliocene sands, which consist of the Discorbis 69 and Discorbis 70 sands, ranging in depths from 8,700 to 9,400 feet, on OCS blocks South Pass 33, 48, and 49. We also have a 57% working interest in and operate all sands located at depths above and below the Discorbis 69 and 70 units. The field is produced from one central production platform. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 2.3 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 58% oil at June 30, 2011.
South Timbalier 21 Field. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the South Timbalier 21 field, located six miles offshore of Lafourche Parish, Louisiana in approximately 50 feet of water on OCS blocks South Timbalier 21, 22, 23, 27 and 28, as well as on two state leases. The field was discovered by Gulf Oil in the late 1950s and has produced in excess of 320 MMBOE since production first began in 1957.
The field is bounded on the north by a major Miocene expansion fault. Miocene sands are trapped structurally and stratigraphically from 7,000 feet to 15,000 feet in depth. Minor faulting that is secondary to the major normal fault separates hydrocarbon accumulations into individual compartments. There are 10 major production platforms and 61 smaller structures located throughout the field. Since acquiring the field in June 1, 2006, implemented projects include 20 drill wells and 15 rig workovers in this field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 3.2 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 75% oil at June 30, 2011.
Bayou Carlin Field. We currently have a 19% working interest in this field operated by McMoRan located onshore South Louisiana. The discovery well, C.M. Peterson Jr. #1 (Laphroaig) was drilled to 20,250 feet measured depth and put on production in 2007 and has produced 31.2 BCFG and 527 MBC to date. In April 2011, the second well in the field, Laphroaig #2 (Pontiff) was drilled to a total depth of 21,099 feet measured depth and brought on production at a rate of over 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, 500 barrels of condensate per day, and zero barrels of water in a newly discovered reservoir. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 1.0 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 93% gas at June 30, 2011.
South Timbalier 54 Field. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the South Timbalier 54 field, located 36 miles offshore of Lafourche Parish, Louisiana in approximately 67 feet of water on OCS. The field was originally discovered in 1955 by Humble Oil and Refinery. The field is set up at the confluence of regional and counter/regional fault systems. Pleistocene through Miocene sands are trapped from 4,800’ feet to 17,000’ feet in shallow low relief structures over a deeper seated salt dome and in some combination of structural and stratigraphic traps against salt at depth. Minor faulting separates hydrocarbon accumulations into individual compartments. The field has produced in excess of 132 MMBOE. There are five production platforms and 23 active and 22 shut-in wells located throughout the field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 3.7 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 62% oil at June 30, 2011.
Grand Isle 43. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the West Delta Blocks 72 and 93 of Grand Isle 43 field, located 25 miles offshore of Grand Isle, Louisiana in approximately 150 feet of water on OCS. The field was discovered in 1956 by Conoco and production began on West Delta blocks 72 and 93 in 1964. Located on the west flank of West Delta 73 field, the field produces from Pleistocene through Upper Miocene aged sands on a low relief faulted anticline. Productive sands range from 1,300 feet to 13,000 feet in depth. Some pressure depletion production is found in the deeper Upper Miocene sands. Minor faulting that is secondary to the major normal fault separates hydrocarbon accumulations into individual compartments. The field has produced in excess of 629 MMBOE. There is one production platform and seven active and four shut-in wells located throughout the field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 2.1 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 47% oil at June 30, 2011.
Grand Isle 16/18. We operate and have a 100% working interest in the Grand Isle 16/18 field, located seven miles offshore of Lafourche Parish, Louisiana in approximately 50 feet of water on OCS. The field was originally discovered in 1948 by Humble Oil and Refinery and production begin in 1948. The field consists of two separate shallow piercement salt domes. Pleistocene through Miocene Sands are trapped structurally and stratigraphically from 6,000 feet to 13,000 feet in depth against the salt piercements. Radial faulting separates hydrocarbon accumulations into individual compartments. The field has produced in excess of 515 MMBOE. There are 15 production platforms and 39 active and 45 shut-in wells located throughout the field. The field’s average net production for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 2.6 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 84% oil at June 30, 2011.
Main Pass 73 Field. We have a 100% working interest in and operate the Main Pass 73 field, located in approximately 100 feet of water near the mouth of the Mississippi River and in close proximity to the Main Pass 61 field. This field consists of OCS blocks Main Pass 72, 73, and part of 74. The field was originally discovered in 1976 by Exxon and production began in 1979. Production is from the Upper Miocene sands ranging in depths from 5,000 to 12,500 feet. Three producing platforms and one central facility are located throughout the field. We also have ownership in two Petroquest operated gas condensate wells on Main Pass
74. Average net production from the complex for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 2.3 MBOED. Net proved reserves for the field were 77% oil at June 30, 2011.
In May 12, 2011 we agreed to sell a number of non-core, mostly non-operated, onshore natural gas assets to two private buyers for a total of $39.6 million in cash. The transactions closed on June 27 and June 29, 2011 with an effective date of June 1, 2011. For financial reporting purposes, we recorded revenue and expenses thru the closing date. The assets included about 70 producing wells in 20 fields with recent average net production of 8 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 285 barrels per day (Bbls/d) of oil, or a total equivalent of 1.6 MBOED.
Ultra-Deep Shelf Exploration and Development Activity We participate in a joint venture (the “Partnership”) led by McMoRan Exploration Company with respect to several prospects in the ultra-deep shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Data received to date from ultra-deep shelf drilling with respect to the Davy Jones and Blackbeard West discovery wells in the Gulf of Mexico confirm geologic modeling that correlates objective sections on the shelf below the salt weld in the Miocene and older age sections to those productive sections seen in deepwater discoveries by other industry participants. In addition to Davy Jones and Blackbeard West, the Partnership has identified approximately 15 ultra-deep shelf prospects in shallow water near existing infrastructure. The Partnership’s ultra-deep shelf drilling plans in calendar years 2010 and 2011 included the Blackbeard East and Lafitte exploratory wells and delineation drilling at Davy Jones. The Partnership’s near-term sub-salt shelf drilling plans include 2 - 3 exploratory wells. We expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our current commitments related to our ultra-deep shelf exploration and development activity.
Davy Jones. In January 2010, the Davy Jones discovery well on South Marsh Island Block 230 (“Davy Jones #1”) was drilled to a total depth of 29,000 feet. As reported in January 2010, the Partnership logged 200 net feet of pay in multiple Eocene/Paleocene (Wilcox) sands in the well. In March 2010, a production liner was set and the well was temporarily abandoned. Facilities construction has already begun while completion equipment has been designed and is being delivered in time for the completion to start in the second half of 2011, that will allow for the flow test to begin in late December with commercial production expected shortly thereafter.
On April 7, 2010, the Partnership commenced drilling the Davy Jones offset appraisal well (“Davy Jones #2”) on South Marsh Island Block 234, two and a half miles southwest of Davy Jones #1. The well has been drilled to a total depth of 30,546 and a 6 5/8” liner was set to TD and the well was suspended awaiting completion. As previously reported, log results above 27,300 feet confirmed 120 net feet of hydrocarbon-bearing Wilcox sands, indicating continuity across the major structural features of the Davy Jones prospect. Davy Jones #2 encountered the same Wilcox sand sections that were encountered in the Davy Jones #1, in addition to Tuscaloosa and Cretaceous sections that were encountered deeper in the well. In June 2011, results from wireline logs of the Cretaceous section below 27,300 feet indicated that the Davy Jones No. 2 well encountered 192 net feet of potential hydrocarbons in the Tuscaloosa and Lower Cretaceous carbonate sections. The well has been temporarily abandoned pending completion and facilities installation, which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal 2012.
The Davy Jones play involves a large ultra-deep shelf structure encompassing four lease blocks (20,000 acres). As of June 30, 2011, our investment in both wells at Davy Jones totaled $62 million.
Blackbeard East. The Blackbeard East ultra-deep shelf exploration well commenced drilling on March 8, 2010 and was drilled to a depth of 32,559 feet. The drill pipe became stuck and upon attempting to retrieve the pipe 1,351 feet of pipe was left in the bottom of the hole. In July 2011, McMoRan commenced operations to drill a by-pass of the well at approximately 30,700 feet to evaluate targets in the Eocene. Based on the drilling data obtained, Energy XXI believes the well encountered the Sparta Sands in the Eocene, which are younger than the Wilcox. Sparta Sands are productive onshore Louisiana. Wireline logs will be required to evaluate this interval. The well, which is located in 80 feet of water on South Timbalier Block 144, has a proposed total depth of 34,000 feet, targeting Middle and Deep Miocene objectives seen below 30,000 feet in Blackbeard West, nine miles away. As of June 30, 2011, our investment in the well totaled $33.7 million.
Lafitte. The Lafitte ultra-deep exploration well commenced drilling on October 3, 2010 and is drilling below 25,600 feet and has a proposed total depth of 29,950 feet. Like Blackbeard East, Lafitte will target Middle and Deep Miocene objectives. Lafitte is located on Eugene Island Block 223 in 140 feet of water. As of June 30, 2011, our investment in the well totaled $18.1 million.
Blackbeard West. Information gained from the Blackbeard East and Lafitte wells will enable the Partnership to consider priorities for future operations at Blackbeard West. As previously reported, the Blackbeard West ultra-deep exploratory well on South Timbalier Block 168 was drilled to 32,997 feet in 2008. Logs indicated four potential hydrocarbon bearing zones that require further evaluation, and the well was temporarily abandoned. The BOEMRE has granted a geophysical Suspension of Operations (“SOO”) to extend the terms of Blackbeard West leases through April 30, 2012 allowing the Partnership to drill an offset location which has been identified. Our investment in the Blackbeard West well totaled $27.1 million at June 30, 2011.
Reserve Estimation Procedures The information included in this Form 10-K about our proved reserves represents evaluations prepared by our in-house reserve engineers as well as Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent oil and gas consultants (“NSAI”). NSAI has prepared evaluations on 92% of our proved reserves on a valuation basis (the remainder was prepared by our engineers) and the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our net interests in oil and gas properties as of June 30, 2011. The scope and results of NSAI’s procedures are summarized in a letter, which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. For further information on reserves, including information on future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information.”
The reserve estimates prepared by NSAI are reviewed by members of our senior engineering staff. The process performed by NSAI to prepare reserve amounts included the estimation of reserve quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also prepared estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of their preparation of the reserve estimates, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, well test data, historical costs of operation and development or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of its work, something came to its attention which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until they had satisfactorily resolved their questions relating thereto.
The reserve estimates prepared by NSAI along with those reserve estimates prepared by our internal engineering staff are then reviewed by our Vice President of Corporate Development in order to ensure that our reserve estimates are complete and accurate and are in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Following the review of our Vice President of Corporate Development, NSAI and our senior engineering staff present their respective reserve estimates to our board of directors for review.
However, the preparation of our reserve estimates are in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of input data into a reserve forecasting and economic evaluation software, as well as management review. The internal controls include but are not limited to the following:
• a comparison of historical expenses is made to the lease operating costs in the reserve database;
• updated capital costs are supplied by our Operations Department;
• internal reserves estimates are reviewed by well and by area by Engineering personnel. A variance by well to the previous year-end reserve report and quarter-end reserve estimate is used as a tool in this process;
• material reserve variances are discussed among the internal reservoir engineers and the VP of Corporate Development to ensure the best estimate of remaining reserves; and
• the internal reserves estimates are reviewed by senior management prior to publication.
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
• the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
• estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
• the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
• the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
We are staffed by petroleum engineers with extensive industry experience who meet the professional qualifications of reserves estimators and reserves auditors as defined by the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information,” approved by the Board of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 2001 and revised in 2007.
Our Vice President of Corporate Development, Bobby Poirrier, is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for the coordination of the third-party reserve report provided by NSAI. Mr. Poirrier has over 18 years of experience and is a graduate of the Colorado School of Mines with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Prior to joining Energy XXI in 2010, Mr. Poirrier held engineering positions with Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation and Apache Corporation.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Qualifications of Third Party Engineers NSAI provides worldwide petroleum property analysis services for energy clients, financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No.. The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserves estimates has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at NSAI since 1997 and has over 30 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines. The technical work was conducted by a team of six NSAI petroleum engineers and geoscientists having an average industry experience of 20 years.
Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at June 30, 2011 The following estimates of the net proved oil and natural gas reserves of our oil and gas properties located entirely within the United States of America are based on evaluations prepared by third-party reservoir engineers (92% of our proved reserves on a valuation basis) and, the remainder, by our engineers. Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions with no provisions for price and cost changes except by contractual arrangements. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates of new
discoveries are more imprecise that those of producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, reserve estimates are expected to change as additional performance data becomes available.
(1) We refer to “PV-10” as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by NSAI using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs. PV-10 is not a financial measure prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); therefore, the table reconciles this amount to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of this pre-tax measure is valuable because there are unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Average prices used in determining future net revenues were $90.09 per barrel of oil and $4.21 per MMBtu of gas.
Changes in Proved Reserves Our total proved reserves increased 41.0 MMBOE from 75.6 MMBOE at June 30, 2010 to 116.6 MMBOE at June 30, 2011, primarily attributable to the ExxonMobil Acquisition.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves Our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2011 were 35.0 MMBOE. Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at June 30, 2011 totaled approximately $407 million. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, we developed approximately 4% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of June 30, 2010, consisting of 3 gross, 3 net wells at a net cost of approximately $38.9 million. None of our proved undeveloped well locations remain undeveloped past five years from the date of initial recognition as proved undeveloped. Further, we did not have any proved undeveloped well locations as of June 30, 2011 that were not scheduled to be converted into proved developed reserves within the five year requirement as of June 30, 2011.
The following table discloses our progress toward the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.
(1) Relates to the reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves due to the SEC five year development rule.
Drilling Activity The following table sets forth our drilling activity.
Present Activities As of June 30, 2011, five gross wells, representing approximately 1.9 net wells, were being drilled which include the ultra-deep shelf well Lafitte and the well on South Timbalier 144, also known as Blackbeard East.
