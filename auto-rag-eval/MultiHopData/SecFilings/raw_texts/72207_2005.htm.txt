Offices
The principal corporate office of Noble Energy is located at 100 Glenborough Drive, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77067-3610. The Company also maintains offices for domestic and international operations at the Houston location. The Company maintains additional offices in Ardmore, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado and in China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Israel and the United Kingdom.
Proved Reserves
As of December 31, 2005, Noble Energy had estimated proved reserves of 3,091 Bcf of natural gas and 291 MMBbls of crude oil. On a combined basis, these proved reserves were equivalent to 807 MMBoe, of which 53% were located in the U.S. and 47% were located internationally. At December 31, 2005, 75% of reserves were proved developed reserves. During 2005, the Company's U.S. reserves increased by 200%. Over 85% of domestic reserve additions were due to the Patina Merger. At the merger date (May 16, 2005), Patina's proved reserves were approximately 271 MMBoe.
The following table sets forth estimates of Noble Energy's proved natural gas and crude oil reserves as of December 31, 2005:
For additional information regarding estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including estimates of proved and proved developed reserves, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and the changes in discounted future net cash flows, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplemental Oil and Gas Information." See also "Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Reserves."
Company engineers in the Houston and Denver offices perform all reserve estimates for the Company's different geographical regions. These reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by appropriate senior
engineering staff and Division management with final approval by the Senior Vice President with responsibility for corporate reserves. During 2005, Noble Energy retained Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI"), independent third-party reserve engineers, to perform a reserve audit of proved reserves. The reserve audit included a detailed review of eleven of the Company's major international, deepwater, and domestic properties, which covered approximately 72% of Noble Energy's total proved reserves. In 2004, Noble Energy also retained NSAI to perform a reserve audit of proved reserves. The reserve audit for 2004 included a detailed review of the major properties, which covered approximately 78% of Noble Energy's total proved reserves. For 2003, Noble Energy retained NSAI to perform a reserve procedural audit of the Company's procedures and methods used to estimate proved reserves.
Since January 1, 2005, no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with, or included in any report to any federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the Energy Information Administration ("EIA") of the U.S. Department of Energy. Noble Energy files Form 23, including reserve and other information, with the EIA.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Noble Energy searches for potential crude oil and natural gas properties, seeks to acquire exploration rights in areas of interest and conducts exploratory activities. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate, on properties for which it has acquired exploration rights. Noble Energy's properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases. The Company also owns natural gas and natural gas liquids ("NGL") processing plants and pipeline systems. At December 31, 2005, the Company had exploration, development and/or production operations in North America (U.S.), Equatorial Guinea, Israel, North Sea (the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), Ecuador, China, Argentina and Suriname.
North America - Noble Energy's North America operations accounted for 58% of 2005 company-wide production and 53% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2005. Domestic proved reserves are approximately 64% natural gas and 36% crude oil. During 2005, Noble Energy expanded its operations in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-continent regions with the Patina Merger. The Patina Merger provided Noble Energy with a multi-year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. The following discussion includes activities related to Patina properties from the merger date (May 16, 2005) through December 31, 2005.
Rocky Mountain Region - The Rocky Mountain region includes the D-J (Wattenberg field), San Juan, Wind River, and Piceance basins, as well as the Niobrara, Bowdoin and Siberia Ridge fields. The addition of Patina's assets, particularly in the Wattenberg field, combined with Noble Energy's operations in the Bowdoin field, the Niobrara trend, the Wind River basin and Piceance basin have created a new core operating area in the Rocky Mountains. The Company is currently operating 7 drilling rigs and 25 completion units.
Wattenberg Field - Noble Energy acquired working interests in the Wattenberg field through the Patina Merger. Wattenberg provides the Company with a substantial future project inventory. The Wattenberg field is located in the D-J basin of north central Colorado. One of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations. In a section 4,500 feet thick, there may be up to eight potentially productive formations. Three of the formations, the Codell, Niobrara and J-Sand, are considered "blanket" zones in the area of the Company's holdings, while others, such as the D-Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman, are more localized.
Drilling in Wattenberg field is considered low risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves, with 100% of the wells drilled in 2005 encountering sufficient quantities of reserves to be completed as economic producers. The Company's working interest at December 31, 2005 is approximately 94%. In May 1998, the COGCC adopted the "Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A" which allows all formations in the Wattenberg field to be drilled, produced and commingled from any or all of ten "potential drilling locations" on a 320-acre parcel. In December of 2005, the COGCC amended Rule 318A providing for an effective well density of one well per 20 acres in a
designated portion of the Greater Wattenberg Area. The amendment applies only to the Niobrara, Codell and J-Sand formations and will become effective in March 2006.
In 2005, development expenditures in the Wattenberg field totaled $117.3 million. The Company's current field activities are focused primarily on the development of J-Sand and Codell reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores, refracing or trifracing existing Codell wells and refracing or recompleting the Niobrara formation within existing Codell wells. A refrac consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. These projects and continued success with the production enhancement program allowed the Company to increase its production and to add proved reserves in 2005 in what is considered a mature field.
During 2005 the Company drilled 34 wells and deepened eight wells to the J-Sand formation in Wattenberg. At December 31, 2005, the Company had over 265 proven J-Sand drilling locations or deepening projects in inventory. The Company plans to drill or deepen approximately 42 wells to the J-Sand in 2006.
The Company performed 174 Codell refracs in Wattenberg field during 2005. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 1,500 proven Codell refrac projects. The Company plans to perform approximately 235 Codell refrac projects in 2006.
The Company performed 28 Codell trifracs in Wattenberg field during 2005. The trifrac program, which is effectively a refrac of a refrac, has had encouraging results. The Company expects to perform approximately 132 trifracs in 2006. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 455 proven Codell trifrac projects in inventory.
The Company performed 177 Niobrara refracs or recompletions in Wattenberg field during 2005. At December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 1,050 proven Niobrara projects. The Company plans to perform approximately 300 Niobrara projects in 2006.
The Company also performed 24 Codell recompletions and drilled 84 Codell wells in the D-J basin in 2005. The Company had an additional 320 Codell/J-Sand/Sussex proven recompletion opportunities and over 1,070 Codell new drill opportunities at December 31, 2005. The Company plans to drill 172 Codell wells in 2006.
During 2005, numerous well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones were performed. These projects, combined with the new drills, deepenings and refracs, were an integral part of the 2005 Wattenberg development program. The Company estimates it had over 800 of these minor projects in inventory at year-end 2005.
At December 31, 2005, the Company had working interests in approximately 3,700 gross (3,500 net) producing oil and gas wells in the D-J basin. Daily production from this field averaged 9,525 Bbls per day of crude oil and 140,141 Mcf per day of natural gas for the period May 16, 2005 through December 31, 2005. The Company anticipates spending approximately $220.5 million in Wattenberg in 2006 or approximately 18% of budgeted capital.
San Juan Basin - The San Juan basin is located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. During 2005 Noble Energy completed 17 development wells, all of which were successful. The Company expects to drill 18 new wells and recomplete four others during 2006.
Niobrara Trend - The Niobrara trend is located in eastern Colorado. Drilling in Noble Energy's Niobrara trend project increased substantially during 2005. Noble Energy completed 213 development wells with a 91% success rate during 2005. The Company expects to drill 35 wells in 2006.
Bowdoin Field - The Bowdoin field is located in north central Montana. During 2005, Noble Energy drilled 39 development wells, all of which were successful. The Company expects to drill 25 new wells and recomplete 50 wells during 2006.
Piceance Basin - The Piceance basin in western Colorado is another rapidly growing area for Noble Energy. The Company drilled six development wells during 2005, all of which were successful. The Company expects to drill 24 wells during 2006.
Siberia Ridge Field - The Siberia Ridge field is located in south central Wyoming. During 2005, Noble Energy drilled six development wells, all of which were successful. The Company expects to drill three wells during 2006.
Wind River Basin - The Wind River basin is located in central Wyoming. During 2005, Noble Energy drilled three development wells, two of which were successful. The Company expects to drill 16 wells during 2006.
Acreage Agreement - In January 2006, Noble Energy entered into an acreage earning agreement with Teton Energy Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Noble Energy will earn a 75% working interest in approximately 184,000 acres in the D-J basin by drilling 20 wells on or before March 1, 2007. Upon completion of the first 20 wells, Noble Energy and Teton will split all costs associated with future drilling according to each party's working interest. The acreage included in this agreement is a potential eastward extension of the prolific Niobrara producing trend in Yuma County, Colorado.
Mid-continent Region - The Mid-continent region includes Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Texas panhandle. The Patina Merger has made the Mid-continent region another core area for Noble Energy. The Company is currently operating 10 drilling rigs and 20 completion units.
Buffalo Wallow - A significant area of activity in the Mid-continent region is the Buffalo Wallow field located in the Texas panhandle. The primary producing horizons, which generally produce natural gas, are comprised of various intervals in the Granite Wash sequence at approximately 11,000 feet. The productive intervals include a series of stratigraphically trapped sands with an average gross interval of 700 feet. The field has historically been developed on 40-acre spacing. In late 2004, the Texas Railroad Commission approved down-spacing of the field to allow development on 20-acre locations. The Company drilled 64 development wells in the Buffalo Wallow field in 2005, all of which were successful. The Company plans to drill approximately 70 wells in 2006. The Company anticipates spending approximately $120.0 million in Buffalo Wallow in 2006 or approximately 10% of budgeted capital.
Billy Rose - The Billy Rose field is located in the Texas panhandle. During 2005, the Company drilled five development wells, all of which were successful. During 2006, the Company plans to drill 12 additional wells.
Central Oklahoma - During 2005, the Company drilled 55 wells, 51 of which were successful. The Company plans to drill 75 wells during 2006.
Illinois - In southern Illinois, the Company instituted a drilling program, drilling 36 development wells in 2005, 34 of which were successful. The Company plans to drill 50 wells in 2006.
Other - During 2005, the Company completed an additional 24 wells in the Mid-continent region including wells drilled in Kansas and other parts of Oklahoma.
Southern Region - The Southern region includes the Gulf Coast onshore, West and East Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico represent a core domestic operating area.
Deepwater - During 2005, the Company continued to focus on growth of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico business with several key development projects moving toward first production.
Viosca Knoll Block 917, 961, and 962 ("Swordfish"), a 2001 deepwater discovery, is located in approximately 4,500 feet of water. The Swordfish field consists of three wells with crude oil and natural gas pay in multiple, high quality reservoirs. Noble Energy has a 60% working interest in Swordfish and became operator for the project effective December 1, 2005. During 2005, the three subsea wells were tied back via dual flowlines to Kerr-McGee's Neptune spar in Viosca Knoll Block 826. Due to host construction delays, an active 2005 hurricane season, and numerous storm-related downstream service disruptions, Swordfish
first production was delayed until the fourth quarter of 2005. First production was established with a production volume of approximately 8,500 Boepd, net to the Company.
Green Canyon Block 199 ("Lorien"), a 2003 deepwater discovery, is located in approximately 2,200 feet of water. Noble Energy is the operator of the development with a 60% working interest. The Lorien development was sanctioned in March 2005. During 2005, a development well was successfully drilled and both the discovery well and development well were completed. The Lorien field consists of two subsea wells. At year-end, installation of subsea infrastructure to tie the wells back to a nearby host was in progress. Host upgrade and final subsea construction will be completed in early 2006. Production is expected to commence in the first half of 2006 at an initial rate of approximately 12,000 Boepd, net to Noble Energy. The Company recorded net reserves of 4.2 MMBoe in 2005 and expects to add proved reserves during 2006 based on production performance.
Green Canyon Block 768 ("Ticonderoga"), a 2004 deepwater discovery, is located in approximately 5,300 feet of water. Noble Energy holds a 50% non-operated position in the development. The Ticonderoga field is near Kerr-McGee's Constitution development in Green Canyon Block 680 and is a subsea tieback to the Constitution spar. During 2005, a development well was successfully drilled and both the discovery well and development well were completed. Ticonderoga achieved first production on February 16, 2006 and has achieved peak production volumes of approximately 8,750 Bopd and 6,600 Mcfpd, net to Noble Energy's 50% working interest.
At year-end, the Company began drilling its Redrock exploration prospect at Mississippi Canyon Block 204. The Mississippi Canyon 204 #1 well has a proposed total depth of 22,300 feet and is located in approximately 3,300 feet of water. The well will test the first of two Noble Energy operated exploration prospects planned for this area in 2006.
Noble Energy submitted successful high bids on eight (out of eight total bids submitted) deepwater lease blocks in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 194 held in March 2005. The bids were all made at a 100% working interest and totaled $9.3 million.
In December 2005, Noble Energy and Samson Offshore Company ("Samson") entered into an exploration agreement covering interests in 37 deepwater leases held by Noble Energy in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Samson acquired 25% of Noble Energy's working interest in the leases, a majority of which were 100% owned and operated by Noble Energy. Noble Energy and Samson plan to drill at least four exploratory wells through the end of 2008, the first of which is Mississippi Canyon 204 #1 which commenced at year-end 2005.
Hurricanes - The Gulf of Mexico experienced significant hurricane activity in 2004 and 2005. In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan moved through the Gulf of Mexico resulting in infrastructure damage at Main Pass 293/305/306. Clean-up and redevelopment activities began in 2005 and sales of production from the undamaged Main Pass platforms commenced third quarter 2005. However, production was shut in again when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita moved through the Gulf of Mexico in August and September of 2005. Hurricane Katrina destroyed the Main Pass 306D platform. No platforms were lost to Hurricane Rita. However, the back-to-back hurricanes caused damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities that have slowed reinstatement of Noble Energy's production. The Company estimates that 2005 production was reduced by approximately 6,700 Boepd due to the effects of the hurricanes.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf - A 2005 workover program has been successful in maximizing the value of the Company's existing asset base in the Gulf of Mexico shelf area. The workover program will continue into 2006.
Gulf Coast - Activities in the Gulf Coast area during 2005 targeted larger prospects such as the Laurents #1 (South Lake Arthur Deep) which is a 21,000 foot Marg tex test. The well is currently drilling. Noble Energy operates the well with a 54% working interest.
International - Noble Energy has significant international operations. Production from international locations accounted for 42% of 2005 Company-wide production. At December 31, 2005, approximately 47% of the Company's proved reserves were in foreign locations. International proved reserves are approximately 63% natural gas and 37% crude oil. Operations in Equatorial Guinea, Ecuador and China are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. Noble Energy has operations in the following countries:
Equatorial Guinea - The Company's operations in Equatorial Guinea accounted for 66% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2005 and 52% of 2005 international production (including production from an equity method investee). Activities in this West African country center around a working interest in the offshore Alba field, one of Noble Energy's most significant assets. Operations include the Alba field and related condensate production facilities, an onshore LPG processing plant, and a methanol plant. With the completion of recent expansion projects (Phase 2A and 2B) the current condensate capacity is 21,000 Bpd net to Noble Energy and current LPG capacity is 5,600 Bpd net to Noble Energy. The methanol plant is designed to produce commercial grade methanol at a rate of 2,500 MTpd for sale to domestic and international customers. The Company's share of methanol production totaled 162,446 MGal during 2005. Noble Energy owns a 34% working interest in the Alba field and related condensate production facilities, a 28% interest in the LPG plant (through an equity method investee) and a 45% interest in the methanol plant (through an equity method investee).
Blocks "O" and "I" are operated by Noble Energy and represent new exploration opportunities for the Company. In October 2005, Noble Energy announced a discovery on Block "O" with successful test results from the "O-1" ("Belinda") exploration well. The Company is planning to perform additional appraisal and exploratory work on Block "O" and expects to begin exploratory work on Block "I" in 2006. Noble Energy is the technical operator of both blocks, with a 45% working interest in Block "O" and a 40% working interest in Block "I". Block "O", offshore Bioko Island, covers 437,871 acres and is located in water depths that range from the Bioko Island shoreline to over 500 meters (1,640 feet). Block "I", adjacent to Block "O", covers 199,167 acres and is located in water depths in excess of 500 meters. Two 3-D seismic surveys exist on Block "O" and one 3-D seismic survey exists on Block "I".
At December 31, 2005, the Company held 45,203 gross developed acres and 903,792 gross undeveloped acres offshore Equatorial Guinea.
Israel - The Company's properties in Israel are a core international asset, comprising 17% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2005. During 2005, natural gas production from the offshore Mari-B field totaled 66 MMcfpd net to Noble Energy, representing 18% of international production. Noble Energy has a 47% working interest in the field and is the operator. During 2005 the Company began construction of a permanent onshore receiving terminal for distribution of natural gas from the Mari-B field to purchasers. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2006. At December 31, 2005, the Company held 123,552 gross developed acres and 292,572 gross undeveloped acres located about 20 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 5,000 feet.

Block 30 (non-operated) covers approximately four million acres with two-thirds of the block in water depth greater than 600 feet. A seismic program is currently underway. Noble Energy and its partners plan to drill the first exploration well offshore Suriname during 2007.
Production, Price and Cost Data - Production, price and cost data for continuing operations are as follows:
(1)Natural gas in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant through 2026 and to an LPG plant. Sales from the Alba field to these plants are based on a BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. Both of these plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the crude oil information. (2)Other International gas production includes Ecuador and Argentina. Although Ecuador natural gas sales volumes are included in Other International production, they are excluded from average natural gas sales prices. The natural gas-to-power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by Noble Energy and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated. Natural gas production volumes associated with the gas-to-power project were 8,320 MMcf for 2005, 7,640 MMcf for 2004, and 7,842 MMcf for 2003. Other International oil production includes China and Argentina. (3)Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. LPG volumes were 2,328 Bopd, 706 Bopd, and 701 Bopd for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. (4)Average natural gas sales prices for the U.S. reflect reductions of $0.77 per Mcf (2005), $0.08 per Mcf (2004) and $0.44 per Mcf (2003) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for the U.S. reflect reductions of $8.03 per Bbl (2005), $3.05 per Bbl (2004) and $1.01 per Bbl (2003) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for Equatorial Guinea reflect a reduction of $9.93 (2005) from hedging activities. (5)Average production costs include lease operating expense, workover expense, production and ad valorem taxes, and transportation expense.
Productive Wells - The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which Noble Energy held an interest as of December 31, 2005 follows:
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. One or more completions in the same borehole are counted as one well in this table.
The following table summarizes multiple completions and non-producing wells as of December 31, 2005. Included in non-producing wells are productive wells awaiting additional action, pipeline connections or shut-in for various reasons.
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage - The developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) that Noble Energy held at December 31, 2005 is as follows:
(1)The North Sea includes acreage in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway. (2)If production is not established, approximately 220,758 gross acres (129,787 net acres), 233,949 gross acres (142,453 net acres), and 285,545 gross acres (152,548 net acres) will expire during 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Developed acreage is acreage spaced or assignable to productive wells. A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Undeveloped acreage is
considered to be those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Included within undeveloped acreage are those leased acres (held by production under the terms of a lease) that are not within the spacing unit containing, or acreage assigned to, the productive well so holding such lease.
Drilling Activity - The following table shows the results of crude oil and natural gas wells drilled for each of the last three fiscal years:
A productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a dry hole. A dry hole is an exploratory or development well determined to be incapable of producing either crude oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir. A development well, for purposes of the table above and as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, to the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.
At December 31, 2005, Noble Energy was drilling 88 gross (67.3 net) development wells and 5 gross (2.5 net) exploration wells. These wells are located onshore in Argentina and North America (Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas) and offshore Gulf of
Mexico. The drilling cost to Noble Energy of these wells will be approximately $86.2 million if all are dry and approximately $119.7 million if all are completed as producing wells.
Title to Properties
Noble Energy believes that its title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that are not so material as to detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company's operations. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.
