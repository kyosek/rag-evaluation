Item 2. Properties
Our producing fields are located in federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7,300 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, with high initial production rates relative to other domestic reservoirs. At December 31, 2019, the following two areas of operations accounted for approximately 67% our proved reserves determined using quantities of proved net reserves on an energy equivalent basis. “Shelf” refers to acreage under 500 feet of water. The following table provides information for these fields:
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Our Fields
On December 31, 2019, we had two areas of operations of major significance, which we define as having year-end proved reserves of 10% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on an energy equivalent basis. These areas are the Mobile Bay Properties, which are offshore Alabama but also include the associated gas treatment plant located onshore in Alabama, and the Ship Shoal 349 field (Mahogany) located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Unless indicated otherwise, “drilling” or “drilled” in the descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth, as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SEC’s definition for completion. Following are descriptions of these areas of operations:
Mobile Bay Properties
The recently acquired Mobile Bay Properties consist of interests located off the coast of Alabama, in state coastal and federal Gulf of Mexico waters approximately 70 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. The field area includes 16 Alabama state water lease blocks and four Federal OCS lease blocks. These properties include seven major platforms and 27 flowing wells, in up to 50 feet of water. Exxon first discovered Norphlet gas play in 1978 with the first gas production from the Mary Ann Field in 1988. We acquired varied operated working interests ranging from 25% to 100% in nine producing fields from Exxon effective January 1, 2019, and we became the operator of the fields in December 2019. Cumulative field production through 2019 is approximately 576.6 MMBoe gross. The Mobile Bay Properties produce from the Jurassic age Norphlet eolian sandstone at an average depth of 21,000’ total vertical depth. As of December 31, 2019, 56 Norphlet wells have been drilled on the Mobile Bay Properties, 45 wells were successful and 27 wells are currently producing.
We acquired the Mobile Bay Properties at the end of August 2019 and included the results of operations effective September 1, 2019 within our Consolidated Results of Operations. During September 2019 to December 2019, transitioning activities occurred to transfer operatorship of the Mobile Bay Properties from Exxon to W&T. Given the limited history and the change in operatorship, production volumes, realized prices received and production costs are omitted.
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany)
Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana. The field area covers Ship Shoal federal OCS blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349 in 375 feet of water. Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation (“Apache”) and we now own a 100% working interest in this field except for an interest in one well owned in the Joint Venture Drilling Program. Cumulative field production through 2019 is approximately 53.2 MMBoe gross. This field is a sub-salt development with nine productive horizons below salt at depths up to 18,000 feet. As of December 31, 2019, 31 wells have been drilled and 26 were successful. Since acquiring an interest and subsequently taking over as operator, we have directly participated in drilling 17 wells with a 100% success rate. During 2018, one well was completed which had been drilled to target depth during 2017, and in addition, two wells were drilled and completed during 2018. During 2019, one well was drilled, completed and producing in 2019, and significant workover activities were done to increase production.
The following table presents our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes (net to our interests) from the Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three years:
(1)
Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs.
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet of gas equivalent
Proved Reserves
Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant, and amounts provided in this Form 10-K are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 are summarized below and the mix by product was 24% oil, 16% NGLs and 60% natural gas determined using the energy-equivalent ratio noted below:
Volume measurements:
MMBbls - million barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
Bcf - billion cubic feet
MMBoe - million barrels of oil equivalent
Bcfe - billion cubic feet of gas equivalent
(1)
In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2019. Applying this methodology, the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") average spot price of $55.85 per barrel and the Henry Hub natural gas average spot price of $2.578 per million British Thermal Unit were utilized as the referenced price and after adjusting for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials, the average realized prices were $58.11 per barrel for oil, $18.72 per barrel for NGLs and $2.63 per Mcf for natural gas. In determining the estimated realized price for NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the crude oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the crude oil price using SEC guidance. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2)
Energy equivalents are determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly.
(3)
We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. We have also included PV-10 after ARO below. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP; therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10, or PV-10 after ARO, of our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown above represent a current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2019 were 157.4 MMBoe compared to 84.0 MMBoe at December 31, 2018, representing an overall increase of 73.4 MMBoe. Increases from acquisitions were 90.1 MMBoe, primarily from the Mobile Bay Properties; extensions and discoveries were 1.1 MMBoe; and positive technical revisions (including increased well performance) were 7.0 MMBoe. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases due to lower commodity prices of 10.0 MMBoe and production of 14.8 MMBoe. See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2019. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 20 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our estimates of proved reserves, PV-10 and the standardized measure as of December 31, 2019 are calculated based upon SEC mandated 2019 unweighted average first-day-of-the-month crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices, and adjusting for quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional price differentials, which may or may not represent current prices. If prices fall below the 2019 levels, absent significant proved reserve additions, this may reduce future estimated proved reserve volumes due to lower economic limits and economic return thresholds for undeveloped reserves, as well as impact our results of operations, cash flows, quarterly full cost impairment ceiling tests and volume-dependent depletion cost calculations. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2019 included in this Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultants, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2013 and has over 14 years of prior industry experience. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Director of Reservoir Engineering has over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience and has managed the preparation of public company reserve estimates the last 16 years. He joined the Company in 2016 after spending the preceding 12 years as Director of Corporate Engineering for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. He has also served in various engineering and strategic planning roles with both Kerr-McGee and with Conoco, Inc. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University in 1989 and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Houston in 1999.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
●
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
●
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
●
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and
●
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. We convert barrels to Mcfe using an energy-equivalent ratio of six Mcf to one barrel of oil, condensate or NGLs. This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our PUDs were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant. Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31, 2019 were estimated at $242.0 million.
The following table presents changes in our PUDs (in MMBoe):
The following table presents our estimates as to the timing of converting our PUDs to proved developed reserves:
Activity related to PUDs in 2019:
●
Successfully drilled and converted two locations and 0.5 MMBoe from PUD to proved developed with total capital expenditures of $27.1 million during 2019.
●
Net PUD revisions of 7.1 MMBoe were primarily at our Ship Shoal 028 and our Mahogany fields.
Activity related to PUDs in 2018:
●
Successfully drilled and converted three locations and 5.0 MMBoe from PUD to proved developed with total capital expenditures of $24.5 million during 2018.
●
Added eight PUD locations and 11.3 MMBoe primarily at our Ship Shoal 028 and our Mahogany fields.
●
Conveyance of a portion of the working interest in properties which included 3.5 MMBoe of PUDs to the Joint Venture Drilling Program, as described in more detail in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.
We believe that we will be able to develop all but 2.5 MMBoe (approximately 11%) of the total 23.6 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31, 2019, within five years from the date such PUDs were initially recorded. The lone exceptions are at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field ("Matterhorn") and Viosca Knoll 823 ("Virgo") deepwater fields where future development drilling has been planned as sidetracks of existing wellbores due to conductor slot limitations and rig availability. Two sidetrack PUD locations, one each at Matterhorn and Virgo, will be delayed until an existing well is depleted and available to sidetrack. We also plan to recomplete and convert an existing producer at Matterhorn to water injection for improved recovery following depletion of existing well. Based on the latest reserve report, these PUD locations are expected to be developed in 2021 and 2022.
Acreage
The following table summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2019. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water:
Approximately 69% of our net acreage is held by production. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
Regarding the undeveloped leasehold, 1,152 net acres (1%) of the total 169,170 net undeveloped acres could expire in 2020; 5,760 net acres (3%) could expire in 2021; 7,210 net acres (4%) could expire in 2022; 66,936 net acres (40%) could expire in 2023; and 88,112 net acres (52%) could expire in 2024 and beyond. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2020 and beyond, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net acreage increased 153,120 net acres (39%) from December 31, 2018 due to acquisitions and lease purchases, partially offset by sales, lease expirations and relinquishments.
Production
For the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net daily production averaged 40,634 Boe, 36,510 Boe and 39,921 Boe, respectively. Production increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of the Mobile Bay Properties, increases at Mahogany from drilling and workovers, and wells coming online at other fields, partially offset by natural production declines. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three years:
Volume measurements:
MBbls - thousand barrels for crude oil, condensate or NGLs
MMcf - million cubic feet
MBoe - thousand barrels of oil equivalent
MMcfe - million cubic feet equivalent
See Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 in this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data, including average realized sale prices and production costs.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2019 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well represents our fractional working interest of a gross well in which we own less than all of the working interest:
(1)
Includes seven gross (6.0 net) oil wells with multiple completions.
(2)
Includes three gross (2.5 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
The table below is based on the SEC’s criteria of completion or abandonment to determine wells drilled.
Development and Exploration Drilling
The following table summarizes our development and exploration offshore wells completed over the past three years:
Our success rates related to our development and exploration wells drilled was 100% in both 2019 and 2018, with all wells drilled being productive and none were non-commercial (dry holes). In 2017, we drilled one sub-sea well which had not been completed as of the filing date of this Form 10-K as we are evaluating various options on this well. As such, we have not reflected the well in the table above. Of the remaining wells in our 2017 drilling program, 80% of the wells drilled were productive and we had one exploration well drilled during 2017 that was deemed to be non-commercial and therefore not completed, of which we had a 39% working interest.
Recent Drilling Activity
During 2019, the following wells were completed: the Virgo A-13 exploration well; the South Timbalier 320 A-3 development well; the Mississippi Canyon 800 ("Gladden") SS002 exploration well; the Ship Shoal 028 041 development well; the East Cameron 321 B-8 ST1 development well; and the Mahogany A-6 ST1 development well. All of these wells are in the Joint Venture Drilling Program except for the Mahogany A-6 ST1 well. During the first two months of 2020, there was one well in the process of drilling, which is in the Joint Venture Drilling Program.
Capital Expenditures
