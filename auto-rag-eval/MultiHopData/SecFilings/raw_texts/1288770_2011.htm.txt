Description of Properties
Each of our mineral exploration projects; namely our Kibi Project, our Kwabeng, Project, our Pameng Project, our Banso Project and our Muoso Project are currently at an early stage of evaluation. As at the date of this Report, no mineralized material or mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates have been made at any of our Projects. As of the date of this Report, except for the 2012 Drill Program at our Kibi Project located on the Kibi Gold Belt, and the Buccaneeer Drill Program being carried out by Buccaneer, there are no exploration activities currently being conducted on our other Projects or have any such activities been planned for the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date. Prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year covered by this Report, we had completed preliminary lode gold exploration programs at our Kibi, Banso and Muoso Projects and their respective results are noted hereunder.
Three concessions totaling 118.92 sq km; namely our Kibi Project, which is located to the south of our Kwabeng and Pameng Projects, and our Kwabeng Project and our Pameng Project, are contiguous to our Banso and Muoso Projects.
Title to Properties
We hold 30-year mining leases expiring on July 26, 2019 on our Kwabeng and Pameng Concessions (see “Kwabeng Project - Kwabeng Mining Lease” and “Pameng Project - Pameng Mining Lease”), a 7-year mining lease on our Apapam Concession expiring on December 17, 2015 (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease”), a 14-year mining lease on our Banso Concession (see “Banso Project - Banso Mining Lease” and a 13-year mining lease on our Muoso Concession (see “Muoso Project - Muoso Mining Lease”).
Recovery of Placer Gold
In 2007 and 2008, we recovered and sold placer gold from our Kwabeng Project. We did not recover any placer gold during 2009. In July 2010, we entered into (a) agreements with independent Ghanaian contract miners to recover placer gold and produce the mineralized material from our Kibi and Pameng Projects; (b) an agreement with Ravenclaw Mining Limited (“Ravenclaw”), a Swiss company, to assist in overseeing the contract miners to (i) limit our involvement in the recovery of placer gold operations; and (ii) enable our company to focus on lode gold exploration activities. Our General Manager of XG Mining received compensation from Ravenclaw for assisting Ravenclaw in fulfilling its contract with our company (see Item 11 - Executive Compensation - Summary Compensation Table and Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Consulting Agreement with Principal Shareholder” for further details.
VTEM Survey
In 2011, an airborne Versatile Time-domain Electromagnetic (“VTEM”), Magnetic and Radiometric survey (the “VTEM Survey”) was completed by our company on our Projects located in the Kibi Gold Belt and encompassed approximately 4,000 line-kilometers at 200 m line spacing, with approximately 490 line-kilometers of detail 100 m line spacing coverage over our core Kibi Project mining lease area. The VTEM system is renowned for its superior penetration depth of greater than 400 m, low base frequency for enhanced penetration in conductive ground cover and high spatial resolution which permits the spotting of drill targets directly off the airborne anomalies. The primary purpose of the VTEM Survey was to delineate auriferous graphitic or sulphidic shears but resistivity-depth data may also help further define and/or identify the granitoid bodies hosting the Kibi Project mineralization In addition to helping map lithological contacts, including the gold prospective granitoid bodies, the aeromagnetic survey will permit the detection of low-magnetic domains possibly reflecting demagnetization resulting from intense gold-related hydrothermal alteration. The radiometric survey may also help further define and/or identify the gold-hosting granitoid bodies.
The VTEM data was incorporated into the geological compilation following our receipt of the final survey interpretation data from Geotech (see “Description of Properties - Interpretation Report of VTEM Survey” for further details). This integrated survey, in combination with previous soil geochemistry and reconnaissance geology surveys will help further further delineate known gold occurrences outside Zone 2 of the Kibi Project, and evaluate the remainder of the Apapam Mining Lease area for the hosting of granitoid-hosted and Ashanti style shear zone gold mineralization. Similarly the VTEM survey will help further define the extent and regional controls of the gold-bearing structures discovered to date by scout trenching on the Ankaase Gold Trend, located on the Muoso Concession, and Banso Area No. 3 gold-in-soil anomalies; with the objective of guiding follow-up trenching designed to outline high priority, cost effective drill targets.

Technical Reports
Interpretation Report of VTEM Survey
In August 2011, Geotech provided our company with a report setting forth its interpretation of approximately 4,027 line km of electromagnetic (“EM”), magnetic and radiometric data for gold exploration in our Kibi Project area.
The airborne geophysical datasets display a complex signals largely dominated by NE-SW to NNE-SSW structures that are interpreted as shear zones and graphitic sediments. Metasediments, metavolcanics and granitoids units have been delineated from their geophysical (magnetic, electromagnetic and radiometric) characteristics. The EM anomaly picks show elongated patterns of conductors located in NE-SW to NNE-SSW trending areas interpreted as graphitic layers within the interpreted shear zone and graphitic sediments.
The available geological and geophysical data was interpreted in terms of gold potential within the area of interest. The geophysical interpretation used the genetic model for stockworks/silicification gold emplacement and the genetic model of granitoid gold emplacement. A total of 38 targets were delineated and ranked according to a priority level for ground follow-up. Geotech suggested that these targets should be further investigated in the field using geology and geochemistry prior to planning for a drilling program.
Modified Gold Deportment Study
In October 2011, SGS provided our company with a mineralogical report relating to mineralogical test work consisting of a modified gold deportment study (the “Study”) aimed at characterizing the gold, in two samples, in order to recommend a process route to maximize gold recoveries. Approximately 10 kilograms (“kg”) of sample G478923 sulphide material (drill core) and 10 kg of composite oxide (saprolite) material were utilized for the test work. The composite oxide sample was created by SGS from trench samples that were crushed and combined. The mineralogical test work included metallurgical and mineralogical tests. The mineralogical test work was done in conjunction with gravity test work conducted by the Metallurgical Section of SGS South Africa. Among other things, the report outlined the methodology as to how the different tests were conducted, the results of the test work, conclusions and recommendations.
The objective of the Study was to gain an understanding of the nature and mode of occurrence of the gold in each sample. The Study included the following:
test work to determine the amenability of the ore to gravity recovery;
gold distribution across size fractions (grading analysis);
heavy liquid separation to determine the amount of free gold or gold in heavy particles such as sulphides;
exposure and mineral association analysis of the particulate gold grains in the gravity concentrate;
chemical composition of the ore and metallurgical test products;
general mineralogical characterization of the ore;
identification and quantification of gold minerals including native gold, gold-tellurides, etc. in the gravity concentrates;
grain size distribution of the gold grains in the gravity concentrate;
test work to determine the gold recovery by direct cyanidation; and
diagnostic leach analysis of the gravity tailings in order to determine the gold deportment in the gravity tails.
SGS made the following preliminary gold recovery conclusions in their report:
The gold in the G478923 gold ore samples (3.49 g/t Au) is highly amenable to cyanidation leaching with ~97% recoverable by means of direct cyanidation. This ore is also amenable to gravity upgrading, with ~67% of the gold recovered at a mass pull of ~3%. In the gravity concentrate (97.5 g/t Au), a total of 143 particulate gold grains were observed in the gravity concentrate of this sample.
The grading analysis on the G478923 gold ore sample indicated a very high upgrading of gold in the +106µm size fraction (~69%). This indicates that the gold is either large gold grains or locked in large gold-bearing particles. From the liberation and mineral association characteristics determined by QEMSCAN, on the gravity concentrate, the gold was found to be ~63% liberated and ~25% was associated with pyrite. This indicates that the gold is either large, liberated gold grains or locked in large gold-bearing pyrite particles.
- 19 -
The direct cyanidation and diagnostic leach indicates that the sample is highly amenable to cyanide leaching, with ~97% of the gold recovered from the head sample at a grind of 80%-75µm by direct cyanidation and ~96% for the gravity tailings at a grind of~50%-75µm. This is corroborated by the exposure and the mineral association characteristics as determined by QEMSCAN analysis of the gravity concentrate. Approximately 90% of the particulate gold grains are ≥10% exposed and should be leachable.
The gold in the composite gold ore sample (7.28 g/t Au) is also highly amenable to cyanidation, with ~97% of the gold recoverable by means of direct cyanidation. The ore is also amenable to gravity upgrading, to some degree, with only ~56% of the gold recovered at a mass pull of ~3%. In the gravity concentrate (134.83 g/t Au) a total of 125 particulate gold grains were observed by QEMSCAN.
The grading analysis on the composite gold ore sample indicated a very high upgrading of gold in the +106µm size fraction (~74%). This indicates that the gold is either large gold grains or locked in large gold-bearing particles. From the liberation and mineral association characteristics determined by QEMSCAN analysis of the gravity tailings, it was found that the gold grains were moderately liberated (~76%) and that ~10% was occurring in silicates and ~14% in oxides. This indicates that the gold is either large, liberated gold grains or locked in large gold-bearing silicate/oxide particles.
The direct cyanidation and diagnostic leach tests indicated that the sample is highly amenable to cyanide leaching, with ~98% of the gold recovered from the head sample at a grind of 80%-75µm and ~99% of the gold in the gravity tailings at a grind of 50%-75µm. This is corroborated by the exposure and mineral association characteristics of particulate gold in the gravity concentrate, as determined by QEMSCAN analysis. Approximately ~96% of the gold grains are ≥10% exposed and should be leachable.
The most simplistic processing option would be to mill the ore to ~80%-75µm followed by Carbon-in-leach (“CIL”) cyanidation. Another option, which may result in somewhat lower operational cost is to mill the ore relatively coarsely (say 80%-106µm) followed by gravity concentration and intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate. The gravity tailings could then be milled finer to ~80%-75 µm, followed by CIL. Taking out the coarse gold and some of the sulphides by gravity, will allow shorter retention times in the leach tanks and possibly even lower cyanide consumption.
Report on Structural Geological Investigations of Zone 2, Kibi Project
In November 2011, SRK provided our company with a report of their structural geological investigations of Zone 2 (Big Bend Zone, South Zone and other zones including the Mushroom Zone) on our Kibi Project.
Objectives and Overview
to review geological mapping to date and to provide on ground structural geological guidance; and
to conduct structural geological investigations of key exposures and drill core at Zone 2 with a focus on understanding:
- the 3D geometry of diorite dykes;
- structural controls on the distribution of gold mineralization (including ore plunge); and
- kinematics of shear/fault zones and their influence on the distribution of gold mineralization.
SRK Conclusions
The distribution of gold mineralization in the Big Bend Zone is controlled by two NNE-trending shear zones that bound the auriferous zone in a quartz diorite.
Auriferous quartz veins in the Big Bend Zone comprise:
- shear and extensional veins related to the development of NNE-trending shear zones; and
- stockwork veins in a particular portion of the quartz diorite.
- 20 -
Vein geometry, rare kinematic indicators and steeply plunging mineral lineation imply that deformation associated with gold mineralization in the Big Bend Zone resulted from a protracted episode of reverse SE over NW movement.
The controls on gold mineralization at the South Zone and other zones are not well understood and require further oriented core drilling followed by structural geology investigations.
SRK Recommendations
Big Bend Zone
complete infill drilling at the Big Bend Zone to confirm gold grade continuity in preparation for resource estimation;
conduct detailed petrography studies to identify compositional variations in the quartz diorite and verify their potential control on the distribution of gold mineralization;
include structural contours of auriferous diorite contacts on geological maps to investigate the relationship between the geometry of the auriferous portion of the diorite body and the distribution of gold mineralization; and
define the continuation of (auriferous) shear zones to the north and south of the Big Bend diorite.
South Zone and Other Zones (including the Mashroom Zone)
undertake further oriented core drilling to verify the extent and potential presence of shear zones at the South Zone (drill orientations to SW and SE); and
determine the shear zone kinematics and controls on gold distribution.
Regional Structural Geology Interpretation of the Aeromagnetic Data from the VTEM Survey
In December 2011, SRK provided our company with a report of their structural geological interpretation of aeromagnetic data covering our Kibi Gold Belt mining concessions to assist in understanding the structural setting of gold mineralization in the area and to provide a practical structural framework for future exploration targeting. The defined area of interest (“AOI”) is ~705 km2 in area and is located at the northern extremity of the Kibi Gold Belt. The AOI was based on the extent of the VTEM Survey conducted by Geotech. The SRK report documents the methodology, results, conclusion and recommendations from the structural geological interpretation.
The scope of work included a desktop structural interpretation of the airborne geophysical data we acquired over the AOI. On the basis of available airborne geophysical data, SRK constructed form lines outlining the internal geometry of stratigraphy within our AOI. In general, form lines within our AOI display a strong southwest-northeast trend, parallel to the tectonic grain in the known greenstone belts of Ghana. Variations from this trend occur in a north-west-southeast-trending belt along the lower portion of our AOI.
SRK Conclusions
A fault network was interpreted and subdivided in terms of age. The fault network comprises dominant southwest- northeast-trending faults, subparallel to the dominant trend observed in the form lines that include early reactivated DE extensional faults. These faults are interpreted to have developed (or reactivated) during the Eburnean Orogeny (D2 -D5) and are believed to be closely linked to gold mineralization.
Two types of instrusions (belt and basin type granitoids) were identified in our AOI, both of which were emplaced prior to the culmination of the Eburnean Orogeny (D5) and therefore are overprinted by D5 deformation.
A late (D6) fault set is represented by east-west-rending faults that are linked by minor northwest-southeast-trending faults. These are characterized by narrow, linear breaks in the magnetic data often with little to no visible offset in the magnetic stratigraphy. These late faults are interpreted to have resulted from northeast-southwest compression that may have occurred at the final stages of the Eburnean Orogeny or post-dated the Eburnean Orogeny.
Several areas of structural complexity were identified within our AOI, including left and right-hand steps along the major fault corridors, intersections between D2 -D5 faults and intersections between D2 -D5 and D5 faults, particularly in the vicinity of intrusions.
- 21 -
SRK Recommendations
Regional ground-truthing of the regional structural interpretation should be conducted. This should aim to not only identify whether a given fault is present, but also characterize each fault in terms of:
- fault products (including the brittle/brittle-ductile/ductile nature of the fault);
- orientation of associated foliations and lineations if present;
- kinematics; and
- alteration or gold mineralization present.
A confidence rating should be compiled for each interpreted fault identified as part of this interpretation. This may include using existing geological mapping, satellite imagery, other geophysical datasets, or ground-truthing to produce a confidence rating based on the number of datasets, a given fault is identified in, or based on the resolution of datasets a given interpreted fault is based on.
Regional ground-truthing of the regional lithological interpretation should be conducted. This should focus on the location of the boundary between the basin and belt assemblages, as well as better defining the internal variation within both these assemblages, including their known relationships with gold mineralization.
Conduct a regional geochemical survey to verify the validity of identified target areas and conduct close-spaced soil geochemical sampling to guide exploration drilling in areas of positive results.
Kibi Project
Overview
Our Kibi Project (also referred to as the “Apapam Concession”) is comprised of 33.65 sq km and our company’s interest in the Apapam Concession is secured by the Apapam Mining Lease (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease” for further details). Our Kibi Project is our company’s flagship project and is the only material project of our company.
Our Kibi Project land position also encompasses two land staking applications: (i) a reconnaissance license contiguous to the southwest extremity of our Kibi Project covering an area of 7.0 sq km (700 ha) (the “Akim Apapam Concession”); and, (ii) a ground extension along the northwest boundary of the Kibi Project covering an area of 1.42 sq km (142 ha) (the “Apapam Concession Extension”). The Akim Apapam Concession was made to provide a buffer area. The Akim Apapam Concession was covered by a first pass (200m x 25m) soil geochemistry survey in 2011; with the results still being compiled as at the date of this Report. There is no current knowledge of past exploration activity or lode gold occurrences on this ground. The Apapam Concession Extension was made to cover certain trench and drill gold intercepts. The applications for the Akim Apapam Concession and the Apapam Concession Extension were submitted by the Company to Mincom on January 15, 2008 and, as at the date of this Report, approval of these applications is still pending and there is no assurance that either of them will be granted.
The Apapam Concession contains two (2) small scale mining (“SSM”) licenses, comprising approximately 0.1012 sq km (10.12 ha) located within the northwest portion of the concession which were granted to third parties prior to our company’s application for the Apapam Concession. None of the in situ, lode gold mineralization occurrences, described in an independent 43-101 technical report prepared by SEMS in 2010, are located within and/or proximal to these third party SSM licenses, and there is no current knowledge of any lode gold occurrences being present on these parcels. No information is available on past and/or current alluvial gold mining activity on these SSM licenses (see “NI 43-101 Reports” hereunder).
Location and Access
Our Kibi Project lies within the Kibi-Winneba area in the Eastern Region of Ghana and is located on the eastern flank of the Atewa Range along the headwaters of the Birim River in the immediate vicinity of the district capital of Kibi, approximately 75 km NNW of the nation’s capital city of Accra. Access to our Kibi Project is by driving northwest from Accra on the paved Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road which is the main national highway for approximately 90 km until the town of Kibi, marked by a road sign, is reached. One would make a left hand turn at the Kibi sign and drive southwest for approximately 5 km to arrive at our Apapam concession. A tarred road emanating from the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road approximately 15 km northeast of Kibi dissects the north-central and south-eastern portions of our concession, while the tarred road servicing the town of Apapam provides access to the concession’s south-western extremity. Our Kibi Project is located approximately 20 km south-southeast from our Field Camp.
- 22 -
The Kibi-Winneba area is characterized by a narrow sequence of Birimian metavolcanics underlying most of the Atewa Range, which is covered by an extensive laterite/bauxite capping, and surrounded by a thick package of Birimian metasediments dominating the flanks and the lower lying areas. Our Kibi Project covers the Birimian volcanic-sediment contact which we believe represents a highly favorable environment for the hosting of lode gold deposits throughout Ghana.
Historic Work
Prior to the exploration work conducted by our company as noted hereunder, very little systematic exploration work for bedrock gold deposits has been conducted in the Kibi area since the 1930s.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
General
All gold results for the following exploration programs are reported in “ppm Au” (part per million gold). The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for any exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
Phase I Drill Program
The Phase I Drill Program carried out on our Kibi Project from 2008 to 2009 encompassed 18 diamond drill holes (NQ2 core), ranging from 60 m to 320.5 m in length, and totaling 3,001 linear meters. This reconnaissance drilling was designed to test the depth continuity of gold mineralization discovered in trenches excavated on Zone 2 and Zone 1 of our Kibi Project; an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four (4) extensive, higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area. The Phase I Drill Program was implemented from August 30 to October 28, 2008 by Burwash Drilling of Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada.
This initial reconnaissance drilling program yielded very encouraging results and demonstrated that the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization occurrences intersected along the Kibi gold-in-soil trend offers potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth.
The first 15 holes of the Phase II Drill Program targeted gold mineralization discovered in four (4) trenches, TKB005, TKB004, TKB006, and TKB009-010, spread out over an approximately 975 m E-W distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Thirteen (13) out of the 15 holes on Zone 2 yielded significant gold intercepts, including 10 holes intersecting significant granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over 7 m to 45 m core lengths. Significant gold intercepts are presented in Table 4 below. The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining, and disseminated sulphides. Mineralization discovered by trenching and/or drilling on Zone 2 and Zone 3 appears to be hosted by swarms of granitoid bodies, ranging from 5.5 m to 79 m in core length, interpreted to be emplaced along splay structures off an inferred NE-trending regional structure.
Limited drilling to date traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over a 200 m strike length and to a vertical depth of 100 m at the Trench TKB004 Zone, including gold intercepts of: 2.11 ppm gold over 25.4 m; 0.87 ppm gold over 15 m and 1.28 ppm gold over 33 m; 2.24 ppm gold over 16 m; and 2.78 ppm gold over 15 m in holes KBD08012, KBD08013, KBD08014, and KBD08015, respectively. Similarly, mineralization at the Trench TKB005 Zone was traced over an approximately 135 m strike length and to a vertical depth of 76 m in holes KBD08003 and KBD08004 and KBD08010 and KBD08011, including significant intercepts of 8.49 ppm gold over 12 m and 4.83 ppm gold over 7 m in holes KBD08004 and KBD08010, respectively.
Limited Zone 1 scout drilling (3 holes) intersected a typical “Ashanti” style shear zone setting developed proximal to a metavolcanic-metasediment contact with a spatially associated granitoid body. Hole KBD08017 yielded intermittent, exploration significant, anomalous gold values over a 60 m core length, including encouraging intercepts of 1.43 ppm gold over 13.5 m, 1.04 ppm gold over 6 m, and 1.02 ppm gold over 8 m. In addition, Trench TKB012 excavated on a gold-in-soil anomaly, located approximately 100 m west of hole KBD08017, returned a channel sample intercept of 2.51 ppm gold over a 4 m trench length.
- 23 -
Recommended work to further advance our Project includes: (a) additional mechanical trenching to further define the geological / structural nature and extent of the granitoid-host gold mineralization in Zone 2 and 3; and (b) a 5,000 m combined reverse circulation / diamond drilling program. The estimated cost of the follow-up exploration program is approximately $800,000.

Phase II Drill Program
The Phase II drill program (the “Phase II Drill Program”) on our Kibi Project encompassed 50 RC holes, ranging from 40 m to 150 m in length, and totalling 4,715 linear meters including 27 holes for 2,478 m on Zone 2 and 23 holes totaling 2,237 m on Zone 3. Fifteen initial RC holes targeted the Trench TKB005 and Trench TKB004 gold zones located at the southeast extremity of Zone 2 of the Kibi Gold Trend; an over 5.5 km long, northeast trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four extensive higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75 to 300 m to 1,000 m by 100 to 500 m in area. The Phase II Drill Program was designed to: (i) test the dip and strike extensions of the four gold target zones identified in Zone 2 during the Phase I Drill Program; (ii) assess the depth continuity of gold mineralization discovered in trenches excavated in Zone 3, an approximately 1,000 m by 100 to 500 m gold-in-soil anomaly located approximately 700 m southwest of the Zone 2 drilling conducted under the Phase I Drill Program in 2008; and (iii) test IP / Resistivity anomalies spatially associated with the Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The Phase II Drill Program was designed to build upon the 2008 Phase I diamond drill results and to continue to demonstrate that the widespread, classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization developed along our Kibi Project offers potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth. The Phase II Drill Program was implemented from July 14, 2009 to September 26, 2009 by BLY Ghana Ltd., a subsidiary of Boart Longyear.
Drilling Results from Trenches TKB005 and TKB004 Zones (15 Holes) - Zone 2 - Kibi Project
Eleven out of the initial 15 of the 27 RC holes on Zone 2 yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from one m to 78 m in core length. Mineralization identified by trenching and drilling on Zone 2 appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence. Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides. Significant gold intercepts for the Trench TKB005 and TKB004 zones are set forth in Table 3 hereunder.
As at September 28, 2009, gold mineralization at the Trench TKB005 zone has been traced over an approximately 220 m strike length and to a vertical depth of approximately 75 m. Highlights from the present drilling includes intercepts of 6.29 g/t over 23 m, including 8.55 g/t over 10 m, in hole KBRC09047 and 2.97 g/t over 18 m, including 6.32 g/t over 8 M in hole KBRC09042. These two holes tested the central portion of the zone in a scissor pattern designed to better characterize the lithological and structural controls of the gold mineralization intersected in diamond drill holes KBD08003 and KBD08004 from the Phase I drill program. Field and trench mapping indicates that the Trench TKB005 zone mineralization is hosted by a moderate, easterly dipping granitoid body exhibiting an extensive, shallow to moderate, westerly dipping, sheeted quartz vein system. Hole KBD09042 (270° AZ / -50° dip) intersected the host granitoid sill at approximately right angles from a collar position on the eastern (hanging wall) flank of the granitoid body. While hole KBRC09047 (090° Az / -55° dip) was drilled down the dip of the host granitoid sill in order to transect the westerly dipping, sheeted quartz veining at approximately right angles, with the hole remaining within the confines of the host granitoid body to a down hole depth of 23 m.

Drilling Results from Trenches TKB006 and TKB010 Zones (12 Holes) - Zone 2 - Kibi Project
Seven out of the 12 remaining drill holes on Zone 2 were designed to better define gold mineralization at Trench TKB006 and Trench TKB010 zones identified during the initial scout Phase I Drill Program at the northwest extremity of Zone 2 of our Kibi Project; one hole targeted a new gold zone exposed in recent trenching (trenches TKB014E and TKB014F); two holes probed previously untested gold-in-soil anomalies and two holes tested an IP / Resistivity anomaly spatially associated with a gold-in-soil anomaly. In addition, a total of 960 linear meters of mechanized trenching (38 trenches) was also conducted on Zone 2 in conjunction with this drill program to better define the surface trace of the host granitoid bodies, to test strike extension of known mineralization and to test gold-in-soil anomalies and geophysical targets.
Five out of the above-noted seven holes targeting the Trench TKB006, TKB010 and TKB014E-TKB014F zones yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from one meter to 76 m in core length. As at October 28, 2009, mineralization identified by trenching and drilling, spread out over an approximately 975 m east-west distance on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil trend, appears to be hosted by a series of sill-like granitoid bodies hosted within a folded metasediment-metavolcanic rock sequence.
Mineralized material consists of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides.

Drilling highlights include granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut) including 10.0 m grading 33.15 g/t gold uncut (10.95 g/t gold cut) in drill hole KBRC09060 and 76.0 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 20.0 m grading 3.36 g/t gold (and including 5.25 g/t gold over 9.0 m) in hole KBRC09068. Significant gold intercepts for holes KBRC09057 to KBRC09068 are set forth in Table 4 hereunder.

Holes KBRC09057, KBRC09059 to KBRC09061 and KBRC09065 further tested the Trench TKB006 gold zone situated in the north-central portion of the approximately 1,000 m long Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Additional mechanized trenching and geological mapping during this drilling campaign appears to indicate that the Trench TKB006 Zone is characterized by two, NNW-trending, approximately eight (8) m and 40 mwide, sill-like granitoid bodies lying approximately 25 m apart within a metasediment rock sequence. Hole KBRC09060 targeting an extensive system of NE to SE trending quartz veining developed within the wider, eastern granitoid body returned an intercept from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut), including 10.0 m grading 33.15 g/t gold uncut (10.95 g/t gold cut). Drilling, including initial scout drill hole KBD08005, which returned intercepts of 1.18 g/t gold over 17.0 m and 1.02 g/t gold over 15.0 m, has traced the Trench TKB006 gold zone mineralization over an approximately 160 m strike distance.
Hole KBRC09062, designed to undercut gold mineralization discovered by trenching of a previously untested gold-in-soil anomaly lying approximately 225 m west-northwest of the Trench TKB006 zone, yielded a granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercept of 4.03 g/t gold over 4.0 m, including one m grading 9.32 g/t gold. The two target trenches positioned end to end on the same soil geochemical anomaly line both returned significant channel sample intercepts separated by an approximately 20.5 m distance, including 8.49 g/t gold over a 5.0 m trench-length, including 2.0 m grading 14.85 g/t gold, in trench TKB014E and 6.86 g/t gold over an 8.0 m trench-length, including 1.0 m grading 22.4 g/t gold, in trench TKB014F. This new gold zone is considered especially interesting given the values defined at this early stage and the extent of the untested gold-in-soil anomalies present along lines 167N to L169N within the approximately 400 m gap between the Trench TKB006 and TKB010 zones.
Holes KBRC09067 and KBRC09068 further tested the Trench TKB010 gold zone located at the north-western extremity of the approximately 1,000 meter long Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. Hole KBRC09068 targeting an extensive system of NE to NW trending quartz veining exposed in Trench TKB010 returned a granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercept from surface of 76.0 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 20.0 m grading 3.36 g/t gold (and including 5.25 g/t gold over 9.0 m). Drilling and trenching to date, including initial scout drill hole KBD08008, which returned an intercept of 1.01 g/t gold over 45.0 m (including 2.01 g/t gold over 12.0 m), have traced the Trench TKB010 gold zone mineralization over an approximately 150 meter distance along the inner, northern margin of an east to southeast trending granitoid body.
Results from 23 Scout RC Holes - Zone 3-- Kibi Project
Drilling highlights for Zone 3 include granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 30.0 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 14.0 m grading 6.47 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 8.0 m in hole KBRC09019; 4.0 m grading 4.86 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 26 m in hole KBRC09023 and 8.0 m grading 4.95 g/t gold, including 3.0 m grading 12.89 g/t gold, from surface in hole KBRC09024. Significant gold intercepts for holes KBRC09019 to KBRC09041 are set forth in Table 5 hereunder.
Similarly to Zone 2, all Zone 3 mineralization targets are near surface, remain open in all directions and offer potential for shallow oxide mineralization amenable to bulk mining and heap leaching, as well as large primary gold systems at depth. The limited scout drilling returned several significant gold intercepts over an approximately 825.0 m E-W distance across Zone 3. Zone 2 and Zone 3 drilling has traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over an approximately 2,100 m distance along the NE-trending Kibi Gold Trend.
This initial Zone 3 scout drilling formed part of the 4,715 meter Phase II RC Drill Program which included 27 holes for 2,478 m on Zone 2 and 23 holes totaling 2,237 m on Zone 3; an over 5.5 km long, NE-trending, anomalous gold-in-soil trend characterized by four extensive higher grade zones ranging from approximately 800 m by 75-300 m to 1,000 m by 100-500 m in area. The present drilling was designed to undercut surface gold mineralization exposed in reconnaissance trenches, and to test geophysical Induced Polarization (“IP”) / Resistivity and/or gold-in-soil anomalies on Zone 3; an approximately 1,000 m by 100-500 m, gold-in-soil anomaly located approximately 700 m to the southwest of the main Zone 2 drilling area.

As at February 11, 2010, drilling included five holes to test the Trench TAD019 and TAD007 targets located at the southeastern extremity of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly, and 18 holes to assess the Trench TAD001 - TAD004, TAD015 - TAD021 and TAD016 targets within the north-central portion of the gold-in-soil anomaly. Fourteen out of the 23 scout holes returned significant gold intercepts, with an additional three holes yielding anomalous gold intercepts. (see QA-QC disclosure section for “Significant” and “Anomalous” intercept criteria). All mineralized intercepts consisted of granitoid-hosted and/or granitoid-associated gold mineralization, with mineralized material typically consisting of altered quartz diorite and tonalite exhibiting quartz-iron carbonate veining and disseminated sulphides.
Hole KBRC09019 targeting an extensive system of granitoid-hosted, NE-trending, moderately NW-dipping, sheeted quartz veins discovered in Trench TAD019 returned a significant mineralized intercept of 30.0 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 14.0 m grading 6.47 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 8.0 m. For reference purposes, Trench TAD019 yielded a channel sample intercept of 4.93 g/t gold over 45.0 m, including 10.12 g/t gold over 12.0 m. Hole KBRC09039, representing the second hole of a scissor drill pattern designed to determine the dip attitude of the host granitoid body, returned an intercept of 39.80 g/t gold over 1.0 m from a quartz vein in mafic metavolcanic rock along the footwall flank of the granitoid body. Hole KBRC09020, targeting a zone of anomalous gold values in Trench TAD007 located approximately 65.0 m to the west of the KBRC09019 collar, yielded granitoid-hosted mineralization intercepts of 1.01 g/t gold over 3.0 m and 4.10 g/t gold over 2.0 m.
A total of 18 holes were drilled within the north-central portion of the Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly which is characterized by an approximately 800 meter long IP Chargeability anomaly exhibiting a spatial relationship with a geophysically inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend. Eleven of these holes tested the north-eastern, Moderate Chargeability / Very High Resistivity portion (200 m) of the IP anomaly exhibiting a coincidental gold-in-soil signature and anomalous trench results (i.e. Trench TAD001 - TAD004 Zone).
The limited, shallow RC drilling outlined an approximately 135.0 meter wide, NE-trending, granitoid hosted, structural corridor appearing to encompass at least five (5) distinct, gold-bearing, sheeted vein zones ranging from 1.0 m to 31.0 m in core length. Eight (8) out of the 11 Trench TAD001 - TAD004 Zone holes returned significant gold intercepts, including seven (7) holes yielding multiple significant and/or anomalous gold intercepts.
- 30 -
The mineralized structural corridor is characterized by significant gold intercepts over 1.0 m to 8.0 m core lengths occurring within more extensive, lower grade, mineralization envelopes attaining 15.0 m to 31.0 m in core length. Holes KBRC09024 and KBRC0937, intersecting what appears to be the same sheeted vein zone approximately 35.0 m horizontally apart within the central section of the structural corridor returned mineralized intercepts of 8.0 m grading 4.95 g/t gold, including 3.0 m grading 12.89 g/t gold, and 28.0 m grading 0.87 g/t gold, respectively. Similarly, holes KBRC09023 and KBRC09038, drilled in a scissor pattern along the northern margin of the structural corridor, yielded 4.0 m grading 4.86 g/t gold and 31.0 m grading 0.57 g/t gold, respectively from intercepts located approximately 8.0 m horizontally apart along the same mineralized structure.
Thirteen out of the 18 holes described above were drilled on open ground along the northern flank of the Apapam Mining Lease (see “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease” for details of this mining lease), with the drill traces extending from approximately 50.0 m to 300.0 m outside the concession boundary, and two (2) additional holes straddle the concession boundary. Following the completion of a professional land survey, the approximately 1.42 sq km wedge of open ground lying between the Apapam Mining Lease and the Atewa Forest Reserve boundary was staked by us to cover the mineralization targets identified by the holes in question. The staking application was formally received by Mincom on November 19, 2009 and is currently being processed, thus securing our priority staking status, however, as at the date of this Report, the application is still pending and there is no absolute assurance that this parcel of ground will be granted to our company. Refer to the Significant Intercept Table above for the claim status of individual Zone 3 drill holes.
NI 43-101 Reports
In July 2010, SEMS prepared an independent technical report consistent with the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, Form 43-101F1 - Technical Report and Companion Policy 43-101 CP on our Kibi Project.
As at the date of this Report, we have commissioned SEMS to prepare an initial NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate on the Big Bend and East Dyke gold zones located within Zone 2 of our Kibi Gold Project. This will constitute the first ever mineral resource estimate generated on a gold project within the underexplored Kibi Gold Belt.
Phase III Drill Program
Based on the results of the 2009 Phase II Drill Program, we commenced and completed our follow-up Phase III Drill Program on our Kibi Project during 2010 to: (i) further test the dip and strike extensions of the gold mineralization zones identified in the Phase I and Phase II drill programs; and (ii) test IP / Resistivity anomalies spatially associated with the Kibi gold-in-soil trend. The Phase III Drill Program was implemented from July 2010 to December 15, 2010 by Burwash Drilling of Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada.
Results of Phase III Drill Program
Drilling highlights from the South Ridge Granitoid of Zone 2 include surface or near surface granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 19.5 m grading 1.52 g/t gold in drill hole #KBDD10085; 25.5 m grading 1.50 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10086 and 23 m grading 1.74 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10090. Hole #KBDD10091 encountered a 17.0 m intersection grading 2.42 g/t gold as noted in the following table. These holes yielded significant gold intercepts, with all mineralized intercepts consisting of granitoid-hosted gold mineralization spanning from 2 m to 72 m in core length. Drilling and trenching traced an extensive system of en echelon extension vein arrays across an approximately 440 m distance along the SE-trending South Ridge Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite to tonalite composition. Additional trenching/drilling is required to further define the extent and strike length of the quartz vein arrays, the structural controls of the mineralization and the contacts of the host granitoid body.

Ongoing diamond drilling has significantly expanded known gold mineralization down dip on the Zone 2 - Central Granitoid at our Kibi Project. Three step-back holes (685 m) successfully expanded the gold mineralization to a down dip depth of up to approximately 115 m. Drilling highlights include classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of 20 m grading 2.43 g/t gold in KBDD10099; 58 m grading 2.46 g/t gold, including 28 m grading 3.67 g/t gold, in KBDD10101; 27 m grading 1.98 g/t gold and 25 m grading 1.76 g/t gold in KBDD10103.
- 32 -
The above-noted drill holes targeted the depth potential of the gold mineralization along the southeast portion of the Central Granitoid body located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. All three holes were designed to test the down dip extension of gold mineralization along an approximately 100 m strike extension of the host granitoid body; with the drilling centered on a flexure or possible fold nose imparting a change from a northwesterly trend to an easterly trend to the moderate, northerly dipping granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite to tonalite composition.
Hole #KBDD10099 was drilled in a southwest direction on the NW-trending segment of the granitoid body. It was designed to undercut a mineralized intercept of 27.0 m grading 4.03 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10069 and yielded two significant mineralization intercepts located approximately 75 m down dip of the #KBDD10069 intercept, including: 20.0 metres grading 2.43 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 141 m; and 7.0 m grading 2.53 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 176 m. Significant mineralization was traced over an approximately 115 m down dip distance from surface on the KBDD10069 - KBDD10074 - KBDD10099 drill section.
Hole #KBDD10101, consisting of a south trending borehole designed to test the nose of the flexure in the granitoid body at depth below an intercept of 25.4 m grading 2.11 g/t gold yielded by scout diamond core hole #KBD08012, returned a wide mineralized intercept of 58.0 m grading 2.46 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 112 m; approximately 45 m down dip of the #KBD08012 intercept. This 58 m mineralized intercept encompasses an essentially barren, 11.0 m core-length interval (130 m - 141 m) appearing to reflect the truncation of the mineralization by a post mineralization dyke; with the mineralized section above the dyke yielding an intercept of 18.0 m grading 2.18 g/t gold (112 m - 130 m), and the segment below the dyke returning 28.0 m grading 3.67 g/t gold (142 m - 170 m), including 15 m grading 5.42 g/t gold. Hole #KBDD10103, also consisting of a south trending borehole collared approximately 50 m to the east of hole #KBDD10101 along the northern, hanging wall flank of the easterly trending granitoid body, was designed to undercut intercepts of 15.0 m grading 0.87 g/t gold and 33 m grading 1.28 g/t yielded by scout diamond core hole #KBD08013. Hole #KBDD10103 returned two significant mineralization intercepts extending approximately 45 m to 75 m down dip from the lower #KBD08013 mineralized intercept, including: 27.0 m grading 1.98 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 131.0 m, including 15.0 m grading 3.23 g/t gold; and 25.0 m grading 1.76 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 180.0 m.
- 33 -
The 2010 drilling and trenching efforts traced significant gold mineralization within the southeastern segment of the Central Granitoid over an approximately 300 m strike extension of the host granitoid body and down to a maximum down dip distance 115 m.
2011 Drill Program
On January 15, 2011, we commenced our 2011 Drill Program on our Kibi Project. The drilling was primarily designed to expand known gold mineralization along strike and at depth within the southeast portion of the Central Granitoid body located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly.
Results of 2011 Drill Program
The first two diamond core holes from our 2011 Drill Program have significantly expanded known gold mineralization down plunge on the Zone 2 - East Dyke Granitoid at our Kibi Project. The vertical fan pattern holes (379 m) successfully expanded the gold mineralization to a down plunge depth of approximately 200 m.
Highlights of these holes include classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of:
15 m grading 2.05 g/t gold, including 5 m grading 4.00 g/t gold, in KBDD11105; and
14 m grading 2.36 g/t gold, including 5 m grading 5.18 g/t gold, in KBDD11106.
At the time, drilling targeted the depth potential of the gold mineralization along the northern portion of the East Dyke Granitoid body located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly. The two west trending, vertical fan pattern holes (-50o & -70o) were designed to undercut a mineralized intercept of 7 m grading 4.83 g/t gold in scout hole #KBD08010 located at the northern extremity of the easterly dipping host granitoid body. Other drilling highlights from the North Zone - East Dyke Granitoid include intercepts of: 8.49 g/t gold over 12 m in hole #KBD08004 and 6.29 g/t over 23 m, including 8.66 g/t over 10 m, in hole #KBRC09047, and 2.97 g/t over 18 m, including 6.32 g/t over 8 m, in hole #KBRC09042. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition.

The upper #KBDD11105 borehole (-50o dip) yielded a significant mineralized intercept of 15 m grading 2.05 g/t gold, including 5 m grading 4.0 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 105 m, approximately 60 m down dip from the scout hole #KBD08010 intercept; and the steeper #KBDD11106 borehole (- 70o) returned a mineralized intercept of 14 m grading 2.36 g/t gold, including 5 m grading 5.18 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 141 m, approximately 65 m down dip of the #KBDD11105 intercept. To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 100 m strike length and 200 m down plunge distance along the North Zone of the East Dyke Granitoid. Drilling to date indicated that the North Zone consists of a northerly plunging (approx. 65o) mineralized vein package appeared to be developed at a flexure in the host granitoid body.
Geological mapping and trenching efforts appear to indicate that the four auriferous Granitoid bodies discovered to date on Zone 2 may form part of a continuous, folded Granitoid body. To date, gold mineralization had been traced by drilling and trenching over an approximately 1,500-metre aggregate distance along the limbs and nose of this SE-trending fold structure. The mineralization remained open in all directions and drilling/trenching to further define the extent and geological controls of the mineralization was ongoing.
In April 2011, a spectacular, coarse native gold-bearing, vein quartz clast was discovered by our local contracted placer gold miners along the Birim River valley within the north-central portion of the Apapam Mining Lease area. A photograph of the gold specimen has been posted on our website at www.xtragold.com. Although the complex geomorphologic setting and depositional history of the auriferous gravel deposits present along the base of the Atewa Range make it difficult to determine conclusive bedrock sources for the widespread placer gold occurrences, the high grade nature of this quartz vein gold mineralization renders it of considerable lode gold exploration significance.
A 3.5 km long, NE-trending, chargeable/resistive Induced Polarization (IP) anomaly exhibiting a spatial relationship with a geophysically inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend, and characterized by coincidental gold-in-soil anomalies and/or auriferous floats, lying approximately 1 km northwest of the Birim River along the south-western margin of the approximately 5.5 km long Kibi Project gold trend, represents a possible bedrock source for the vein gold material; based on the fact that the gold specimen was discovered at the confluence of an alluvial gold-bearing, secondary stream dissecting this anomalous trend. Another possible bedrock source for the gold mineralization is the southwest extension of the Kibi Old Mine structure inferred to pass to the south of the Birim River.
At the time, a mechanised trenching program targeting the 3.5 km long geophysical/geochemical trend and an extensive soil sampling program (75 line-km) covering the possible southwest extension of the Kibi Old Mine structure within the central portion of the Apapam Concession was scheduled for initiation in mid May, 2011. See the NI 43-101 Technical Report entitled “Kibi Project, Eastern Region, Ghana” dated July 12, 2010, filed under our company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com for further details regarding the aforementioned geophysical/geochemical target, the Kibi Old Mine prospect, and the geology and geomorphology of the Kibi Gold Belt placer gold deposits.
Two additional diamond core holes (586 m) were drilled on the newly named Big Bend Gold Zone - Central Granitoid at our Kibi Gold Project.
Highlights of these holes include classical granitoid-hosted gold mineralization intercepts of:
42 m grading 2.39 g /t gold in KBDD11108 from 189 m down-hole; and
27 m grading 0.89 g/t gold in KBDD11107 from 127 m down-hole.
The Big Bend Gold Zone was intersected approximately 215 m down-plunge of previously identified mineralization; extending down-plunge potential from surface to approximately 360 m along a through-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body.
- 35 -
These two southwest (225o) trending, vertical fan pattern holes (-50o & -75o) targeting an embayment or wallrock protrusion developed along the hanging wall of the Central Granitoid body represent the first holes drilled on the Big Bend gold zone during the current 20,000 m drill campaign to follow up on the significant gold intercepts yielded by Phase III holes KBDD10101 and KBDD10103. Hole KBDD10101 collared approximately 210 m to the west of the present drill collars returned 2.46 g/t gold over 58 m, including 3.67 g/t gold over 28 m; and KBDD10103 located 40 m to the east of KBDD10101 yielded intercepts of 1.98 g/t gold over 27 m and 1.76 g/t gold over 25 m. To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 300 m strike length and approximately 360 m down plunge distance from surface along the Big Bend gold zone hosted by the Central Granitoid body. Drilling to date indicated that the Big Bend zone consisted of northeasterly plunging, en echelon, mineralized vein packages appearing to be developed along a through-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body.
The upper KBDD11107 borehole (-50o dip) yielded a mineralized intercept of 27 m grading 0.89 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 127 m; and the steeper KBDD11108 borehole (-75o) returned a mineralized intercept of 42 m grading 2.39 g/t gold, including 14 m grading 3.11 g/t gold and 9 m grading 3.19 g/t gold from a down hole depth of 189 m, approximately 100 m down dip of the KBDD11107 intercept. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition.
Both boreholes also intersected mineralization spatially associated with a northerly trending shear zone cross-cutting the Central Granitoid; with KBDD11107 yielding a sheared diorite intercept grading 8.44 g/t gold over 3 m from a down-hole depth of 60 m; and sheared, graphitic metasedimentary rocks in KBDD11108 returning mineralized intercepts grading 2.12 g/t gold over 4 m and 2.36 g/t gold over 5 m, including 5.36 g/t gold over 2 m, from down-hole depths of 87 m and 116 m, respectively. This newly discovered gold-bearing shear zone represented a very prospective target to be followed-up by additional trenching and drilling.
To date, we had completed 31 holes totaling 7,692 m (#KBDD11105 - #KBDD11135) of our 2011 Drill Program (including KBDD11116 which was abandoned at 71 m); with 15 out of the 31 holes (4,390 m) targeting the Big Bend gold zone on the Central Granitoid body. At the time, ongoing drilling efforts were focused on the further delineation of the Big Bend gold zone.
Ongoing drilling on the Big Bend Gold Zone on our Kibi Gold Project continues to intersect significant gold mineralization, including 2.42 g/t gold over 52 m. At the time, assay results from six new diamond core holes (1,308 m) noted hereunder continued to confirm the down-plunge continuity and the multiple en-echelon vein package structural style of the mineralization, and demonstrated the occurrence of higher grade mineralization within the Big Bend gold system.
Highlights of the holes noted hereunder include classical granitoid - hosted gold mineralization intercepts of:
52 m grading 2.42 g/t gold in KBDD11113 from 84 m down-hole, including 27 m grading 3.58 g/t gold (and including 6.09 g/t gold over 12 m);
50 m grading 1.64 g/t gold in KBDD11110 from 158 m down-hole, including 24 m grading 2.45 g/t gold; and
50 m grading 1.31 g/t gold in KBDD11114 from surface, including 20 m grading 2.21 g/t gold.
- 36 -
To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 300 m strike length and approximately 360 m down plunge distance from surface along the Big Bend gold zone hosted by the Central Granitoid body. Drilling to date indicated that the Big Bend zone consisted of north-easterly plunging, en echelon, mineralized vein packages appearing to be developed along a through-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition. Irregularities or flexures in the geometry of the host diorite bodies appear to strongly influence the development of veining and grade distribution; as is exemplified by the Big Bend Zone on the Central Granitoid and the East Dyke Granitoid Zone. Similar flexures have potential to host mineralization elsewhere along the strike or down-dip extensions of the extensive dioritic bodies characterizing our Kibi Gold Project.
Boreholes KBDD11109 - KBDD11110 and KBDD11111 - KBDD11112 consisting of a pair of south trending, vertical fan drill sections (-50o & -75o), collared approximately 45 m apart were designed to test the quartz diorite body at depth between holes KBDD10103 and KBDD11108 which yielded significant gold intercepts located approximately 45 m west and 50 m east of the present drill sections, respectively. With KBDD10103 returning mineralized intercepts of 1.98 g/t gold over 27 m and 1.76 g/t gold over 25 m; and KBDD11108 returning an intercept of 42 m grading 2.39 g/t gold.
- 37 -
The upper KBDD11109 borehole (-50o) of the KBDD11109 - KBDD11110 vertical fan pattern yielded a mineralized intercept of 2 m grading 5.75 g/t gold from a down-hole depth of 91 m; and the steeper KBDD11110 borehole (-75o) returned a mineralized intercept of 50 m grading 1.64 g/t gold, including 24 m grading 2.45 g/t gold, from a down-hole depth of 158 m, approximately 75 to 125 m down dip of the KBDD11109 intercept. The shorter KBDD11109 intercept appeared to represent the upper fringes of the north-easterly plunging mineralization zone.
The upper KBDD11111 borehole (-50o) of the KBDD11111 - KBDD11112 vertical fan pattern yielded mineralized intercepts of 22 m grading 1.25 g/t gold and 18 m grading 2.09 g/t gold, including 7 m grading 4.18 g/t gold, from down-hole depths of 94 m and 133 m, respectively. The steeper KBDD11112 borehole (-75o) yielded three (3) mineralized intercepts developed over a 115 m core-length starting at a down-hole depth of 130 m, including: 47 m grading 0.71 g/t gold, including 2.71 g/t gold over 6 m; 18 m grading 1.31 g/t gold; and 17 m grading 2.0 g/t gold, including 3.89 g/t gold over 7 m. The KBDD11112 mineralization envelope extended from approximately 55 m to 120 m down-dip of the upper KBDD11111 intercepts.
KBDD11113 and KBDD11114, consisting of vertical boreholes (-90o) collared approximately 35 m apart at the western extremity of the Big Bend Gold Zone, were designed to test the extensive system of shallowly dipping, extension (ladder) vein arrays associated with the mineralized system; and to obtain additional information on the structural controls of the mineralization. Hole KBDD11113 returned a mineralized intercept of 52 metres grading 2.42 g/t gold, including 27 m grading 3.58 g/t gold (and including 6.09 g/t gold over 12 m), from a down-hole depth of 84 m; and KBDD11114 yielded an intercept of 50 m grading 1.31 g/t gold from surface, including 20 m grading 2.21 g/t gold.
To date, we had completed 34 holes totaling 8,550 m (#KBDD11105 - #KBDD11138) of our 2011 Drill Program (including KBDD11116 which was abandoned at 71 m after encountering seven m of 2.57 g/t gold from 64-71 m); with 18 out of the 31 holes (5,248 m) targeting the Big Bend gold zone on the Central Granitoid body. Ongoing drilling efforts during that time frame focused on the further delineation of the Big Bend gold zone.
In June 2011, field preparations were underway for exploration programs in the third quarter of the Fiscal Year designed to fully maximize the discovery potential on our Kibi Gold Project.
The comprehensive and systematic field programs will include a combination of follow-up work to define drill targets on untested gold-in-soil and Induced Polarization (“IP”) anomalies lying along the approximately 5.5 km long Kibi Project gold trend located along the north-western margin of the Apapam Mining Lease; as well as first pass, grassroots exploration covering the southeastern portion (70%) of the concession, and the contiguous Akim Apapam reconnaissance license area. The multi-faceted work programs, including first pass (200m x 25m) and in-fill (100m x 25m) soil sampling, geological mapping and prospecting, hand auger sampling, and mechanized trenching, will also permit the prioritization and definition of geophysical anomalies produced by the completed, detail 100 m line-spacing, airborne Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic (“VTEM”), magnetic, and radiometric survey over the Apapam property area.
To date, only approximately 15% of the existing Kibi Gold Project soil geochemistry / IP survey grid, covering approximately 30% of the 33.65 km2 Apapam Mining Lease, had been subjected to follow-up work; with the ongoing 2011 Drill Program focused on Zone 2 of our Kibi Gold Project only representing approximately 3% of the total concession area. Limited trenching and scout drilling outside Zone 2 has traced the granitoid-hosted gold mineralization over an approximately 2,100 m distance along the approximately 5.5 km NE - trending Kibi Gold Trend. In combination with VTEM/Mag/Radiometric survey, these target generation/definition programs will enable our company to further define known gold occurrences outside Zone 2, and evaluate the remainder of this very prospective land position for the hosting of granitoid-hosted and Ashanti style shear zone gold mineralization.”
Line cutting for the Apapam South control grid, to be followed by soil sampling, commenced on June 13, 2011. Hand auger sampling and mechanized trenching will follow-up on untested gold-in-soil and IP anomalies on the existing Kibi Gold Project grid and was expected to start by the end of June. At the time, these target generation/definition work programs were scheduled to be implemented concurrently over the next two to three months; with arrangements in progress for the booking of a second diamond drill rig to start testing high priority targets towards the end of the third quarter of the Fiscal Year.
Regional government mapping indicated that the Apapam South / Akim Apapam soil geochemistry survey area covers highly prospective terrain for the hosting of Ashanti style shear zone gold mineralization in the form of two major Birimian unit contacts, including the contact between an extensive metavolcanic rock sequence, forming the core of the Kibi Gold Belt, and a metasedimentary/volcaniclastic rock package; and a major north-east trending reverse fault along the eastern margin of the belt. The Kibi Old Mine historical lode gold prospect located at the north-central extremity of the Apapam Concession is spatially associated with this regional structure.

The first pass soil survey will cover an approximately 25 km2 area and encompass an estimated 5,450 samples to be collected at a sampling density of 200 m x 25 m. Reconnaissance geology and prospecting will also be conducted along the approximately 136 km of NW-SE trending cross-lines. Every second sample (50 m stations) will initially be submitted for gold and arsenic analysis (approximately 2,725 samples); with the “held - back” samples subsequently subjected for analysis where required to delineate / bracket anomalous gold-in-soil anomalies. Detailed (100m x 25m) follow-up soils and hand auger sampling will be conducted upon reception of analytical results to provide greater definition of gold-in-soil anomalies.
Untested gold-in-soil and IP anomalies lying within the existing Kibi Gold Project grid area will be followed-up by in-fill (100m x 25m) soil sampling and/or hand auger sampling, and mechanized trenching designed to identify high priority, cost-effective drill targets. Of particular interest is a 3.5 km long, NE-trending, chargeable/resistive IP anomaly exhibiting a spatial relationship with a geophysically inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend, and characterized by coincidental gold-in-soil anomalies and/or auriferous floats lying along the south-western margin of the approximately 5.5 km long Kibi Project gold trend.
See the NI 43-101 Technical Report entitled “Kibi Project, Eastern Region, Ghana” dated July 12, 2010, filed under our company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com for further details regarding to the aforementioned Kibi Old Mine historical prospect and the high priority geophysical/geochemical target.
In August 2011, ongoing drilling on our Kibi Gold Project continued to intersect significant gold mineralization, including 2.67 g/t gold over 38 m on the Big Bend Gold Zone - Central Granitoid and 4.88 g/t gold over 16 m on the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone at the southeastern extremity of the Upper Central Granitoid. Assay results from 19 new diamond core holes (5,055 m), as noted hereunder, continued to confirm the down-plunge continuity and the multiple en-echelon vein package structural style of the Big Bend Gold Zone, and demonstrated the multiple gold deposit potential within Zone 2 of our Kibi Gold Project.
Highlights of the holes noted hereunder include:
16 m grading 2.25 g/t gold and 38 m grading 2.67 g/t gold in KBDD11133 from 152 m and 182 m down-hole, respectively (Big Bend Gold Zone);
32 m grading 2.41 g/t gold in KBDD11136 from 149 m down-hole, including 17 m grading 4.01 g/t gold (Big Bend Gold Zone);
Big Bend Gold Zone now traced over approximately 325 m strike length and 450 m down plunge from surface within the Central Granitoid body;
16 m grading 4.88 g/t gold, including 10 m grading 7.38 g/t gold, from 67 m down hole in KBDD11117, on the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone on the Upper Central Granitoid (as noted below); and
3 newly defined Shear Targets, including 34.80 g/t gold over 1 m in coarse visible gold-bearing shear zone in KBDD11133.

- 40 -
These drill results are part of 2011 Drill Program. Holes included nine holes (2,913 m) on the Big Bend Gold Zone, 3 holes (612 m) on the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone on the Upper Central Granitoid, and 7 exploration holes (1,530 m) on newly discovered shear and Induced Polarization (IP) / soil geochemistry targets.
At the time, drilling included nine holes on the Big Bend Gold Zone, including 8 holes (2,446 m) designed to further delineate/infill the gold zone and 1 hole (#KBDD11134; 467 m) drilled down the plunge of the zone in order to obtain additional structural information on the multiple en-echelon vein package system and to test the continuity of the mineralization down plunge. The delineation/infill holes, with the exception of #KBDD11115, consist of southerly trending boreholes (- 50o to -75o inclinations) collared on the northern, hanging wall flank of the easterly trending host diorite body and drilled across the ESE-trending, northerly dipping mineralization sheets.
Holes #KBDD11128, #KBDD11133, and #KBDD11135 to #KBDD11137 were designed to further delineate/infill the Big Bend Gold Zone along strike at vertical depths ranging from approximately 90 m to 175 m. Boreholes #KBDD11138 and #KBDD11139 tested the down plunge extension of the zone at vertical depths of approximately 200 m to 300 m. Hole #KBDD11115 consists of a vertical borehole (-90o) collared at the western extremity of the Big Bend Gold Zone designed to test the extensive system of shallowly dipping, extension (ladder) vein arrays associated with the mineralized system; and to obtain additional information on the structural controls of the mineralization.
All eight Big Bend Gold Zone delineation/infill holes returned significant gold mineralization, including: intercepts of 2.25 g/t gold over 16 m and 2.67 g/t gold over 38 m from down hole depths of 152 m and 182 m, respectively in hole #KBDD11133; and 0.78 g/t gold over 7 m and 2.41 g/t gold over 32 m (including 4.01 g/t gold over 17 m) from down hole depths of 134 m and 149 m, respectively in #KBDD11136. The #KBDD11133 gold intercepts are located approximately 25 m west and below mineralized intercepts of 1.98 g/t gold over 27 m and 1.76 g/t gold over 25 m yielded by previously reported hole #KBDD10103. The #KBDD11136 gold intercepts are located approximately 50 m below mineralized intercepts of 22 m grading 1.25 g/t gold and 18 m grading 2.09 g/t gold in previously reported hole #KBDD11111, and approximately 40 m above and east of mineralized intercepts of 47 m grading 0.71 g/t gold, 18 m grading 1.31 g/t gold, and 17 m grading 2.0 g/t gold in hole #KBDD11112.
Hole #KBDD11134 was drilled down the plunge of the Big Bend Gold Zone in order to obtain additional structural information on the multiple en-echelon vein package system, to test the continuity of the mineralization down plunge, and to serve as a pilot hole to permit better targeting of deeper holes along the down plunge extension of the zone. The NE-trending borehole (060o/-58o) was collared at the western, surface expression, extremity of the Big Bend Gold Zone and allowed to run unaided down the plunge and diagonally across (down dip) the system of stacked, approximately 70o northerly dipping, mineralization sheets. KBDD11134 remained within the confines of the host Central Granitoid body to its final depth of 467 m; with the borehole stopped due to a shortage of drill rods.
- 41 -
Hole #KBDD11134 yielded multiple mineralized intervals, ranging from 3 m to 73 m in core length, reflecting the en-echelon style vein packages forming the Big Bend Gold Zone mineralization, including: 1.51 g/t gold over 26 m from a down hole depth of 6 m, 3.03 g/t gold over 41 m from a down hole depth of 96 m, 2.04 g/t gold over 42 m from a down hole depth of 223 m, and 1.06 g/t gold over 73 m from a down hole depth of 312 m (see Table 2). The array of mineralized intervals produced a length weighted average grade of 1.62 g/t gold over a cumulative core length of 276 m, and the hole returned 1.01 g/t gold, including internal dilution, over its 464 m core length (3m - 467m); exemplifying the down plunge continuity of the Big Bend Gold Zone mineralization.
To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 325 m strike length and approximately 450 m down plunge distance from surface along the Big Bend Gold Zone hosted by the Central Granitoid body. Drilling to date indicated that the Big Bend Zone consisted of north-easterly plunging, en-echelon, mineralized vein packages appearing to be developed along a trough-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition.
Mushroom Gold Zone
Holes #KBDD11117, #KBDD11118 and #KBDD11120 were designed to follow up on significant drill intercepts yielded by RC hole #KBRC09060 and diamond drill hole #KBDD10081 within the southeastern portion of the Upper Central Granitoid, i.e. the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone.
Hole #KBDD11117 consisting of the re-drilling of hole #KBDD11116, which returned 7 m grading 2.57 g/t gold before being abandoned due to technical difficulties at the 71 m mark, was designed to follow up on scout hole #KBRC09060 drilled down the dip of the host granitoid body in order to transect an extensive system of westerly dipping, sheeted quartz veining; with the borehole returning an intercept from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut). The southeast trending #KBDD11117 borehole designed to intersect the Upper Central Granitoid at right angles from a collar position on the northeastern, hanging wall flank of the host granitoid body returned a mineralized intercept of 4.88 g/t gold over 16 m, including 10 m grading 7.38 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 67 m, approximately at the same vertical depth as the bottom of the #KBRC09060 intercept.
Hole #KBDD11118 designed to undercut a mineralized intercept of 9 m grading 3.60 g/t gold in #KBDD10081, approximately 60 m to the northwest of #KBDD11117, returned 2.57 g/t gold over 11 m, including 5 m grading 4.23 g/t gold, from a down hole depth of 84 m, approximately 45 m down dip of the #KBDD10081 intercept. Drilling to date appeared to indicate that the Mushroom Gold Zone consists of a northeast plunging vein system spatially related to a series of pinch and swells in the Upper Central Granitoid body.
Irregularities or flexures in the geometry of the host diorite bodies appear to strongly influence the development of veining and grade distribution; as is exemplified by the Big Bend Gold Zone on the Central Granitoid, the East Dyke Granitoid Zone, and the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone on the Upper Central Granitoid. Similar flexures have potential to host mineralization elsewhere along the strike or down-dip extensions of the extensive dioritic bodies characterizing our Kibi Gold Project.

Shear Zone Targets
An approximately 0.5 m wide, coarse visible gold bearing, quartz vein hosted within a fault breccia forming part of a prominent shear zone spanning over an approximately 10 m core length returned 34.80 g/t gold over a 1 m core length at a down hole depth of 398 m in hole #KBDD11133. This newly discovered northwest trending/northeasterly dipping shear zone represented a very prospective exploration target due to its emplacement along the southern limb of the Central Granitoid body.
Boreholes #KBDD11122 and #KBDD11123 consisting of a west trending, vertical fan drill section (-50o & -70o) was designed to further test the northerly trending Junction Shear cross-cutting the Central Granitoid; approximately 80 m south of a 8.44 g/t gold over 3 m intercept yielded from the same structure in hole #KBDD11107. The upper KBDD11122 borehole (-50o) of the vertical fan pattern returned mineralized intercepts of 3 m grading 3.14 g/t gold, including 7.59 g/t gold over 1 m, and 5.15 g/t gold over 1 m from down hole depths of 78 m and 92 m, respectively; and the steeper KBDD11123 hole (-70o) returned an intercept of 2.45 g/t gold over 1 m at a down hole depth of 126 m, approximately 50 m down dip of the KBDD11122 intercept.
To date, , we had completed 54 holes totaling approximately 14,825 m (#KBDD11105 - #KBDD11158) in our 2011 Drill Program (including KBDD11116 which was abandoned at 71 m); with 24 out of the 54 holes (7,704 m) targeting the Big Bend gold zone on the Central Granitoid body. Ongoing drilling efforts during that time frame are currently focused on the further delineation of the newly defined Mushroom Gold Zone on the Upper Central Granitoid.
In November 2011, ongoing drilling continued to confirm the down-plunge continuity and the multiple en-echelon vein package structural style of the Big Bend gold zone, and demonstrated the multiple gold deposit potential within Zone 2 of our Kibi Gold Project.
Highlights of the 15 diamond core holes (5,714 m) noted hereunder include:
62 m grading 1.57 g/t gold, including 2.00 g/t gold over 42 m (and including 2.76 g/t gold over 19 m) in #KBDD11141 from 232 m down-hole (Big Bend Zone);
41 m grading 1.62 g/t gold, including 2.18 g/t gold over 20 m, in #KBDD11143 from 249 m down-hole (East Dyke- North Zone);
Big Bend Zone now traced over approximately 325 m strike length and 500 m down plunge from surface within the Central Granitoid body;
South Ridge Gold Zone extended 170 m further down dip than from 2010 drilling; gold mineralization now traced over distances of approximately 440 m along the strike and 400 m down the dip of the South Ridge Granitoid body;
New typical Kibi-type granitoid hosted vein system (i.e. Road Cut Zone) discovered in diorite body located 60 m due south of the Central Granitoid’s Big Bend Zone; and
Second diamond drill rig contracted to accelerate delineation/infill drilling of the Big Bend Zone and East Dyke - North Zone geared towards an initial resource estimate.
- 43 -
The following drill results are part of our 2011 Drill Program designed to delineate/infill the Big Bend Gold Zone - Central Granitoid; as well as further test/delineate other prominent gold systems and geophysical/geochemical anomalies on the approximately 1,200 m long by 500 m to 800 m wide Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly of our Kibi Gold Project. The 15 holes (#KBDD11129 to #KBDD11150) drilled at the time included: 6 holes (2,327 m) on the Big Bend Zone, including #KBDD11142 which tested both the East Dyke and Big Bend zones; 3 holes (899 m) on the East Dyke Zone; 3 holes (1,211 m) on the newly discovered Road Cut Zone; 1 hole on the South Ridge Granitoid Zone (578 m); and 3 geology/exploration holes (699 m) designed to further define the geometry of Zone 2 diorite bodies.
Big Bend Zone (Central Granitoid)
Drilling included 6 holes (2,327 m) on the Big Bend Zone, including 4 holes designed to further delineate/infill the gold zone and 2 holes targeting the down plunge extension of the mineralized body. In addition, hole #KBDD11146 targeting the southern diorite body hosting the Road Cut Zone was collared on the footwall margin of the Central Granitoid (i.e. Big Bend Zone) but exited the Central Granitoid body at a down-hole depth of 25 m.
The Big Bend Zone holes, with the exception of #KBDD11142, consist of southerly trending boreholes (- 60o to -77o inclinations) collared on the northern, hanging wall flank of the easterly trending host diorite body and drilled across the ESE-trending, northerly dipping mineralization sheets. KBDD11142 consists of a WNW-trending borehole originally designed to test the East Dyke Zone but extended down to the Central Granitoid to test the down plunge extension of the Big Bend Zone and to obtain additional structural information on the mineralized vein system.
- 44 -
Holes #KBDD11140 and #KBDD11141 were drilled in a vertical fan pattern (-60o and -72o) with the upper borehole designed as an infill hole along the eastern portion of the Big Bend Zone and the lower borehole targeting the down plunge extension of the mineralized body. The upper #KBDD11140 borehole (-60o) yielded mineralized intercepts of 7 m grading 1.46 g/t gold and 15 m grading 1.39 g/t gold from down-hole depths of 162 m and 192 m, respectively, and the steeper #KBDD11141 borehole (-72o) intersected 2.00 g/t gold over 42 m from 241 m down-hole, including a higher-grade core grading 2.76 g/t gold over 19 m (251m-270m), in a broader intercept grading 1.57 g/t gold over 62 m from a down-hole depth of 232 m; approximately 100 m vertically below the #KBDD11140 intercept. This mineralization exhibited good continuity with an intercept of 42 m grading 2.39 g/t gold, including 3.11 g/t gold over 14 m and 3.19 g/t gold over 9 m, in hole #KBDD11108; approximately 50 m above the #KBDD11141 intercept.
Hole #KBDD11142 initially targeted the East Dyke Zone (see description below) but was extended down to the Central Granitoid to test the down plunge extension of the Big Bend Zone and to obtain additional structural information on the mineralized vein system. The westerly trending (285o) borehole diagonally transected (down dip) the easterly trending, steep northerly dipping system of stacked, mineralized vein sheets. This lower segment of #KBDD11142 yielded multiple mineralized intervals, spanning from 350 m to 468 m down-hole, reflecting the en-echelon style vein packages forming the Big Bend Zone mineralization, including: 6 m grading 1.98 g/t gold; 20.1 m grading 1.71 g/t gold; 3 m grading 2.14 g/t gold; and 22 m grading 1.43 g/t gold, including 3.19 g/t gold over 5 m. The lowermost #KBDD11142 intercept (446m-468m) lies approximately 150 m below the #KBDD11141 mineralized intercept and approximately 500 m down plunge from the surface expression of the mineralized body.
Holes #KBDD11130, #KBDD11131, and #KBDD11132 were designed to further delineate/infill the down-dip extension of the western portion of the Big Bend gold zone, approximately 150 m down-plunge from surface, at vertical depths ranging from approximately 150 m to 280 m. All 3 holes returned significant gold mineralization, including: intercepts of 1.75 g/t gold over 26 m, including 12 m grading 2.56 g/t gold, from a down-hole depth of 211 m in hole #KBDD11131; and 1.72 g/t gold over 6 m, 3.21 g/t gold over 3 m, and 0.81 g/t gold over 20 m (including 5 m grading 2.30 g/t gold) from down hole-depths of 237 m, 264 m, and 280 m, respectively. The #KBDD11131 gold intercept is located approximately 70 m vertically below mineralized intercepts of 27 m grading 1.98 g/t gold and 25 m grading 1.76 g/t gold in #KBDD10103, and approximately 70 m below and 22 m west of intercepts of 16 m grading 2.25 g/t gold and 38 m grading 2.67 g/t gold in #KBDD11133.
To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 325 metre strike length and approximately 500 metre down plunge distance from surface along the Big Bend gold zone hosted by the Central Granitoid body. Drilling to date indicated that the Big Bend zone consisted of north-easterly plunging, en-echelon, mineralized vein packages appearing to be developed along a trough-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition.
East Dyke - North Zone (#KBDD11142 and #KBDD11143)
Holes #KBDD11142 and #KBDD11143 consisting of a pair of west trending, vertical fan pattern holes (-55o and -70o) collared on the eastern (hanging wall) flank of the northern segment of the East Dyke Granitoid, targeted the down-plunge extension of significant gold mineralization intersected earlier in the Fiscal Year by fan pattern holes #KBDD11105 and #KBDD11106; which returned 15 m grading 2.05 g/t gold, including 5 m grading 4.0 g/t gold, and 14 m grading 2.36 g/t gold, including 5 metres grading 5.18 g/t, respectively.
The upper #KBDD11142 borehole (-55o dip) yielded a mineralized intercept of 26 m grading 1.41 g/t gold, including 8 m grading 2.37 g/t gold, from a down-hole depth of 200 m, approximately 50 m north and 25 m below the #KBDD11106 intercept; and the steeper #KBDD11143 borehole (-70o) returned a significant mineralized intercept grading 1.62 g/t gold over 41 m, including 2.18 g/t gold over 20 m, from a down-hole depth of 249 m, approximately 80 m down dip of the #KBDD11142 intercept.
To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 150 m strike length and 320 m down plunge distance along the North Zone of the East Dyke Granitoid (i.e. East Dyke - North Zone). Drilling to date indicated that the North Zone consisted of a northerly plunging (approx. 65o) mineralized vein package appearing to be developed at a flexure in the host granitoid body.
Road Cut Zone (#KBDD11144; New Zone)
Hole #KBDD11144 (100o/-55o) returned a mineralized intercept of 30 m grading 0.79 g/t gold (34 m - 64 m), including 19 m grading 1.05 g/t gold, across a NNE-trending system of typical Kibi-type granitoid hosted quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining. This new gold zone (i.e. Road Cut Zone) is emplaced within an easterly trending quartz diorite body lying approximately 60 m south of the Central Granitoid; due south of the flexure along the Central Granitoid appearing to control the Big Bend Gold Zone mineralization. Additional trenching/drilling is planned to further define the geometry of the host diorite body and the structural controls of the mineralization.
- 45 -
South Ridge Zone (#KBDD11148)
Hole #KBDD11148 (225o/-55o) was drilled as a combination geology/exploration borehole designed to further delineate the western extensions of the Central Granitoid and South Ridge Granitoid bodies, define the stratigraphy across the colluvium-filled valley separating the Central Granitoid and South Ridge Granitoid, and test the down dip potential of the central portion of the South Ridge Gold Zone.
Hole #KBDD11148 returned a significant, quartz diorite-hosted, mineralized intercept of 15 m grading 1.40 g/t gold (452 m - 467 m), including 7 m grading 2.53 g/t gold, appearing to correspond to the down dip extension of the South Ridge Gold Zone; approximately 170 m down dip of the lowermost intercept of 47 m grading 0.58 g/t gold in hole #KBDD10086. The borehole also intersected two previously unmapped iron-carbonate altered quartz diorite bodies prospective for the hosting of Kibi-type granitoid hosted gold mineralization.
Drilling and trenching to date had traced an extensive system of en-echelon extension vein arrays across an approximately 440 m distance along the SE-trending, moderately NE-dipping South Ridge Granitoid body; with the present borehole appearing to extend the mineralization to a down-dip depth of approximately 400 m.
Drilling Progress and Exploration Outlook
At the time, 70 holes totalling 18,932 m had been completed by our company in our 2011 Drill Program, of which, including the 15 holes (5,714 m) noted in the preceding paragraphs, 50 drill holes have been reported.
In November 2011, a new 20,000 m drill contract, to be initiated following the completion of our 2011 Drill Program, had been signed with Burwash Drilling Limited, and our company also contracted Global Drilling Services for a second diamond drill rig (10,000 m minimum) which commenced drilling on December 16, 2011.
One drill rig will be dedicated to the further delineation/infill drilling of the Big Bend Zone and East Dyke - North Zone geared towards an initial resource estimate. The second drill rig will focus on the further testing/delineation of other prominent Zone 2 gold systems including the South Ridge and Mushroom zones, the scout drilling of Zone 3 and Zone 4 trench showings and gold-in-soil anomalies, and the testing of priority geophysical targets yielded by the airborne VTEM, magnetic, and radiometric survey completed earlier in the Fiscal Year.
The results from 26 additional diamond core holes totaling 6,713 m from Zone 2 of our Kibi Gold Project are noted hereunder.
Highlights of the drill results include:
17 m grading 5.47 g/t gold, including 12.66 g/t gold over 4 m, in #KBDD11172 from 127 m down-hole (Big Bend Zone);
24.5 m grading 3.43 g/t gold, including 4.70 g/t gold over 17 m, in #KBDD11176 from 165.5 m down-hole (East Dyke-North Zone);
20 m grading 2.82 g/t gold in #KBDD11157 from 92 m down-hole (Mushroom Zone - Upper Central Granitoid);
North Zone traced approximately 465 m down plunge from surface within the East Dyke Granitoid body (#KBDD11175);
New typical Kibi-type granitoid hosted vein system discovered at depth within the apparent fold nose developed within the Central Granitoid (#KBDD11161); and
Ongoing follow-up trenching on Double 19 Zone within extensive Zone 3 gold-in-soil anomaly returns channel sample intercept of 2.27 g/t gold over 36 m trench-length, including 2 m grading 22.22 g/t gold, in trenches #TAD022 - #ADRS001.

These drill results are part of our 2011 Drill Program of our Kibi Gold Project. The 26 holes (#KBDD11151 to #KBDD11176) include: 6 holes (2,148 m) on the Big Bend Zone; 5 holes (1,157 m) on the East Dyke Zone; 7 holes (1,290 m) on the Mushroom Zone - Upper Central Granitoid; 2 holes (433 m) on the South Ridge Granitoid Zone; 2 holes (510 m) on the recently defined Road Cut Zone; and 4 geology/exploration holes (1175 m) designed to further define the geometry of Zone 2 diorite bodies.
Big Bend Zone (Central Granitoid)
Drilling included 6 holes (2,148 m) on the Big Bend Zone, including: 3 holes designed to further delineate/infill the gold zone (KBDD11160, KBDD11171, KBDD11172); 2 holes targeting the down plunge extension of the mineralization along the northwestern limb of the trough-like flexure (i.e. Big Bend) developed within the Central Granitoid body (KBDD11169 - 170); and 1 hole (KBDD11161) drilled down the plunge of the zone in order to obtain additional structural information on the multiple en-echelon vein package system and to test the continuity of the mineralization down plunge.
Hole #KBDD11172 consisting of a southwest trending borehole designed to further delineate the western extremity of the Big Bend Zone, along the north-western limb of the trough-like flexure developed within the Central Granitoid body, returned a high grade mineralized intercept grading 5.47 g/t gold over 17 m, including 4 metres grading 12.66 g/t gold, from a down-hole depth of 127 m. This mineralization exhibited good continuity with an intercept of 27.13 m grading 2.12 g/t gold, including 4.01 g/t gold over 6.93 m in #KBDD10070, lying approximately 40 above and 20 m to the south of the #KBDD11172 intercept.

Hole #KBDD11170 consisting of a deep exploratory borehole targeting the down plunge extension of the mineralization along the north-western limb of the trough-like flexure intersected several exploration significant intercepts distributed over an approximately 100 m core-length from a down-hole depth of 243 m, including 8 m grading 1.10 g/t gold; approximately 175 m down plunge from the #KBDD11172 intercept.
Hole #KBDD11161 was drilled down the plunge of the Big Bend Zone, parallel to and approximately 75 m to the southeast of similar down-plunge hole #KBDD11134; with these down-plunge boreholes designed to obtain additional structural information on the multiple en-echelon vein package system, to test the continuity of the mineralization down plunge, and to serve as pilot holes to permit better targeting of deeper holes along the down plunge extension of the zone. The ENE-trending borehole (070o/-55o) was collared along the inner footwall margin of the host granitoid body, along the eastern limb of the trough-like flexure, and allowed to run unaided down the plunge and diagonally across (down dip) the system of stacked, approximately 70o northerly dipping, mineralization sheets. KBDD11161 remained within the confines of the host Central Granitoid body for its entirety; with technical difficulties forcing the borehole to be abandoned within a new mineralization zone at a down-hole depth of 537 m.
Hole #KBDD11161 yielded multiple mineralized intervals, ranging from 10 m to 45 m in core length, reflecting the en-echelon style vein packages forming the Big Bend Zone mineralization, including: 1.50 g/t gold over 28 m from a down hole depth of 3 m; 1.22 g/t gold over 20 m from a down hole depth of 116 m; 2.0 g/t gold over 45 m from a down hole depth of 159 m; 1.57 g/t gold over 35 m from a down hole depth of 231 m; and 1.40 g/t gold over 25 m from a down hole depth of 283 m (see Table 2). The array of mineralized intervals produced a length weighted average grade of 1.60 g/t gold over a cumulative core length of 185 m, and the hole returned 1.03 g/t gold, including internal dilution, over a 305 m core length (3m - 308m); exemplifying the down plunge continuity of the Big Bend zone gold mineralization.
Technical difficulties forced #KBDD11161 to be abandoned at the 537 m mark within a zone of typical Kibi-type quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining; with the bottom 11 m of the borehole returning 1.23 g/t gold, including 2 m grading 2.79 g/t gold. This new mineralization zone lies at a vertical depth of approximately 400 m, approximately 160 m east of the deepest down plunge extent of the Big Bend Zone, within the apparent fold nose developed within the Central Granitoid.
At the time, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 325 m strike length and approximately 500 m down plunge distance from surface along the Big Bend gold zone hosted by the Central Granitoid body. Drillingto indicated that the Big Bend zone consisted of north-easterly plunging, en-echelon, mineralized vein packages appearing to be developed along a trough-like flexure within the Central Granitoid body. Gold mineralization is associated with quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining developed within a rock body of quartz diorite composition.
East Dyke - North Zone
Drilling efforts on the East Dyke included a deep hole targeting the down plunge extension of the mineralized system and a delineation hole in the upper portion of the zone. KBDD11175 consisting of a deep, westerly trending borehole collared on the eastern, hanging wall flank of the East Dyke Granitoid returned typical granitoid hosted quartz-albite-carbonate-sulphide veining intercepts grading 0.88 g/t gold over 7 m and 1.14 g/t gold over 10 m from down-hole depths of 359 m and 385 m, respectively; approximately 145 m further down plunge than the previous extent of the mineralization.
To date, significant gold mineralization had been traced over an approximately 150 m strike length and 465 m down plunge distance along the North Zone of the East Dyke Granitoid (i.e. East Dyke - North Zone). Drilling to date indicated that the North Zone consisted of a northerly plunging (approx. 65o) mineralized vein package appearing to be developed at a flexure in the host granitoid body.
Hole #KBDD11176 designed to further define the northern extent of the East Dyke - North Zone at a vertical depth of approximately 160 m returned a significant mineralized intercept of 24.5 m grading 3.43 g/t gold, including 4.70 g/t gold over 17 m. This mineralization exhibited good continuity with an intercept of 14 m grading 2.36 g/t gold in #KBDD11106, approximately 45 m to the east; and intercepts of 1.41 g/t gold over 26 m and 1.62 g/t gold over 41 m, including 20 m grading 2.18 g/t gold, in holes #KBDD11142 and #KBDD11143, respectively, approximately 35 m and 105 m below the #KBDD11176 intercept, respectively.

Mushroom Zone (Upper Central Granitoid)
Holes #KBDD11151, #KBDD11153 - #KBDD11154, #KBDD11157, and #KBDD11158 were designed to further test the recently defined Mushroom Zone; following a significant, near surface intercept of 4.88 g/t gold over 16 m yielded by hole #KBDD11117. Drilling to date appeared to indicate that the Mushroom Zone consisted of a northeast plunging, en-echelon, vein system spatially related to a constriction in the south-eastern portion of the Upper Central Granitoid body; with present hole #KBDD11154 tracing the mineralization to a down-plunge depth of approximately 190 m.
Hole #KBDD11151 consisting of a southwest trending borehole targeting the down-plunge extension of the #KBDD11117 intercept from a collar position on the north-eastern, hanging wall flank of the host granitoid body returned a mineralized intercept of 2.45 g/t gold over 15 m from a down-hole depth of 110 m, approximately 50 m down plunge of the #KBDD11117 intercept. The mineralization zone was also tested in a west-northwest direction by #KBDD11157 which yielded an intercept of 2.82 g/t gold over 20 m from a down-hole depth of 92 m, approximately 20 m below and 10 m west of the #KBDD11151 intercept.
Hole #KBDD11154 consisted of the re-drilling (i.e. twinning) of #KBDD11153 which was abandoned at 128 m due to technical difficulties; with the boreholes having the same basic trace down to the 128 metre mark. KBDD11154 was drilled to a final depth of 344 m. The northeast trending boreholes, drilled down the dip extension of the host granitoid body in order to obtain additional information on the structural controls of the mineralization, dissected the extensive system of south-westerly dipping, sheeted quartz veining in a down-plunge fashion along the mineralization shoot. These holes were collared adjacent to hole #KBRC09060, a due east trending scout RC borehole, which returned an intercept from surface of 39.0 m grading 9.23 g/t gold uncut (3.54 g/t gold cut). KBDD11154 returned a mineralized intercept of 81 m grading 1.52 g/t gold from a down-hole depth of 3 m, including 2.94 g/t gold over 13.5 m, 2.56 g/t gold over 19 m, and 2.21 gold over 10 m. The borehole also yielded additional intercepts of 7 m grading 2.20 g/t gold and 6.23 g/t gold over 1 m from down-hole depths of 169 m and 190 m, respectively.
Double 19 Zone (Zone 3 Gold-In-Soil Anomaly)
Gold assay results for the first two trenches (109 m) of an ongoing trenching program to follow-up on very encouraging 2008 trenching and 2009 scout RC drilling results on the Double 19 Zone, located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,250 m long Zone 3 gold-in-soil trend; approximately 600 metres southwest of the South Ridge Zone on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly, are noted hereunder. The trenching program is designed to further define the geometry of the host diorite body and the structural controls of the mineralization in preparation for diamond drilling in the first quarter of 2012.
Trench #TAD022 (58 m) and road cut #ADRS001 (51 m) consisting of southeast and northwest trending excavations with a common start point yielded a combined channel sample intercept of 2.27 g/t gold over a 36 m trench-length, including 2 m grading 22.22 g/t gold, approximately 40 m southwest of the #TAD019 discovery trench. The Double 19 Zone is characterized by an extensive system of granitoid-hosted, NE-trending, moderately NW-dipping, sheeted quartz veins exhibiting a spatial relationship with northeasterly trending shearing.
For reference purposes, RC hole #KBRC09019 targeting the #TAD019 trench returned a mineralized intercept of 30 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 6.47 g/t gold over 14 m, from a down-hole depth of 8 m; with the discovery trench yielding a channel sample intercept of 4.93 g/t gold over a 45 m trench-length, including 12 m grading 10.12 g/t gold.
Drilling Progress
As at the year ended December 31, 2011, 80 holes totalling 21,795 m have been completed by our company in our 2011 Drill Program.
Gold Intercept Reporting Criteria
Unless otherwise indicated, “Reported Intercepts” represent core-lengths; true width of mineralization is unknown at this time. Individual sample results were length weighted to yield average composite interval grades as reported. Unless otherwise indicated “Significant Intercepts” satisfy following criteria: greater than (>) 5.0 gram gold x metre product and > 0.5 g/t gold. “Anomalous” signifies at least one intercept > 2.0 gram gold x metre product and > 0.25 g/t gold. Unless otherwise indicated intercepts are constrained with a 0.25 g/t gold minimum cut-off grade at the top and bottom of the intercept, with no upper cut-off grade applied, and a maximum of five consecutive metres of internal dilution (less than 0.25 g/t gold). All internal intervals yielding above 15 g/t gold are indicated within the intersection.

Quality-Control Program
We have implemented a quality-control program to ensure best practice in the sampling and analysis of the drill core, RC samples and trench channel samples. Drill core is HQ diameter (63.5 mm) in upper oxidized material (regolith) and NQ diameter (47.6 mm) in the lower fresh rock portion of the hole. Drill core is saw cut and half the core is sampled in standard intervals. The remaining half of core is stored in a secure location. RC samples are taken at one meter intervals under dry drilling conditions by experienced geologists, with all samples weighed on site. Trench samples consist of continuous, horizontal channels collected from a canal excavated along the bottom sidewall of the trench (~ 0.10 meter above floor). All samples are transported in security-sealed bags to ALS. ALS is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory. As of the date of this Report, a 250 gram split of the sample is pulverized to better than 85% passing 75 microns, and analyzed by industry standard 50 gram fire assay fusion with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish. Samples with observed visible gold and/or exhibiting typical Kibi-type granitoid hosted mineralization characterized by liberated, particulate gold grains are pulverized in their entirety to better than 85% passing 75 microns, and analyzed four (4) times by industry standard 50 gram fire assay fusion with AAS finish; with the arithmetic average of the four (4) assays reported. Our company inserts a certified reference standard (low to high grade), analytical blank, and field duplicate sample in every batch of 20 drill core / RC chip / trench channel samples. Validation parameters are established in the database to ensure quality control.
2012 Diamond Drill Program
Initial Results of 2012 Drill Program
As at the date of this Report, we have drilled a total of 37 holes for a total of 7,843 m of core. The present drilling is designed to further delineate/infill the Big Bend Zone - Central Granitoid and the South Ridge Granitoid Zone; as well as further test/delineate other prominent gold systems and geophysical/geochemical anomalies along the approximately 5.5 km NE-trending Kibi Gold Trend. The 37 holes (#KBDD12186 to #KBDD12222) drilled in this year’s campaign to date include:
3 holes (1,092 m) on the Big Bend Zone;
3 holes (381 m) on the South Ridge Granitoid Zone in Zone 2;
10 holes (2,293 m) on the Double 19 Zone in Zone 3 - East;
4 holes (491 m) on the Kibi Old Mine prospect;
3 holes (782 m) on Zone 1;
10 holes (2,184 m) on the Zone 4 Gold Trend; and
4 holes (620 m) testing grassroots geophysical targets with coincidental gold-in-soil anomalies.
Double 19 Zone (Zone 3 - East Gold-In-Soil Anomaly)
The Double 19 Zone located at the south-eastern extremity of the approximately 1,250 m long Zone 3 gold-in-soil trend, approximately 600 m southwest of the South Ridge Zone on the Zone 2 gold-in-soil anomaly, was tested by a 10 hole (2,293 m) drill program designed to further define the mineralization along strike and at depth, gain additional insight on the mineralization’s structural setting, and further delineate the geometry of the host diorite body. The Double 19 Zone is characterized by an extensive system of granitoid-hosted, NE-trending, moderately NW-dipping, sheeted quartz veins exhibiting a spatial relationship with northeasterly trending shearing. To date, the mineralization has been traced over an approximately 125 m distance along the diorite body and to a vertical depth of 175 m.
The present drilling program was designed to follow-up on very encouraging trenching and 2009 scout RC drilling results. RC hole #KBRC09019 targeting the #TAD019 trench returned a mineralized intercept of 30 m grading 3.52 g/t gold, including 6.47 g/t gold over 14 m, from a down-hole depth of 8 m; with the discovery trench yielding a channel sample intercept of 4.93 g/t gold over a 45 m trench-length, including 12 m grading 10.12 g/t gold. Trench #TAD022 (58 m) and road cut #ADRS001 (51 m) consisting of southeast and northwest trending excavations with a common start point yielded a significant channel sample intercept of 2.27 g/t gold over a 36 m trench-length, including 2 m grading 22.22 g/t gold, approximately 40 m southwest of the #TAD019 discovery trench. Trenching is ongoing on the Double 19 Zone to further define the surface extent of the mineralization and the geometry of the host diorite body.
Kibi Gold Mine Prospect
The Kibi Old Mine prospect located at the north-central extremity of the Apapam Mining Lease was the focus of exploration and underground development work in the mid 1920’s and late 1930’s; including a main shaft sunk to a depth of 172 feet (~ 52.5 m) with levels driven at depths of 65 feet and 150 feet (~20 m and ~45.5 m). Mineralization consists of a series of auriferous quartz veins emplaced within sheared Birimian metasedimentary rock; spatially associated with a geophysically-interpreted dilational jog developed along a regional NE-trending structure. The present drilling encompassed 4 holes (491 m) designed to better characterized the gold grade and structural setting of the Kibi Old Mine vein system, including; 3 holes targeting the down dip extension of the veining below the 150 foot level at vertical depths of approximately 60 m to 145 m; and a shallow vertical hole testing the veining above the 65 foot level.

Zone 1 Target
Three holes (782 m) were drilled on the Zone 1 gold-in-soil anomaly to follow up on 2008 scout drill hole KBD08017 which yielded intermittent, exploration significant, anomalous gold values over a 60 m core length, including individual intercepts of 1.43 g/t gold over 13.5 m, 1.04 g/t gold over 6 m and 1.02 g/t gold over 8 m. The Zone 1 target is characterized by shear-hosted gold mineralization developed within a tightly folded metasedimentary (turbititic) rock sequence; spatially associated with an induced polarization (IP)/resistivity anomaly lying along a geophysically-inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend.
Scout Drilling Program - Zone 4 Target
A 10 hole (2,184 m) scout drilling program was conducted on the Zone 4 Target area to test high priority geophysical, soil geochemical, and geological targets along the 3.5 km long Zone 4 gold trend located within the south-western portion of the Apapam Mining Lease. The Zone 4 trend is characterized by a NE-trending, chargeable/resistive induced polarization (IP) anomaly exhibiting a spatial relationship with a Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic (VTEM) - inferred, NE-trending, regional structural trend, and characterized by coincidental gold-in-soil anomalies and/or auriferous, sheared, silicified/sulphidized, metasedimentary rock floats.
Phase II Soil Geochemistry Program
Approximately 90% of the first pass soil geochemistry survey, initiated in June 2011, covering an approximately 25 km2 area encompassing the south-eastern portion (70%) of the Apapam Mining Lease and the contiguous Akim Apapam reconnaissance license area has been completed. To date, approximately 106.5 km of NW-SE trending cross-lines have been established with a total of 4,162 samples collected at a sampling density of 200 m x 25 m; including a total of 2,129 samples submitted to the laboratory for gold analysis. As per program design every second sample (50 m stations) was initially submitted for gold analysis; with the “held - back” samples to be subsequently analyzed where required to delineate / bracket anomalous gold-in-soil anomalies. Based on gold results received to date for 1,991 samples, as at the date of this Report, approximately 900 in-fill (25 m station) samples have been selected for analysis to further define the newly detected anomalous gold-in-soil trends. Gold-in-soil anomalies exhibit a close spatial relationship with an array of structural features associated with a geophysically-interpreted dilational jog developed along a regional NE-trending structure.
Follow-up hand auger sampling and scout trenching is also planned to investigate the subsurface geochemical signature of the gold-in-soil anomalies.
Future Exploration Plans
We plan to continue our 2012 Drill Program throughout 2012 at an estimated cost of $5,000,000.
Resources and Reserves
No mineral resources or mineral reserves have been identified on our Kibi Project. As at the date of this Report, we have commissioned SEMS to prepare an initial NI 43-101-compliant mineral resource estimate on the Big Bend and East Dyke gold zones located within Zone 2 of our Kibi Project.
Apapam Mining Lease
XG Mining’s interest in the Kibi Project was previously held by a prospecting license granted by the Government of Ghana on March 29, 2004 covering a licensed area of 33.65 sq km. Subsequently, in May 2008, XG Mining made an application to the Government of Ghana to convert the prospecting license to a mining lease. Our application received parliamentary approval resulting in the Government of Ghana granting and registering the Apapam Mining Lease to XG Mining on the following terms and conditions.

Kwabeng Project
Overview
Our Kwabeng Project (also referred to as the “Kwabeng Concession”) is comprised of 44.76 sq km and our company’s interest in the Kwabeng Concession is secured by the Kwabeng Mining Lease (see “Kwabeng Project - Kwabeng Mining Lease” for further details).
- 53 -
Location and Access
The Kwabeng Concession is located in the East Akim District of the Eastern Region of the Republic of Ghana, along the western, lower flank and base of the Atewa Range, approximately 8.5 km north-northwest of our Kibi Project which is located on the Apapam Concession. The eastern boundary of the Kwabeng Concession is demarcated by the Atewa Forest Reserve.
Access to our Kwabeng Project can be gained by driving northwest from the City of Accra on the Accra-Kumasi Trunk Road, which is the main paved national highway, for approximately 110 km until arrival at Anyinam. Make a left hand turn at the road sign that reads “Kwabeng” in the middle of the Town of Anyinam and drive in a southwesterly direction approximately 10 km until arrival at a sign reading “Xtra-Gold Mining” before reaching the town of Kwabeng.
Historical Work
There has been very little exploration for lode source gold deposits at our Kwabeng and Pameng Projects; however, there has been detailed exploration for placer gold deposits. Our Kibi, Kwabeng and Pameng Projects contain approximately 12,583,000 bank cubic meters (“BCM”) with an average grade of 0.568 grams of gold/BCM. In addition to the mineralized material, there is potential to define reserves with further exploration.
The placer gold deposit currently located at our Kwabeng Concession was mined by the former owner in the early 1990’s for 15 months and produced approximately 16,800 ounces of gold before operations were ceased due to mining difficulties as noted hereunder. The placer gold is contained in a gravel deposit distributed across the floor of the river valleys west of the Atewa Range which can easily be excavated.
Prior Exploration by Xtra-Gold
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for any exploration activities conducted by us prior to the three years required by this Report.
2009 to 2011 Exploration Programs
No significant work program was carried out by our company on the Kwabeng Concession during 2009 through to 2011.
Future Exploration Plans for 2012
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date. A mechanized trenching and/or first pass drilling program to further evaluate the Kwabeng Old Mine prospect on our Kwabeng Project is currently under consideration for 2012.
Recovery and Sale of Placer Gold
In January 2007, we commenced an early stage pre-production mining process whereby a sample area of ore was processed, the results of which assisted us in determining the best way and most profitable manner in which to mine the placer gold to be recovered from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project. The foregoing process was internally referred to by our company as a “Bulk Test”. We tested 32,906.70 BCM of mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project that we processed through our floating placer gold washing processing plant and recovered 608.50 ounces of placer gold. Following completion of the Bulk Test, our company made modifications to our Wash Plant. We recovered placer gold from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project since January 19, 2007. In October 2008, we temporarily suspended our operations at the Kwabeng Project while management of our company considered a more economic and efficient manner in which to extract and process the placer gold recovered from the mineralized material at this Project. As at December 31, 2011, we have sold an aggregate of 8,814.82 ounces of placer gold recovered from the mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project, however we did not conduct any recovery of placer gold operations at this Project during the Fiscal Year. We did not have an exclusive agreement with any company or entity to buy the placer gold that we recovered.
Resumption of Recovery of Placer Gold Operations at our Kwabeng Project
As at the date of this Report, we have not resumed recovery of placer gold operations at our Kwabeng Project. As stated elsewhere in this Report, we plan to focus our efforts and our financial resources primarily on planned exploration activities on our Kibi Project. In particular, as of the date of this Report, we have been conducting our 2012 Drill Program at our Kibi Project (see “Kibi Project - 2012 Diamond Drillng Program”) since January 6, 2012. With respect to any mineralized material at our Kwabeng Project, we plan to enter into negotiations with independent Ghanaian contract miners and operators to assume such operations at this Project on fixed payment terms to our company. Also, the current gold price (approximately $1,669 per ounce) is significantly greater compared to the gold price during the previous mining effort by the former operator of this Project (approximately $300 per ounce). On the basis of an annual recovery of placer gold of approximately 360,000 BCM, we anticipate that recovery of placer gold operations at this Project could be sustained for 20 years, however, this will depend upon numerous factors including the grade and commercial recoverability of the mineralized material and the selling gold price at the relevant time.

Former Ownership
In the early 1990’s, the former mining lessee invested approximately $24,000,000 to open and operate a mine at the Kwabeng concession. The mining operation lasted for 15 months and 16,800 ounces of gold was produced before the mine was shut down due to a poor gold price, mining methodology and a lack of funds to continue mining operations.
Resources and Reserves
No mineral resources or mineral reserves have been identified on our Kwabeng Project.
Kwabeng Mining Lease
The Kwabeng Mining Lease is dated July 26, 1989 and is owned and controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; and is registered to our subsidiary, XG Mining, with the remaining 10% free carried interest in XG Mining being held by the Government of Ghana. The Kwabeng Mining Lease covers an area of 44.76 sq km (the “Kwabeng Lease Area”). The Kwabeng Mining Lease has a 30 year term expiring on July 26, 2019. We have been granted surface and mining rights by the Government of Ghana to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area (including processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials). See “Kibi Project - Apapam Mining Lease” for identical terms for the Kwabeng Mining Lease, except for the name of the mining lease, the lease registration particulars, the lease area and annual rental fees payable in the amount of approximately $19 (GH¢32.80) .
The Kwabeng Mining Lease further provides that XG Mining shall report forthwith to the Government Authorities in the event we discover any other minerals in the Kwabeng Lease Area, who in turn will provide XG Mining with the first option to prospect further and to work the said minerals subject to satisfactory arrangements made between XG Mining and the Government Authorities.

All gold results for the following exploration programs are reported in “ppm Au” (part per million gold). The term “ppm” represents “part per million” where 1 ppm = 1 gram per tonne (g/t) = 1,000 part per billion (ppb).
2009 to 2010 Exploration Programs
Our Muoso Project is at an early stage of evaluation and no mineralized material or mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates have been made.
2009 and 2010 Trenching Program
From December 1, 2009 to February 20, 2010, we conducted a 546 linear-meters trenching program at our Muoso Project. Details of the trenching program are noted below under “Ankaase Trench 2009 Trenching Program”.
Ankaase Trend Auger Sampling
As a follow up to the Phase II (2006) soil geochemistry survey, a hand-auger program was implemented on the Ankaase gold-in-soil anomaly located at the eastern extremity of the Muoso Concession. The auger sampling was designed to test the geochemical signature of the gold-in-soil anomalies at depth within the saprolite horizon in order to better define trenching targets. A total of 99 sites, totaling 371 linear-meters, were augered to an average depth of approximately 3.75 m (5 m max.). A one (1) m sample was collected from the saprolite horizon at the bottom of each hole. Auger hole spacing was typically at 25 m, with some 12.5 meter infilling.
The anomalous threshold for the auger sample results was set at 0.10 ppm gold based on past work experience in the Kibi Belt. 21 (21%) out of the 99 auger samples returned gold values greater than the 0.10 ppm anomalous threshold; including four samples over 0.5 ppm and a maximum value of 2.46 ppm. The auger sampling proved to be an efficient trench target definition method.
Ankaase Trend 2009-2010 Trenching Program
The 2009-2010 trenching program encompassed 12 hand dug trenches, ranging from 30 m to 68 m in length and from 1.2 m to 3.5 m in depth, and totaling 546.0 linear meters. This trenching program commenced on December 1, 2009 and was completed on February 20, 2010. By the end of 2009, five trenches totaling approximately 208.0 m had been excavated and channel sampled. The reconnaissance follow-up trenching was designed to better define the structural controls of the mineralization identified during the initial 2008 scout trenching program.
2011 Exploration Program
No significant lode gold exploration work was conducted by our company in 2011 on our Muoso Project, however, Buccaneer carried out exploration work in 2011 in preparation for the Buccaneer Drill Program noted hereunder.
Future Exploration Plans for 2012
As at the date of this Report, we have not planned for any additional exploration activities during the next 12 months, however, we may consider doing so at a later date.
Exploration Activities by Buccaneer in 2011 and 2012
With a view to Buccaneer meeting the required exploration expenditures to earn the 55% Interest, Buccaneer commenced exploration activities on this Project during the Fiscal Year including building a road in preparation for drilling and some limited trenching. As at the date of this Report, Buccaneer has commenced the Buccaneer Drill Program on this Project and on our Banso Project. The Buccaneer Drill Program is designed to test several drill targets identified on the Banso and the Muoso Concessions.
- 59 -
The initial drill target on the Muoso Concession is a mineralized shear zone identified in trenches, over strong soil geochemical anomalies combined with geophysical interpretations.
As at the date of this Report, 16 drill holes totaling 2,587 m of drilling have been completed by Buccaneer in the Ankaase area, in the eastern portion of the Muoso Concession.
Assay results received by Buccaneer from Intertek Lab, in Tarkwa, Ghana, have indicated the following gold mineralized intersections:
Assay results for holes AN12-05 and AN12-07 to AN12-16 are still pending.
The gold mineralization encountered in Ankaase is typical for the Kibi Gold Belt and exhibits many similar features to Ghana’s main gold belt, the Ashanti Belt. It consists of lode gold deposit, with structurally controlled mineralization.
Typical mineralization occurs in dioritic sills and in meta-volcanic host units, and is characterized by the presence of quartz-carbonate veining and sulphide mineralization.
Resources and Reserves
No mineral resources or mineral reserves have been identified on our Muoso Project.
Muoso Mining Lease
The Muoso Mining Lease is dated January 6, 2011 and is owned and controlled by Xtra-Gold, as to a 90% interest; and is registered to our subsidiary, XG Mining, with the remaining 10% free carried interest being held by the Government of Ghana.

Edum Banso Project
Location and Access
The Edum Banso Concession lies within the south Ashanti gold belt in the Western Region of Ghana and is located approximately 235 km west of Accra and 15 km northwest of Takoradi, the regional capital. The north-western extremity of this concession falls within the grounds of the Benso Oil Palm Plantation.
Overview
We previously held an interest, from 2005 through the Fiscal Year covered by this Report, in the Edum Banso Concession (also referred to in our previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as the “Edum Banso Project”). The Edum Banso Concession is comprised of 20.60 sq km and lies at the southern extremity of the Ashanti gold belt in the Western Region of Ghana.
In October, 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, XGEL, entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Adom Mining Limited (“Adom”) to acquire 100% of Adom’s right, title and interest in and to a prospecting license on the Edum Banso Concession. Adom further granted XG Exploration the right to explore, develop, mine and sell mineral products from this concession. The prospecting license was renewed by Adom for a two year period expiring on July 21, 2013.
The consideration paid for the Option Agreement was $15,000 with additional payments of $5,000 to be paid on the anniversary date of the Option Agreement in each year during the term which term has been extended to November 11, 2013. Further net smelter royalty payments, based on proven and probable reserves and gold production, was also payable to Adom.
Assignment of Interest
During August 2011, our company assigned its interest in the Edum Banso Project to Norman Cay Development, Inc. (“NCD”) for cash of $125,000 (paid in the Fiscal Year), 1,000,000 NCD shares, valued at $260,000 on the date of issuance (issued to our company in the Fiscal Year), and a final option payment of $135,000 payable in six months from the date of assignment of the option interest (paid subsequent to the Fiscal Year). If NCD did not exercise its six-month option the Project reverted to our company. Of the payments received, $20,000 reduced the carrying value of the Edum Banso Project on the balance sheet and the balance reduced exploration spending in the third quarter of 2011.
General
Please refer to our annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC for further details including exploration activities conducted by us.
