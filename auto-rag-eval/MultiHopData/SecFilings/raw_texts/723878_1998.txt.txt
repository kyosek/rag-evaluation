MESSAGE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
Company Overview
1998-A Year of Building for the Future Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. entered 1998 with the objective of aggressively expanding its branch network. In the midst of continued mergers and consolidations within our industry, Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. seized the opportunity to enter new marketplaces and build new relationships (not just branches) by offering quality customer service and localized decision making.
The past year could be described as the Company's most hectic, yet most exciting year. During 1998, the following events had a major impact on our branch network:
March 18 - Dickson City Branch in Wal-Mart Supercenter opened. April 1 - Lackawaxen Branch opened. May 18 - Wilkes-Barre Mortgage Loan Center opened. June 17 - Honesdale Branch in the Wal-Mart Supercenter opened. August 24 - Taylor Branch opened. August 31 - Tannersville Branch opened. September 8 - Groundbreaking for the Wilkes-Barre Boulevard Branch - expected to open Spring, 1999. September 9 - Purchased the Mellon Bank Mountainhome Branch. September 14- Wilkes-Barre Public Square Branch opened. November 23 - East Mountain Branch in Scranton opened. December 7 - Kingston Branch opened. December 11 - Sold Lackawaxen Branch to Honesdale National Bank. December 11 -Sold Lake Wallenpaupack Branch to Honesdale National Bank.
Our financial franchise has now been established to span five counties with 22 banking locations. The ultimate challenge starts in 1999 and continues into the 21st Century - "Achieving outstanding financial performance and value for our stockholders." Costs associated with the expansion of our branch network had a negative impact on this year's earnings. A full year's effect of these operations will hamper earnings during 1999, but we are optimistic that most of our new branches will become profitable within two years and, therefore, have a positive effect on earnings in the near future.
Stockholders' Value Significant events during 1998 had major impacts on the Company's capital position: - - 5% stock dividend - - Cash dividend increased by 8% - - Cash dividend increased 17th consecutive year - - 10.27% Return on Average Equity
At year-end 1998, our Company was in a very strong capital position. Stockholders' equity was at $38 million. The Tier I, or core capital ratio was 14.07% and the total risk-based capital ratio was at 14.96%, this is in comparison to regulatory minimums of 4% and 8%, respectively. The new capital raised in December, 1997 has been used to continue the Bank's expansion goals.
During 1998, for the 17th consecutive year, the Company increased its per share cash dividend from $0.38 in 1997 to $0.41 in 1998, an 8% increase and, also, for the third consecutive year, paid a 5% stock dividend. Per share information for all prior years has been restated to reflect the effects of this stock dividend.
Our return on average stockholders' equity for 1998 was 10.27%, down from 15.24% in 1997 due to the weighted average effect in 1998 of the sale of $12 million of common stock in December, 1997. Return on stockholders' equity is arguably the most important measure of a bank's performance.
Book value increased from $7.50 in 1997 to $7.87 in 1998, an increase of 5%. The Company's (LABN) market price closed at $12.375 per share on December 31, 1998 as compared to $17.75 at December 31, 1997. While the closing market price at December 31, 1998 was somewhat disappointing, the price represents 16 times earnings and 157% of book value.
Net Income
1998 proved to be another strong earnings performance for the Company: - - Record Earnings - - $3,771,000 - up 10% - - Return On Average Assets - 0.88% - - 12% Growth in Net Interest Income - - Earnings per share - basic - $0.79 - - Earnings per share - diluted - $0.77
The Company's net income for 1998 was $3,771,000, 9.9% higher than the $3,431,000 reported for 1997. Net income was positively influenced by a 12.2% growth in net interest income and a 45.1% growth in other operating income. Overhead costs were $11.5 million for 1998, an increase of $2.2 million or 24.3% from $9.2 million reported in 1997. Overhead costs were greatly impacted by the growth in the number of branch offices in 1998.
Operating earnings for the year were at $0.79 per share - basic and $0.77 per share - diluted compared to $0.88 per share - basic and $0.84 diluted in 1997. Return on average assets was 0.88% for 1998.
Growth 1998 proved to be another year of exceptional increases: - Assets - 29.0% - Deposits - 11.5% - Loans - 7.9% - Investment Securities - 67.6%
Total assets increased to $474.7 million at year-end 1998, an increase of $106.6 million or 29.0% from $368.1 million at December 31, 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to a $16.5 million growth in securities and $77.6 million growth in net loans and leases.
Investment securities increased to $192.4 million at year-end, an increase of $77.6 million or 67.6% from $114.8 million at December 31, 1997. This increase was attributable to an investment strategy implemented during 1998 whereby the Company borrowed $75 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ("FHLB") and invested in a combination of various fixed and variable rate investments.
Total net loans increased to $224.7 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $16.5 million or 7.9% from $208.2 million at December 31, 1997. For the year 1998, residential mortgage loans increased to $106.7 million, an increase of $3.7 million or 3.4% from $103.0 million at December 31, 1997. This increase was attributable to the increased mortgage loan activity during the period, particularly during the second half of 1998, net of mortgage loans sold during 1998 of approximately $34.9 million. As of year end, LA Bank was servicing over $141 million in residential mortgage loans.
During 1998, total deposits increased to $312.7 million, an increase of $32.3 million or 11.5% from $280.5 million at December 31, 1997.
Strengthening the Organization - Branches, Personnel and Technology
In order to accommodate our growth during 1998 the following personnel changes were made. Branch operations were enhanced with the promotions of Treva J. Day to Vice President, Regional Branch Administrator of Monroe, Pike and Wayne Counties and Lynn P. Thiel to Vice President, Regional Branch Administrator of Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties. Other promotions include Lisa Dowse, Branch Manager, Lake Ariel; Joann Simyan, Assistant Branch Manager, Mt. Cobb; Saundra Roeckel, Branch Sales Manager and Ellen Juseck, Assistant Branch Sales Manager of our first in-store location in the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Dickson City and Deborah Aragona, Branch Sales Manager and Annemarie Roberts,
Assistant Branch Sales Manager of our second in-store location in the Honesdale Wal-Mart Supercenter; Marjorie Kunkle, Branch Manager, Tannersville; Lauri Nidoh, Branch Manager, Steamtown and Scranton; Debra Skurkis, Branch Manager, Public Square; Sybil Kline, Branch Manager, East Mountain; Patricia Williamson, Branch Manager, Kingston; Lisa Akulonis, Branch Manager, Eynon and Mary Auffhammer, Branch Manager, Keyser Valley and Maryann McManus, Branch Manager, Wilkes-Barre Boulevard.
Our sales team was refined with the addition of John Gouse as a Business Development Officer for Monroe and Pike Counties; Mary Beth Pasqualicchio, Branch Sales Officer; Cathy Langan, Mortgage Originator for Wayne County; Paul Ochman, Mortgage Originator for Luzerne County; William Zernhelt, Mortgage Originator for Pike County, and Theresa Yocum, Mortgage Originator for Monroe County.
The lending staff was reinforced with the addition of Maureen Straub, Senior Vice President, Commercial Loan Officer of Luzerne County; Paul Freeman, Vice President, Commercial Loan Officer; Peter Misura, Assistant Vice President, Consumer Loan Officer; Susan Mroczka, Consumer Loan Officer; Scott Hiller, Assistant Vice President, Credit Analyst; and, Lawrence Highhouse, Assistant Vice President, Collection Department Manager.
Finally, Daniel Santaniello was promoted to Senior Operations Officer and Francis Chinchar to Data Processing Supervisor.
In January, 1999, Kenneth M. Pollock, President of HUD, Inc. t/a Emerald Anthracite II, from Luzerne County, was appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. He currently serves on the Boards of Pennsylvania Enterprises, Inc., PG Energy, and Penn State Wilkes-Barre Campus. We welcome Mr. Pollock's vast experience and business leadership to our Company.
As a result of our new and increased presence in additional market areas, we have expanded our Business Development Boards to include Monroe and Luzerne County Boards. We have also appointed new, energetic members to the existing Development Boards. We fully expect these Boards to provide an additional source of referrals and new customers within the market areas they serve.
Marketing, Products and Services During 1998, the Company retained the services of a professional advertising agency to develop a new marketing campaign to assist in the marketing of the new branches which opened during the year. The Senior Management team felt a strong campaign would also help launch our expansion into Luzerne County where the Company had little name recognition. Print and television ads, direct mail pieces and billboard treatments were developed which proved to be an overwhelming success in all areas, not just Luzerne County.
Home equity loans and mortgage loans were aggressively marketed throughout the year, which resulted in a record number of new loans originated. LA Bank became one of the first community banks in the area to develop a Reverse Mortgage Program, targeting senior citizens. This specialized program allows seniors to borrow against the equity in their home, which then generates monthly income that allows the money necessary for seniors to live a more comfortable lifestyle and remain in their homes. In addition, the Bank was identified through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as the number one lender in Northeastern Pennsylvania for conventional home purchase mortgage loans.
During the first quarter of 1998, the Bank's newly formed company, Ariel Financial Services, Inc., was introduced to employees through a series of training sessions. Customers received communications throughout the year regarding the services offered by Ariel Financial Services, Inc. and the Bank's highly-trained investment specialists marketed the Company's products and services to customers throughout the Bank's current twenty-one office branch network.
Also, during the first quarter, two new retirement products were added to the Bank's product line. The Education IRA and Roth IRA were introduced in response to significant changes in legislation signed into law under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
In response to the mandates of Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1999 (EFT99), new legislation affecting the direct deposit of government retirement funds, the Bank's senior citizen program was heavily marketed throughout the year to attract new customers. A senior citizen seminar was held in April which addressed the new direct deposit mandate, investment services, estate planning and reverse mortgages. The Bank's new senior travel club was also introduced. The inaugural season of the travel club was an overwhelming success. The group traveled to the Grand Candlelight Dinner Theater in Milton, Atlantic City casinos and closed the year with a trip to The Big Apple to see a Broadway play.
The first of our SmartLine electronic banking products was introduced. The SmartLine telephone voice response unit allows customers to access their accounts, get information on certificates of deposit, loans, transfer funds between accounts and obtain current deposit and loan rate information via a touch-tone telephone. The new system allows customers 24-hour access to account information without the assistance of a bank employee. Bill- payment services will be added to the SmartLine in early spring of 1999.
The Bank kept abreast of current product marketing via the World Wide Web by incorporating our print advertising with the `What's New Page'. In addition to the outward change of our address to www.labank.com, LA Bank has greatly improved our Internet speed and accessibility by housing our own website. Browsers may now contact senior management and department heads directly from the web page. LA Bank employees are afforded the opportunity to procure product and sales manuals, in addition to employee handbooks via the recently established intranet. This greatly reduces the amount of paper used and allows for immediate updates and enhanced communication and efficiencies within the Bank.
For the third consecutive year, we achieved two top ratings from national financial review organizations. The Bank received IDC Financial Publishing, Inc.'s Superior ranking and Bauer Financial Reports, Inc.'s 5-Star rating, which recognizes the Bank as one of the safest financial institutions in the United States. In addition, the Bank earned the distinction of an award given by the Pennsylvania Community Bankers for the best community project in our asset size during Community Banking week.
With the addition of our two new in-store branches, an entirely different sales program was developed for these branches. The new program includes extensive sales training for the staff, focusing on in-aisle selling, development of sales promotions, and employee incentives. Each month, the branch staff develops two promotions, which run concurrently during the month. The staff are required during the day to go out in the aisle and talk to shoppers about the convenience of 7-day a week banking, our products and services. The sales staff at both in-store branches have developed unique and attractive promotions that have contributed to the success of each of the branches.
Community Reinvestment and Development During 1998, LA Bank continued to meet the credit needs of low and moderate income families within their market area by offering innovative mortgage products and participating with other local banks and agencies in providing financing to families who would not normally qualify for traditional mortgage loans. In addition, many of the Bank's loan officers are actively involved with community organizations that focus on housing and credit needs. The Bank's commitment to the communities it serves was confirmed when the Bank was notified by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1998 that the Bank is the number one Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) lender for conventional home purchase mortgages within Northeastern Pennsylvania. We are all very proud of this achievement.
The Bank's "Welcome Neighbor" program for first time homebuyers in the low and moderate income level was revised and improved during the year. Over $61 million of these loans were originated during 1998.
The Bank is also involved with the Office of Economic & Community Development in the City of Scranton, which assists low and moderate income individuals who are interested in becoming first time homeowners. The Bank's management team works with a consortium of other local lenders in underwriting and funding these loans.
LA Bank also participates with the Pike County Planning and Development Authority to rehabilitate residential real estate. The county provides grant money and the Bank provides financing to low and moderate income individuals who are remodeling deteriorated primary homes. Twenty-six loans were originated during 1998 for a total of $286,000.
Year In Review For the year ended December 31, 1998, LA Bank achieved substantial growth and posted record high profits. We are very proud of this year's efforts and performance and believe our aggressive strategy gives us reason for optimism for future years.
Looking to the future, management believes that an excellent financial institution has been established. The Company has exercised a broad involvement in the various communities it serves and continues to meet the credit needs of all community segments. We believe that the Company's current commercial and retail loan growth momentum, balance sheet strength, and increased market share provide the nucleus for continued and improved earnings trends.
We thank our Board of Directors, Business Development Boards, management and employees for making 1998 a very successful year. Their effort and support, coupled with invaluable experience, are appreciated by all of us. Once again, as a stockholder, we sincerely hope that you continue to support, promote and patronize LA Bank so that we may continue in our efforts to grow as a strong locally-owned community bank.

BOARD
While the average LA Bank customer would not be nearly as familiar with the faces of the Board members as they are with those of our staff which serves them daily, it is the directives of our Board and their policy decisions that impact the products and services our customers benefit from and from which our stockholders ultimately derive financial reward. It is this entrepreneurial spirit that has given us the momentum to expand, improving the products and services we offer our customers, and culminating with our proud tradition of financial reward to our stockholders. Our aggressive expansion into now a five county territory, including the Luzerne County location pictured here, provides new opportunities to the diverse populations of the communities we serve. We welcome the new customer base which further increases our market share and overall performance.
LUZERNE COUNTY
Luzerne County has become a focal point for our continuing strength and expansion. In May, 1998 we opened our first dedicated Mortgage Loan Center, followed in September by a full-service branch at the same Luzerne County landmark site, Public Square. December ushered in the opening of our Kingston Branch, situated adjacent to the cherry-blossomed banks of the Susquehanna River. We expect our third Luzerne County branch on the Wilkes-Barre Boulevard to open in the spring of 1999. Our main Luzerne County location, this branch will also be home for our Luzerne County commercial lending and other lending functions.
There is no doubt that Public Square (pictured here) has long been the spiritual center of Luzerne County. The Square houses other prominent landmarks, including the Greater Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Business and Industry Center, the Kirby Center for the Performing Arts, and, within walking distance, the Greco-Roman style Luzerne County Courthouse. Nearby, numerous educational institutions and businesses help shape the surrounding culture of our new locations and accent the Public Square that symbolizes the aspirations of creating fine public spaces for all to enjoy.
LACKAWANNA COUNTY
LA Bank's presence in Lackawanna County has been recently marked by our Financial Center, located in the heart of downtown Scranton. Simultaneously, the greater Scranton area itself is becoming more identified with the concept of Steamtown. Steamtown National Historic Site, pictured here, is truly a landmark of national recognition. Drawing thousands of domestic and international rail fans and historians, Steamtown is a memorial to one of the most prosperous times in the history of the County. Today, one can enjoy the exhilaration of stepping back in time to enjoy an excursion spotlighting the beauty of the Valley. As it is true that life, times and means of transportation change, 1998 brought about the opening of our newest Lackawanna branch locations at Dickson City, located in the new Wal-Mart Supercenter; downtown Taylor; and, Meadow Avenue, located in the busy East Mountain area of Scranton.
WAYNE COUNTY
Despite LA Bank's multiple expansions throughout a five-county region of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Wayne County -- the site of the founding of our precursor, the First National Bank of Lake Ariel -- remains the spiritual home to many who know the history of our founding on November 10, 1910. Today, Wayne County houses three additional branches, including our newest office located inside the Honesdale Wal-Mart Supercenter. Our Hamlin and Newfoundland locations complete the list of our other Wayne County locations. This traditional rural character is immediately evident from a drive through the Wayne County countryside, where farming remains a way of life. The values of the farming lifestyles are the landmark so reflective of this county. This lifestyle is well represented by the Walter Krompasky Farm, principally a dairy operation, and one of the oldest working farms located in the region.
PIKE COUNTY
Pike County is home to three LA Bank branches, including one in downtown Milford. The Columns, home to the Museum of the Pike County Historical Society, a landmark of rich architectural distinction, can be seen when visiting our branch. This county shares the tremendous natural beauty of the Pocono Mountains bordering Monroe County, and together are noted as two of the fastest growing counties in Pennsylvania. The Columns, pictured here, is proof that, despite the Pocono's recreational opportunities and astounding natural aesthetics, it has man-made wonders of equal beauty. Built originally as a summer estate for a textile magnate before being deeded to the Historical Society in 1930, The Columns is best known as the home of the Lincoln Flag, historically authenticated as the flag which was placed under the head of the assassinated President as he lay dying.
MONROE COUNTY
A popular destination for tourists seeking to enjoy the fun the outdoors offers, Monroe County was carved out of the original Northampton County, itself one of the great land grants presented by the King of England to William Penn. The county features spectacular recreational terrain and immense natural beauty. The natural beauty of the Pocono Mountains in the county itself is a true landmark and this beauty is captured in the spectacular photo of the Delaware River at Shawnee. Home to one of LA Bank's newest branches, Tannersville is also home to the Crossings, a popular shopping epicenter located just across the border from New Jersey.
Responsibilities for Preparation of Financial Statements
The management of Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. ("the Company") is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the financial statements, as well as other information contained in the annual report. Estimates are an integral part of preparing financial statements as management must make informed judgements about the expected effects of events and transactions prior to their definitive resolution.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, the Company depends on its system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with the appropriate corporate authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Although accounting control procedures are designed to achieve these objectives, it must be recognized that errors or irregularities may nevertheless occur. The effectiveness of the system of accounting controls is reviewed continually throughout the year by an established program of internal audit. These controls are constantly modified and improved in response to changes in business conditions and operations. The design, monitoring and revision of internal accounting controls involve, among other considerations, management's judgement with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The Company believes that its accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions.
Management discharges its responsibility for the financial statements through the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised entirely of Directors who are not Company employees. This responsibility includes general oversight of the Company's accounting system, internal accounting controls, financial accounting and reporting matters and regulatory reports. The independent auditors and the Company's internal audit department have direct access to the Audit Committee, and meet with it, with and without management being present, to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters.
The accompanying financial statements have been audited by Parente, Randolph, Orlando, Carey & Associates, Certified Public Accountants, for the purpose of rendering an independent professional opinion, and their report is included herein.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The consolidated financial review of Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. ("the Company") provides a comparison of the performance of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996. The financial information presented should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report.
Background
The Company is a one bank holding company whose principal subsidiary is LA Bank, N.A. The Company operates 21 full-service branch banking offices in its principal market area in Lackawanna, Luzerne, Monroe, Pike and Wayne Counties. At December 31, 1998, the Company had 174 full-time equivalent employees. The increase, 41 additional over 1997, was due to the additional staffing needs in the new branches.
Analysis of Results of Operation
Overview Net income for 1998 increased to $3.8 million, an increase of $340,000 or 9.9% over 1997. Net income for 1997 was $3.4 million, an increase of $400,000 or 13.2% over 1996. On a per share basis, net income was $0.79 basic and $0.77 diluted in 1998, $0.88 basic and $0.84 diluted in 1997 and $0.78 basic and diluted in 1996. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were 4,906,000, 3,886,000, and 3,686,000, respectively. Earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding reflect adjustment for the 5% stock dividends paid on October 1, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and the two-for-one stock split effective November 10, 1997.
The growth in net income during 1998 was attributable to the volume improvement in net interest income after provision for possible credit losses, which increased to $11.4 million, an increase of $1.0 million or 9.7% over 1997, and which was coupled with an increase in other operating income to $4.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 45.1% over 1997. This increase more than offset the increase in other operating expenses to $11.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million or 24.3% over 1997. The Company continued to focus its efforts toward retail banking services within its existing and new market areas with specific attention given to increasing overall market share.
The growth in net income in 1997 was also attributable to the improvement in net interest income after provision for possible credit losses, which increased to $10.3 million, an increase of $903,000 or 9.6% over 1996 and which was also coupled with an increase in other operating income to $3.4 million, an increase of $695,000 or 25.7% over 1996. This increase more than offset the increase in other operating expenses to $9.2 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 15.2% over 1996.
Analysis of Net Interest Income In 1998, net interest income (tax-equivalent basis) increased to $13.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 11.9% over 1997 levels. Average loans and leases increased to $218.6 million, an increase of $24.6 million or 12.7% over 1997. Average commercial loans grew to $73.4 million, an increase of $12.2 million or 20.0% over 1997 levels. Interest income on commercial loans increased to $6.6 million, an increase of $665,000 or 11.1% over 1997. This was due to increased volumes through most of 1998. The national prime rate as reported in a national publication published daily, an index to which the majority of these loans were tied, was 7.75% and 8.50% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Average real estate loans increased 14.5%, which contributed to a 12.0% increase in interest income on real estate loans. Average consumer loans, which included credit card receivables and leases, decreased $1.2 million or 2.9% over 1997, and resulted in no change in related interest income, due to the increased volume and rates from lease financing.
Net interest income (tax-equivalent basis) for 1997 increased to $11.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 12.0% over 1996. This increase was due to the continued strong growth of earning assets, which grew 23.3% over 1996 levels.
On average, investment securities in 1998 increased to $166.2 million, an increase of $52.0 million or 45.5% over 1997 levels. Investment securities in 1997 increased to $114.2 million, an increase of $28.9 million or 33.9% over 1996 levels. Income earned on investment securities increased to $11.4 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 37.8% over 1997. Income earned in 1997 increased to $8.3 million, an increase of $2.2 million or 36.2% over 1996. As is discussed under "Financial Condition", the asset/liability management and investment strategies that were employed during 1998 resulted in increased holdings of investment securities and created an increase in investment income. The mix of securities in the investment portfolio changed slightly during 1998. Taxable securities, which represented 73.9% of the investment portfolio in 1997, increased to 80.2% or $133.3 million in 1998. At December 31, 1998, tax-exempt securities represented 19.8% of the portfolio compared to 26.1% in 1997 and 23.9% in 1996. In 1998, tax-exempt securities provided similar after-tax investment returns as taxable issues in similar maturity and quality ranges. Accordingly, average balances on state and municipal securities at December 31, 1998 increased to $32.9 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 10.5% over 1997. Average balances on state and municipal securities at December 31, 1997 increased to $29.8 million, an increase of $9.4 million or 46.1% from $20.4 million at December 31, 1996.
Average interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 1998 increased to $243.4 million, an increase of $10.8 million or 4.6% over 1997. Average interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 1997 increased to $232.6 million, an increase of $28.7 million or 14.1% from $203.9 million at December 31, 1996. Savings and interest-bearing demand deposits at December 31, 1998 increased to $77.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 10.1% over 1997. Savings and interest-bearing demand deposits at December 31, 1997 increased to $70.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million or 9.9% from $64.2 million at December 31, 1996. As a percentage of total average interest-bearing deposits, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits represented 32.0% in 1998, 30.4% in 1997 and 31.5% in 1996. Average time deposits (including deposits greater than $100,000) at December 31, 1998 increased to $165.6 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 2.2% over 1997. Average time deposits at December 31, 1997 increased to $162.0 million, an increase of $22.3 million or 15.9% over 1996. As a percentage of total average interest-bearing deposits, time deposits represented 68.0% in 1998, 69.6% in 1997, and 68.5% in 1996. Due to the shift in the mix of deposits, the rates at which they were repricing and the volume increase, interest expense on deposits at December 31, 1998 increased to $10.9 million, an increase of $462,000 or 4.4% over 1997. Interest expense on deposits at December 31, 1997 increased to $10.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 16.1% from $9.0 million at December 31, 1996. These results were reflected in the cost of funds which decreased 2.2% from 1997 through 1998, and increased 1.8% from 1996 to 1997, while volume increased 4.6% and 14.1%, respectively. Interest expense as a percent of earning assets decreased by 2 basis points from 4.32% in 1997 to 4.30% in 1998 due to the rate decrease paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Short-term borrowings, which included federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, averaged $2.2 million in 1998, $2.1 million in 1997 and $3.7 million in 1996. These borrowings remained relatively constant through 1998.
The overall effect of the modest decrease in interest rates paid, the shift in mix of and growth in deposit accounts and long-term debt and the decreasing yields earned on earning assets produced a negative impact on net interest margin. The net interest margin decreased by 38 basis points to 3.43% in 1998 from 3.81% in 1997. The net interest margin was 4.20% in 1996. This result is very indicative of a decreasing rate environment, which took place in 1998. Due to the large volume of variable rate securities and loans tied to the national prime rate, the yield on earning assets decreased to 7.74% from 8.13% in 1997, or a 39 basis point decrease. Similarly, the rate of interest expense as a percent of earning assets decreased from 4.32% to 4.30% or 2 basis points.
The following tables provide an analysis of changes in net interest income with regard to volume, rate and yields of interest-bearing assets and liabilities based on average balances for each period. Components of interest income and expenses are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 34.0% each year.

[/TABLE]
Provision for Possible Credit Losses The provision for possible credit losses for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased to $1.1 million, an increase of $350,000 or 44.9% over 1997. The provision for possible credit losses for 1997 increased to $780,000, an increase of $130,000 or 20.0% from $650,000 for 1996. In 1998, the provision for possible credit losses was 128.4% of net charge-offs, compared to 155.7% in 1997 and 136.3% in 1996. The provision represented management's assessment of the risks inherent in the loan and lease portfolio while providing the amounts necessary to cover potential charge-offs.
Net charge-offs in 1998 increased to $880,000, an increase of $379,000 or 75.6% over 1997. Net charge-offs in 1997 increased to $501,000, an increase of $24,000 or 5.0% from $477,000 in 1996. The net charge-offs in 1998 were primarily attributed to the commercial, consumer installment, and credit card portfolios. The net charge-offs in 1997 were primarily attributed to the consumer installment loans and credit card portfolio. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was at 0.40% for 1998, 0.26% for 1997 and 0.30% for 1996.
Net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans for 1998 were $506,000 or 57.5% of net charge-offs compared to $64,000 or 12.8% of net charge-offs for 1997 and $118,000 or 24.7% of net charge-offs for 1996. Consumer and credit card and real estate related debt accounted for 42.5% in 1998, 87.2% in 1997 and 75.3% in 1996, of net charge-offs, respectively.
Other Operating Income Other operating income in 1998 increased to $4.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 45.0% over 1997. Other operating income in 1997 increased to $3.4 million, an increase of $695,000 or 25.7% from $2.7 million in 1996. Fees generated from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans provided $39,000 or 1.0% in 1998, $183,000 or 5.4% in 1997 and $266,000 or 9.8% in 1996, of other operating income. Mortgage servicing fee income, net of amortization of mortgage servicing rights, decreased in 1998 to $294,000, a decrease of $16,000 or 5.1% over 1997. Such income in 1997 decreased to $310,000, a decrease of $17,000 or 5.2% from $327,000 in 1996. These fees were directly influenced by the volume of loans that were sold in the secondary market and the value of the retained servicing rights. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans occurred when the coupon rates on mortgage loans exceeded or fell short of the yields required by the purchasers. The net gain of $951,000 recorded in 1998, compared with the net gain of $404,000 in 1997 and net gain of $114,000 in 1996, was indicative of the changes in interest rates during the periods in which the sales occurred.
Fee income from service charges on demand deposits, item processing, return items and other service fees increased to $1.6 million in 1998, an increase of $329,000 or 26.4% over 1997. Such income in 1997 remained constant with 1996 at $1.2 million. These fees, which represented 31.9% of other operating income, were influenced by both pricing changes and increases in the number of consumer and business demand deposit accounts which increased $22.8 million or 31.9% in 1998 over 1997.
Net gains on available-for-sale securities represented approximately 8.8% in 1998, 6.3% in 1997 and 1.6% in 1996 of other operating income, respectively. The sales of these securities resulted from the Company's decision to liquidate certain securities to capture market gains with the ability to reinvest in bonds with similar risk and yield.
Included in other income are earnings on directors' and officers' life insurance policies, credit card annual fees and merchant discounts, safe deposit box rentals, rental income on excess office space in four of the Company's branch offices, automated teller machine surcharge income, commissions on check orders and other general service fees. These fees in 1998 increased to $1.7 million, an increase of $673,000 or 67.0% over 1997. These fees in 1997 increased to $1.0 million, an increase of $265,000 or 35.9% from $739,000 in 1996. Automated teller machine surcharge income represented $46,000 of the increase. Earnings on directors' and officers' life insurance policies represented $121,000 of the increase. Rental income represented $55,000 of the increase. A gain of $240,000 on the sale of deposits and fixed assets of two branch offices during the year represents the majority of the remaining increase.
Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses in 1998 increased to $11.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million or 24.3% over 1997. Other operating expenses in 1997 increased to $9.2 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 15.0% from $8.0 million in 1996. Salaries and benefits, which were the most significant of the noninterest expenses, increased in each of the years reported. Salaries and benefits for 1998 increased to $5.0 million, an increase of $807,000 or 19.2% over 1997. Salaries and benefits in 1997 increased to $4.2 million, an increase of $522,000 or 14.2% from $3.7 million in 1996. These increases were due to the additional staffing needs in both new and existing branch and administrative offices, merit increases and the added costs associated with health care insurance and other benefits which were provided by the Company.
Equipment and occupancy expenses in 1998 increased to $2.7 million, an increase of $462,000 or 20.4% over 1997. Such expenses in 1997 increased to $2.3 million, an increase of $389,000 or 20.7% over 1996. Again, these increases were primarily attributable to the growth in the number of branch offices, in addition to overall increases in overhead expenses, maintenance costs, equipment upgrades (including computer hardware and software), and the Year 2000 testing and related equipment costs throughout the branch network.
FDIC insurance assessments decreased from $222,000 in 1995 to $0 in 1998. The decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment reflected the decision by the FDIC in late 1995 to charge well-capitalized banks a $1,000 semi-annual membership fee without any deposit-based insurance premium. In 1998 and 1997, the FDIC charged no membership fee. Foreclosed asset expenses in 1998 were $27,000, a decrease of $12,000 or 30.8% over 1997. The decrease was a result of the sales of properties in 1998 without any material additions. Foreclosed asset expenses in 1997 were $39,000, a decrease of $12,000 or 23.5% over 1996.
Amortization of intangible assets increased to $205,000 in 1998, an increase of $51,000 or 33.1% over 1997, and was related to the premium the Company paid for the core deposits and the deposit customer lists from acquired branch offices. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $154,000 in 1997, an increase of $46,000 or 42.6% over 1996, also related to the acquisition premium paid for core deposits and customer lists. Advertising expenses increased to $430,000 in 1998, an increase of $138,000 or 47.3% over 1997. The increase is the result of expenses associated with a new advertising and promotion campaign developed for 1998 as well as increased marketing costs in our new market segments. Advertising expenses increased to $292,000 in 1997, an increase of $43,000 or 17.3% over 1996.
Other expenses in 1998 increased to $3.3 million, an increase of $847,000 or 35.2% over 1997. Other expenses in 1997 increased to $2.4 million, an increase of $273,000 or 12.8% over 1996. Included in these expenses were such costs as legal fees, professional and audit, state shares' tax, directors' fees and other general branch and administrative operating expenses.
Provision For Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $1.1 million. The effective tax rate for 1998, 1997, and 1996 was 22.0%, 24.4% and 27.0%, respectively.
Financial Condition
December 31, 1998 Compared to December 31, 1997
The Company's total assets increased to $474.7 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $106.6 million or 29.0% from $368.1 million at December 31, 1997. The increase in assets was primarily attributable to a $16.5 million growth in net loans and a $77.6 million increase in investment securities.
The amortized cost of investment securities, including held-to-maturity (HTM) and available-for-sale (AFS), increased to $192.8 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $78.0 million or 67.9% from $114.8 million at December 31, 1997. The continued attention given to management's asset/liability and investment strategies resulted in an increase in net interest income while controlling interest rate risk. Due to the significant increase in deposits and by again utilizing structured borrowings with the FHLB, the Company was able to purchase both taxable and tax-exempt investments that provided a favorable spread between the interest rate on deposits and borrowings versus the yield on invested funds. During 1998, the Company purchased $75 million of securities with funds borrowed from the FHLB. The strategy that was employed provided a favorable spread between the rates on invested and borrowed funds. At December 31, 1998, gross unrealized gains in the HTM investments were $858,000 while gross unrealized losses amounted to $331,000.
The following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the securities portfolio of the Company at December 31, 1998. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a taxable equivalent basis.
A summary of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 follows (in thousands):
A summary of the outstanding loans and leases by major categories at December 31 is as follows:
Total net loans increased to $224.7 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $16.5 million or 7.9% from $208.2 million at December 31, 1997. The increase in net loans was directly related to the significant growth in commercial loans and residential mortgages. Residential mortgage loans (net of mortgage loans sold during 1998 of $34.9 million), which included real estate construction loans, increased to $106.7 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $3.7 million or 3.5% from $103.0 million at December 31, 1997.
Consumer loans, net of unearned discounts, increased to $41.0 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $2.4 million or 6.2% from $38.6 million at December 31, 1997. Commercial loans increased to $79.3 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $9.8 million or 14.1% from $69.5 million at December 31, 1997. Commercial loans consisted of loans made to small businesses within the Company's market area and were generally secured by real estate and other assets of the borrowers.
Life insurance cash surrender value increased to $8.8 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $900,000 or 11.4% from $7.9 million at December 31, 1997. The policies represent investments in various life insurance contracts to fund directors' deferred compensation plans, a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (SERP) and an officer group term life insurance replacement plan on the executive officers and certain other officers of the Company.
Total deposits increased to $312.7 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $32.3 million or 11.5% from $280.5 million at December 31, 1997. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to $52.4 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $12.7 million or 32.1% from $39.7 million at December 31, 1997. In the aggregate, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased to $80.3 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $12.1 million or 17.8% from $68.2 million at December 31, 1997. As a percentage of total deposits, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits represented 25.7% in 1998, compared to 24.3% in 1997. Savings deposits increased to $38.5 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $2.1 million or 5.7% from $36.4 million at December 31, 1997. Time deposits, which include certificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or more, increased to $180.0 million at December 31, 1998, an increase of $7.4 million or 4.3% from $172.6 million at December 31, 1997. As a percentage of total deposits, these deposits decreased to 57.6% in 1998 from 61.5% in 1997. Approximately $20.7 million or 6.6% of total deposits are from public funds of school districts and local governments located within the Company's market area.
Included in interest-bearing deposits are certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or more. These certificates of deposit and their remaining maturities at December 31 are as follows:
Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets included nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets held for sale. Nonperforming loans consisted of loans where the principal and/or interest was 90 days or more past due and loans that had been placed on nonaccrual status. When loans were placed on nonaccrual status, income from the current period was reversed from current earnings and interest from prior periods was charged to the allowance for possible credit losses. Consumer loans were charged-off when principal or interest was 120 days or more delinquent, or were placed on nonaccrual status if a sufficient amount of collateral existed. The following table shows information concerning loan delinquency and other nonperforming assets of the Company for 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, and 1994:
The following summary shows the impact on interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans for the periods indicated:
Nonperforming loans increased 58.8% from year-end 1997. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.9 million or in excess of three times from year-end 1997. Commercial loans accounted for 87.2% of all nonaccruals, followed by real estate loans at 12.8%. Within the $2.4 million of total nonaccrual loans, 100.0% were secured by mortgages, primarily first liens, against residential or commercial properties. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $694,000 from 1997 year-end levels. These loans included $420,000 in real estate mortgages, $68,000 in consumer credit, $236,000 in commercial loans and $35,000 in leasing. These loans were reviewed by management at its quarterly loan review meetings regarding collection efforts.
Legal proceedings on the nonaccrual loans are ongoing, routine, and reviewed by management on a continuing basis. No material losses are expected as a result of these proceedings.
Foreclosed assets held for sale were $357,000 at year-end 1998 compared to $523,000 at year-end 1997. The decrease was a result of sales during the year without any substantial additions. The Company does not expect any material losses on the sales of these properties based on current appraised values exceeding book values. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results" for factors that could affect sales prices of foreclosed assets.
Potential Problem Loans At December 31, 1998, the Company had approximately $1.3 million of potential problem loans not included in the nonperforming loan classification. Known information about possible credit problems related to these borrowers caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in future classification of such loans as nonperforming. These potential problem loans were taken into consideration by management when determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses at December 31, 1998. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results" for further discussion.
Allowance for Possible Credit Losses The Company determined the provision for possible credit losses through a quarterly review of the loan portfolio. Factors such as changing economic trends; the volume of nonperforming loans; concentrations of credit risk; adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay; prior loss experience within the various categories of the portfolio; and current economic conditions were considered when reviewing the risks in the portfolio. Larger exposures were analyzed individually. Over the past several years, the Company implemented more stringent underwriting standards in commercial lending as this category of loans continues to grow. While management believed the allowance for possible credit losses was adequate, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. The adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses was reviewed quarterly by a loan review committee comprised of members of the Board of Directors and senior management of the Company. The full Board of Directors reviewed the relevant ratios with respect to the allowance after the loan review committee made its recommendations. At December 31, 1998, the allowance for possible credit losses was 1.05% of loans compared to 1.00% at December 31, 1997 and 1.03% at December 31, 1996. For further discussion on factors that could influence the allowance for possible credit losses, see "Factors That May Affect Future Results."
Changes in the allowance for possible credit losses for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were as follows:
The Company's management is unable to determine in what loan category future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses among various categories. At December 31, 1998, approximately 74.1% of the allowance for possible credit losses is allocated to general risk to protect the Company against probable yet undetermined losses. The allocation is based upon historical experience. The entire allowance for possible credit losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.
Interest Rate Risk Management The following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). These forward-looking statements may involve significant risks and uncertainties that are described under the caption "Factors That May Affect Future Results."
Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and earnings volatility due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Company's net interest income is affected by changes in the level of market interest rates. In order to maintain consistent earnings performance, the Company seeks to manage, to the extent possible, the repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities.
Asset/Liability Management. One major objective of the Company when managing the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities is to stabilize net interest income. The management of and authority to assume interest rate risk is the responsibility of the Company's Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO"), which is comprised of senior management and Board members. ALCO meets quarterly to monitor the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities. The process to review interest rate risk management is a regular part of management of the Company. Consistent policies and practices of measuring and reporting interest rate risk exposure, particularly regarding the treatment of noncontractual assets and liabilities, are in effect. In addition, there is an annual process to review the interest rate risk policy with the Board of Directors which includes limits on the impact to earnings from shifts in interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk Measurement. Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures: static gap analysis, earnings at risk simulation and economic value at risk simulation. While each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations, taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the Company and the distribution of risk along the yield curve, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships.
Static Gap. The ratio between assets and liabilities repricing in specific time intervals is referred to as an interest rate sensitivity gap. Interest rate sensitivity gaps can be managed to take advantage of the slope of the yield curve as well as forecasted changes in the level of interest rate changes.
To manage this interest rate sensitivity gap position, an asset/liability model called "static gap analysis" is used to monitor the difference in the volume of the Company's interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within given periods. A positive gap (asset sensitive) indicates that more assets reprice during a given period compared to liabilities, while a negative gap (liability sensitive) has the opposite effect. The Company employs computerized net interest income simulation modeling to assist in quantifying interest rate risk exposure. This process measures and quantifies the impact on net interest income through varying interest rate changes and balance sheet compositions. The use of this model assists the ALCO to gauge the effects of the interest rate changes on interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to determine what impact these rate changes will have upon the net interest spread.
At December 31, 1998, LA Bank maintained a one year cumulative gap of positive $11.6 million or 2.45% of total assets. The effect of this gap position provided a positive mismatch of assets and liabilities which can expose LA Bank to interest rate risk during a period of decreasing interest rates. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, net income could be positively affected because more assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the above table. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. The ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.
Earnings at Risk and Economic Value at Risk Simulations. The Company recognizes that more sophisticated tools exist for measuring the interest rate risk in the balance sheet beyond static gap analysis. Although it will continue to measure its static gap position, the Company utilizes additional modeling for identifying and measuring the interest rate risk in the overall balance sheet. The ALCO is responsible for focusing on "earnings at risk" and "economic value at risk", and how both relate to the risk-based capital position when analyzing the interest rate risk.
Earnings at Risk. Earnings at risk simulation measures the change in net interest income and net income should interest rates rise and fall. The simulation recognizes that not all assets and liabilities reprice one for one with market rates (e.g., savings rate). The ALCO looks at "earnings at risk" to determine income changes from a base case scenario under an increase and decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates simulation model.
Economic Value at Risk. Earnings at risk simulation measures the short-term risk in the balance sheet. Economic value (or portfolio equity) at risk measures the long-term risk by finding the net present value of the future cashflows from the Company's existing assets and liabilities. The ALCO examines this ratio quarterly utilizing an increase and decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates simulation model. The ALCO recognizes that, in some instances, this ratio may contradict the "earnings at risk" ratio.
The following table illustrates the simulated impact of 200 basis points upward or downward movement in interest rates on net interest income, net income, and the change in economic value (portfolio equity). This analysis assumed that interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels at December 31, 1998 remained constant. The impact of the rate movements was developed by simulating the effect of rates changing over a twelve-month period from the December 31, 1998 levels.
Rates +200 Rates -200 Earnings at risk: Percent change in: Net Interest Income.......................... 8.42% (11.65)% Net Income................................... 22.28 (29.48)
Economic value at risk: Percent change in: Economic value of equity..................... (2.48) (20.40) Economic value of equity as a percent of book assets................ (0.29) (2.39)
Economic value has the most meaning when viewed within the context of risk-based capital. Therefore, the economic value may change beyond the Company's policy guideline for a short period of time as long as the risk-based capital ratio (after adjusting for the excess equity exposure) is greater than 10%.
Capital
The adequacy of the Company's capital is reviewed on an ongoing basis with regard to size, composition and quality of the Company's resources. An adequate capital base is important for continued growth and expansion in addition to providing an added protection against unexpected losses.
An important indicator in the banking industry is the leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of common stockholders' equity less intangible assets, to average quarterly assets less intangible assets. The leverage ratio at December 31, 1998 was 7.72% compared to 10.26% at December 31, 1997. This decrease in the leverage ratio in 1998 was caused by the increase in average assets in 1998 due to the borrowings from the FHLB which were invested in investment grade securities. The higher leverage ratio in 1997 was the result of the public stock offering in December, 1997. For 1998 and 1997, the ratios were well above minimum regulatory guidelines.
As required by the federal banking regulatory authorities, guidelines have been adopted to measure capital adequacy. Under the guidelines, certain minimum ratios are required for core capital and total capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and other off-balance sheet instruments. For the Company, Tier I capital consists of common stockholders' equity less intangible assets, and Tier II capital includes the allowable portion of the allowance for possible loan losses, currently limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. By regulatory guidelines, neither Tier I nor Tier II capital reflect the adjustment of SFAS No. 115, which requires adjustment in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by including as a separate component of equity, the amount of net unrealized holding gains or losses on debt and equity securities that are deemed to be available-for-sale.
At December 31, 1998 (Dollars in thousands)
Primary capital...................................... $ 37,880 Intangible assets.................................... 2,293 Tier I capital....................................... 35,587 Tier II capital...................................... 2,268 Total risk-based capital............................. $ 37,855
Total risk-weighted assets........................... $252,967 Tier I ratio......................................... 14.07% Risk-based capital ratio............................. 14.96% Tier I leverage ratio................................ 7.72%
Regulatory guidelines require that core capital and total risk-based capital must be at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively.
Liquidity and Funds Management Liquidity management is to ensure that adequate funds will be available to meet anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals, debt servicing payments, investment commitments, commercial and consumer loan demand and ongoing operating expenses. Funding sources include principal repayments on loans and investments, sales of assets, growth in core deposits, short- and long-term borrowings and repurchase agreements. Regular loan payments are a dependable source of funds, while the sale of loans and investment securities, deposit flows, and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and level of interest rates.
At December 31, 1998, the Company maintained $19.0 million in cash and cash equivalents (including Federal funds sold) in the form of cash and due from banks (after reserve requirements). In addition, the Company had $2.7 million of mortgage loans held for resale and $80.6 million in AFS securities. This combined total of $102.3 million represented 21.6% of total assets at December 31, 1998. The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate.
The Company considers its primary source of liquidity to be its core deposit base. This funding source has grown steadily over the years and consists of deposits from customers throughout the branch network. The Company will continue to promote the acquisition of deposits through its branch offices. At December 31, 1998, approximately 65.9% of the Company's assets were funded by core deposits acquired within its market area. An additional 8.0% of the assets were funded by the Company's equity. These two components provide a substantial and stable source of funds.
Net cash used in operating activities was $422,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 million for the comparable period in 1997. This $5.3 million decrease is primarily related to a net $6.7 million increase in the change in mortgage loans held for resale and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities increased $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from $69.5 million to $99.5 million, which was primarily attributable to purchases of investment securities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $36.0 million from 1997. A net increase in FHLB borrowings of $40.2 million were used to fund investment purchases. A net increase in the annual growth of deposits from 1997 to 1998 of $5.0 million was the other major component impacting funds provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities for 1998 was impacted by a net decrease of $11.8 million from net proceeds from issuance of common stock.
Future Outlook In 1995, interest rates began moving steadily upward as the Federal Reserve Board tightened its monetary policy. In early 1995, interest rates rose and continued rising through the middle of the year, with the national prime lending rate peaking at 9.0%. The national prime lending rate fell to 8.5% at December 31, 1995, falling again to 8.25% in February 1996, where it remained at December 31, 1996. In March 1997, the national prime lending rate increased to 8.5%. Beginning with September 1998 through November 1998, the national prime lending rate fell in three separate adjustments to its current level of 7.75%. Management and the Board of Directors do not have the ability to determine if another rate adjustment will occur; however, the Company believes it is very well prepared to meet the challenges and effects of a changing interest rate environment. Management's belief is that a significant impact on earnings depends on its ability to react to changes in interest rates. Through its ALCO, the Company continually monitors interest rate sensitivity of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to minimize any adverse effects on future earnings. The Company's commitment to remaining a community-based organization is strong and the intention is to recognize steady growth in its consumer, mortgage and commercial loan portfolios while obtaining and maintaining a strong core deposit base.
The banking and financial services industries are constantly changing. The Company is not aware of any pending pronouncements that would have a material impact on the results of operations.
A normal examination of LA Bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") in 1998 resulted in no significant findings and no impact is anticipated on current or future operations.
LA Bank's current and future FDIC BIF assessment is expected to be $0; however, the FICO assessment for 1999 is expected to be approximately $45,000.
In 1996, LA Bank acquired the real estate and deposit customer lists of the Milford (Pike County) and Mountainhome (Monroe County) branches of PNC Bank. These branches opened in December 1996. In September 1998, LA Bank acquired the fixed assets and deposits of the Mountainhome (Monroe County) branch of Mellon Bank. The acquired office was consolidated into LA Bank's existing Mountainhome branch. The amortization of the customer lists and deposit premium was $205,000 for 1998 and is expected to be $300,000 for 1999.
Management is hopeful that the newest additional banking offices will continue to expand the Company's deposit base by attracting new depositors, while providing quality service to both new and existing customers. The initial costs associated with the branch openings, such as salaries and benefits, advertising, overhead expenses and marketing, will have a short-term negative impact on the Company's earnings until the growth in deposits reaches a level to offset these expenses. The potential for future earnings growth is positive and should provide a favorable return for our stockholders.
Year 2000 Compliance; Management Information Systems The Board of Directors has established a Year 2000 compliance committee to address the risks of the critical internal bank systems that are affected by date sensitive applications, as well as external systems provided by third parties. A comprehensive plan was developed detailing the sequence of events and actions to be taken as the Year 2000 approaches.
The Year 2000 (Y2K) Committee was formed in May 1997. The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer was named liaison to executive management. Co-chairpersons of the committee are Senior Operations Manager and Deposit Operations Manager. Other committee members include MIS Supervisor, Controller, Senior Lending Officer, Loan Review Officer, Loan Operations Officer, and Branch Administration Officers. The committee currently meets weekly to discuss the progress of the project.
An outline was developed by the Y2K Committee to manage the phases of our year 2000 readiness program. The outline addresses the necessary phases (identification, renovation, testing, and implementation) necessary to conduct a detailed review of the Company's readiness.
A list was compiled of all vendors. The list included information technology vendors and non-information technology vendors. The Company does not utilize any in-house developed programs. A letter was sent to vendors early in the third quarter of 1997 seeking assurance and testing scripts to ensure their products are Year 2000 ready. Each vendor was evaluated and prioritized as to the Company's reliance on the application. The Company's MIS Department has conducted testing on all personal computers and file servers. Those that did not successfully roll into the Year 2000 were replaced. Unisys Corporation was contracted to assist and act as a consultant to the Company with the Year 2000 testing. The Company simulated its entire technology platform into the Year 2000 to conduct transactional testing.
Lending officers have compiled a Year 2000 questionnaire for each client with a total lending relationship of $250,000 or more. Loan review has incorporated into their evaluations of the borrower's credit worthiness the question of the impact that the Year 2000 will have on an individual business and the risk associated with non-compliance resulting in business disruption. A Year 2000 legal addendum has been added to the loan documentation for all new and renewed commercial loans. Large depositors have also been personally contacted and made aware of the Year 2000 issue and how it may effect them. The Company has also developed a Year 2000 awareness brochure that was inserted with the customers' Company statements.
The Year 2000 Committee has established a timeline for Year 2000 Readiness. This timeline is updated as actions are completed.

YEAR 2000 BUDGET
In accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Year 2000 advisory letters, the Y2K Committee has prepared a budget of current and anticipated expenditures. The following is a breakdown as of January 1, 1999:
**The purchase of the check sorter equipment was a Y2K issue as well as improving the efficiency of the Bank's overall operations. The existing check processing software and equipment could have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant for approximately $80,000.
The core business processes that the Year 2000 Committee has identified are Information Technology Incorporated, Bankers Systems Incorporated, Attachmate Incorporated, Unisys Corporation, NCR, Novell Incorporated, and Leasetek Incorporated. The Company is very optimistic that by conducting the necessary tests there will not be any interruption of services.
The process that is most heavily relied upon in the Company's daily operations is Information Technology Incorporated. Without this process, the Company would not function adequately. The Year 2000 Committee has identified this as a high-risk process and has developed a very intensive testing schedule. The Company has already conducted detailed testing of this process and currently has generated a schedule that will continue into the Year 1999.
The Company has developed a written contingency plan to handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios. The plan addresses alternate vendors for these mission critical applications, a timeline for implementation and action, circumstances and trigger dates, and core business processes that pose the greatest amount of risk to the Company. The Y2K Committee will be responsible for updating the contingency plan, reporting progress and implementating changes. The contingency plan will be modified to reflect any changes at that time. However, no assurance can be made that the systems of others that the Company relies upon will be converted on a timely basis, or that their failure to be compliant would not have an adverse effect on the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot currently quantify the potential financial impact of a worst case scenario created by Y2K failures.
In October 1997, the Company purchased and installed an upgrade to its current bank operating systems to improve efficiencies of operations and position itself for future growth. The cost of the new system was approximately $775,000. Preconversion testing demonstrated that the new hardware and software are Year 2000 compliant.
Factors That May Affect Future Results
General
Banking is affected, directly and indirectly, by local, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and by government monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, tight money supply, real estate values, international conflicts and other factors beyond the control of the Company may adversely affect the future results of operations of the Company. Management does not expect any one particular factor to affect results of operations. A downward trend in several areas, however, including real estate, construction and consumer spending, could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to maintain or increase profitability. Therefore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue its current rate of profitability and growth. See "Business - Allowance For Possible Credit Losses."
Interest Rates
The Company's earnings depend, to a large extent, upon net interest income, which is primarily influenced by the relationship between its cost of funds (deposits and borrowings) and the yield on its interest-earning assets (loans and investments). This relationship, known as the net interest spread, is subject to fluctuate and is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume, rate and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the level of nonperforming assets. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, management seeks to control its exposure to interest rate changes by managing the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Through its asset/liability committee, the Company continually monitors interest rate sensitivity of its earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to minimize any adverse effects on future earnings.
As of December 31, 1998, total interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than total interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same period by $11.6 million, representing a cumulative one-year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets of positive 2.45%. This condition suggests that the yield on the Company's interest-earning assets should adjust to changes in market interest rates at a faster rate than the cost of the Company's interest-bearing liabilities. Consequently, the Company's net interest income could increase during periods of rising interest rates. See "Interest Rate Risk Management."
Adequacy of Allowance for Possible Credit Losses
In originating loans, there is a likelihood that some credit losses will occur. This risk of loss varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness and debt servicing capacity of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral securing the loan. Management maintains an allowance for possible credit losses based on, among other things, historical loan loss experience, known inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and an evaluation of current economic conditions. Management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses is adequate. There can be no assurance that nonperforming loans will not increase in the future.
Effects of Inflation
The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is the Company's ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.
New Financial Accounting Standards
Reporting Comprehensive Income
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This Statement establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. Statement No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. This Statement does not require a specific format for that financial statement, but requires that an enterprise display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in that financial statement. Statement No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The impact of this Statement on the Company was to require additional disclosures in the Company's financial statements.
Operating Segment Disclosure
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." Statement No. 131 establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. Statement No. 131 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. The impact, if any, of this Statement on the Company will be to require additional disclosures in the Company's financial statements. There was no impact on the Company's financial statements in 1998.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
FASB No. 133, issued in June 1998, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. In connection with the implementation of FASB No. 133, the Company may transfer debt securities classified as held-to-maturities to the available-for-sale category. Such a transfer will not call into question the Company's intention to hold other debt to maturity in the future. The impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the future volume (if any) of acquisitions of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company plans to adopt FASB No. 133 in 1999. Management has not determined the impact, if any, of this statement on the Company.
Accounting for Mortgage-Backed Securities after the Securitization of Mortgage Loans Held for Sale by a Mortgage Banking Enterprise
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 134 amends FASB No. 65, Accounting for Certain Mortgage Banking Activities. The amendment provides that after the securitization of a mortgage loan held for sale, any retained mortgage-backed securities shall be classified in accordance with the provisions of FASB No. 115. However, a mortgage banking enterprise must classify as trading any retained mortgage-backed securities that it commits to sell before or during the securitization process. The adoption of Statement No. 134 had no impact on the Company.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, LA Bank, N.A. including its subsidiaries, LA Lease, Inc. and Ariel Financial Services, Inc. (collectively, "Company"). All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Nature of Operations Lake Ariel Bancorp, Inc. is a one bank holding company whose principal subsidiary is LA Bank, N.A. LA Lease, Inc., provides auto and equipment leases to individuals and small business entities. Ariel Financial Services, a newly formed business unit, offers stocks, bonds, annuities and other insurance-related products.
The Company provides a variety of financial services to individuals and corporate customers through its twenty-one branch banking offices in Wayne, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Pike and Monroe Counties. The Bank's primary deposit products are both noninterest and interest-bearing demand deposits and certificates of deposit. Its primary lending products are single-family residential loans which qualify for sale on the secondary residential loan market.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for possible credit losses and the valuation of assets acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. In connection with the determination of the allowances for possible credit losses and foreclosed assets, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.
A majority of the Company's loan portfolio consists of single-family residential loans in the Northeastern Pennsylvania area. Accordingly, the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of foreclosed assets are susceptible to changes in local market conditions.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases and foreclosed assets, future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowances for possible credit losses and foreclosed assets. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the allowances for possible credit losses and foreclosed assets may change materially in the near term.
Investment Securities Held-to-maturity securities are bonds, notes and debentures for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. These securities are reported at cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.
Government bonds held principally for resale in the near term, and mortgage-backed securities held for sale in conjunction with the Company's mortgage banking activities, are classified as trading account securities and are recorded at their fair values. Unrealized gains and losses on trading account securities are included immediately in other income. The Company neither held nor purchased securities which would be categorized as trading account securities during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. Available-for-sale securities consist of bonds, notes, debentures and certain equity securities not classified as trading securities nor as held-to-maturity securities. These unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, are the sole component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Investment gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.
Declines in the fair value of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary result in write-downs of the individual securities to their face value. The related write-downs are included in earnings as realized losses.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has no derivative financial instruments requiring disclosure under SFAS No. 119.
Mortgage Loans Held for Resale Mortgage loans originated and intended for resale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or fair value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income. These loans are sold in whole and without recourse to the Company.
Loans and Leases Loans are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned interest, net deferred loan fees and the allowance for possible credit losses. Unearned interest on installment loans is recognized as income using the actuarial method. Interest on all other loans is recognized on the accrual basis, based on the principal amount outstanding. Loan fees, including origination and commitment fees, less certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and recognized over the estimated lives of the related loans as an adjustment to yield. The unamortized balance of these fees and costs are included as part of the loan balance to which it relates. Prior to 1988, such fees and costs were recognized as income or expense when collected or paid. Impaired loans are placed in a nonaccrual status when management believes that the collection of principal or interest is uncertain, unless the loans are both in the process of collection and well secured. When interest accrual is discontinued, income recorded in the current year is reversed and the accrued interest from prior years is charged to the allowance for possible credit losses.
Allowance for Possible Credit Losses The allowance for possible credit losses is established through a provision for possible credit losses as a charge to operating expense. The Company provides for possible credit losses based on an evaluation of the risk associated with the Company's loan portfolio, prior loan loss experience, economic conditions and other factors. Loans are charged against the allowance for possible credit losses when management believes that the collection of principal is unlikely. Recoveries on previously charged-off loans are added to the allowance for possible credit losses.
Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale Foreclosed assets held for sale are carried at the lower of fair value minus estimated costs to sell, or cost.
Loan Servicing and Loan Servicing Rights The Company services real estate loans for investors in the secondary mortgage market, which are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The approximate total amount of mortgages serviced amounted to $141,381,000, $131,509,000, and $119,898,000 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The cost of mortgage servicing rights is amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Impairment of mortgage servicing rights is assessed based on the fair value of those rights. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on a current market interest rate. For purposes of measuring impairment, the rights are stratified based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, stated term of the loan and interest rate. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights for a stratum exceed their fair value.
When participating interests in loans sold have an average contractual interest rate, adjusted for normal servicing fees, that differs from the agreed yield to the purchaser, gains or losses are recognized equal to the present value of such differential over the estimated remaining life of such loans. The resulting "excess servicing receivable" or "deferred servicing revenue" is amortized over the estimated life using a method approximating the interest method.
Quoted market prices are not available for the excess servicing receivables. Thus, the excess servicing receivables and the amortization thereon are periodically evaluated in relation to estimated future servicing revenues, taking into consideration changes in interest rates, current prepayment rates, and expected future cash flows. The Company evaluates the carrying value of the excess servicing receivables by estimating the future servicing income of the excess servicing receivables based on management's best estimate of remaining loan lives and discounted at the original discount rate.
Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Routine maintenance and repair expenditures are expended as incurred while significant expenditures are capitalized. Depreciation expense is determined primarily on the straight-line method over the following ranges of useful lives:
Buildings and improvements 10 to 40 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 to 20 years
Intangible Assets Core deposit intangible assets and customer lists acquired are included in other assets and are being amortized over a period of six to twelve years using the straight-line method. Amortization for 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $205,000, $154,000, and $108,000, respectively.
Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains and funds a defined contribution profit-sharing plan which covers substantially all eligible employees. The Company also maintains a 401(k) savings plan. Substantially all of the Company's employees are eligible to participate in the profit-sharing/401(k) savings plan on the January 1 or July 1 following their completion of six months of service and attaining age 20 1/2.
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes to the tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable.
Cash Flows The Company considers amounts due from banks and federal funds sold as cash equivalents. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods.
In 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company transferred $266,000, $420,000, and $858,000, respectively, from its loan portfolio to foreclosed assets held for sale.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the statement of financial condition. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumption used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Statement No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.
Comprehensive Income The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", as of January 1, 1998. Accounting principles require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The adoption of SFAS No. 130 had no effect on the Bank's net income or stockholder's equity.
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 reporting format.
2. Restrictions on Cash and Due From Bank Accounts The Company is required to maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average monthly balance required during 1998 and 1997 was approximately $375,000. In addition, at December 31, 1998 and 1997, required compensating reserve balances with correspondent banks were $2,239,000 and $2,003,000, respectively.
Deposits with any one financial institution are insured up to $100,000. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with certain other financial institutions in excess of the insured amount.
3. Investment Securities Debt and equity securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheet according to management's intent. The carrying amount of securities and their approximate fair values at December 31, 1998 and 1997 were as follows (in thousands):
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 1998, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands).

There is no significant concentration of investments in any individual security issue (excluding U.S. government and its agencies) that was in excess of 10% of stockholders' equity at December 31, 1998 or 1997.
The unamortized premiums on mortgage-backed securities amounted to $1,671,000 and $817,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The unaccreted discount on mortgage-backed securities amounted to $318,000 and $14,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
4. Loans and Leases A summary of the outstanding loans and leases by major categories at December 31 is as follows:
Total nonaccrual loans outstanding at December 31, 1998 were approximately $2,396,000 as compared to $534,000 at December 31, 1997. Included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 1998 and 1997 are $2,088,000 and $411,000, respectively, of impaired loans in nonaccrual status, for which $452,000 and $248,000, respectively, have been allocated in the allowance for possible credit losses to cover potential losses from these impaired loans. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, there were no outstanding commitments to lend funds to debtors with nonaccrual loans. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, no loans were being accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring.

The Company maintains a U.S. Treasury tax and loan note option account for the deposit of withholding taxes, corporate income taxes and certain other payments to the federal government. Deposits are subject to withdrawal and are evidenced by an open-ended interest-bearing note. Borrowings under this note option account were approximately $300,000 at December 31, 1998 and approximately $1,000,000 at December 31, 1997. These deposits are included in interest-bearing demand deposits for each period presented.
The Company has a line of credit commitment available from the Federal Home Loan Bank for borrowings of up to approximately $10.0 million, expiring March 24, 1999. There were no borrowings under this line of credit at December 31, 1998 or 1997.
8. Long-term Debt Long-term debt at December 31 is as follows:
Annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows: $3,032,000 in 1999, $8,232,000 in 2000, $8,339,000 in 2001, $5,448,000 in 2002, $50,065,000 in 2003, $69,000 in 2004, $30,074,000 in 2005, $79,000 in 2006, $84,000 in 2007, and $10,037,000 in 2008. Investment securities are pledged to collateralize the borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.
9. Common Stock The Company has reserved 284,025 shares under its 1994 and 1997 Stock Option Plans ("Option Plan"). Options are granted to purchase common stock at prices not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Such shares and prices have been adjusted to reflect the stock dividends and stock split.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for the Option Plan. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the Option Plan. Had compensation cost for the Option Plan been determined based on the fair values at the grant dates for awards consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below for the year ended December 31, 1998:
As Reported Pro Forma Net Income (in thousands): $3,771 $3,726 Earnings per share-basic: $0.79 $0.78
For purposes of the pro forma calculations, the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option - pricing model with the following weighted - average assumptions for grants issued in 1995:
Dividend yield 3.51% Expected volatility 36.73% Risk-free interest rate 5.89% Expected lives 10 years
A summary of the status of the Company's Option Plan as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and changes during the years then ended, is presented below:
The following summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 1998:
The Company reserved 115,763 shares of common stock under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, increased to 100,000 effective November 10, 1997, as a result of the two-for-one stock split. Under the terms of the plan, employees may purchase common stock of the Company at 85% of the fair market value. Employees pay for their stock purchases through periodic payroll deductions subject to a limit of 10% of base pay. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, 5,500, 11,579, and 5,735 shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan.
The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan was implemented during the year ended December 31, 1994 to provide stockholders an opportunity to automatically reinvest their dividends in shares of common stock. Total common shares of 694,575 are reserved under this plan. The price per share of common stock purchased from the Company is 95% of the fair market value on the quarterly dividend payment date. During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, 38,890, 35,306, and 16,856 shares, respectively, were issued under this plan.
10. Other Comprehensive Income The components of other comprehensive income and related tax effects are as follows (in thousands):
11. Income Taxes The following temporary differences gave rise to the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1998 and 1997 (in thousands):
The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components (in thousands):
The following tabulation presents a reconciliation of the expected provision for income taxes (in thousands), determined by using the current federal income tax rate of 34% in 1998, 1997, 1996 to the actual provision for income taxes reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
12. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a profit-sharing plan for the benefit of its employees. Contributions to the profit-sharing plan are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors, funded currently, and amounted to $236,000 in 1998, $251,000 in 1997, and $214,000 in 1996.
The Company also maintains a 401(k) savings plan. The Company contributes 50% of the employee contribution up to 6% of compensation. The Company's 1998, 1997 and 1996 contributions to this plan were $77,000, $70,000, and $58,000, respectively.
13. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to the 5% stock dividends issued on October 1, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the two-for-one stock split effective November 10, 1997, and the assumed exercise of stock options. The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effects on income and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common stock for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. The common shares denominators for 1997 and 1996 have been adjusted for the 1998 and 1997 5% stock dividend and two-for-one stock split.
14. Regulatory Matters The Company may not pay cash dividends in any year in excess of the total of the current year's net income and the retained net income of the prior two years without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Accordingly, Company cash dividends in 1999 may not exceed $3,912,000 plus Company net income for 1999. Similar banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company by its bank subsidiary without prior approval of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 1997, that the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
To be categorized as well capitalized, the bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution's category. The Company's actual capital amounts (in thousands) and ratios are also presented in the table. No amounts were deducted from capital for interest-rate risk in either year.
15. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate or liquidity risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract amount of these instruments expresses the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.
The Company's exposure to credit loss from nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk.
The financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk at December 31, 1998 were as follows (in thousands):
Commitments to extend credit $15,123 Standby letters of credit $950
Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, on an extension of credit is based on management's credit assessment of the counterparty.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing performance by a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
16. Fair Values of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the statement of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values.
Investment securities: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.
Loans: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts. The fair values for other loans (for example, fixed rate commercial real estate and rental property mortgage loans and commercial and industrial loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Loan fair value estimates include judgements regarding future expected loss experience and risk characteristics. The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value. Mortgage loans held for resale are valued based on available market quotations.
Deposits: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (for example, interest-bearing checking accounts and passbook accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is, their carrying amounts). The fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated contractual maturities on such time deposits. The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.
Short-term borrowings and notes payable: The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings and notes payable approximate their fair values.
Other liabilities: Commitments to extend credit were evaluated and fair value was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
Financial Assets and Liabilities The following represents the notional or carrying values and estimated fair values as of December 31:
17. Condensed Financial Information -Parent Company Only Condensed parent company only financial information is as follows (in thousands):
18. Contingencies On February 5, 1996, a complaint was filed against LA Bank ("the Bank") and certain directors and officers of the Bank. The plaintiffs demanded monetary and punitive damages and the additional payment of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and disbursements and other court-related costs. Counsel representing the Company and the Bank are not currently able to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome since an unfavorable outcome is neither probable nor remote. In addition, an estimate of the loss or range of loss, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, has not been provided since the probability of the inaccuracy of such an estimate is more than slight. No provision for any liability has been made in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 1998 and 1997.
19. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk Most of the Company's business activity is with customers located within Pennsylvania. Investments in state and municipal securities typically involve governmental entities within the Company's market area. Concentrations of credit, as defined by the Company's loan policy, are groupings of loans with a common repayment source that exceed 25% of the Company's capital. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had no such credit concentrations.
The distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. Commercial and standby letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers. The Company, as a matter of policy, does not extend credit in excess of 50% of the Bank's regulatory legal lending limit to any single borrower or group of related borrowers.
The contractual amounts of credit-related financial instruments such as commitments to extend credit, credit-card arrangements, and letters of credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.
20. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) (in thousands, except per share data)
