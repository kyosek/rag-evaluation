A. LISBON VALLEY PROPERTY, SAN JUAN COUNTY, UTAH
Known Reserves
As part of the Revised Final Feasibility dated October 23, 1996 done by Robert &Schaefer, the Company commissioned an independent consultant, Kelsey Associates, LTD. ( KEI ) of Denver, Colorado to prepare reserve estimates for the Centennial, Sentinel and GTO deposits assuming a copper commodity price of $0.90 per pound;. These reserves were then given to Gary Simmerman, an independent consulting mining engineer, to determine a Mine Production Schedule. The following table shows KEI's estimated minable ore reserves as adjusted for the Mine Plan:
At a copper price of $0.90/lb.
Millions Ore Tons of Lbs. Strip Deposit (thousands) Grade% Copper Ratio*
Sentinel 6,716 0.312 41.9 0.55:1.00 Centennial 25,310 0.484 244.9 1.86:1.00 GTO 2,998 0.631 37.9 4.51:1.00
TOTALS 35,024 0.464 324.7 1.84:1.00
* Tons of waste : tons of ore.
These estimates include both proven and probable reserves and are based on in-place material. The Revised Final Feasibility Study anticipates that between 5% and 10% of copper will be lost in the leaching process. The aggregate net recovery rate for the project is estimated to be 90%. Location and Access
The Lisbon Valley Property comprises approximately 5,940 acres and is situated in southeastern Utah, about five miles west of the Colorado border and about 45 miles southeast of the town of Moab, Utah. The Property lies within a northwesterly-trending flat-bottomed valley at an elevation of about 6,400 feet above sea level and comprises 256 unpatented lode mining claims and fractions, three State of Utah leases covering approximately 960 acres, a lease of approximately 160 acres of private land and fee ownership of approximately 400 acres of private land. Assessment rental fees of $100 per unpatented claim are required to be paid annually on or before August 31 of each year. The Lisbon Valley Property is reached by road from Moab, where most services and supplies may be obtained. Access to the various parts of the Property is by county maintained gravel road.
Interest of the Company in the Property
The Company's interest in the Lisbon Valley Property originated from an agreement whereby Summo USA acquired by assignment certain leases and other agreements. Since such assignment, the Company has obtained a direct interest in certain of the assigned leases and acquired rights to additional property in the region.
Pursuant to a restated agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of March 10, 1994, among the Company, Summo USA, St. Mary Minerals Inc., a Colorado corporation ("St. Mary") and MLP Associates Limited, a Colorado limited partnership ("MLP"), Summo USA acquired by assignment of certain underlying agreements from MLP all of MLP's interest in and to approximately 4,720 acres of the Lisbon Valley Property in consideration of the issuance of 2,400,000 common shares of the Company (the "Purchase Shares") and certain other payments and covenants. Summo USA also assumed the obligations to make all of the payments under the underlying agreements. The Purchase Shares were issued one-half upon execution of the Agreement and one-half in September 1995 following the issuance of a Feasibility Study. Prior to entering into the Agreement, the relationship between MLP and the Company was arm's length. The Company was also required to make certain cash payments to MLP until June 1995.
The following summarizes the material terms of the agreements covering separate property parcels of land pursuant to which the Company now holds interests with ore reserves in the Lisbon Valley Property:
1. Lease dated April 20, 1988, as amended by agreement dated July 24, 1993, between MLP as lessee and Lisbon Copper Ltd. ("Lisbon Copper") as lessor. a.

Present Condition of the Property
There are four established copper deposits within the Lisbon Valley Property which have previously produced minerals as follows:
Tons Mined Deposit (Approximately)
Globe Unknown Centennial 350,000 Sentinel 100,000 GTO 450,000
The Globe deposit is now considered to be essentially mined out.
Centennial Deposit. This is the largest known and best explored deposit in the area. The deposit is roughly rectangular in plan with dimensions of 2,600 ft. by 1,200 ft. Over 500 drill holes have defined three or four overlapping mineralized lenses in a 300-foot stratigraphic section and which dip 5 degrees to 25 degrees southwest toward the Lisbon Valley Fault. The lenses vary in thickness from about 40 to 150 feet, with the greatest thicknesses adjacent to the fault. One stratigraphic unit in particular, known as Bed 15, is up to 150 feet in thickness and is generally well mineralized.
Sentinel Deposit. Copper mineralization occurs in the middle and upper parts of Bed 15, and the mineralized section averages 39 feet in thickness. The mineralization occurs in a tabular body dipping 10 degrees to 25 degrees to the southwest, toward the Lisbon Valley Fault. The dimensions of the deposit are 1,300 feet by 1,100 feet and it is open to the east and south.
GTO Deposit. This is a high-grade deposit about one mile south of the Centennial deposit. Copper occurs in the Dakota sandstone.
Previous Work Undertaken
The Lisbon Valley Property has been the site of mining exploration, development and production for almost 100 years. The most intense activity has taken place since 1969 when Keystone-Wallace Resources ("KWR") rebuilt the copper leach plant and began a systematic development and mining program.
KWR mined and processed approximately 900,000 tons of ore from the Lisbon Valley Property: 350,000 tons of 1.25% copper from Centennial; 450,000 tons of 1.75% copper from GTO; and 100,000 tons of 0.45% copper from Sentinel.
Between 1974 and 1992, a series of operators conducted drilling programs on the Lisbon Valley Property, principally on the Centennial Deposit. In 1988, MLP acquired a lease on the Property.
In 1992, Kennecott Exploration ("Kennecott") optioned the Lisbon Valley Property from MLP and drilled five widely-spaced vertical holes across the lower Lisbon Valley. One hole, 700 feet deep and drilled in the Centennial pit, averaged 0.33% Copper over 530 feet and was stopped while still in mineralization. Kennecott terminated its option in 1993. Management believes that Kennecott terminated its option because the likely reserves in the Property were relatively small in comparison to the other copper production of Kennecott.
In July 1993, St. Mary, by preliminary agreement, acquired a lease on the Lisbon Valley Property from MLP for the benefit of Summo USA, which had not at that time been incorporated. St. Mary then initiated a program of data compilation and review, reverse circulation drilling, large diameter core drilling, detailed stratigraphic mapping and additional land acquisition.
Work Completed by the Company
Since August 1993 and through December 31, 1996, the Company has spent approximately $4,800,000 on the Lisbon Valley Property for land acquisition costs, rental payments, drilling, metallurgy, assaying, a Feasibility Study, and general and administrative expenses.
The 1993 drilling program consisted of 29 reverse-circulation holes totaling 9,683 feet on the Centennial Deposit in locations where the spacing between earlier holes was considered to be too great. The results of the drilling showed a close correlation between the predicted thickness and grade; the average thickness of 39 intercepts was 61 feet and the actual weighted average grade was 0.49% of copper. These results do not affect the reserve calculations for the Centennial Deposit.
The Company carried out leach tests on the drill cuttings from the 29 holes drilled in 1993. The results indicated that about 90% of the copper in the various ore types can be recovered by acid leaching. Earlier work by St. Mary on a one-ton representative sample of Lisbon Valley ore, crushed to minus four inches and leached in a 24-inch column, resulted in a 76% recovery in 45 days with low acid consumption.
In December 1994, the Company completed an additional 68 reverse-circulation drill holes on the Lisbon Valley Property, with 48 of the holes containing visible copper over minable widths. The Company received updated reserve calculations in July 1995. See "Known Reserves." Work by the Company during 1996 is discussed under Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Drilling on Lisbon Valley was conducted in two phases in 1995. The first phase was completed in May 1995 and designed for condemnation purposes in the proposed waste dump area adjacent to the Centennial deposit. All ten holes confirmed no ore lies beneath the proposed waste dump site. A second phase of drilling was completed in December 1995 and designed to fill in gaps in the drill density on the periphery of the Centennial deposit. All twelve holes cut ore grade over minable widths in areas which were carried as waste in the then-current mine plan. A new ore reserve was calculated, and a new pit was designed to accommodate the additional ore intercepts in May of 1996.
Metallurgical tests continued on drilling cores from the deeper portion of the Centennial deposit to further quantify leach kinetics for ore to be delivered to the pad during the second half of the planned mine life. The tests show recovery of approximately 90% of the total copper can be achieved by leaching of ore crushed to -1 1/2 inch size in a period of approximately 400 days.
The Company obtained a Feasibility Study in August 1995 on the Lisbon Valley Property prepared by Roberts & Schaefer Company ( Roberts & Schafer ), an independent mining engineering and consulting firm. The Company had Roberts & Schafer complete a Final Feasibility Study ( Final Feasibility Study ) based on the ore reserves and new operating and capital costs received, which was completed June 18, 1996. The Company had Roberts & Schafer update the Final Feasibility Study based on an ore reserve using $0.90 copper prices to produce a Revised Final Feasibility dated October 23, 1996. This reduced the tons of ore but increased the grade and decreased the strip ratio, ultimately reducing cost. This Revised Final Feasibility contemplates a project wherein the Company will mine the Centennial, Sentinel and GTO deposits by open-pit methods using acid leaching and SX-EW technology. The mined ores will be processed at a processing facility designed to produce cathode copper to meet LME Grade A standards (approximately 99.99% copper). Also included with the mining and process operations will be a truck shop for servicing the mine fleet, a laboratory for maintaining control of mining and process activities and an administration building for mine management, engineering and accounting personnel. All mining equipment and mining services will be supplied to the Company through a fixed contract from Brown & Root, Inc.
The Revised Final Feasibility Study estimates the initial capital costs for the project to be $48.4 million including all process equipment, infrastructure, engineering/construction management, working capital, pre-operating capital, installation, permits, royalty, spares and contingencies. The average cash operating costs over the life of the mine, exclusive of the cost of capital, are estimated to be $4.3 million per quarter, or $.47 per pound of copper produced. The total life of mine capital and operating costs are estimated to be $0.72 per pound of copper produced. Both capital and operating cost estimates are believed to be calculated to plus or minus 5% accuracy, which reflects the fact the Company has signed letters of intent for an engineering, procurement & construction ( EPC ) contract to construct the plant and a fixed price for the mining cost, which is 50% of operating cost, and contracts for delivery of acid and power which comprise an additional 20% of operating cost.
A series of pro forma cash flow analyses were performed as part of the Revised Final Feasibility Study using assumed copper prices ranging from $.90 per pound to $1.10 per pound. The pro forma cash flow analysis show nominal cumulative profitability over the 9-year duration of the project at an assumed copper price of $0.90 per pound and increasing profitability as the copper price increases from such level.
The Revised Final Feasibility Study concludes that the project is economically sound, and although the risk and sensitivity analyses performed by Roberts & Schaefer disclose risks principally deriving from the variability of the market price of copper, the Revised Final Feasibility Study shows significant profit potential. Subject to the availability of capital, the Company intends to develop and mine the Lisbon Valley Property according to the recommendations and descriptions in the Revised Final Feasibility Study.
Plant and Equipment
There is no surface plant or equipment on the Lisbon Valley Property other than a three-phase 12 kV power line which is not sufficient to support all the power requirements of the mine but which may be utilized in addition to a new 69 kV power line which will to be run approximately ten miles to the site. The initial cost to the Comapny of the new power line will be $750,000, which amount is included in the estimated initial capital costs.
Environmental Matters
The Company has retained a consulting firm to conduct various technical and baseline studies on the Lisbon Valley Property. These include ground water quality testing and monitoring, environmental baseline studies of the flora, fauna and soils in the Lisbon Valley, and a study of the soil available for reclamation purposes.
The environmental baseline studies undertaken regarding flora, fauna and soils do not indicate that there are any threatened or endangered species of plants or fauna which have been found or are likely to be present in the area of the Lisbon Valley Property. The soils tested to date do not indicate any deleterious chemical properties.
Baseline hydrolic data, pump tests on groundwater for pit dewatering and makeup water requirements, and flora and fauna studies continued through 1996 as part of the permitting process on Lisbon Valley.
Permitting for construction and operation commenced in August 1995 after completion of a positive Feasibility Study. A Notice of Intent was approved and a Memorandum of Understanding was reached between the Company, its third-party contractors, and the BLM regarding the manner and time-frame anticipated for permitting the project as described in the Notice of Intent. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was completed on May 31, 1996. This document recommends development of the property as proposed by the Company with an alteration to the location of a small waste dump site. The public comment on the DEIS closed on July 15, 1996, with no significant adverse comments. Permitting with the State of Utah was completed in January, 1997. The Final Environmental Impact Statement was issued by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in February. At this writing the project is in the 30-day availability period before a Record of Decision is due to be announced in mid-March.
See "Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Environmental Matters" for a discussion of other potential environmental issues which could arise with respect to the property.
COPPER SPUR PROPERTY
No Known Reserves
The Company is in the exploration stage with respect to the Copper Spur Property and the property is without a known body of reserves. Because of the recent date of acquisition of the property the Company has not yet commissioned independent geologists and consultants to perform certain tests on the property or to make preliminary estimates of the extent of the mineral deposit(s) and the metallurgical properties of the deposit(s). Work completed by the Company is described below.
Location and Access
The Copper Spur Property covers approximately 600 acres and is located in north-central Colorado, approximately 65 miles south of Hayden, Colorado. The property consists of 30 unpatented lode mining claims. Assessment rental fees of $100 per claim are required to be paid annually on or before August 31 of each year. The property is accessible via highways and a county maintained gravel road.
Interest of the Company in the Property
The Company owns directly 30 unpatented lode mining claims staked in September and October, 1996 on public lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
Previous Work Undertaken
The copper + lead deposit on the property was first mined in the early 1900's. Small scale underground production of high grade copper and lead occurred sporadically into the 1950's. There are no official records of production from the mine in the Company's possession, but average ore grade was reported to be +2% copper. Underground workings extend down-dip for a distance of 650 feet and cover a cross-strike width of 200 ft. Almost all of the workings are contained within the copper-bearing rock unit.
The property was staked in 1994 by Chemical Lime Company (CLC) to cover exposures of the Leadville Limestone which overlies the copper-bearing unit. CLC drilled four diamond drill holes on the property in 1995 on a spacing of approximately one-mile centers, targeting all of the holes for the limestone unit. One of the holes was drilled in the area of the copper deposit, and it apparently intersected copper immediately below the limestone unit, where the hole was terminated. None of the other three holes penetrated the copper-bearing unit. CLC dropped their claims in August, 1996 and the Company staked the ground immediately thereafter.
Work Completed by the Company
The Copper Spur property contains a stratabound disseminated copper oxide deposit and target area contained within the Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite. The deposit/target dips shallowly to the south at a slightly higher angle than the topographic slope. The Company completed surveying of the underground workings and channel sampled the workings on regular 50 ft. intervals. Complete back-to-floor channel samples were taken throughout the underground workings to document the copper content of the deposit/exploration target. Both back and floor remain in the copper zone. Average channel height was approximately 8 ft. The channel samples cover an area with dimensions of 700 ft. x 200 ft. The 26 full-height channel samples returned values from 0.327%Cu to 6.50%Cu, with an average of 1.74%Cu. The full thickness of the copper zone is unknown. The deposit is truncated by a fault along the eastern edge of the workings, but the displacement on this fault appears to be nominal, with the offset extension to the deposit probably lying within a vertical distance of 50 ft. or less.
Surface geologic mapping of the property indicates the target area has dimensions of approximately 5,000 ft. x 1,500 ft., and lies at depths of less than 200 ft. A 15-20 hole drilling program for 1997 is being planned to test the extensions to the deposit throughout the target area.
Planned Exploration Program
A preliminary drilling program is being planned for 1997 to test the potential of the known deposit and surrounding target area. The deposit/target lies at shallow depths below the surface, based on preliminary geologic mapping. The Company plans to drill 15-20 shallow (200-300 ft.) holes across an area approximately 1,500 ft. X 1,500 ft. To initially test the potential of the target area. Follow-up drilling of an additional 15-20 holes would ensue upon discovery of appreciable copper in the first phase of drilling.
Detailed mapping and soil/rock sampling of the known ore horizon across a strike length of greater than one mile will also help quantify the full potential of the property.
Plant and Equipment
There are no surface or underground plant or equipment on the Copper Spur Property, other than the vestigial remnants of small iron precipitation tanks and ponds which were built on the property in the 1950's. These have no value nor do they represent an impediment to development of the property.
Environmental Matters
The Copper Spur Property is in an arid geographic location and has had a long history of exploration and mining activity. The Company has yet to undertake an environmental review of the Property and will undertake such review if and when it conducts a Feasibility Study on the Property. See "Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Environmental Matters" for a discussion of potential environmental issues which could arise with respect to the property.
C. CASHIN PROPERTY, MONTROSE COUNTY, COLORADO
No Known Reserves
The Company is in the exploration stage with respect to the Cashin Property and the property is without a known body of reserves. The Company has performed or commissioned independent geologists and consultants to perform certain tests on the property to make preliminary estimates of the extent of the mineral deposits and the metallurgical properties of the ore located on the property. The results of those tests are summarized below. The following information provides no information about the economic or legal feasibility of extraction of minerals on the Property and no assurance can be given that the Cashin Property contains a commercially minable mineral deposit until further close drilling is performed and a final economic Feasibility Study based upon such work is completed.
In January, 1996, the Company received results from an independent consulting geologist of a mineral deposit estimate for the Cashin deposit based upon all available drilling results including the Company's 1994 and 1995 drilling programs. The estimated geological mineral deposits were 13,127,754 tons grading 0.496 percent copper. The mineral deposit volume was calculated to include the volume of ore contained within the drill hole patterns, but in no event further than 200 feet from a drill hole. The volume calculation was further constrained by the top and bottom of the ore host sandstone (Wingate Sandstone). A tonnage factor of 13 cubic feet per ton was used to convert volume to tonnage. This is the factor commonly used to compute tonnage for the Wingate Sandstone formation throughout the region. Grade was calculated by a weighted average of all intercepts contained within the volume of the deposit.
Drill cuttings from the Company's 1994 drill program were tested for their metallurgical properties. A total of 296 samples were taken, representing all of the five-foot intercepts which assayed 0.1% copper or higher. 138 of the samples in the oxide zone were subjected to acid leach tests and produced average recoveries of 85.5%. 121 samples from the sulfide zone were subjected to cyanide leach tests and produced average recoveries of 83%. There was a wide range of individual recoveries, probably due to mineralogical differences.
Because of its open-pit, heap leach potential, the primary exploration target on the Cashin Property is the Wingate Sandstone bed adjacent to the Cashin Fault and the Cliff Dweller Fault. The recent drilling and mapping indicate that, although only a small portion of the Cashin Fault zone has been explored by drilling, it has positive potential for open pittable disseminated type copper deposits.
The Company obtained a report in February, 1995 from an independent mining engineer concerning its interest in the Property (the "Cashin Report"). The Cashin Report recommended additional drilling of the Cashin oxide zone to increase the mineral deposit base and several wildcat holes to test other veins such as the Cliff Dweller and Michigan. This program was completed in June, 1995. Nineteen additional holes were drilled and 16 of the holes intersected the deposit in the main target zone and returned an average grade of .59% copper over 134 feet including one hole which intersected 160 feet of 1.18% copper. Three holes failed to intersect significant mineralization.
Location and Access
The Cashin Property covers approximately 2,542 acres and is located in the southwestern corner of Colorado, approximately 50 miles southeast of Moab, Utah, five miles south of Paradox, Colorado, and situated about 20 miles northeast of the Lisbon Valley Property. The Property consists of 14 patented and 122 unpatented mining claims and three millsites. Assessment rental fees of $100 per unpatented claim are required to be paid annually on or before August 31 of each year. The Property is accessible via highways and a county-maintained gravel road.
Interest of the Company in the Property
The Company holds options to purchase the patented claims and 68 of the unpatented claims. The Company also directly holds 56 additional unpatented claims. The Company's interest in the Cashin Property originated from two underlying option agreements which were assigned to Summo USA from St. Mary in November 1993. The two agreements are as follows:
Moretz Agreement. Pursuant to an Exploration and Purchase Option Agreement made as of September 1, 1993, (as revised March 29, 1996), Summo USA maintains an option (the "Option") to purchase a 100% ownership interest in 12 patented lode mining claims and three patented millsites containing an aggregate of approximately 102 acres on or before September 1, 2000, by paying to the owners the sum of $370,000 as follows:
a. $10,000 upon execution of the agreement b. $20,000 on or before March 1, 1994 c. $20,000 on or before September 1, 1994 g. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1995 h. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1996 i. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1997 j. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1998 k. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1999 l. $70,000 on or before September 1, 2000
As of December 31, 1996 all required payments had been made. During the term of the Option, Summo USA has the unrestricted right to conduct exploration and development operations on such claims.
Ahlstrom/Peacock Agreement. Pursuant to an Option Agreement made as of September 27, 1993,(as revised March 29, 1996), Summo USA maintains an option to purchase an undivided two-thirds ownership interest in two patented lode claims and a 100% ownership interest in 68 unpatented lode claims containing an aggregate of approximately 1,320 acres on or before September 1, 2001, by paying to the owners the sum of $770,000 as follows:
a. $10,000 upon execution of the agreement b. $20,000 on or before March 1, 1994 c. $20,000 on or before September 1, 1994 d. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1995 e. $50,000 on or before September 1, 1996 f. $100,000 on or before September 1, 1997 g. $100,000 on or before September 1, 1998 h. $100,000 on or before September 1, 1999 i. $120,000 on or before September 1, 2000 j. $200,000 on or before September 1, 2001
As of December 31, 1996 all required payments had been made.
Previous Work Undertaken
The copper-silver deposits on the Property were discovered and staked in 1895. Small scale underground production of high-grade ore by one or more unknown operators started in 1896 and continued intermittently until 1946. Official records indicate that total production from the two mines on the Property, Cashin and Cliff Dweller, was 1,835,355 pounds of copper and 427,319 ounces of silver recovered from 23,151 tons of ore. Therefore the average ore grade was about 4% copper and 18.5 ounces per ton of silver.
Around 1969 a program of geochemical sampling and drilling was conducted on the Property by Valley Metallurgical Processing Company of Moab, Utah. A total of 4,379 feet was drilled in 43 holes on various parts of the Property, and the Company has obtained the drilling records for 40 of the holes. The Property remained inactive from 1970 to 1993, when St. Mary obtained a lease.
Work Completed by the Company
The Company acquired the Cashin Property in November, 1993 and has spent approximately $707,000 for land acquisition costs, rental payments, drilling, metallurgy, and general and administrative expenses through December 31, 1996. In October and November, 1993 the Company undertook a 12-hole reverse-circulation drilling program totaling 3,515 feet to test the bulk tonnage copper-oxide potential of the Property. The results indicate that oxide mineralization predominates to a depth of 150-165 feet. Beneath this lies a 10-40 foot thick transition zone, below which sulfides predominate. An additional 25 holes were completed in 1995 to further define the extent of the copper mineral deposit.
In late 1994, the Company engaged a consultant to carry out a mineral deposit estimate for the Cashin Property, which estimate was updated in January, 1996 after completion of the 1995 drilling program. The results are summarized above under "No Known Reserves."
Planned Exploration Program
A metallurgical study is currently under way to determine potential recoveries from acid leach SX-EW extraction.
Plant and Equipment
There is no surface or underground plant or equipment on the Cashin Property other than several old derelict buildings dating from mining operations in the 1920s and there has been no underground exploration on the property except as herein set forth.
Environmental Matters
The Cashin Property is in an arid geographic location and has had a long history of exploration and mining activity. The Company has yet to undertake an environmental review of the Property and will undertake such review if and when it conducts a Feasibility Study on the Property. See "Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Environmental Matters" for a discussion of potential environmental issues which could arise with respect to the property.
D. CHAMPION PROPERTY, TAOS COUNTY, NEW MEXICO
No Known Reserves
The Company is in the exploration stage with respect to the Champion Property and the property is without a known body of reserves. The Company has performed or commissioned independent geologists and consultants to perform certain tests on the property to make preliminary estimates of the extent of the mineral deposits and the metallurgical properties of the ore located on the Property. The results of those tests are summarized below. The following information is preliminary and in any case can provide no information about the economic or legal feasibility of extraction of minerals on the Champion property. No assurance can be given that the Property contains a commercially minable mineral deposit until further close drilling is performed and a final economic Feasibility Study based upon such work is completed.
In a preliminary calculation St. Mary estimated a mineral deposit of 18,000,000 tons grading 0.4% copper. The mineral deposit volume was calculated to include the volume of ore contained within the drill hole patterns, but in no event further than 200 feet from a drill hole. A tonnage factor of 12 cubic feet per ton was used to convert volume to tonnage. Grade was calculated by a weighted average of all intercepts contained within the volume of the deposit. Samples submitted for leach testing indicated that the copper was soluble in sulfuric acid. As indicated below under "Previous Work Undertaken", Bear Creek Mining Co. estimated in 1968 a preliminary mineral deposit of 20,000,000 tons grading 0.23% copper.
Location and Access
The Champion Property is located in Taos County, New Mexico about 90 miles northeast of Albuquerque and 20 miles southwest of the town of Taos. The Property lies at about 8,000 feet above sea-level. Access to the Property may be gained by a gravel road off of a state highway. Power exists along the state highway. Interest of the Company in the Property
The Champion Property consists of approximately 4,500 acres located in the Picuris and Copper Mountain Mining District and comprises five patented lode mining claims (approximately 123 acres), four patented millsite claims (approximately 20 acres) and 223 unpatented lode mining claims (approximately 4,200 acres). The Company holds options to acquire a 100% ownership interest in the patented claims and seven unpatented claims and acquired a 100% ownership interest in another 64 unpatented claims (approximately 4,060 acres) by staking in September, 1994 and February, 1996.
The Company's interest in the Champion Property is derived from three underlying agreements which entitle the Company to purchase a 100% ownership interest, subject to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty, in a portion of the Property. The three agreements were assigned to Summo USA from St. Mary in consideration of the issuance of 80,000 shares of the Common Stock of the Company to St. Mary as reimbursement of the $60,000 expended by St. Mary and the payment to St. Mary of a 1.5% net smelter return royalty. The material terms of the three underlying agreements are as follows:
Hill Agreement. Pursuant to an Exploration and Purchase Option Agreement (the "Hill Agreement") made as of August 1, 1994, the owners granted to St. Mary an option (the "Option") to purchase a 100% ownership interest in nine patented mining claims and millsites (collectively the "Patented Claims") located in the Picuris and Copper Mountain Mining District, and comprising approximately 120 acres by paying to the owners $500,000 as follows:

Previous Work Undertaken
The Champion Mine was developed in the early 1900s with a 310 foot adit that connected to two short shafts. The development was on a quartz vein and later sampling along the adit returned a grade of 1.17% copper over 310 feet.
The Champion Property has been explored intermittently over the past 25 years by several major copper companies, and essentially all of the work has been drilling around the Champion adit and extending eastward toward Copper Hill. The largest program was a 59-hole program conducted in 1968 by Bear Creek Mining Co. ("Bear Creek"). The drilling was done with an air-track drill and none of the holes was longer than 200 feet and 24 were less than 100 feet in length. Based on the drilling, Bear Creek estimated a mineral deposit of 20,000,000 tons grading 0.23% copper. Bear Creek also channel-sampled the Champion adit and several cross-cuts which returned grades ranging from 0.04% to 5.0% copper.
In succeeding years, Duval Corp, Conoco Oil Inc., Anaconda Corporation and Phelps Dodge Corporation each conducted exploration work, although Phelps Dodge appears to have been targeting gold and silver mineralization and not copper.
In 1994, the Champion Property was acquired by St. Mary, which reassayed all the Phelps Dodge samples greater than 0.1% copper. The results returned significant grades--for example, 75 feet of 0.32% copper in one hole in the interval 50-125 feet and 50 feet of 0.607% copper in another hole in the interval 115-165 feet. St. Mary also carried out a limited orientation soil geochemical survey on the north flank of Copper Hill which outlined a weak copper anomaly open to both the east and west.
Work Completed by the Company
The Company acquired the Champion Property in May, 1995 and has spent approximately $400,000 on the Property for land acquisition costs, rental payments, geological, drilling, and general and administrative expenses through December 31, 1996.
The Company obtained a report in January, 1995 concerning its interest in the Property from independent mining engineers. The report recommends that an exploration program (Phase I) be carried out at an estimated cost of $145,000 comprising a drilling program to confirm the grade and size of the existing deposit and to expand its limits; a soil geochemical survey to trace the mineralization across the valley immediately east of the deposit; and prospecting, mapping and rock sampling to determine the extent and tenor of the mineralization on the claims located in the Copper Mountain area. This program was completed in 1995.
Planned Exploration Program
The Company is currently evaluating the results of the 18 drill holes completed in 1996. An additional 10-20 drill holes may be proposed in 1997 to fill in gaps in the current drill pattern, before further exploration on the property is contemplated.
The Company's object is to identify a drill-indicated resource in excess of 200 million pounds of copper, which would be amenable to open pit mining, heap leaching and recovery by SX-EW.
Plant and Equipment
There is no plant or equipment on the Champion Property.
Environmental Matters
The Champion Property is situated in a high, unpopulated pinion-juniper arid area with a long history of mining activity. The Company has yet to undertake an environmental review of the Champion Property. The Company will undertake such a review if and when it conducts a Feasibility Study on the Property. See "Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Environmental Matters" for a discussion of potential environmental issues which could arise with respect to the Property.
D. CACTUS GOLD MINES PROPERTY, KERN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA
No Known Reserves
The Company is in the exploration stage with respect to the Cactus Gold Mines property and the property is without a known body of reserves. Because of the recent date of option to purchase the property the Company has not received results from the independent geologists and consultants commissioned to perform certain tests on the property or to make preliminary estimates of the extent of the mineral deposit(s) and the metallurgical properties of the deposit(s).
Location and Access
The Cactus Gold Mines Property is located in Kern County, California, in the western Mojave Desert about 60 miles north of Los Angeles and 9 miles west of the town of Mojave. Access to the property is via a paved road.
Interests of the Company in the Property
The Company has acquired options to purchase the interests of two mining companies in the Cactus Gold Mines property, subject to the terms of the underlying leases. The Company has until July, 1997 to review the property during the option period prior to making a decision whether or not to purchase the property rights. If the Company decides to exercise its purchase options, total costs are estimated at approximately $1 million.
Previous Work Undertaken
Gold was first mined on the property in 1894. Production increased during the Depression and was halted in 1942 by the War Order Act. CoCa Mines, Inc., reopened the property in 1986 as an open pit mine heap leach facility, and built the Shumake operation in 1988 with Compass mining Company as a minority partner. The property reached annual production of 60,000 ounces of gold in 1991. Hecla Mining Company purchased CoCa Mines and mined the existing reserves until 1992 when mine production ceased. Hecla continues to operate the property while it rinses the heaps prior to reclamation and closure. Production on the property totals approximately 400,000 ounces of gold and 3 million ounces of silver.
Planned Exploration Program
During the six-month option period, the Company plans to drill a series of test holes to confirm continuity and grade of the anticipated mineral deposit. In addition, the Company expects to commence metallurgical tests on bulk material from the current pit wall and from cuttings to verify metallurgical behavior of the anticipated mineral deposit. The Company is in the process of completing environmental and technical due diligence to confirm that there are no obvious flaws or liabilities / obligations which could potentially discourage the Company from proceeding with the acquisition. Summo has retained a consulting firm to assess the value of the property and to recommend alternative vehicles for Summo to realize the full value of the property.
Plant and Equipment
The Company estimates approximately $10 million worth of capital assets are included with the Cactus Gold Mines property, including operating permits, leach pads and ponds, buildings, power, water, telephone, and miscellaneous equipment. The Company estimates approximately $8 million of new capital would be required to restart operations. The property comes complete with operating permits and it is Summo's assessment that it could be placed back in production quickly.
Environmental Matters
The Cactus Gold Mines property is nearly fully permitted for operations. See "Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Environmental Matters" for a discussion of other potential environmental issues which could arise with respect to the property.
ITEM 3.
