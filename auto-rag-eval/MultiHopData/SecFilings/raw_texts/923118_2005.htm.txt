Item 2. Properties -------------------
As of December 31, 2005, the Owned Properties consisted of 153 multifamily residential communities containing 43,432 apartment units. At the time of the IPO (August 4, 1994), Home Properties owned 11 communities containing 3,065 units and simultaneously with the closing of the IPO acquired an additional four communities containing 926 units. From the time just prior to the IPO to December 31, 2005, the Company experienced a compounded annualized growth rate of 26.1% in the number of apartment units it owned. In 2005, Home Properties acquired 2,430 apartment units in seven communities for a total purchase price of approximately $283.4 million. Also in 2005, the Company sold four communities with a total of 816 units for total consideration of $142.6 million.
The Owned Properties are generally located in established markets in suburban neighborhoods and are well maintained and well leased. Average economic occupancy at the Owned Properties was 93.3% for 2005. Occupancy is defined as total possible rental income, net of vacancy and bad debt expense as a percentage of total possible rental income. Total possible rental income is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at market rents. The Owned Properties are typically two- and three-story garden style apartment buildings in landscaped settings and a majority are of brick or other masonry construction. The Company believes that its strategic focus on appealing to middle income residents and the quality of the services it provides to such residents results in lower resident turnover. Average turnover at the Owned Properties was approximately 45% for 2005, which is significantly below the national average of 61.3% for garden-style apartments.
Resident leases are generally for a one year term. Security deposits equal to one month's rent or less are generally required.
Certain of the Owned Properties secure mortgage loans. See Schedule III contained herein (F-42 to).
The table on the following pages illustrates certain of the important characteristics of the Owned Properties as of December 31, 2005.

Property Development --------------------
For approximately five years, from 1996 to 2000, the Company actively diversified its portfolio of market-rate communities with government assisted multifamily housing developed or re-developed by the Company. Effective December 31, 2000, the Company sold its affordable housing development operations to Conifer, LLC. Conifer, LLC is led by Richard J. Crossed, a former Executive Vice President and former director of the Company. At that time, the Company retained general partner ownership interests in and property management operations for 8,325 apartment units in 136 existing affordable communities.
In December 2002, the Company determined that it would market for sale virtually all of the assets associated with its interests in various affordable property limited partnerships. At that time, the Company announced its intention to sell the assets which include the equity interest in the affordable housing partnerships, loans, advances and management contracts.
During 2003, the Company was successful in selling its interest in entities that own in the aggregate 84 properties containing 2,590 units. During 2004, the Company closed on the sale of its general partner interests in an additional 26 entities that owned in the aggregate 1,952 units. During 2005, the Company sold 12 entities that owned in the aggregate 868 units. In addition, the Company completed the disposal of 1,057 units through a default on the non-recourse financing. The Company still holds an interest in one affordable limited partnership with 868 units. The Company will retain its ownership interest and will continue to manage this property located in Columbus, Ohio.
The Company has retained the ability to develop new market rate communities. It plans to engage in development activity only on a selective basis. The Company anticipates the development activity to be in the markets in which it currently is doing business, on land adjacent to existing properties or by increasing density of units at communities currently owned. Currently, the Company is developing a 120-unit apartment community in South Portland, Maine adjacent to a market-rate property the Company acquired in 1998. The first phase of the project, which consists of 48 units, was completed in the summer of 2005. The second and third phases, which consist of 72 units, are expected to be completed in the summer of 2006. The total construction cost at this community is anticipated to be $13.6 million upon completion. In addition, the Company is developing a 216-unit apartment community in Allentown, Pennsylvania, adjacent to a market-rate community purchased in 2000. The project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2008. The total construction cost for this development is anticipated to be $27.1 million upon completion. The construction in progress for these two development projects amounted to $4.5 million as of December 31, 2005.
Property Management -------------------
As of December 31, 2005, the Managed Properties consist of: (i) 868 apartment units where Home Properties is the general partner of the entity that owns the property; and (ii) 2,701 apartment units managed for others.
On January 1, 2004, the Company sold certain assets of its commercial property management division to Home Leasing LLC, which is owned by Nelson and Norman Leenhouts, who were the founders of Home Leasing, former Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company, and current Co-Chairs of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Leenhoutses"). This division managed approximately 2.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, as well as certain planned communities. The majority of the managed commercial properties are and have been owned in whole or in part by the Leenhoutses since before the Company's IPO in 1994. The sale was completed in order to permit the Company to focus solely on the direct ownership and management of market-rate apartment communities. The contribution from the commercial property management division to Home Properties' 2003 earnings was significantly less than one-half of one percent. The initial amount paid was $82,000. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive a percentage of the management fee received by Home Leasing LLC and its assigns in connection with the management of one of the commercial properties for a period not to exceed 36 months. If Home Leasing LLC or its assigns continues to manage that property for three years, the Company is expected to receive an additional deferred purchase price of $135,000, for a total consideration of $217,000. If the management of this property is retained for the entire three years, the gain on sale will be approximately $104,000.
The Company may pursue the management of additional properties not owned by the Company, but will only do so when such additional properties can be effectively and efficiently managed in conjunction with other properties owned or managed by Home Properties, or where the Company views the properties as potential acquisitions in desirable markets.
