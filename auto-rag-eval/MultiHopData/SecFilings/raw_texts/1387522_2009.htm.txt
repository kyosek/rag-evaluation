PROPERTIES
Property Locations and Descriptions
Pacific Copper holds mineral concessions in Chile and Peru. Pacific Copper’s subsidiary, Sociedad Pacific Copper Chile Limitada (a Chilean limited liability partnership,), holds or controls mining concessions in the Corral/Mofralla, Venapai, Guanaca, Carrizal, Cerro Blanco and Carrera Pinto mining districts of Chile and certain other areas in Atacama Region III of Chile (the “Chile Claims”). The Company also has a subsidiary, Pacific Copper Peru SRL (a Peruvian limited liability partnership) that holds claims in the Medalla Milagrosa district of Peru (the “Peru Claims”). There is no assurance that commercially viable mineralized material, let alone proven or probable reserves, exist on any of our mineral concessions and further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to economic feasibility is determined. We consider the La Guanaca, El Corral/La Mofralla, and the Venapai properties in Chile to be material. We do not consider any of our other properties to be material at this time; however the Company’s assessment may change if further exploration is undertaken on these properties.
Pacific Copper also held claims in Okanogan County, Washington referred to collectively as the “Mazama Claims”. On September 25, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to discontinue the exploration of the Mazama Claims in order to focus the Company’s efforts and resources on the Chile Claims and the Peru Claims. The Company has relinquished and let lapse with the United States Bureau of Land Management the Mazama Claims, thereby relieving the Company of the cost of maintaining these claims.

PAFICIC COPPER IN SOUTH AMERICA
SOCIEDAD PACIFIC COPPER CHILE LIMITADA
On January 8, 2008, Pacific Copper acquired 99% of the interests of Sociedad Pacific Copper Chile Limitada, a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of Chile (“Pacific LTDA”) pursuant to a share exchange agreement entered into as of April 11, 2007, as amended (the “Chile Agreement”) between the Company and the former partners of Pacific LTDA. In order to facilitate the formation of Pacific LTDA, upon execution of the Chile Agreement, the Company paid $25,000 to cover expenses relating to formation of Pacific LTDA and the consummation of the Chile Agreement. On August 9, 2007, Harold Gardner (then a partner of Pacific LTDA) was appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, in contemplation of the closing of the Chile Agreement. On November 26, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the appointment for Mr. Gardner, Eduardo Esteffan, Andrew Brodkey, George Orr and Elden Schorn to serve as directors of Pacific LTDA.
Pursuant to the Chile Agreement the Company issued, subject to an escrow agreement, an aggregate of 6,088,452 of its common shares to the former partners of Pacific LTDA as consideration for the acquisition (the “Consideration Shares”). Mr. Gardner received, in escrow, 2,425,000 Consideration Shares.
Immediately following the closing of the Chile Agreement, Pacific LTDA became a 99%-owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Esteffan retained a 1% partnership interest in Pacific LTDA (the “Retained Interest”) in order to comply with Chilean law requiring that a limited liability partnership have at least two members. The number of Consideration Shares Mr. Esteffan was originally scheduled to receive under the Chile Agreement (2,425,000 Shares) was reduced by 61,548 shares in order to avoid compensating him for the Retained Interest. The Retained Interest is subject to an option agreement between the Company and Mr. Esteffan that entitles the Company to purchase the Retained Interest in exchange for the issuance of 61,548 common shares of the Company at any time in the future.
Through closing of the Chile Agreement, Pacific LTDA holds title to or controls certain mineral concessions located in the Carrizal, Cerro Blanco and Carrera Pinto mining districts in Chile (the “Chile Claims”). The Consideration Shares were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, were restricted upon issuance, and were issued in escrow subject to a “Closing Agreement” between the Company, Pacific LTDA, and the former partners of Pacific LTDA. The conditions under the Closing Agreement have been satisfied or waived, and the Chile Consideration shares have been issued to the former partners of Pacific LTDA.
CHILEAN OXIDE/LEACHABLE COPPER PROJECTS
La Guanaca Chile Copper Oxide Property
On January 24, 2008, the Company, through its subsidiary Pacific LTDA entered into an exclusive exploration, mining and exploitation agreement (the "Guanaca Lease") for the La Guanaca oxide copper project located northeast of the town of Inca de Oro, Chanaral Province, Atacama Region 3, Chile. This property, which consists of approximately 250 hectares of exploration concessions, is road-accessible and was previously explored in the mid-1990's through geophysical methods, sampling and drilling by Empresa Nacional de Mineria ("ENAMI") a Chilean nationally-owned mining enterprise. The Guanaca Lease is for a term of 5 years and is renewable automatically for additional 5-year periods. The owners of the La Guanaca propertywill receive US$2,000 per month in cash as a lease payment during the term of the agreement.

CARRIZAL, CERRO BLANCO, AND CARRERA PINTO
PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS IN CHILE
History
The Carrizal District, the Cerro Blanco District and the Carrera Pinto District (collectively the “Porphyry Districts”) were known in Europe and the United States during the 1800’s. Chile led all countries in world copper production from 1850 - 1880, supplying as much as 40% of world demand. Almost half of all Chilean production during this period came from the Districts. The combined mining operations at Carrizal and Cerro Blanco provided from 10% to 15% of the world’s copper during the period from 1850-1880. These historical results are not indicative of future exploration results.
The Copiapo Mining Company, a British Company, operated in the Districts from 1836 until 1911. Total copper exported from the Districts during that period was estimated to be 750,000 tons. Gold production at Carrizal alone has been estimated to be as high as 1.7 million ounces. Based upon available records, half of the veins at Cerro Blanco carried substantial silver, which when hand cobbed, averaged 30 ounces per ton of ore. These historical results are not indicative of future exploration results.
Each of the Districts had dozens of high grade copper veins with precious metal by-products. After World War I, with deepening vein systems, production eventually dwindled and was replaced at mines such as El Teniente and Chuquicamata, with low grade porphyry systems, the technology for that made these sites economical to mine.
To the knowledge of the Company, no serious exploration effort has been made during the last 100 years in the Districts to locate any of the mineralizing porphyry systems. Currently, there is a renewed interest in the Carrera Pinto area, with several major mining companies having obtained land positions and planning drilling operations. In total, the Company holds 5,000 hectares of exploration concessions in these districts.
CARRERA PINTO DISTRICT
The Carrera Pinto District is located 60 kilometers northeast of Copiapo and is reached on paved roads using the highway to Inca del Oro. Travel time is less than an hour. Pacific Copper has three porphyry targets in a group of properties totaling approximately 2,750 hectares of constituted exploration concessions , with additional filings pending with respect to 1,100 additional hectares. The properties are located in the plain and along the fringes of a collapsed caldera system of approximately 20 kilometers in diameter. The hills forming the caldera walls are crossed with numerous veins and mantos containing copper with some silver.
Turkesa properties
The Turkesa properties cover over 700 hectares, with an additional 500 contiguous hectares covered by a filing, covering a porphyry target and crossing mantos. Land to the north is controlled by Teck Cominco Limited and the Dulcinea mine, with workings more than 6,000 feet deep. Additional lands will be claimed to the east as it becomes available. The crossing manto system feeds the Dulcinea complex, and a series of former mines to the north. A porphyry system is believed to be covered in large part by the Turkesa claims.
Cobrizo Properties
The Cobrizo properties cover 2,000 hectares of registered exploration concessions with additional amounts filed totaling an additional 600 hectares. Portions of this property were also drilled by CORFO Ltd., which identified a porphyritic system. Pacific Copper believes that it has covered a substantial portion of this system, as well as a small portion of an adjacent system which it shares with Phelps Dodge Mining Co., BHP Billiton, and Minera Carola.
A total of three porphyry systems, and a few crossing manto systems, comprise the targets at Carerra Pinto.
CODELCO, the Chilean state copper company, is also very active in the area, drilling a large plain 30 kilometers north of Carrera Pinto.
CERRO BLANCO DISTRICT
The porphyry system at Cerro Blanco is believed to be approximately eight square kilometers in area, of which Pacific Copper is estimated to control roughly 70%. This system mineralizes both the high grade lode veins of the historic district to the south, as well as the Corral chalcosite-silver veins to the north. Chalcosite is a copper mineral containing two atoms of copper for each atom of sulfide. The property consists of 940 hectares of registered exploration concessions, with an additional 200 hectares filed for registration.
Cerro Blanco is located approximately 90 kilometers south of Copiapo and is accessed using a paved road for half of the distance and an improved gravel road for the balance. Mean elevation of the porphyritic system is approximately 1,900 meters and weather conditions are appropriate for year round operations.
CARRIZAL DISTRICT
The porphyry system in the Carrizal District is approximately eight kilometers wide with two enriched copper ore zones, one on either side of a subsides area crossed by vein lodes which formed the bulk of past copper and gold production. The eastern zone is the largest porphyry target, about twelve square kilometers, almost all of which is covered by Pacific Copper’s 1,100 hectares of registered mining property. Pacific Copper will have 160 hectares of titled exploration concessions on the smaller western target, with applications for additional acreage pending.
Carrizal is accessed using the Pan American highway south of Copaipo for about an hour, then west on improved secondary roads for an additional 30 minutes. The mean elevation is 700 meters, and weather is temperate for year round operations.
The following tables show the mineral concessions held by Pacific LTDA in the Porphyry Districts.

The Consideration Shares were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and were restricted upon issuance. As of the date of this report, the Peru Consideration Shares remain in escrow, the Closing Conditions have not been satisfied, and the Company has not yet elected to waive any of the Closing Conditions.
The Company through Pacific LTDA also executed a letter of intent with a single vendor to acquire its interest in the Yerbas Buenas oxide copper property located 130 km southeast of the city of Copiapo, Atacama Region III. Chile. Yerbas Buenas is located roughly 20 km from the El Corral property. The vendor of Yerbas Buenas is Gareste, Ltda., a Chilean entity which is owned in part by a Director of the Company. The vendor will receive 2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at closing in exchange for its interest at Yerbas Buenas, and a 2% NSR royalty, capped at $6 million, 1% of which can be repurchased for the sum of $2 million at any time prior to commercial production. This transaction has not closed and is pending. The Company does not consider this property to be material. .
Pacific Copper held claims in Okanogan County, Washington referred to collectively as the “Mazama Claims”. On September 25, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to discontinue the exploration of the Mazama Claims in order to focus the Company’s efforts and resources on the Chile Claims and the Peru Claims.
