Office Premises
We conduct our activities from our principal and technical office located at Coresco AG, Level 3, Gotthardstrasse 20, 6304 Zug, Switzerland The telephone number is (+41) 7887-96966. These offices are provided to us on a month to month basis. We believe that these offices are adequate for our purposes. We do not own any real property or significant assets. Management believes that this space will meet our needs for the next 12 months.
Mining and Exploration Properties
Our properties are located in (i) the Tapajos Region of Brazil and (ii) near the city of Boulder in Colorado USA. In Brazil we have calculated a body of mineralized material to Guide 7 standards that equates to approximately 130,000 ounces of gold @ 2 grams per tonne. This mineralized material is located on our Sao Domingo’s property. The rest of our Brazil properties are in the preliminary exploration stage and do not contain any known bodies of ore.
Our strategy is to concentrate our efforts on: (i) existing operations where an infrastructure already exists; (ii) properties presently being developed and/or in advanced stages of exploration which have potential for additional discoveries; and (iii) grass-roots exploration opportunities. We are currently concentrating our property exploration activities in Brazil and Colorado a. We are also examining data relating to the potential acquisition of other exploration properties in Latin America, South America. Mineral exploration and development involves a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There is no assurance that our planned production will result in a commercial success, as production is gold price and politically sensitive. Once production has commenced we will be able to gauge the onward commercial viability of the project. There is no assurance that our planned mineral exploration and development activities will result in any further discoveries of commercially viable bodies of mineralization. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our exploration programs, which may be affected by a number of factors. Please refer to “Risk Factors.”
We currently have the Front Range Gold Project located near Boulder in the USA, an interest in three (3) projects located in Tapajos gold province in Para State, Brazil and one property located in British Columbia, Canada. We have conducted exploration activities on all our projects and have ranked the projects in order of merit and may discontinue such activities and dispose of some of the properties if further exploration work is not warranted.

Geology
The geology of the Săo Domingos property is predominantly composed of paleo-proterozoic Parauari Granites that play host to a number of gold deposits in the Tapajos Basin. Typical Granites of the younger Maloquinha Intrusive Suite have been noticed in the vicinity of Molly Gold Target, and basic rocks considered to be part of the mesoproterozoic Cachoeira Seca Intrusive Suite occur around the Esmeril target area.
The Săo Domingos property was a previous large alluvial operation, and the property area covers numerous areas of workings.
Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement
In May 2008 we signed an agreement with Samba Minerals Limited (“Samba”), which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the Săo Joăo project by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, we will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest in the property to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property. Samba can terminate its participation by providing us 30 days notice in writing. Upon withdrawal from its participation, Samba would forfeit to us all of its rights in relation to the project and would be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Samba will be the manager of the Săo Joăo project. A feasibility study has not been completed as of April 15, 2011 and thus no joint venture has been formed as of that date.
Location and access
The Sao Joao property is located in the central portion of the Southern Tapajos basin and is accessed by light aircraft from the regional centre of Itaituba. Access is also possible by unsealed roads linking up to the Transgarimpeiro highway and by a purpose cut heavy vehicle access track linking Sao Joao to the exploration centre at the primary project at Sao Domingo.
Tenure - Săo Joăo Project - DNPM Processes 851.533/94 to 851.592/94 inclusive:
The company has good title over the mineral rights which were granted in 1994 and 2005 by the Brazilian National department of Mineral Production DNPM - Departamento Nacional de Produçăo Mineral, as DNPM Process numbers 851.533/94 to 851.592/94 and which are valid and in force, free and clear of any judicial and extrajudicial encumbrances and taxes. The Săo Joăo mineral rights are located at the Municipality of Itaituba, State of Pará, and are registered in the name of the previous holder since an Exploration Permit has not yet been granted. The Săo Joăo mineral rights comprise 60 Applications for Alluvial Mine of 50 hectares each which was presented to DNPM on May 16, 1994. On August 30, 2006 the previous holder of the Applications applied for the conversion of the Applications to Exploration Permits. When the conversion request is approved by the Authorities, the previous holder will be granted the Exploration Permit for an area of 3000 ha. The assignment of the Săo Joăo mineral rights to Aurora can only be done after the approval of the Applications and the actual granting of an Exploration Permit to the previous Holder.
Option Agreement
The Săo Joăo Option Agreement dated January 20, 2006 and amendments dated June 2, 2008 and December 2, 2008, allows us to perform geological surveys and assessment work necessary to ascertain the existence of possible mineral deposits which may be economically mined and to earn a 100% interest in the Săo Joăo property mineral rights. Under the terms of the Option Agreement and amendments, a total amount of USD $1,435,000 (one million four hundred and thirty five thousand dollars) is due by Aurora for the acquisition of the Săo Joăo mineral rights. The total option agreement payments for the mineral rights are structured as follows: April 12, 2006 - USD $20,000 (paid); September 12, 2006 - USD $25,000 (paid); September 12, 2007 - USD $60,000 (paid); June 25, 2008 - $100,000 (paid by Samba Minerals Limited as part of the agreement with them as discussed in the Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement above); December 5, 2008 - USD $40,000 (paid by Samba Minerals Limited as part of the agreement with them as discussed in the Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement above); January 15, 2009 - USD $30,000 (paid by Samba Minerals Limited as part of the agreement with them as discussed in the Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement above); February 15, 2009 - USD $30,000 (paid by Samba Minerals Limited as part of the agreement with them as discussed in the Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement above); April 30, 2009 to March 30, 2011 - USD $8,333.33 per month (April 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010 paid by Samba Minerals Limited as part of the agreement with them as discussed in the Săo Joăo - Samba Minerals farm in agreement above); July 30, 2011 - USD $950,000. The vendor will have a 1.5% Net Smelter Royalty. The Royalty payment can be purchased at any time upon written notice to the vendor and payment in Reals (Brazilian currency) of the equivalent of USD $1,000,000. The option agreement can be terminated at any time upon written notice to the vendor and we will be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due.
Geology
The prime targets for the Săo Joăo property are located around and on the intersection of regional NW and NNW faults within the Pararui Intrusive Suite and this area has been the focus of large-scale alluvial workings. The Pararui Intrusive Suite has proven to host the vast majority of gold deposits elsewhere within the Tapajos Gold Province. We conducted a rock chip program over an area currently being excavated for gold in quartz systems via shallow underground workings. The sample results have demonstrated that the quartz vein systems are highly mineralized and considered continuous for at least 200m. We are confident that the quartz vein systems are much more extensive and are currently planning to increase the sample density of rock and soil sampling over, and adjacent to, the current workings to locate further mineralized vein systems, and to drill test their depth extensions in the near future.
Previous mining activity over a number of years focused on the alluvial deposits within its many tributaries, and has now progressed to include the saprolite host rock and out cropping quartz veins.
Comandante Araras - Samba Minerals farm in agreement
In May 2008 we signed an agreement with Samba, which was subsequently amended in August 2008, whereby Samba can earn up to an 80% participating interest in the Comandante Araras projects by funding exploration expenditures to completion of a feasibility study on the property. Upon completion of a feasibility study, we will immediately transfer an 80% participation interest to Samba and enter into a formal joint venture agreement to govern the development and production of minerals from the property. Samba can terminate its participation by providing us 30 days notice in writing. Upon withdrawal from its participation, Samba would forfeit to us all of its rights in relation to the project and would be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due. Samba will be the manager of the Comandante Araras project. A feasibility study has not been completed as of April 15, 2011 and thus no joint venture has been formed as of that date.
Location and access
The Comandante Araras property is located in the central portion of the Southern Tapajos basin and is accessed by light aircraft from the regional centre of Itaituba. The project adjoins the Săo Joăo project to the south east. Access is also possible by unsealed roads linking up to the Transgarimpeiro highway and by a purpose cut heavy vehicle access track linking Săo Joăo to the exploration centre at the primary project at Sao Domingo.
Tenure - Comandante Araras Project - DNPM Processes 853.785/93 to 853.839/93 inclusive:
We have good title over the mineral rights which were granted by the Brazilian Department of Mines (Departamento Nacional de Produçăo Mineral - “DNPM”) as DNPM Process numbers 853.785/93 to 853.839/93 and which are valid and in force, free and clear of any judicial and extrajudicial encumbrances and taxes. The Comandante Araras mineral rights are located at the Municipality of Itaituba, State of Pará, and are registered in the name of the previous holder since an Exploration Permit has not yet been granted. The Comandante Arara mineral rights comprise 55 Applications for Alluvial Mine of 50 hectares each and the Applications for the rights were presented to DNPM on October 5, 1993. The conversion to Exploration Permits has not been applied for yet. The assignment of the Comandante Araras mineral rights to Aurora can only be done after the approval for the conversion of the Applications and the actual granting of an Exploration Permit to the previous Holder.

The option agreement can be terminated at any time upon written notice to the vendor and we will be free of any and all payment commitments yet to be due.
Geology
The geology of the Comandante Araras property is dominated by two regional faults in the Parauari granite that strike North west in the northern half of the property and South east in the southern part of the property. The project was selected based on the potential trends of mineralization striking towards Comandante Araras from the Săo Joăo project.
British Columbia, Canada
Kumealon
Location and access
In February 1999, we acquired, by staking, a high grade limestone property three (3) square kilometers (741 acres) located on the north shore of Kumealon Inlet, 54 kilometers south-southeast of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada.
This property is highlighted by consistence of purity and whiteness of the limestone zone outcropping along the southwest shore of Kumealon Lagoon. The zone is comprised mostly of white, recrystallized, fine to course grained limestone, striking 150 degrees and can be traced for at least 1200 meters. The zone is estimated to have an average stratigraphic thickness of 180 meters. Chip samples taken across the zone averaged 55.06% CaO, 2.11% insolubles and 43.51% ignition loss. This property has no known reserves.
We have conducted only preliminary exploration activities on these properties. None of the foregoing properties contain any known reserves.
