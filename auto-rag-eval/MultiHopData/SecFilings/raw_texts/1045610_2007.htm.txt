Properties
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2007, we owned and managed 1,060 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 118.2 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, we had 788 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 78.0 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 45 markets throughout the United States and in Canada, China, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Our industrial properties were 96.0% leased to 2,591 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.5% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 15 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information related to our operations.
Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings.
The following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on square footage, of our total owned and managed operating portfolio, which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term.
Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options.
Overview of Principal Global Markets. Our industrial properties are typically located near key international passenger and cargo airports, seaports and major highway systems in major metropolitan areas, which include Chicago, Northern New Jersey/New York City, Paris, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, South Florida, Southern California, Tokyo and U.S. On-Tarmac. Our other markets in the Americas are Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Mexico City, Minneapolis, Monterrey, New Orleans, Orlando, Querétaro, Savannah, Tijuana and Toronto. In Europe, our other markets are Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Rotterdam. In Asia, our markets are Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai and Singapore.
Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These infill locations are typically near major airports, seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.
Portfolio Overview
The following includes our owned and managed operating portfolio and development properties, investments in operating properties through non-managed unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and recently completed developments that have not yet been placed in operations but are being held for sale or contribution:
(1)
Annualized base rent (“ABR”) is calculated as monthly base rent (cash basis) per the terms of the lease, as of December 31, 2007, multiplied by 12.
(2)
See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a discussion of why management believes same store cash basis NOI is a useful supplemental measure for our management and investors, of ways to use this measure when assessing the Company’s financial performance, and the limitations of the measure as a measurement tool.
(3)
Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenant’s term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation.
(4)
Includes domestic on-tarmac air cargo facilities at 14 airports.
(5)
Annualized base rent for leases denominated in foreign currencies is translated using the currency exchange rate at December 31, 2007.
(6)
Owned and managed is defined by us as assets in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term.
(7)
Includes investments in operating properties through our investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures that we do not manage, and are therefore excluded from our owned and managed portfolio, and the location of our global headquarters.
(8)
Represents development projects available for sale or contribution that are not included in the operating portfolio.

Properties held through Co-investment Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships
The following table summarizes our ten consolidated and unconsolidated significant co-investment ventures as of December 31, 2007:
Consolidated Co-investment Ventures:
As of December 31, 2007, we held interests in co-investment ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties, which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general partner, exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, we and the other party to the co-investment venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests by us or the other party to the co-investment venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the co-investment venture to sell our or their interest in the co-investment venture to the co-investment venture or to the other co-investment venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures include buy/sell provisions.

Secured Debt
As of December 31, 2007, we had $1.5 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2007, the total gross investment book value of those properties securing the debt was $2.1 billion. Of the $1.5 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.1 billion was consolidated co-investment venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $1.8 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Part IV, Item 15: Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations.
