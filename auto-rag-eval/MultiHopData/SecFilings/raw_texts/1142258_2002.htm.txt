Item 2 of this Form 10-K.
Competition
We compete primarily in the upper upscale sector of the full-service segment of the lodging industry. Each geographic market where we own hotels has other full- and limited-service hotels that compete with our hotels. Competition in the U.S. lodging industry is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of
location, brand affiliation, price, range of services and guest amenities offered, and quality of customer service and overall product.
Seasonality
Demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns. For non-resort properties, demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season. For resort properties, demand is generally higher in winter and early spring. Since the majority of our hotels are non-resort properties, our operations generally reflect non-resort seasonality patterns. We typically have lower revenue, operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue, operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters. These general trends are, however, greatly influenced by overall economic cycles.
Employees
As of December 31, 2002, we employed 30 persons, all of whom work at our corporate headquarters in Washington D.C.
Governmental Regulation
Americans with Disabilities Act
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, all public accommodations must meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Although significant amounts have been and continue to be invested in ADA-required upgrades to our hotels, a determination that we are not in compliance with the ADA could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We are likely to incur additional costs in complying with the ADA; however, such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Environmental Laws
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in property. Laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate contaminated property, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent real property or to borrow funds using real property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by those persons.
Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with the ownership and operation of our hotels, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the regulated substances and storage tanks and claims related thereto. Activities have been undertaken to close or remove storage tanks located on the property of several of our hotels.
All of our hotels have undergone Phase I environmental site assessments, which generally provide a nonintrusive physical inspection and database search, but not soil or groundwater analyses, by a qualified independent environmental engineer. The purpose of a Phase I assessment is to identify potential sources of contamination for which the hotels may be responsible and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. The Phase I assessments have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns. Nevertheless, it is possible that these environmental site assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist of which we are currently unaware.
In addition, our hotels have been inspected to determine the presence of asbestos. Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations also require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Asbestos-containing materials are present in various building materials such as sprayed-on ceiling treatments, roofing materials or floor tiles at some of our hotels. Operations and maintenance programs for maintaining asbestos-containing materials have been or are in the process of being designed and implemented, or the asbestos-containing materials have been scheduled to be or have been abated, at these hotels. Any liability resulting from non-compliance or other claims relating to environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
In recent years there has been a widely-publicized proliferation of mold-related claims by tenants, employees and other occupants of buildings against the owners of those buildings. To date, a few such claims have been filed against us by employees of hotels where mold has been detected. Mold-related claims are not covered by our insurance programs. These claims have not been material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In every hotel where we have identified a measurable presence of mold, whether or not a claim has been made, we have undertaken remediation we believe to be appropriate for the circumstances encountered. Unfortunately, there is little in the way of government standards, insurance industry specifications or otherwise generally accepted guidelines dealing with mold propagation. Although considerable research into mold toxicity and exposure levels is underway, it may be several years before definitive standards are available to property owners against which to evaluate risk and design remediation practices. We cannot predict the outcome of any future regulatory requirements to deal with mold-related matters. We also do not believe that, currently, any potential mold-related liabilities, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

RISK FACTORS
Financing Risks
We are highly leveraged; our significant amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
As of December 31, 2002, we had $1.7 billion of total debt outstanding, or 65% of our total capitalization. We are subject to the risks normally associated with significant amounts of debt, including the risks that:
•
our vulnerability to downturns in our business, such as the one we are currently experiencing, is increased, requiring us to reduce our capital expenditures as described further in “Operating Risks” (the potential adverse impact of our failure to meet the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements), and restricting our ability to make acquisitions;
•
our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;
•
we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness, including secured indebtedness;
•
the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; and
•
we currently are, and may in the future be, unable to make distributions on any of our OP Units, except as required to maintain MeriStar Hospitality’s qualification as a REIT.
We may be required to refinance our indebtedness, and the failure to refinance our indebtedness may have a material, adverse effect on us.
As of December 31, 2002, we had $154.3 million payable to MeriStar Hospitality (represents their subordinated notes maturing in 2004); $205 million payable to MeriStar Hospitality (represents their senior subordinated notes maturing in 2007); $300 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2008 and $250 million maturing in 2009; $314.6 million of collateralized mortgage-backed securities maturing in 2009; $400 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2011; and $38 million of mortgage debt maturing between 2003 and 2012. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our indebtedness at maturity, we will have to refinance the indebtedness through additional debt financing. This additional financing might include private or public offerings of debt securities and additional non-recourse or other collateralized indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of hotels or other assets on disadvantageous terms. This could potentially result in losses and adverse effects on cash flow from operating activities. If we are unable to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, our outstanding indebtedness could be accelerated, and our properties could be foreclosed upon by the secured lenders with a consequent loss of income and asset value.
Our senior secured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments have restrictive covenants that could affect our financial condition.
We currently have, and as of December 31, 2002 had, no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. Our ability to borrow under this facility is subject to financial covenants, including leverage and interest rate coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. Our compliance with these covenants in future periods will depend substantially upon the financial results of our hotels. If we fail to meet a future compliance measure, the availability of funds under our credit facility might be restricted. The credit agreement limits our ability to effect mergers, asset sales and change of control events, and limits dividends. The credit agreement also contains a cross-default provision, which would be triggered by a default or acceleration of $50 million or more of indebtedness secured by our assets or $5 million or more of any other indebtedness. Because we were not in compliance with the leverage covenant under the credit agreement as of March 10, 2003, we could not borrow under the credit agreement and do not expect to be able to do so in the future unless we amend or replace our credit facility, or use the proceeds from any future asset sales to reduce our leverage. See “Recent Developments - New Senior Revolving Credit Facility.”
As of December 31, 2002, we had the following outstanding borrowings:
•
$154.3 million payable to MeriStar Hospitality (represents their convertible subordinated notes due 2004 bearing interest at 4.75%);
•
$205 million payable to MeriStar Hospitality (represents their senior subordinated notes due 2007 bearing interest at a weighted-average annual rate of 8.69%);
•
$300 million of senior unsecured notes due 2008 bearing interest at 9%;
•
$250 million of senior unsecured notes due 2009 bearing interest at 10.50%;
•
$314.6 million of collateralized mortgage-backed securities due 2009 bearing interest at a rate of 8.01%;
•
$400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2011 bearing interest at 9.125%; and
•
$38 million of mortgage debt maturing between 2003 and 2012 at interest rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.5%.
The indentures relating to some of our outstanding debt contain limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events, as well as other limitations, including limitations on:
•
Incurring additional indebtedness;
•
Selling our assets;
•
Conducting transactions with our affiliates; and
•
Incurring liens.
In this respect, the indentures relating to our senior unsecured notes and MeriStar Hospitality’s senior subordinated notes significantly restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and MeriStar Hospitality from paying dividends, and our ability to acquire or prepay certain of our debt if our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in these indentures) is less than 2 to 1 for our most recently ended four fiscal quarters. Such ratio has been less than 2 to 1 since March 2002, and was at 1.6 to 1 as of December 31, 2002.
Debt instruments we issue in future offerings will likely contain similar restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. In addition, they may require us to maintain specific financial ratios and to satisfy various financial covenants. We may be required to take action to reduce our debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives to meet these ratios and satisfy these covenants.
Our secured facility is secured by a portfolio of 19 hotels and contains standard provisions that require the servicer to maintain in escrow cash balances for certain items such as property taxes and funding of capital expenditures. In addition, the facility contains a provision that requires our mortgage servicer to retain in escrow the excess cash from the encumbered hotels after payment of debt service (“Excess Cash”), if net hotel operating income after payment of FF&E reserves and franchise fees (“NOI”) for the trailing twelve months declines below $57 million. This provision was triggered in October 2002 and will be effective until the hotels generate the minimum cash flow required for two consecutive quarters, at which time the cash being held in escrow will be released to us. Approximately $4.5 million of cash was held in escrow under this provision as of December 31, 2002. Additional amounts continue to be held in escrow. The security agreement permits us to substitute unleveraged properties into the portfolio in place of existing properties in order to increase the NOI to a level at which the portfolio will meet this requirement. We have begun discussions with the servicer regarding this substitution.
We may be able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage.
Although the terms of our debt instruments restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. If we add new debt to our current debt, the related risks we now face could intensify and increase the risk of default on our indebtedness.
Rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and interest expense.
Any borrowings we make under our senior secured revolving credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate. In addition, in the future we may incur indebtedness bearing interest at a variable rate, or we may be required to refinance our existing indebtedness at higher interest rates. Accordingly, to the extent we borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facility, increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow, reducing the amounts available to make payments on our other indebtedness, make acquisitions, or pursue other business opportunities.
Operating Risks
Acts of terrorism, the threat of terrorism, the war with Iraq and the potential conflicts with other countries, and the ongoing war against terrorism have had a negative impact on and will continue to have a negative effect on our industry and our results of operations.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have had a negative impact on our hotel operations from the third quarter of 2001 to the present, causing lower than expected performance in an already slowing economy. The events of September 11 have caused a significant decrease in our hotels’ occupancy and average daily rate due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns, and concerns about travel safety. Major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been adversely affected by concerns about air travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel.
The September 11 terrorist attacks were unprecedented in scope, and in their immediate, dramatic impact on travel patterns. We have not previously experienced such events, and it is currently not possible to accurately predict if and when travel patterns will be restored to pre-September 11 levels. While we have had improvements in our operating levels from the period immediately following the attacks, we believe the uncertainty associated with subsequent incidents, the war with Iraq and the possibility with other countries, threats and the possibility of future attacks will continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns for the next several quarters.
The recent economic slowdown, the threat of further terrorist attacks, and the uncertainty of a conflict with Iraq and other countries have materially affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our revenue per available room, or RevPAR, performance and operating cash flows, and if they worsen or continue, these effects could become materially more adverse.
We have experienced the following declines in RevPAR:
•
18.0% decline during the first quarter of 2002, as compared to the same period of 2001;
•
11.3% decline during the second quarter of 2002, as compared to the same period of 2001;
•
5.3% decline during the third quarter of 2002, as compared to the same period of 2001; and
•
8.6% decline during the full year 2002, as compared to full year 2001.
After generating $224 million of cash from operations during 2000, we generated $150.1 million during 2001 and $56.7 million of cash from operations during 2002. The decreases from 2000 are due to the economic slowdown that began in 2001, as well as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the continuing threat of further terrorist attacks and the uncertainty of potential conflicts with Iraq and other countries. A sharper-than-anticipated decline in business and leisure travel was the primary cause of the declines, which were principally reflected in decreased occupancies. If the current economic slowdown worsens significantly or
continues for a protracted period of time, the declines in occupancy could also lead to further declines in average daily room rates and could have a further material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and EBITDA.
We expect to fund our continuing operations, which primarily include our interest expense and capital expenditures, through cash generated by our hotels and to the extent necessary from the proceeds of sales of non-core hotel assets. In response to the decline in our cash flows since September 11, 2001, we have significantly curtailed our capital expenditure programs, which may adversely affect the competitive position of our hotels in their markets. We expect capital expenditures of $40 million to $50 million in 2003. If the current economic conditions worsen, we may have to curtail our capital expenditures even further. We have also sold non-core assets to generate cash. Since the fourth quarter in 2001, we have sold eight hotels for aggregate cash proceeds of $83 million and are currently actively marketing or expect to bring to market in the near future a total of 16 non-core assets.
If our revenues are negatively affected by one or more particular risks, our operating margins could suffer.
Until January 1, 2001, we leased all but eight of our hotels to Interstate Hotels. Under each of those leases, Interstate Hotels was required to pay us a fixed base rent plus participating rent based on a percentage of revenues at the hotel. As a result of changes to the federal tax laws governing REITs, which became effective on January 1, 2001, Interstate Hotels assigned those leases to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and those subsidiaries have entered into management agreements with Interstate Hotels to manage our hotels. As a result of this new lease structure, we report operating revenues and expenses from the hotels rather than rental payments under the prior lease structure. Therefore, we have greater sensitivity to changes in operating revenues and are subject to the risk of fluctuating hotel operating margins at those hotels. Hotel operating expenses include, but are not limited to, wage and benefit costs, supplies, repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, insurance and other operating expenses. These operating expenses are more difficult to predict and control than percentage lease revenue, resulting in increased unpredictability in our operating margins. Also, due to the level of fixed costs required to operate full-service hotels, we generally cannot reduce significant expenditures necessary for the operation of hotels when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue.
Various factors could adversely affect our operating margins, which are subject to all of the operating risks inherent in the lodging industry. These risks include the following:
•
dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism, which have been affected by the events of September 11, 2001 and threats of further terrorism, or other outbreaks of hostilities, and may otherwise fluctuate and be seasonal;
•
changes in general and local economic conditions;
•
cyclical overbuilding in the lodging industry;
•
varying levels of demand for rooms and related services;
•
competition from other hotels, motels and recreational properties, some of which may be owned or operated by companies having greater marketing and financial resources than we do;
•
decreases in air travel;
•
fluctuations in operating costs;
•
the recurring costs of necessary renovations, refurbishments and improvements of hotel properties;
•
changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages, prices and construction and maintenance costs; and
•
changes in interest rates and the availability of credit.
In addition, demographic, geographic or other changes in one or more of the markets of our hotels could impact the convenience or desirability of the sites of some hotels, which would in turn affect their operations.
Recent events have adversely affected the insurance market.
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have had a dramatic effect on the insurance and reinsurance industries. Companies in all industry segments are experiencing increases in premiums and reductions in coverage upon renewal of their insurance policies. Some entities have experienced an inability to obtain insurance. If we are unable to maintain insurance that meets our debt covenant and franchise agreement requirements, and if we are unable to amend or waive those requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business. Our total annual property and casualty insurance premiums are approximately $31 million under our renewed policies.
We have significant operational relationships with Interstate Hotels, and Interstate Hotels’ operating or financial difficulties could adversely affect our hotels’ operations or our financial position.
Interstate Hotels manages all of our hotels (107 hotels as of December 31, 2002). As a result, we depend heavily on Interstate Hotels’ ability to provide efficient, effective management services to our hotels. Although we monitor the performance of our properties on an ongoing basis, Interstate Hotels is responsible for the day-to-day management of our properties. According to Interstate Hotels’ public statements, Interstate Hotels has incurred, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the merger that formed Interstate Hotels, net losses of $9.7 million and $20.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. If Interstate Hotels were unable to continue in business as a hotel operator, we would have to find a new manager for our hotels. This transition could significantly disrupt the operations of our hotels and lead to lower operating results from our properties.
Interstate Hotels is the general partner in MeriStar Investment Partners, LP (“MIP”), a joint venture established to acquire upscale, full-service hotels. We have a 16% preferred partnership interest in MIP, (equal to an initial investment of $40 million). We also have a receivable for approximately $10.8 million in cumulative preferred returns outstanding as of December 31, 2002. If Interstate Hotels is unable to continue as the general partner of MIP, a liquidation of MIP may occur. This liquidation could result in an impairment of our investment and cumulative preferred return receivable.
We invest in a single industry.
Our current strategy is to acquire interests only in hospitality and lodging. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in investing in a single industry. The effects on cash available for distribution resulting from a downturn in the hotel industry may be more pronounced than if we had diversified our investments.
We have a high concentration of hotels in the upscale, full-service segment, which may increase our susceptibility to an economic downturn.
As of December 31, 2002, 85% of our hotels were in the upscale, full-service segment. This hotel segment generally demands higher room rates. In an economic downturn, hotels in this segment may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues, as compared to hotels in other segments that have lower room rates. This characteristic results from hotels in this segment generally targeting business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties or political instability, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting trips or seeking to reduce costs on their trips. This characteristic has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
The lodging business is seasonal.
Generally, hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. This may not be true, however, for hotels in major tourist destinations. Revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year. Seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels will cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, economic and political factors and other considerations affecting travel, may also adversely affect our earnings.
We may be adversely affected by the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements.
As of December 31, 2002, approximately 89% of our hotels were operated pursuant to existing franchise or licensing agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands. The franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for, and restrictions and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor system. Those limitations may conflict with our philosophy, shared with Interstate Hotels, of creating specific business plans tailored to each hotel and to each market. Standards are often subject to change over time, in some cases at the discretion of the franchisor, and may restrict a franchisee’s ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor. In addition, compliance with standards could require a franchisee to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures. Action or inaction on our part or by our third-party operator could result in a breach of standards or other terms and conditions of the franchise agreements, and could result in the loss or cancellation of a franchise license. Although we have from time to time received default notices from franchisors due to service or physical plant deficiencies, none of our franchise agreements have been terminated for such deficiencies, and we believe that we can avoid future terminations by cooperating with our franchisors. Loss of franchise licenses without replacement would likely have an adverse effect on our hotel revenues.
In connection with terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a currently-owned hotel or a subsequently-acquired hotel, we may be required to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures. Moreover, the loss of a franchise license could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise due to the loss of associated name recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor. The franchise agreements covering the hotels expire or terminate, without specified renewal rights, at various times and have differing remaining terms. As a condition to renewal, the franchise agreements frequently contemplate a renewal application process, which may require substantial capital improvements to be made to the hotel. Unexpected capital expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness.
The lodging industry is highly competitive.
We have no single competitor or small number of competitors that are considered to be dominant in the industry. We operate in areas that contain numerous competitors, some of which may have substantially greater resources than us. Competition in the lodging industry is based generally on location, availability, room rates, or accommodations, price, range and quality of services and guest amenities offered. New or existing competitors could significantly lower rates, offer greater conveniences, services or amenities; or significantly expand, improve or introduce new facilities in markets in which we compete. All of these factors could adversely affect our operations and the number of suitable business opportunities.
We rely on the knowledge and experience of some key personnel, and the loss of these personnel may have a material adverse effect on our operations.
We place substantial reliance on the lodging industry knowledge and experience and the continued services of our senior management, led by Paul W. Whetsell. While we believe that, if necessary, we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, Mr. Whetsell is currently engaged, and in the future will continue to engage, in the management of Interstate Hotels. Mr. Whetsell may experience conflicts of interest in allocating management time, services and functions between Interstate Hotels and us.
We have lost some of our key personnel to Interstate Hotels.
Historically, many of our senior executives have held similar positions at our company and at Interstate Hotels. Several of these senior executives, including our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, and General Counsel, have left our company and work exclusively for Interstate Hotels. As a result, several members of our senior management are new or have changed positions. Our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel are new to our company, and our Chief Operating Officer has been
recently promoted. Our success will depend in part on the successful assimilation and performance of these individuals. If we are unable to manage this transition, our results of operations could be negatively affected.
Costs of compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our operating results.
See “Governmental Regulation - Environmental Laws” for a further discussion of risks related to environmental compliance.
Aspects of our operations are subject to government regulation, and changes in that regulation may have significant effects on our business.
A number of states regulate the licensing of hotels and restaurants, including liquor license grants, by requiring registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. Interstate Hotels believes our hotels are substantially in compliance with these requirements or, in the case of liquor licenses that they have or will promptly obtain the appropriate licenses. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our hotels and could otherwise adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Although significant amounts have been and continue to be invested in ADA required upgrades to our hotels, a determination that our hotels are not in compliance with the ADA could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
Corporate Structure Risks
We have overlapping directors and an overlapping senior executive officer with Interstate Hotels.
We share three directors, among our ten directors, with Interstate Hotels. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul W. Whetsell, is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Interstate Hotels. Our relationship with Interstate Hotels is governed by an intercompany agreement and by management agreements for each managed hotel. The intercompany agreement restricts each party from taking advantage of certain business opportunities without first presenting those opportunities to the other party. We may have conflicting views with Interstate Hotels on operation and management of our hotels and with respect to lease arrangements, acquisitions and dispositions. Inherent potential conflicts of interest will be present in all of the numerous transactions among Interstate Hotels and us.
We have restrictions on our business and on our future opportunities that could affect our business.
The intercompany agreement with Interstate Hotels generally grants Interstate Hotels the right of first refusal with respect to any management opportunity at any of our properties we do not elect to have managed by a hotel brand owner. We must make such an opportunity available to Interstate Hotels only if we determine that:
•
We are not required to enter into a management agreement with an unaffiliated third party with respect to the property in order to maintain MeriStar Hospitality’s status as a REIT;
•
Interstate Hotels is qualified to be the manager of that property;
•
We decide not to have the property operated by the owner of a hospitality trade name under that trade name;
•
The property is unencumbered by a management agreement, or if a management agreement exists, it can be freely terminated or terminated by the payment of a fee, which Interstate Hotels agrees to pay; and
•
The property is not subject to a leasehold estate held by an unaffiliated third party.
Because of the provisions of the intercompany agreement, we and MeriStar Hospitality are restricted in the nature of our business and the opportunities we may pursue.
We may have conflicts relating to the sale of hotels subject to management agreements.
Our management agreements with Interstate Hotels may require us to pay a termination fee to Interstate Hotels if we elect to sell a hotel or if we elect not to restore a hotel after a casualty. We must pay this fee if we do not replace the hotel with another hotel subject to a management agreement with a fair market value equal to the fair market value of Interstate Hotels’ remaining management fee due under the management agreement to be terminated. Where applicable, the termination fee is equal to the present value of the remaining payments (discounted using a 10% rate) of the existing term under the agreement, based on the operating results of the hotel for the 12 months preceding termination. Our decision to sell a hotel may, therefore, have significantly different consequences for Interstate Hotels and us. The requirement to pay a termination fee may make a disposition transaction less desirable economically.
We lack control over management and operations of our hotels.
We depend on the ability of Interstate Hotels to operate and manage our hotels. In order for MeriStar Hospitality to maintain its REIT status, we cannot operate our hotels. As a result, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions for the operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage operations and similar matters.
Our relationship with Interstate Hotels could limit our acquisition opportunities in the future.
Our relationship with Interstate Hotels could negatively impact our ability to acquire additional hotels because hotel management companies, franchisees and others who would have approached us with acquisition opportunities in hopes of establishing lessee or management relationships may not do so believing that we may rely primarily on Interstate Hotels to manage the acquired properties, or that Interstate Hotels might have a right of first refusal to manage some or all of the acquired properties under the terms of the intercompany agreement. These persons may instead provide acquisition opportunities to companies free to choose their managers or to hotel management companies who choose to own and manage the properties following the sale. This could limit our acquisition opportunities in the future.
There are potential conflicts of interest relating to our relationship with Interstate Hotels.
The terms of the intercompany agreement and our management agreements with Interstate Hotels were not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis. Because MeriStar Hospitality and Interstate Hotels share Paul Whetsell, who is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of both companies, and two other board members, there is a potential conflict of interest with respect to the enforcement and termination of these agreements to our benefit and to the detriment of Interstate Hotels, or to the benefit of Interstate Hotels and to our detriment. Furthermore, because of the independent trading of MeriStar Hospitality and Interstate Hotels, stockholders in MeriStar Hospitality or Interstate Hotels may develop divergent interests which could lead to conflicts of interest. The divergence of interests could also reduce the anticipated benefits of our agreements with Interstate Hotels.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks
Requirements imposed on us relating to MeriStar Hospitality’s REIT status could cause us to operate in a manner that might be disadvantageous to noteholders.
We have operated and intend to continue to operate in a manner designed to permit MeriStar Hospitality to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, MeriStar Hospitality will normally be required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by
excluding net capital gain. MeriStar Hospitality will be subject to income tax on undistributed real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain, and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions it pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of:
•
85% of its ordinary income for the calendar year;
•
95% of its capital gain net income for that year unless it elects to retain and pay income tax on those gains; and

100% of its undistributed income from prior years.
MeriStar Hospitality intends to make distributions to its stockholders to comply with the 90% distribution requirements described above and generally to avoid federal income taxes and the nondeductible 4% excise tax. Its income will consist primarily of its share of our income and its cash flow will consist primarily of its share of distributions made by us. In addition, these provisions of our partnership agreement could in the future cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on future acquisitions, unanticipated capital expenditures or debt, which would require us to borrow funds or sell assets to fund the cost of these items.
Our partnership agreement provides that unless such action or inaction has been specifically consented to by MeriStar Hospitality in writing, we will not take, or refrain from taking, any action which, in the judgment of MeriStar Hospitality, as our general partner:
•
could adversely affect the ability of MeriStar Hospitality to continue to qualify as a REIT, unless MeriStar Hospitality otherwise ceases to qualify as a REIT, or
•
could subject MeriStar Hospitality to additional income or excise taxes applicable to REITs under the Internal Revenue Code.
Our partnership agreement also provides that MeriStar Hospitality, as our general partner, shall use its best efforts to cause us to make sufficient distributions to enable MeriStar Hospitality to meet the distribution requirements described above and to avoid any federal income or excise tax liability, except to the extent that such distributions would contravene the terms of any notes or other debt obligations to which we are subject in conjunction with borrowed funds. Finally, our partnership agreement generally requires us to make pro rata distributions to all holders of Common OP units, not just distributions to MeriStar Hospitality. Thus, whenever distributions are made to MeriStar Hospitality in order to satisfy the foregoing requirements, equivalent distributions must be made to other partners holding Common OP units.
It is possible, however, that differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or the taxable income of MeriStar Hospitality and the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments could in the future require us to borrow funds on a short- or long-term basis to enable MeriStar Hospitality to continue to qualify as a REIT and avoid federal income taxes and the 4% nondeductible excise tax. In these circumstances, we might need to borrow funds in order to avoid adverse tax consequences even if we believe that the then prevailing market conditions generally are not favorable for those borrowings or that those borrowings are not advisable in the absence of these tax considerations.
MeriStar Hospitality, as our general partner, will determine our distributions. The amount of these distributions is dependent on a number of factors including:
•
the amount of cash available for distribution;
•
our financial condition;
•
our decision to reinvest funds rather than to distribute the funds;
•
restrictions in our debt agreements;
•
our capital expenditure requirements;
•
the annual distribution requirements under the real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; and
•
other factors as MeriStar Hospitality deems relevant.
Although we intend to continue to make distributions so that MeriStar Hospitality satisfies the annual distribution requirement to avoid corporate income taxation on the earnings that it in turn distributes, we may not be able to do so.
If we were subject to federal income taxation as a corporation, our ability to make payments on our borrowings or distributions to holders of interest in us could be substantially reduced.
We currently are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Although we are organized and operated with a view to maintaining that status, if the Internal Revenue Service were successfully to determine that we should be treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation rather than as a partnership, we would be required to pay federal income tax at corporate tax rates on our taxable income. As described above, we generally expect to make distributions to our partners each year at least equal to the amount of our taxable income so that MeriStar Hospitality can make distributions to its stockholders sufficient to avoid federal income and excise taxes. To the extent we had made such distributions to our partners, we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate assets to pay the applicable corporate income tax. In addition to the direct impact on us, our treatment as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would also cause MeriStar Hospitality to cease to qualify as a REIT under the Code, which would have the possible results described below.
If MeriStar Hospitality fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to federal income tax at corporate rates which could adversely affect our operations and MeriStar Hospitality’s ability to satisfy its obligations as a guarantor of our borrowings.
Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. In addition, there are presently only very limited judicial and administrative interpretations of the federal tax legislation enacted in 1999 with respect to taxable REIT subsidiaries. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our or MeriStar Hospitality’s control may affect MeriStar Hospitality’s ability to continue to qualify as a REIT. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that holds its assets through a partnership, such as MeriStar Hospitality does. Moreover, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions might change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification.
If MeriStar Hospitality fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and it will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at the applicable corporate rate. In addition, unless it was entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. This disqualification might reduce the funds available to MeriStar Hospitality to satisfy any obligations it might have as a guarantor of our borrowings because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved. In addition, to the extent that distributions to its stockholders would have been made in anticipation of its qualifying as a REIT, MeriStar Hospitality might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate assets to pay the applicable corporate income tax, including assets held by us.
