Regardless of a well's oil or gas designation, it may produce oil, gas, or both oil and gas. (2) As used in this Annual Report, "gross well" refers to a well in which a working interest is owned; accordingly, the number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. (3) As used in this Annual Report, "net well" refers to the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells. For example, a 15% working interest in a well represents one gross well, but 0.15 net well.

Proved Reserves and Net Present Value
The following table sets forth each Partnership's estimated proved oil and gas reserves and net present value therefrom as of December 31, 2006. The schedule of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves was prepared by the General Partner in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). When preparing such reserves, the General Partner follows the SEC's definition regarding oil and gas reserves, which was first published in 1978. The General Partner books proved oil and gas reserves which geological and engineering data show with reasonable certainty to be recovered in the future from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Probable reserves are not booked.
The General Partner combines many methods of reserve estimation in order to obtain the most accurate forecast, including both volumetric and analogy methods. Many levels of review occur during this process. First, the engineers review their respective wells, then the operations manager and division vice presidents review the updated forecasts, and finally the executive vice president of engineering reviews approximately the top 85% (or more) wells by value. All engineers reviewing the data have completed their engineering degrees and/or are licensed petroleum engineers. In addition, reserve information for the top 80% of each Partnership's reserve base (based on volumes) has been reviewed by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), an independent petroleum engineering firm. Ryder Scott has stated to the General Partner their opinion that (i) the estimates of reserves for the properties which they reviewed were prepared in accordance with generally accepted procedures for the estimation of reserves, (ii) they found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data, and (iii) the cash flow projections provided by Samson of gross and net reserves and associated revenues and costs based on constant pricing in general appear reasonable.
Net present value represents estimated future gross cash flow from the production and sale of proved reserves, net of estimated oil and gas production costs (including production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and operating expenses) and estimated future development costs, discounted at 10% per annum. Net present value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves was calculated on the basis of current costs and prices at December 31, 2006. Such prices were not escalated except in certain circumstances where escalations were fixed and readily determinable in accordance with applicable contract provisions. While oil prices remained relatively constant as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 ($60.85 and $61.06 per barrel, respectively), gas prices were substantially lower as of December 31, 2006 ($5.64 per Mcf) than December 31, 2005 ($10.08 per Mcf). This decrease in gas prices caused the estimates of remaining economically recoverable reserves, as well as the values placed on said reserves, at December 31, 2006 to be lower than such estimates and values at December 31, 2005. The prices used in calculating the net present
value attributable to the Partnerships' proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and gas production subsequent to December 31, 2006. In fact, subsequent to December 31, 2006 gas prices increased significantly and then declined. There can be no assurance that the prices used in calculating the net present value of the Partnerships' proved reserves at December 31, 2006 will actually be realized for such production.
The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of, among other things, additional development activity, production history, and viability of production under varying economic conditions; consequently, it is reasonably possible that material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the near future. Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that these reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessment possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.
The reserves table below reflects reserves as either discontinued operations or continuing operations. The discontinued operations reserves consist of all the properties classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2006. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more information about these discontinued operations.

- ------------ (1) Includes certain gas balancing adjustments which cause the gas volumes and net present values to differ from the reserve reports which were prepared by the General Partner and reviewed by Ryder Scott.
No estimates of the proved reserves of the Partnerships comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. Additional information relating to the Partnerships' proved reserves is contained in Note 4 to the Partnerships' financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Significant Properties
The following table sets forth the number and percent of each Partnership's total wells which are operated by affiliates of the Partnerships as of December 31, 2006:
Operated Wells ----------------------------------------- Partnership Number Percent ----------- ------ -------
III-A 21 7% III-B 3 1% III-C 140 21% III-D 135 27% III-E 44 13% III-F 26 6%
The following tables set forth certain well and reserve information as of December 31, 2006 for each oil and gas basin which holds a significant portion of the value of the Partnerships' properties. The tables contain the following information for each such basin: (i) the number of gross wells and net wells, (ii) the number of wells in which only a non-working interest is owned, (iii) the Partnership's total number of wells, (iv) the number of wells operated by the Partnership's affiliates, (v) estimated proved oil reserves, (vi) estimated proved gas reserves, and (vii) the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future net cash flow.
The Anadarko Basin is located in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. The Gulf Coast Basin is located in southern Louisiana and southeast Texas. The Las Animas Arch Basin straddles east Colorado and northwest Kansas. The Southern Oklahoma Folded Belt Basin is located in southern Oklahoma, while the Green River Basin is located in southern Wyoming and northwest Colorado. The Permian Basin straddles west Texas and southeast New Mexico, while the East Texas Basin is located in east Texas and northern Louisiana.
Title to Oil and Gas Properties
Management believes that the Partnerships have satisfactory title to their oil and gas properties. Record title to all of the Partnerships' properties is held by either the Partnerships or Geodyne Nominee Corporation, an affiliate of the General Partner.
Title to the Partnerships' properties is subject to customary royalty, overriding royalty, carried, working, and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, and to other encumbrances. Management believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the Partnerships' interest therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the Partnerships' business.
