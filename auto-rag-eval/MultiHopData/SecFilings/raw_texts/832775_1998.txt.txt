Risks of Ownership
The possibility exists that the tenants of the Partnership's properties may be unable to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the terms of their leases, including making base rent or percentage rent payments to the Partnership. Such a default by the tenants or a premature termination of any one of the leases could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Partnership. The Partnership may be unable to successfully locate a substitute tenant for the Albion, Michigan property due to the fact that the building had been designed or built primarily to house a specific operation. Thus, the Albion, Michigan property and other Partnership properties may not be readily marketable to a new tenant without substantial capital improvements or remodeling. Such improvements may require expenditure of Partnership funds otherwise available for distribution. In addition, because in excess of 45% of the Partnership's cash available for investment has been invested in properties operated as Ponderosa family restaurants, the Partnership is subject to some risk of loss should adverse events affect Ponderosa and in turn adversely affect the Ponderosa lessees' ability to pay rent to the Partnership.
