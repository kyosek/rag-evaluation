Properties
General Background
Since our inception in late August 2000, we have begun to build a solid asset base and achieved steady growth, primarily through property acquisitions, but with some exploitation activities. From our inception through December 31, 2006, our proved reserves have grown to 43,134,974 Boe, at an average acquisition/drilling cost of $3.75 per Boe. Many properties contain both oil and gas reserves. In those cases, the oil and gas reserves and the volume of oil and gas produced are converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of their approximate relative energy content. The common unit which we use is “Barrels of oil equivalent” or “Boe.” Acquisition and drilling costs “per Boe” is calculated by dividing the net capitalized costs ($161,638,633), computed in accordance with applicable accounting standards, as shown under “Capitalized Costs Relating to Oil and Gas Producing Activities” under Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities, by our reserves in Boe (43,134,974).
As of December 31, 2006, our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax PV10 value of approximately $848 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows of approximately $545 million, approximately 25% of which came from properties located in New Mexico, approximately 64% from our properties in Texas, approximately 8% from our properties in Oklahoma and approximately 3% from our properties in Kansas. We spent approximately $162 million on capital projects during 2004, 2005 and 2006. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling. Our capital budget for 2007 is approximately $95 million for development of existing properties. Although our focus will be on development of our existing properties, we also intend to continue seeking acquisition opportunities which compliment our current portfolio. We intend to fund our development activity primarily through use of cash flow from operations and cash on hand, while potential drawings on our credit facility and proceeds from future equity transactions would also be available for development projects or future acquisitions. We believe that our acquisition expertise, together with our operating experience and efficient cost structure, provides us with the potential to continue our growth.
The following table summarizes our total net proved reserves, pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows as of December 31, 2006.
Proved Reserves
Our 43,134,974 Boe of proved reserves, which consist of approximately 84% oil and 16% natural gas, are summarized below as of December 31, 2006, on a net pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows basis. Our reserve estimates have not been filed with any Federal authority or agency (other than the SEC).
As of December 31, 2006, New Mexico proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $215.4 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $138.4 million, our proved reserves in Texas had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $550.5 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $354.2 million, our proved reserves in Oklahoma had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $71.1 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $45.3 million and our proved reserves in Kansas had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $10.7 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $7.6 million.
As of December 31, 2006, approximately 28% of the 43.1 million Boe of proved reserves have been classified as proved developed producing, or “PDP”. Proved developed non-producing, or “PDNP” reserves constitute approximately 5%, proved developed behind-pipe “PDBP” reserves constitute approximately 5% and proved undeveloped, or “PUD”, reserves constitute approximately 62%, of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2006.
Approximately thirty-nine percent (39%) of our reserves for the year ended December 31, 2006 are associated with secondary recovery projects that are either in the initial stage of implementation or are scheduled for implementation. We anticipate that secondary recovery will be attempted by the use of waterflood of these reserves, and the exact project initiation dates and, by the very nature of waterflood operations, the exact completion dates of such projects, are uncertain.
Total proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value as of December 31, 2006 of approximately $848 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $545 million, 28.2% or $212.0 million and $136.6, respectively, of which is associated with the PDP reserves. An additional $57.2 million and $37.0 million, respectively, is associated with the PDNP reserves and $25.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, is associated with PDBP reserves ($294.4 million and $189.8 million, respectively, for total proved developed reserves, or 38.3% of total proved reserves’ pre-tax PV10 value). The remaining $553.2 million and $355.7 million, respectively, is associated with PUD reserves.

Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Significant New Mexico Operations
East Hobbs Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. In May 2004 we acquired an 82.24% working interest and a 67.6% net revenue interest in this lease. “Net revenue interest” is the owner’s percentage share of the monthly income realized from the sale of a well’s produced oil and gas. The net revenue interest is a lesser number as compared to the working interest, due to the mineral owner royalty and other overriding royalties on the well. This lease covers approximately 920 acres. There are currently 34 producing wells. We believe this property can support two additional wells, which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease is held by production.
Seven Rivers Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. We acquired a 70.6% working interest and a 56.48% net revenue interest in this property in May 2003. The remaining working interest is owned by unaffiliated parties. There are currently 51 producing wells on this lease. This lease consists of approximately 2,240 acres and is held by production.
North Benson Queen Unit - Eddy County, New Mexico. In October 2003 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 78.15% net revenue interest in this lease, which currently has 21 producing wells. The lease covers approximately 1,800 acres, and we believe this property can support a number of additional wells, 23 of which are included in our estimate of PUD. This lease is held by production.
The North Benson Queen Unit Waterflood expansion project is in progress. A water line of approximately four miles in length has been constructed along with the associated water storage and transfer equipment. Water injection and pumping equipment have been constructed and water injection will begin into seven wells on the west side of the property in April, 2007. Oil treating and storage facilities are being upgraded and will be completed in the third quarter of 2007. The costs for the expansion and development of the North Benson Queen Unit are estimated to be $4,450,000 in 2007. The North Benson Queen Unit waterflood expansion project will be completed in 2008 with the drilling of twenty-three (23) producing wells at an estimated cost of $9,200,000.
Significant Texas Operations
Fuhrman-Mascho leases - Andrews County, Texas. In December 2004 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 75% net revenue interest in these leases. These leases cover approximately 11,300 acres. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, 121 of which are included in our estimate of PUD. These leases are held by production.
Fuhrman-Mascho offset leases - Throughout 2005 and 2006, the Company has acquired working interests in additional leases and leased additional acreage in and around our Fuhrman-Mascho leases. The working interest percentages acquired range from 20% to 100% with net revenue interest ranging from 16% to 80%. These leases cover approximately 5,960 acres. We believe this property can support a number of additional wells, 90 of which are included in our estimate of PUD. These leases are held by production.
Y6 Lease - Fisher County, Texas. We acquired a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in this lease in June 2001. There are currently 12 producing wells on this lease. A portion of this property has been waterflooded, and when we begin our future development operations on this property, we plan to waterflood the remaining acreage. A waterflood operation is a method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil. The water from injection wells physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells. This potential waterflood project (and the estimated $2,700,000 cost thereof) is included as PUD in our reserve report. This lease consists of approximately 1,697 acres and is held by production.
Significant Oklahoma Operations
Ona Morrow Sand Unit - Cimarron and Texas Counties, Oklahoma. We own a 100% working interest and an 81.32% net revenue interest in this lease which has been producing since our acquisition in July 2002. This lease has approximately 2,120 acres and 12 producing wells. We believe this property can support three additional wells, which are included in our estimate of our PUD. This lease is held by production.
Eva South Morrow Sand Unit - Texas County, Oklahoma. We own a 100% working interest and an 85.41% net revenue interest in this lease which was also acquired in July 2002. The lease consists of approximately 489 acres and has eight producing wells. We believe this property can support two additional wells, which have been included in our estimate of our PUD. This lease is held by production.
Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz and Hanes Leases - Cimarron County, Oklahoma. We own 100% of the working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in these four leases acquired in September 2002. All have been producing leases since the date of our acquisition. The Midwell Appleby and Smaltz leases consist of approximately 1,640 acres with eight producing wells, and we believe there are up to six additional drilling locations on these leases. The Hanes lease contains approximately 640 acres and two producing wells. We believe this property can support four additional wells, which are included in our estimate of PUD. All of these leases are held by production.
Roy Hanes Lease - Texas County, Oklahoma. We own a 24.5% working interest and a 21.44% net revenue interest in this lease, which is a property operated by XTO Energy, Inc, an unaffiliated company, who also owns the remaining working interest. The interest in this lease was acquired at the same time we acquired our interests in the Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz and Hanes leases, and there has been production on this lease since that time. This lease consists of approximately 640 acres, and is currently held by production.
Significant Kansas Operations
Koehn/Rexford Unit - Haskell & Gray County, Kansas. This lease consists of approximately 640 acres. After entering into a farmout agreement with Bird Creek Resources, Inc., an unaffiliated company, we drilled and completed an initial gas well on this lease. Under the terms of this agreement, we agreed to drill one well and could drill additional wells on the property. In exchange for each well drilled, we will be assigned 100% of the working interest (80% of the net revenue interest) in the well and related oil and gas until payout of all costs of drilling, equipping and operating the well. After payout, our working interest in the wells and related oil and gas will decrease to 75% (60% of the net revenue interest).
Two wells have been drilled on this acreage and they have not yet reached payout. They are anticipated to reach payout during the second quarter 2007. After payout, Bird Creek Resources, Inc. will own the remaining 25% working interest.
Schmidt Unit - Gray County, Kansas. During 2004 and 2006 we leased 10,160 acres offsetting our Koehn/Rexford Unit. We have drilled a total of 10 wells on this acreage, seven of which have been successful and have been put into production. This lease is held by production.
Syracuse Prospect - Hamilton County, Kansas. During 2005 and 2006 we leased 21,733 acres. These leases provide us a 100% working interest and an 81% net revenue interest. We have drilled a total of five wells on this acreage, two of which were successful and are in the completion phase.
Rocky Prospect - Comanche County, Kansas. During 2005 we leased 4,160 acres. These leases provide us a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest. We have drilled four wells on this acreage, one of which has been successful and has been put into production.
Acreage
The following table summarizes gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2006 by region (net acreage is our percentage ownership of gross acreage). Acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded.
Production History
The following table presents the historical information about our produced natural gas and oil volumes.
The average oil sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold, in Bbl. The average gas sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold, in Mcf. The total average sales price amounts are calculated by dividing total revenues by total volume sold, in Boe. The average production costs above are calculated by dividing production costs by total production in Boe.
Productive Wells
The following table presents our ownership at December 31, 2006, in productive oil and natural gas wells by region (a net well is our percentage ownership of a gross well).
Drilling Activity
During 2006 we completed the drilling of 124 wells. Eighty-seven wells were drilled on our Fuhrman Mascho properties in Andrews County, Texas. Nineteen wells were drilled in Lea County, New Mexico, with fourteen on our Seven Rivers Queen property and five of them on our East Hobbs property. Twelve wells were drilled in Kansas, four in Gray County, Kansas, offsetting our existing wells there and nine in Hamilton and Greeley County, Kansas on acreage acquired during 2005; the eight wells in Hamilton and Greeley Counties were exploratory wells. Three wells were drilled in Texas County, Oklahoma, with one well on our Eva South property and two wells on our Ona Morrow property. Three wells were drilled on our Midwell and Hanes properties in Cimarron County, Oklahoma.
Cost Information
We conduct our oil and natural gas activities entirely in the United States. As noted previously in the table appearing under “Production History”, our average production costs, per Boe, were $8.85 in 2004, $7.54 in 2005 and $6.06 in 2006. These amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs by our total volume sold, in Boe.
Costs incurred for property acquisition, exploration and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are shown below.
(1) The amount shown for 2005 for acquisition of unproved properties is net of proceeds received for partial working interests sold in wells drilled in Kansas.
Reserve Quantity Information
Our estimates of proved reserves and related valuations were based on reports prepared by Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc., independent petroleum and geological engineers, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities.” The estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors.
Our oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States. A summary of the changes in quantities of proved (developed and undeveloped) oil and natural gas reserves is shown below.
Our proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the standardized measure as described below were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69. Future cash inflows were computed by applying year-end prices to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in producing and developing the proved oil and natural gas reserves at year end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of properties involved. Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences, tax credits and loss carryforwards relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10 percent annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value or the present value of our oil and natural gas properties.
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
The changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Management’s Business Strategy Related to Properties
Our goal is to increase stockholder value by investing in oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on capital employed. We plan to achieve this goal by exploiting and developing our existing oil and natural gas properties and pursuing acquisitions of additional properties. Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following:
Developing and Exploiting Existing Properties. We believe that there is significant value to be created by drilling the identified undeveloped opportunities on our properties. We own interests in a total of 44,456 gross (33,720 net) developed acres and operate essentially all of the net pre-tax PV10 value of our proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we owned interests in approximately 15,787 gross undeveloped acres (12,746 net). We believe that our current and future cash flow will enable us to undertake the exploitation of our properties through additional drilling activities. Our expected capital budget for development of existing properties in 2007 is approximately $95 million.
Pursuing Profitable Acquisitions. We have historically pursued acquisitions of properties that we believe to have exploitation and development potential comparable to our existing inventory of drilling locations. We have developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing core properties. We have an experienced team of management and engineering professionals who identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. While our emphasis in 2007 and beyond is anticipated to focus on the further development of our existing properties, we will continue to look for properties with both existing cash flow from production and future development potential.
Controlling Costs through Efficient Operation of Existing Properties. We operate essentially 100% of the pre-tax PV10 value of our total proved reserves, which we believe enables us to better manage expenses, capital allocation and the decision-making processes related to our exploitation and exploration activities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our oil and gas production costs per Boe averaged $6.06 and general and administrative costs averaged $3.39 per Boe produced.
Other Properties and Commitments
We currently lease our principal executive offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At December 31, 2006, the lease was for approximately 3,224 square feet of office space, at an annual rental of $30,000. This lease expired December 31, 2006 and is continuing on a month to month basis at the same rate.
On March 1, 2007, we closed the acquisition of a two story office building, and an adjoining parcel of real estate, located on 6555 South Lewis Avenue in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This office building has approximately 16,000 square feet, and we intend to occupy approximately 12,000 square feet to house our executive offices. The remaining 4,000 square feet are currently under lease to an unrelated tenant. We anticipate moving into our new executive offices in June, 2007. These facilities are believed adequate for our current operations.
