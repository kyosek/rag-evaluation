ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
GENERAL BACKGROUND
From our inception, we have built our asset base primarily through property acquisitions that are geographically focused in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, which we have identified as the most attractive region in which to develop our business.
As of July 31, 2009, our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax PV10 (present value of future net revenues before income taxes discounted at 10%) of approximately $56.5 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $39.6 million. All of these reserves and values are currently contained in our Hanson Project, located in Eddy County, New Mexico.
The following table summarizes our total net proved reserves, pre-tax PV10 values, and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows as of July 31, 2009.
Proved Reserves
Our estimates of total proved reserves as of July 31, 2009 (“SEC Reserves”) are based on an independent, third-party reserve assessment and report prepared by Russell Hall & Associates of Midland, Texas, independent petroleum engineers, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities”. The estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploitation and development, price changes, and other factors.
Our 3,351,031 BOE of total proved SEC Reserves, which consist of approximately 91.9% oil and 8.1% natural gas, are summarized below as of July 31, 2009, on a pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow basis. Our reserve estimates have not been filed with any Federal authority or agency (other than the SEC).
As of July 31, 2009, all of our proved reserves are located in the State of New Mexico. Approximately 15.7% of the total proved reserves have been classified as proved developed producing, or “PDP”. Proved developed non-producing, or “PDNP” reserves make up approximately 4.8% of the total proved reserves. Proved undeveloped, or “PUD” reserves constitute approximately 79.5% of the total proved reserves as of July 31, 2009.
Our total proved SEC Reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value as of July 31, 2009 of approximately $56.5 million and a Standardized Measure of Future Net Cash Flows (the “Standardized Measure”) of approximately $39.6 __ million. PDP reserves represent a PV10 value of approximately $8.3 million, or 14.7% of the pre-tax PV10 value, and a Standardized Measure of $5.8 million. PDNP reserves represent an additional pre-tax PV10 value of $2.3 million, or 4.1%, and a Standardized Measure of $1.6 million. The remaining $45.9 million of pre-tax PV10, or 81.2%, and $32.1 million of Standardized Measure are associated with the PUD reserves. On October 28, 2009, we acquired a 40% working interest in certain oil and gas properties in Eddy County, New Mexico that we refer to as the Cave Pool Project. The SEC Reserves presented in this Annual Report do not include the Cave Pool Project as those properties were acquired after our fiscal year ended July 31, 2009.

These total proved SEC Reserves were evaluated using fixed prices of $65.12/Bbl and $3.628/MCF, the actual prices received as of July 31, 2009. The SEC Reserves compare favorably to Doral’s independent third-party proved reserves prepared in accordance with the standards set by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE Reserves) also by Russell Hall & Associates, independent petroleum engineers, as of July 1, 2009. Our SPE Reserves were evaluated using NYMEX oil and gas prices $50.00/Bbl & $3.75/MMBtu for 2009, $55.00/Bbl & $4.00/MMBtu for 2010, $60.00/Bbl & $4.50/MMBtu for 2011, and $65.00/Bbl & $5.00/MMBtu thereafter, respectively, with no further escalation. Doral’s total proved SPE Reserves as of July 1, 2009 (as reported in August 2009) were 4,064,441 Bbls oil and 2,473,586 MCF gas (4,476,705 BOE); with PDP SPE Reserves of 514,481 Bbls and 61,715 MCF (524,767 BOE - 11.7% of total proved); PDNP SPE Reserves of 139,052 Bbls and 135,075 MCF (161,564 BOE - 3.6% of total proved); and PUD SPE Reserves of 3,410,908 Bbls and 2,276,796 MCF (3,790,374 BOE - 84.7% of total proved).
Our SEC Reserves differ from our SPE Reserves mainly in the area of PUD reserves where only 81 of the 138 PUD locations contained in our SPE Reserves case were developed in the SEC Reserves due to the capital constraints imposed on future development drilling under the SEC guidelines.
SUMMARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES AND PROJECTS
Hanson Project - Eddy County, New Mexico
The Hanson Project, our first producing acquisition, was acquired in July 2008 from Hanson Energy, a small independent operator based in Artesia, New Mexico. The Hanson Project is comprised of 66 leases which cover a leasehold of approximately 7,868 acres, all of which is located on the northwestern end of the Permian Basin along the Artesia-Vacuum Trend, in eastern Eddy County, east of the city of Artesia, NM. Doral Energy Corp. is the Operator of all leases in the Hanson Project. At the time of the acquisition, the Hanson Project contained a total of 186 wells: 161 producing wells (143 oil wells & 18 gas wells), 12 shut-in wells, and 13 water injection wells. The Artesia-Vacuum Trend is generally viewed as consisting of thirteen reservoirs along the Upper San Andres and Grayburg Platform. While the Artesia-Vacuum Trend is a relatively mature play, recent development of lower permeability Grayburg sandstones in the Grayburg Jackson Pool reservoir has reversed the decline of
Page 14 of 44
production and is an active focus of current development. Our Hanson Project leases convey the shallow rights, generally extending from the surface to a depth of approximately 3,500 feet, generally down through the Grayburg and San Andres formations along with the Fren, Seven Rivers, Queen, Loco Hills, Premier, and other productive zones generally found within this stratigraphic column.
As of July 31, 2009, the Hanson Project contains total proved SEC Reserves of 3.078 million barrels of oil (“MMBO”) and 1.636 billion cubic feet of natural gas (“BCFG”), equal to 3.35 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”). Of these total proved reserves, 0.52 MMBOE are classified as proved developed producing (“PDP”) reserves, 0.16 MMBOE are classified as proved developed non-producing (“PDNP”) reserves, and 2.67 MMBOE are classified as proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. These SEC Reserves contain 81 PUD drilling locations on the Hanson Project leasehold, which represent 58.7% of the 138 PUD locations contained in our SPE Reserves evaluation, and 47.1% of the 172 undeveloped locations that we have identified on the Hanson Project leases and carry in our in-house reserves.
We currently own a 100% working interest (“WI”) and an average net revenue interest (“NRI”) of 74.70% in 55 of the 66 leases in the Hanson Project. We also own an average working interest of 84.40% and an average net revenue interest of 67.10% in the remaining 11 leases in the Hanson Project. For the Hanson Project overall, we own an average 97.5% WI and an average 73.5% NRI in the 66 leases when considered as a whole.
The Hanson Project properties were acquired from Hanson Energy in July 2008 for the following consideration:
(a)
$5,000,000 in cash;
(b)
5,600,000 post 2009 Reverse Split and 2009 Forward Split shares of our common stock; and
(c)
An overriding royalty interest of 2.5% of 8/8ths of the oil and gas produced from the Hanson Project properties.
To complete the acquisition of the Hanson Project properties, on July 29, 2008, Doral entered into a Senior First Lien Secured Credit Agreement (the “Macquarie Credit Agreement”) with Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”). Under the terms of the Macquarie Credit Agreement, Macquarie agreed to provide Doral with: (i) a maximum of $25,000,000 under a revolving loan (the “Revolving Loan”); and (ii) a maximum of $25,000,000 under a term loan (the “Term Loan”). The amounts owed by us under the Macquarie Credit Agreement were due on July 30, 2009, however, Macquarie has agreed to forbear from exercising any of its remedies under the Macquarie Credit Agreement until at least January 29, 2010. The details of the Macquarie Credit Agreement are set out under heading “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.” We are currently seeking to refinance the amounts owed by us under the Macquarie Credit Agreement.
In connection with entering into the Macquarie Credit Agreement, we granted to Macquarie Investment, LLC (“MAC”), a subsidiary of Macquarie, a net profits interest (the “MAC NPORRI”) over the Hanson Project properties. The MAC NPORRI entitles MAC to 35% of the net profits from the Hanson Project properties (proceeds less associated production and capital costs) beginning after all amounts due under the Macquarie Credit Agreement have been repaid. Once MAC has earned $5,000,000 under the MAC NPORRI, the MAC NPORRI net profits interest automatically reduces to 20%.
Over the past year, our improvement efforts in the Hanson Project have primarily involved:
(a)
the inspection and evaluation of existing Project wells, pumping units, and production facilities to ascertain and ensure operational efficiency;
(b)
testing of producing wells to ascertain accurate daily oil, gas and water production rates, and the testing of water injection rates to determine injectivity rates and pressures;
(c)
performing mechanical repair job workovers to restore non-productive wells to production;
(d)
performing repair and clean-out workovers, including well chemical treatments and acid stimulations to improve production rates; and
(e)
improving downhole pump designs and improving production facility equipment, piping, and flowlines to increase operational efficiencies.
During our July 31, 2009 fiscal year, we completed the Phase 0 Initial Well Repair Job Work Program, a first stage improvement work program which carried out mechanical repair jobs on 17 wells in the Hanson Project from November 2008 through January 2009. Post-job well tests on these 17 wells showed that the mechanical repair jobs restored 64.5 barrels of oil production per day (“BOPD”) to the Hanson Project’s daily production,
Page 15 of 44
which was 164% of the pre-job estimate of 39.3 BOPD. In repairing these 17 wells, we found that none of the downhole pumps were working, and more over, all of the pumps were of the wrong type (highly inefficient travelling-barrel design pumps), the wrong size (1-1/2” diameter instead of the proper 1-1/4” diameter pumps for these types of wells), and set at the wrong depth in the wells (above instead of below the perforations). Additionally, all of the wells exhibited very heavy paraffin in the tubing, in the casing, and in the pumps themselves. The 17 wells were restored to production with the proper 1-1/4” bottom-hold-down downhole pumps, installed proper the depth below the perforations, set to pump at the proper pumping speed pump strokes per minute, and optimizing pumping time intervals to efficiently pump the oil and water from the wells based on the amount of inflow from the formation. The repair jobs also carried out the cutting and removing paraffin from the tubing and wellbore, replacing bad rods and tubing where required, replacing and repairing wellheads, and repairing flowlines. The total gross expenditures for the work program were $278,931 which was 87.1% of the AFE estimates. Since the initial program was completed, we have carried out mechanical repair jobs on an additional 14 wells in the Hanson Project with similar results. We estimate that an additional 75 wells in the Hanson Project are currently in need of similar repairs to restore production to more optimum rates, representing a significant opportunity to further increase Hanson Project’s daily production.
In addition to increasing production through repair jobs and improvements on existing wells, it is our long-term goal to create additional value by implementing an infill development drilling program on the Hanson Project properties. Almost all of the current producing wells in the Hanson Project were drilled on 40-acre well spacing per well. Over the past 20-30 years, offset operators along the Artesia-Vacuum Trend have determined that shallow wells like those in the Hanson Project actually drain less than 20 acres in these shallow reservoirs like the Grayburg, San Andres, Premier, Fren, and others. These operators have successfully carried out infill drilling programs on 20-acre spacing with very good success, accessing and developing oil and gas reserves that would not have been produced otherwise by the original wells drilled on 40-acre spacing patterns. By carrying out an infill development drilling program to redevelop the Hanson Project leases on 20-acre well spacing, we anticipate that we will increase production from the Hanson Project properties. We have identified over 250 potential 20-acre infill drilling locations on the Eddy County Properties, and 172 of these locations have been classified as proved undeveloped locations in our in-house reserves. In completing the independent third-party SEC Reserve report for the Hanson Project as of July 31, 2009, Russell Hall & Associates included 81 (47.2%) of these 172 undrilled infill locations as PUD locations due to capital constraints imposed of PUD development capital under SEC reserve guidelines. An infill development drilling program for the Hanson Project is expected to take several years to complete.
In 2008, our engineers and geologists worked to develop the initial infill development drilling program for the Hanson Project properties (the “Phase 1 Development Program”). The proposed Phase 1 Development Program called for the drilling and completion of 21 infill development wells on 20-acre spacing at an estimated cost of approximately $9.6 million in order to develop gross reserves of approximately 1.98 MMBOE (million barrels of oil equivalent) in 2009. However, when we presented this very detailed Phase 1 Development Program to Macquarie Bank in November 2008 (as required under the terms of the Macquarie Credit Agreement), Macquarie informed us that the bank was not funding any new drilling programs at that time due to uncertainties arising from the precipitous drop in the price of oil over the last half of 2008 and a lack of available capital. As a result, our management and Macquarie agreed that we would withdraw the Phase 1 Development Program at that time and re-submit it in early 2010.
We anticipate that the Phase 1 Development Program or an infill 20-acre development drilling program with the same or similar wells and targets will move forward in the coming months, hopefully beginning in early 2010. In addition, drilling costs have decreased significantly in recent months, making the capital investment required smaller and thus making the drilling program more economic. Also, continuing work by our engineers and geologists has shown that a majority of the drilling in the Hanson Project can be achieved using air drilling instead of conventional fluid drilling which will reduce our drilling costs even further. In any event, the selection and timing of infill wells to be drilled under any infill development drilling program in the Hanson Project will be made based on: (i) continuing new geological interpretations and structure and net pay maps of the pay zones being prepared; (ii) updated development drilling well reserves based on both the cumulative production to-date and estimated ultimate recovery of offset wells from the target reservoirs; (iii) the presence of previously undeveloped and un-produced intervals in target pay zones present on the lease; (iv) volumetric reserve calculations where appropriate; (v) the status of lease production facilities and capacities; and (vi) access to gas sales markets for casinghead gas production. Readers are cautioned, however, that there is no assurance that the infill development plan will proceed when scheduled, as currently proposed, or at all.

Production History
The following table shows our net production volumes (net of royalties and amounts due to others), the average daily total net production rate, the average sales prices received, the average production costs (lifting costs) for oil and natural gas for the Hanson Project properties for the periods indicated.
During the fiscal year ending July 31, 2009, our gross production totalled 46,166 Bbls oil and 12,164 MCF gas (48,193 BOE), which resulted in Doral net production totals of 33,701 Bbls oil and 8,880 MCF gas (35,181 BOE). The average oil price receive during the year was $53.48/BO, and the average gas price received was $2.29/MCF, yielding an average total price of $52.02/BOE. Total lease operating expenses during the fiscal year of $2.046 million yielded an average production cost of $58.16/BOE for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2009. The average production tax rate paid during the fiscal year was $7.55/BOE.
The average sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold in barrels. The average gas sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold, in MCF. The total average sales price amounts are calculated by dividing total revenues by total volume sold, BOE. The average production costs above are calculated by dividing production costs by total production in BOE.

Page 17 of 44
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table summarizes the approximate gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage owned by Doral as of July 31, 2009. Net acreage is our working interest percentage ownership of gross acreage. Acreage in which our interest is limited to a royalty or overriding royalty interest only is excluded from this table.
(1)
Developed acreage consists of spacing unit acres spaced assignable to productive wells.
(2)
Undeveloped acreage is considered to be those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains underlying proved reserves.
(3)
Gross acres refers to the number of acres in which we own a working interest.
(4)
Net acres represents the number of acres attributable to our proportionate working interest ownership in the gross acreage.
Drilling Activities
The following table shows the number of gross and net productive and dry development wells and exploratory wells drilled by us during the last three fiscal years. We did not drill any development or exploratory wells during the fiscal year ending July 31, 2009, and have not drilled any development or exploratory wells over the past 3 fiscal years.
Present Activities
As of July 31, 2009, we were not in the process of drilling any development or exploratory wells or conducting completion operations on any development or exploratory well.
Page 18 of 44
We are currently in the process of carrying out recompletion operations on one previously suspended well, the Mustang 28 Federal #1 well, located on the Company’s Federal S lease of the Hanson Project, approximately 0.5 mile south of Loco Hills, NM. This well was originally drilled to 5,490’ as a Paddock test well by Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in October 2001 and had been suspended since Anadarko ceased Paddock testing in early 2002. The wellbore was acquired by Doral as part of the Hanson Project which included rights from the surface to a depth of 4,000’ on the Federal S lease. Doral is in the process of recompleting this well as a Grayburg-San Andres completion in the Grayburg Jackson Pool.
Delivery Commitments
As of July 31, 2009, the Company had no obligations or delivery commitments under any existing contracts.
Other Projects and Properties
Cave Pool Project - Eddy County, New Mexico
On October 28, 2009, Doral West Corp. (“Doral West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Doral Energy Corp., entered into an agreement (the “Blugrass Agreement”) with Blugrass Energy Inc. (“Blugrass”) to purchase a 40% working interest in certain oil and gas properties (the “Cave Pool Unit Properties”) located in and around the Cave Pool Unit in Eddy County, New Mexico approximately 5 miles northwest of Loco Hills, New Mexico. The effective date of the acquisition is October 12, 2009. The Cave Pool Unit Properties are comprised of the Cave Pool Unit and ten (10) leases that make up approximately 2,800 gross acres of leasehold, which Doral now designates as the Cave Pool Project. The Cave Pool Project currently produces approximately 10 BOEPD from a total of 39 wells completed in the Grayburg formation in the Grayburg Jackson Pool.
The Cave Pool Unit Properties are located adjacent to 3 leases that are a part of our Hanson Project, which contain 6 wells producing from the Grayburg and San Andres formations and 9 PUD locations in the Square Lake Field. As operator of the Cave Pool Project, we envision a re-development of the Cave Pool Unit Properties as a 20-acre 5-spot Grayburg waterflood project which has the potential to develop significant undeveloped reserves.
The Cave Pool Unit Properties were acquired by Blugrass from Robinhood LLC on October 12, 2009. Under the terms of the Blugrass Agreement, we have acquired a 40% interest is all of Blugrass’ right, title and interest in the Cave Pool Unit Properties, including the production on-hand and sales generated from the properties after the effective date of October 12, 2009. In consideration for this interest Doral has agreed to:
1.
Share with Blugrass access to appropriate Doral proprietary geological and engineering data and information to enhance the re-development of the Cave Pool Unit Properties;
2.
Pay for and cause the preparation of an independent third-party reserve report on the Cave Pool Unit Properties to be prepared;
3.
Pay for and obtain title opinions for the leases contained in the Cave Pool Project; and
4.
Be assigned as the Operator of the Cave Pool Project.
For their part, Blugrass has agreed to pay for the first $200,000 of well repairs and workovers on the Cave Pool Unit Properties, with Doral West and Blugrass proportionately sharing the cost of all repairs and workovers thereafter. An initial 10 Cave Pool Project wells have been identified for repair jobs and will be re-worked by Doral in the near future, adding to the daily production from the Project.
In addition, the Blugrass Agreement provides that, if Blugrass chooses to sell their remaining interest in the Cave Pool Unit Properties, Doral will have a preferential right to purchase that interest at the greater of:
(a)
$2,000,000; or
(b)
$40,000 per producing net barrel of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) from the Cave Pool Unit Properties.

Miltex Properties - Cochran County, Texas
On January 15, 2009, we entered into an agreement (the “Miltex Agreement”) with Miltex Oil Company (“Miltex”) for the acquisition of six (6) San Andres waterflood units located in Cochran County, Texas (the “Miltex Properties”). Pursuant to the terms of the Miltex Agreement and pursuant to amendment agreements dated February 23, 2009, March 31, 2009, and April 21, 2009, we paid to Miltex a total of $245,000 in cash and a total of 250,000 post 2009 Forward Split shares towards the purchase of the Miltex Properties.
On July 30, 2009, we assigned our right to purchase the Miltex Properties to Legacy Reserves LP in consideration for a total of $750,000 in cash, consisting of $600,000 for the assignment of our right to purchase the Miltex Properties, plus an additional $150,000 to reimburse us for amounts due to a third party for brokering the sale of the Miltex Properties.
Slape Oil Company, Inc. and Flaming S, Inc. - Cochran & Hockley Counties, Texas
On May 5, 2009 and May 15, 2009, respectively, we entered into agreements for the acquisition of Flaming S, Inc. (“Flaming S”) and Slape Oil Company, Inc. (“Slape Oil”). Flaming S and Slape Oil are oil and gas corporations with producing properties in Cochran and Hockley Counties, Texas. In July 2009, the agreements
Page 20 of 44
to acquire Flaming S and Slape Oil were cancelled. A total of 400,000 shares of Doral restricted common stock issued to the shareholders of Flaming S and Slape Oil as deposits were returned to the Company.
