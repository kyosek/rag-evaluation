Production and Development Properties
Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each region are presented in a table in the Operating Statistics section. In addition, Newmont holds investment interests in Canada, Colombia and various other locations.
North America
The North America region maintains its headquarters in Elko, Nevada and operates five sites, Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks, Long Canyon and Cripple Creek & Victor.
In Colorado and Nevada, various mining specific taxes are paid to state and local governments. These taxes are generally assessed on gross income from mining in Colorado at a rate of 2.25% or net proceeds from mining in Nevada at a rate of 5%.
Carlin, Nevada, USA. (100% owned) Carlin is located 25 miles west of Elko, Nevada off of Interstate 80 and can be accessed by paved highway. Newmont has been mining gold at Carlin since 1965 and either owns the private fee land and unpatented mining claims or controls the land through long-term mining leases associated with the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present operations. Properties held under long-term mining leases expire at varying dates over the next 40 years. With respect to a portion of the Gold Quarry pit, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. With respect to various other Carlin deposits, we pay third-party royalties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.
The Carlin complex consists of four open pits and four underground mines. The open pits include the Emigrant and the Gold Quarry pits in the South end of the Carlin Trend and the Silverstar and Goldstar pits in the North end of the Carlin Trend. The underground mines include Leeville, which is a shaft mine, along with Chukar, Pete Bajo and Exodus, which are portal mines. The majority of the underground ore as well as higher-grade surface refractory ores are processed through the roaster (Mill 6), which consists of a grinding circuit, roasting circuit and a conventional carbon-in leach circuit. Mill 6 processed approximately 3.6 million tons of ore in 2017. Higher-grade surface oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Mill 5. Additionally, Mill 5 operates as a flotation mill treating lower grade, non-carbonaceous, sulfidic refractory ore to produce a
gold/pyrite concentrate. Mill 5 processed approximately 4.9 million tons of ore in 2017. Lower-grade surface material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on one of four heap leach pads. Carlin is a sediment-hosted disseminated gold deposit with an available mining fleet consisting of six shovels and 55 haul trucks, which range from 150 to 250 tons.

South America
The South America region maintains its headquarters in Lima, Peru and operates two sites, Yanacocha and Merian.
Yanacocha, Peru. (54.05% owned) Yanacocha is owned by Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha” or “MYSRL”), which is 54.05% owned by Newmont. The remaining 45.95% interest in MYSRL is held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”). In December 2017, MYSRL repurchased 5% of its shares held by the International Finance Corporation, increasing Newmont’s ownership in Yanacocha from 51.35% to 54.05%. For further information about this transaction, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
MYSRL and S.M.R.L. Chaupiloma Dos de Cajamarca (“Chaupiloma”) (a related third party) have mining concessions granted by Peru’s Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute. Mining concessions grant MYSRL an exclusive and irrevocable right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities within a specified area. In order to maintain these concessions, MYSRL must (i) obtain the appropriate permits and rights over the surface lands, (ii) pay annual license fees and (iii) comply with a minimum annual production obligation. For mining concessions granted prior to 2008, concessions will expire if the production obligations are not met by the end of 2028. For mining concessions granted in 2008 or thereafter, concessions will expire if minimum production is not attained by the 20th year from the date of grant.
In Peru, a revised royalty and special mining tax was introduced in October 2011. This tax is dependent on whether or not a stabilization agreement is in effect and is based on a sliding scale, between 1% and 12%. A stabilization agreement is currently in effect through December 2018 for operations in the La Quinua Complex.
Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca and is primarily accessible by paved roads. The Yanacocha property began production in 1993 and consists of the following open pit mines: the La Quinua Complex, the Yanacocha Complex, the Carachugo Complex and Maqui Maqui. In addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads (La Quinua, Yanacocha, Carachugo and Maqui Maqui), three gold processing plants (Pampa Larga, Yanacocha Norte and La Quinua), one limestone processing facility (China Linda) and one mill (Yanacocha Gold Mill).
Yanacocha’s mining activities encompass 260,212 acres (105,304 hectares) that are covered by 182 mining concessions. MYSRL holds the mining rights related to 95,719 acres (38,736 hectares), covered by 71 concessions. Chaupiloma holds the mining rights to the remaining acres and concessions and has assigned these mining concessions to Yanacocha. Each concession has an initial term of 17 to 20 years, which are renewable at Yanacocha’s request for an additional 17 to 20 year term.
The La Quinua Complex is currently mining material from the La Quinua Sur and the Tapado Oeste Layback and is scheduled to finish mining operations in 2019.
The Yanacocha Complex mines material from the Yanacocha Layback and Yanacocha Pinos. The Yanacocha Complex is scheduled to finish mining operations in 2019. The Yanacocha Complex began operations in 1997 and has had limited mining operations in recent years.
The Carachugo Complex and Maqui Maqui mined material from multiple mines that are no longer in operation and only de minimis residual leaching of gold continues.
Yanacocha has three processing concessions from Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines for its processing facilities: Cerro Yanacocha (La Quinua and Yanacocha leach pads, La Quinua and Yanacocha Norte gold recovery plants and Yanacocha Gold Mill), Yanacocha (Carachugo and Maqui Maqui leach pads and Pampa Larga gold recovery plant) and China Linda. Yanacocha’s gold processing plants are located adjacent to the solution storage ponds and are used to process gold-bearing solutions from Yanacocha’s leach pads through a network of solution-pumping facilities. The Yanacocha Gold Mill processes high-grade gold ore to produce a gold-bearing solution for treatment at the La Quinua processing plant. The Yanacocha Gold Mill processes between 5.5 and 6.0 million tonnes per year.
Yanacocha is an epithermal type deposit of high sulfidation hosted in volcanic rock formations. Gold is associated with iron-oxides and pyrite. Material is evaluated for gold grade and cyanide solubility and then placed on leach pads or in stockpiles for processing through the Yanacocha Gold Mill accordingly. Studies are underway to evaluate the potential for mining sulfide gold and copper mineralization. Yanacocha’s available mining fleet consists of two shovels, four excavators, two loaders and 43 haul trucks, which range from 140 to 240 tonnes.
Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing, including the development of Quecher Main within the existing footprint of Yanacocha. This oxide deposit will extend the life of the Yanacocha operation to 2027, with an average of approximately 200,000 ounces between 2020 and 2025. Quecher Main received full funding approval from the Board of Directors in October 2017 and is expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Power is supplied to the operation by Engie Energia Peru SA.
Yanacocha’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $4,282. Yanacocha produced 535,000 ounces of gold (275,000 attributable ounces of gold) in 2017 and reported 2.1 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.
MYSRL also owns the Conga project, which is located approximately 16 miles (25 kilometers) northeast of Yanacocha and is currently in care and maintenance. Due to uncertainty surrounding the project and political risks related to the project’s development, the Company has allocated its exploration and development capital to other projects in recent years. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project, the Company may have to consider other alternatives for the project, which may result in a future impairment charge for the project. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, above for further information.
Merian, Suriname. (75% owned) The Merian gold mine (“Merian”) is owned 75% by Newmont Suriname, LLC (“Newmont Suriname”) (formerly known as Suriname Gold Company LLC and 100% indirectly owned by Newmont Mining corporation) and 25% by Staatsolie (a company wholly owned by the Republic of Suriname).
Merian is located in Suriname, approximately 40 miles (66 kilometers) south of the town of Moengo and 19 miles (30 kilometers) north of the Nassau Mountains, close to the French Guiana border. The site is accessible by paved road from Paramaribo to Moengo and a dirt road maintained mainly by the Company.
Newmont’s interest in the Merian mine was acquired through a Right of Exploitation as defined in a Mineral Agreement. The Right of Exploitation was registered in November 2014, spans a period of 25 years and covers an area of 41,484 acres (16,788 hectares). Newmont Suriname is subject to a 6% net smelter return royalty to the Republic of Suriname payable in gold bullion or cash distributions at the election of the government.
The operation currently includes the Merian 2 open pit and is scheduled to include a second pit (the Maraba pit). Construction for Merian 2 began in August 2014 and commercial production began in October 2016. The Maraba pit is scheduled to be added to the production stream during the first quarter of 2018. All of the gold mineralization at Merian is closely associated with quartz veining within siltstone and sandstone formations. Merian’s available mining fleet consists of six mining excavators and thirty-one 138-tonne haul trucks.
Merian includes processing facilities that utilize a conventional gold mill and processing plant, consisting of comminution plant, including gravity and cyanide leach processes, with recovery by carbon-in-leach, elution, electro-winning and induction furnace smelting to produce a gold doré product. It has a nameplate capacity of 12 million tonnes per year, reducing later to 10 million tonnes per year when the mill feed will be predominantly from fresh rock. Maintenance facilities, camp facilities with a capacity of 1,650 workers and various offices complete the site.
Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing.
Power for the property is self-generated using on-site heavy fuel oil driven generators.
Merian’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $974. Merian produced 513,000 ounces of gold (385,000 attributable ounces of gold) in 2017 and reported 4.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.
Australia
The Australia region maintains its headquarters in Perth, Australia and operates three sites, Boddington, Tanami and Kalgoorlie.
Aboriginal land rights in Australia, which recognize the traditional rights and customs of Aboriginal people, are governed by the Commonwealth Native Title Act and certain other Acts specific to individual states and territories. The Commonwealth Native Title Act was enacted in 1993 following a decision in the High Court of Australia, which held that Aboriginal people, who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditional laws and customs, may hold certain rights which should be
recognized under Australian common law. In the Northern Territory, where the Tanami operation is located, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (“ALRA”) was introduced in 1976, which established an Aboriginal Land rights regime. Under the ALRA, approximately 50% of the land in the Northern Territory is Aboriginal freehold land.
All of Newmont’s operations in Australia take place on land that falls under the custodianship of Aboriginal people. Newmont does not consider that native title claims or determined areas where rights have been established are an impediment to the operation of existing mines. Newmont has existing agreements with the traditional owners of the land utilized by our Tanami and Boddington operations. In Western Australia, a native title claim was registered in 2017 over an area of land utilized by our Kalgoorlie operations. Upon registration of the claim, any granted and existing mining tenements remain valid. However, the undertaking of future heritage surveys will be required to take place with the assistance of the claimants. A determination of native title is likely to take many years and, if successful, could give rights to a native title compensation claim in the future. Throughout Australia, new exploratory and mining tenements may require native title agreements to be entered into and will be subject to a negotiation process, which often gives rise to compensation payments and heritage survey protocols.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Aboriginal groups have negotiated compensation/royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where native title rights are determined or where they own the land.
Boddington, Australia. (100% owned) Boddington is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia and is accessible primarily by paved road. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited.
The Boddington project area comprises 46,697 acres (18,898 hectares) of mining tenure leased from the State of Western Australia, of which 21,018 acres (8,506 hectares) is subleased from the South 32 Worsley Joint Venturers. Royalties are paid to the state government at 2.5% for gold and 5% for copper based on revenue. Shipping and treatment and refining costs are allowable deductions from revenue for royalty calculations for copper. There is an additional profit based royalty payable to AngloGold Ashanti. This royalty is capped at $100 (of which approximately $93 has been paid out). The remaining royalty of approximately $7 is payable quarterly and is equal to 50% of the amount by which the average margin for the quarter exceeds $600 per ounce (on a by-product basis) multiplied by 33.3% of gold ounces sold in that quarter. Newmont owns 74,474 acres (30,139 hectares) of rural freehold property, some of which overlaps existing mining tenure.
Boddington consists of greenstone diorite hosted mineralization and activities continue to develop the known reserve. The mine operates two pits (North & South Pits) utilizing three electric rope shovels as its prime ex-pit material movers with a fleet of 40 production haul trucks and a fleet of ancillary equipment as required. Boddington has a current capacity to mine approximately 235,000 tonnes of material per day. The milling plant includes a three-stage crushing facility (two primary crushers, six secondary crushers and four high-pressure grinding rolls), four ball mills, a flotation circuit and a carbon-in-leach circuit. The flotation circuit process recovers gold-copper concentrate before the material is then processed by a traditional carbon-in-leach circuit where the remaining gold is recovered to produce doré.
Mining operations consist of two open pit operations located adjacent to each other. The processing plant has a nominal capacity to process approximately 39 million tonnes of ore per year. Other major facilities include an emulsion plant, residue disposal area (tailings facility), maintenance workshops and a 2,300-room accommodation camp. Additionally, 31 residential properties are owned in Boddington as employee housing.
Power for the operation is sourced through the local power grid under a long-term power purchase agreement.
Boddington’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $4,083. Boddington produced 787,000 ounces of gold and 80 million pounds of copper in 2017. At December 31, 2017, Boddington reported 12.7 million ounces of gold reserves and 1,340 million pounds of copper reserves.
Tanami, Australia. (100% owned) Tanami is located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs. The underground mining infrastructure and operation is located at Dead Bullock Soak. The processing infrastructure is located 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the east of the mining operations at the Granites. Ore is transported by road train to the processing plant. Supply of materials for the operations is done primarily by road, while the workforce for Tanami utilizes a fly-in/fly-out program. Gold was first discovered and mined in the area around 1900. Mining Tenements were granted in 1983 and have continued to this date. Newmont acquired its ownership in the mine in 2002, as a result of the merger with Normandy Mining Limited (“Normandy”).
The Newmont Tanami Operations has an area of 843,420 acres (341,320 hectares) of exploration licenses and 11,017 acres (4,458 hectares) of mineral leases granted per the Northern Territory Mineral Titles Act. The operation has been granted authorization as per the Northern Territory Mining Management Act to undertake mining activities on these mineral leases. For the exploration licenses, Tanami is required to make an annual administration payment to the Central Land Council for each of the Deeds for Exploration, equivalent to 5% of the audited exploration costs incurred in the relevant year minus a minimum payment made in the first quarter of each year.
According to the Northern Territory Mineral Royalties Act, Newmont is obligated to pay a profit based royalty of 20% to the Northern Territory government. The operation is located on Aboriginal Freehold Land granted under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act which requires Newmont to hold a mining agreement with the traditional owners on which the operation is located. The Mining Agreement is managed by the Central Land Council as per the statutory requirements of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. This agreement also provides for compensation payments to the traditional owners.
Mining operations are predominantly focused on the Callie and Auron ore bodies in the underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak. Tanami consists of sediment hosted sheeted quartz vein mineralization. Exploration is ongoing with the main focus being underground ore definition drilling of the Auron ore body and drilling of the Federation ore body. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company declared first reserves for the Federation ore body.
Tanami, as an underground mining operation, has a fleet of eight underground loaders and 18 haul trucks, each with a 60 tonne payload. The processing plant was originally commissioned in 1986. The processing plant currently consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, gravity carbon in pulp tanks and a conventional tailings disposal facility. The Board of Directors approved full funding of the Tanami Expansion project in October 2015, which reached commercial production at the end of August 2017. The scope for this project included a ventilation upgrade, additional mining equipment, additional mine access and increased process plant capacity and recovery.
Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves in ongoing.
Power for the operations is exclusively sourced from diesel generators which are owned and operated by Pacific Energy Pty (KPS) Ltd. In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved the full funding of the Tanami Power project. Beginning in 2019, the Tanami Power project will lower power costs, mitigate fuel supply risk and reduce carbon emissions.
Tanami’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $1,357. Tanami produced 419,000 ounces of gold in 2017 and reported 4.4 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.
Kalgoorlie, Australia. (50% owned) Kalgoorlie is located 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia and is accessible primarily by paved road. Kalgoorlie is a joint venture with Barrick and Newmont is the operator. We report our interest in Kalgoorlie on a pro rata basis.
Kalgoorlie comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and the Mt Charlotte underground mine. The processing plant includes the Fimiston processing plant on site at the edge of the city of Kalgoorlie and the Gidji processing plant, located approximately 20 kilometers north of the Fimiston processing plant in the city of Boulder. The Fimiston processing plant is licensed to process approximately 13.4 million tonnes of ore per year. Gold was first discovered in the area in 1893. In 1989, Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mine Pty Ltd (“KCGM”) was formed to manage the assets and operations of the joint venture partners. Newmont acquired its ownership in the mine in 2002 as part of the merger with Normandy.
Kalgoorlie consists of greenstone dolerite hosted mineralization. The Kalgoorlie operation encompasses approximately 84,658 acres (34,261 hectares), comprising 63,434 acres (25,671 hectares) of mining leases and other general purpose leases, 14,940 acres (6,046 hectares) of exploration and prospecting licenses and 6,283 acres (2,543 hectares) of miscellaneous licenses held for easements and rights-of-way. The Kalgoorlie operation is obligated to pay a 2.5% royalty on production to the Western Australia state government. Mining and processing operations and facilities are located on properties held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next 21 years. All core mining leases contain options to renew.
The Fimiston plant processes ore from the Super Pit and underground ore from the Mt Charlotte mine. Both ores are processed via two milling circuits which consist of two semi-autogenous grinding (“SAG”) mills and associated ball mills which are capable of treating up to 40,000 tonnes per day. After crushing and milling, the ores are processed via gravity and undergo bulk sulfide flotation to produce a gold-bearing sulfide flotation concentrate, which is subsequently leached after ultra-fine grinding at Fimiston, or is
filtered and moved to the Gidji ultra-fine grinding processing plant. The flotation tailings are also leached at Fimiston by two carbon in pulp leaching circuits. Loaded carbon from both Fimiston and Gidji is treated at the centralized Fimiston elution (stripping) and electrowinning facility. The gold-bearing deposits from the electrowinning circuits are removed periodically from the cathodes and smelted to produce doré gold bars. Excess concentrate, which is unable to be treated on site, is sold to overseas smelters for processing. Concentrate is treated at Gidji through 35-tonne-per-hour (tph) and 10 tph ultra-fine grinding mills and at Fimiston through a 13 tph ultra-fine grinding mill. The open pit operations utilize a fleet of four shovels, one loader, 40 haul trucks, as well as other ancillary equipment. The Mt Charlotte underground mine utilizes underground loaders, a combination of 50 and 60 tonne trucks and drills to enable ore extraction.
Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing at both the Mt Charlotte underground operation and the Fimiston open pit operation.
Power for the operations is supplied through Newmont Power Pty Ltd (a wholly-owned Newmont entity). Newmont Power Pty Ltd sources the power through a combination of purchase from the gas fired power plant in which Newmont holds a 50% interest and through purchase from the local power grid.
Kalgoorlie’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $433. Kalgoorlie produced 367,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2017 and reported 3.9 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.
Africa
The Africa region maintains its headquarters in Accra, Ghana and operates two sites, Ahafo and Akyem.
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement (“IA”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The IA established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. In December 2015, Ghana’s Parliament ratified the Revised Investment Agreements (“Ghana Investment Agreements” or “Revised IAs”). Currently, the maximum corporate income tax remains at 32.5% and royalties are paid on a sliding scale system that is based on monthly gold prices. The rates range from 3% to 5% of revenues (plus an additional 0.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after reaching specific production milestones by receiving 1/9th of the total amount paid as dividends to Newmont shareholders. When the average quoted gold price exceeds $1,300 per ounce within a calendar year, an advance payment on these amounts of 0.6% of total revenues is required. The Ghana Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection.
The Ghana Investment Agreements also include a change in tax stabilization from life of mine to 15 years from commercial production for each mine. In October 2017, the government of Ghana approved Newmont’s request to extend the stability period of the Revised IA at the Ahafo operations for five years to December 31, 2025. The extension was approved based on Newmont’s commitment to invest at least $300 for the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion projects.
See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a description of risks inherent in contracts with governments.
The Ahafo and Akyem mines operate using electrical power generated by the Volta River Authority along with supplemental power generation capacity built by Newmont.
Ahafo, Ghana. (100% owned) Ahafo is located near Kenyasi in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 50% of Ahafo as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2003, Newmont purchased the remaining interest from Moydow Mines International Inc. (“Moydow”), thereby making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Ahafo mine commenced commercial production in 2006 and currently operates a mill and three pits.
The Ahafo operations cover an area of approximately 137,000 acres (55,000 hectares) for the mining lease concession with current mine take area of approximately 18,700 acres (7,600 hectares) that has been fully compensated and approximately 6,500 acres (2,600 hectares) of mining area that has not been fully compensated (i.e. payment would be necessary to move people from their land). Ahafo pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana.
The Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo has three open pits (Subika, Awonsu and Amoma), with current mining from the Awonsu and Subika pits. Subika will move to a four stage pit in 2018, whereas Awonsu is progressing towards future laybacks. Amoma ceased mining operations in May 2017. The available mining fleet consists of three shovels and thirty-eight 141-tonne haul trucks. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The processing plant was commissioned in 2006 to process 7.5 million tonnes of primary and oxide ore per year. With the depletion of oxide ore, the current plant throughput has decreased to 6.5 million tonnes per year. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, carbon in leach tanks, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit and a tailings disposal facility.
Ongoing development projects include Subika Underground and the Ahafo Mill Expansion. The Subika Underground project achieved first production in June 2017, with commercial production expected in the second half of 2018. The Ahafo Mill Expansion will expand the existing plant by approximately 3.5 million tonnes per year through the installation of a new crusher, a single stage SAG mill and two leach tanks. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is expected to reach first production in the first half of 2019, with commercial production expected in the second half of 2019. The expansions will maximize synergies between the Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika underground project at Ahafo.
Ahafo’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $1,999. Ahafo produced 349,000 ounces of gold in 2017 and reported 9.9 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.
Akyem, Ghana. (100% owned) Akyem is located in Birim North District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 85% of Akyem as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2006, Newmont acquired the remaining 15% from Kenbert Mines Ltd. The Akyem operations are comprised of one mill and one open pit mine, and commenced commercial production in October 2013.
The Akyem operations have an area of approximately 15,500 acres (6,000 hectares) for the mining lease concession. The Akyem mine operates on two mining leases between the Government of Ghana and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited. The leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area for a term of fifteen years, including the processing, storing and transportation of ore and materials. The leases require Akyem to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations. Akyem pays a sliding scale royalty to the government based on the monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production.
The Akyem mine is an orogenic gold deposit that has oxide and primary mineralization. The deposit is localized in the Akyem fault zone and gold mineralization is controlled by a series of brittle fracture zones located within the fault zone. The Akyem mine is an open pit mine consisting of a large main pit and a smaller east pit, connected near the surface. The planned pit covers an area of approximately 345 acres (139 hectares). The available mining fleet consists of two shovels, two excavators and nineteen 136-tonne haul trucks. The daily production rate is approximately 91,000 tonnes. The Akyem processing plant was commissioned in 2013 to treat an average of 8.5 million tonnes of ore annually. The processing plant consists of a crushing plant, a SAG and ball milling circuit, carbon-in-leach, elution and bullion smelting facilities and a tailings storage facility.
Exploration efforts at Akyem are focused on defining the extension of the known mineralization below the planned pit shell as well as investigating the underground potential of the deposit.
Akyem’s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2017 was $1,346. Akyem produced 473,000 ounces of gold in 2017 and reported 2.8 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2017.

Proven and Probable Reserves
We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 68.5 million ounces at December 31, 2017. For 2017 and 2016, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,200 or A$1,600 per ounce. Our 2017 reserves would increase by 7% (5 million ounces), or decline by 8% (5 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,300 and $1,100 per ounce gold price, respectively, with all other assumptions remaining constant.
At December 31, 2017, our attributable proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 28.8 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end attributable proven and probable gold reserves were 39.7 million ounces, including 6.0 million ounces in South America, 21.0 million ounces in Australia and 12.7 million ounces in Africa.
Our attributable proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2017 were 2,670 million pounds. For 2017 and 2016, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $2.50 or A$3.35 per pound.
Our attributable proven and probable silver reserves at December 31, 2017 were 87.9 million ounces. For 2017, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $16 per ounce. For 2016, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $17 per ounce. Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions, adjusted for our exchange rate assumption, follow SEC guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralization considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve
estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2018, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, to future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2018.
The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2017 and 2016:
(1)
The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements
are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates.
Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2017 and 2016 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,200, or A$1,600 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
(2)
Tonnages include allowances for losses resulting from mining methods. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 100,000.

The following table reconciles 2017 and 2016 gold, copper and silver proven and probable reserves:
(1)
Revisions are due to reclassification of reserves to mineralized material, optimizations, model updates, metal price changes and updated operating costs and recoveries.
(2)
Additions are due to reserve conversions from mineralized material due to new drilling information and successful feasibility studies for first time declarations.
(3)
Acquisitions include an increase in ownership at Yanacocha in December 2017 which added 0.1 million gold ounces and 1.3 million silver ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2017.
Mineralized Material
All of our mineralized material is located on fee property or mining claims. Mineralized material is a mineralized ore body which has been intersected by a sufficient number of closely spaced drill holes and/or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal(s) to warrant further exploration development work. The deposit does not qualify as a commercially minable ore body until it can be legally and economically extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Metal price assumptions are based on approximately a twenty to thirty percent premium over reserve prices.
We had attributable gold mineralized material of 1,360 million tons at an average grade of 0.025 ounces per ton at December 31, 2017. For 2017 and 2016, attributable gold mineralized material was calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400 or A$1,750 per ounce.
At December 31, 2017, our gold mineralized material included 455 million tons in North America, 520 million tons in South America, 323 million tons in Australia and 62 million tons in Africa.
We had attributable copper mineralized material of 1,065 million tons at a grade of 0.20% at December 31, 2017. For 2017, attributable copper mineralized material was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.25 or A$4.00 per pound. For 2016, attributable copper mineralized material was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.00 or A$3.75 per pound.
We had attributable silver mineralized material of 705 million tons at a grade of 0.15 ounces per ton at December 31, 2017. For 2017 and 2016, attributable silver mineralized material was calculated at a silver price assumption of $20 per ounce. Silver mineralized material is generally a by-product of gold and/or copper mineralized material estimates, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in future calculations of potential economic extraction.
The mineralized material figures presented herein do not include that part of our mineralized material that has been converted to Proven and Probable Reserves as shown above, as they are reported exclusive of reserves, and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper and silver, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain mineralized material containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of mineralized material.
We will publish mineralized materials annually, and will recalculate them at December 31, 2018, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2018.
Mineralized material is reported exclusive of reserves. Mineralized material as used in this annual report, although permitted by the SEC, does not indicate “reserves” as defined in the SEC’s Industry Guide 7. Newmont cannot be certain that any part of the reported mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves.” Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
The following tables detail mineralized material reflecting only those that are attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2017 and 2016:
