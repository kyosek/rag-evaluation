Retail Properties:
Escondido 7-Eleven
In September 2006, we acquired a stand-alone single use retail property located at 850 West Mission Road, Escondido, California. This property consists of a 3,000 sq. ft. retail building situated on an approximately 12,000 sq. ft. corner lot. The property consists of a one-story, brick and wood constructed building with a cement stucco exterior and an asphalt-paved parking lot The building is currently under lease to 7-Eleven, Inc. and is operated as a convenience store. The lease provides for minimum monthly rent of $9,000. The lease, which was originally terminable on December 31, 2008, has been extended to December 31, 2018 with minimum monthly rent of $9,000 during the first 5 years and $10,350 during the second 5 years. The lease is not subject to any renewal options. The lease is a triple net lease requiring the tenant to pay all property related operating costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
In June 2007, we sold a 48.6% undivided interest in the property to the family trust of Mr. William H. Allen, for which he serves as trustee. The sales price was $680,425, which equaled the pro rata share of agreed upon fair value for the property, including most of our acquisition costs and expenses. As a condition to the transaction, the parties, among other things, agreed to engage CHG Properties, Inc. to manage the property.
In April 2008, we and our co-owner contributed our respective interests in this property to a newly formed California limited partnership (the “NetREIT 01 LP Partnership). We serve as general partner of, and own a 51.4% equity interest in, the partnership. In October 2009, under his right to do so granted upon the formation of the partnership, the trust elected to convert a 33.3% equity interest in the partnership into 25,790 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.30 per share for a total of $239,844. Mr. Allen was elected to our Board at our annual stockholder meeting on October 16, 2009. In 2012, the trust elected to convert an additional 17,060 shares at $8.03, after adjusting for stock dividends, or approximately $144,000. Following these conversions, NetREIT’s equity interest in the partnership increased to 77.3%.
This property was sold in October 2012 for a gross selling price of approximately $1.9 million and resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million. The Company completed a 1031 exchange of the 7-Eleven for the purchase of The Presidio and, as a result, The Presidio is owned by the NetREIT 01 LP Partnership.

In connection with these sales, we took back notes from the buyers in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.9 million. The notes are secured by the buyers’ interests in these properties.
