Additional Description of the Properties
Joshua Gold holds an interest in five mineral properties in Canada. All the properties are in Northern Ontario, except for the Carson property which is located in the Northwest Territories. It should be noted that three of the properties, the C-1, the Rollo, and the Kenty are all contiguous but differ in ownership by the Company. In 2019, the mineral rights to the Rollo property expired and were not renewed. They are collectively referred to as the Swayze Area properties and share similar access, locations, and regional geology. However, detailed descriptions for historical exploration work and property geology are given.
Background Information Concerning Properties Located in the Canadian Province of Ontario: Janes, Asquith, C1 Mortimer, Chewett, King Solomon Mines and Kenty
Upon recording of the mineral claims with the provincial Mining Recorder’s Office, the claims will remain in good standing for a period of two years. The claims can be renewed by performing the minimum specified assessment work within 2 years of the recording date for the claim.
Modernizing of the Mining Act in the Province of Ontario
The Ontario Ministry of Mines and Development (the “MNDM”) has modernized the Mining Act, moving Ontario’s mining lands administration systems from ground staking and paper map staking to online registration of mining claims; and creating an online Mining Land Administration System (“MLAS”) that enhances client access to Ontario’s mining lands data and improves their ability to manage their files online.
Pre-Conversion Period
Traditional claim staking in Ontario came to an end on January 8, 2018. During this pre-conversion period claim staking will not be permitted, nor will other transactions such as transfers and the filing of assessment work reports. This period will allow MNDM to prepare for conversion as well as for exhaustive testing of the information technology architecture that will underpin MLAS, and provide enough time to enroll and train users on the new system prior to launch.
Types of Mining Claims
At conversion, there will be two claim types:
(a) Cell Claims
As defined in the Mining Act, a cell claim means a mining claim that relates to all of the land included in one or more cells on the provincial grid that is open for mining claim registration. A cell claim is created at conversion where there are one or more legacy claims in a cell, and all are held by the same holder. In this case, if there is more than one legacy claim in a cell, those claims will merge into one cell claim. A cell claim created from conversion can be a minimum of one cell though it can be amalgamated to form a multi-cell claim up to a maximum of 25 cells.
(b) Boundary Claims
As defined in the Mining Act, a boundary claim is created at conversion when there are multiple legacy claims within a cell that cannot merge into a cell claim. There are two circumstances where mining claims will not merge into a cell claim:
1. When the legacy claims are held by different holders;
2. When the legacy claims are held by the same person who chooses to keep them separate by making an election through the Claim Boundary Report process.
Overall note: boundary cell indicates that the mineral rights are still defined by the legacy claim boundaries, of which the maps provided show and are representative of the physical area that the new claim news/cells represent under changes in the Ontario Mining Act.
·
Jane Property
The Jane Property consists of two (2) legacy claims, converted into 31 cell claims (20 standard and 11 boundary claims). These require annual exploration expenditures of $10,200 CAD per year, accompanied by an industry standard report detailing the work completed. These are due on the claim anniversary dates, which also summarizes the cells that compose each legacy claim. These grant the holder (i.e., the Company),, the sole right to explore for minerals, and to apply for a mining lease for extraction of the minerals. This does not grant any surface rights to the Crown land, nor rights to extract or mine aggregates from the claim areas.
Jane Property Claim Summary
The Janes leases expired during the year and were not renewed.
·
Asquith
The Asquith Property consists of one (1) legacy claims, converted into seven (7) cell claims (2 standard and 5 boundary claims. These require annual exploration expenditures of $2,000 CAD per year, accompanied by an industry standard report detailing the work completed. Amounts are due at different times of the year. These grant the holder, Joshua Gold, the sole right to explore for minerals, and to apply for a mining lease for extraction of the minerals. This does not grant any surface rights to the Crown land, nor rights to extract or mine aggregates from the claim areas. The table lists the legacy claim numbers and the new cell claims that these legacy mining claims have been converted to under the implementation of the new Ontario Mining Act.
Asquith Property Claim Summary
During the year the Asquith property leases expired and were not renewed.
·
C1 Property
The C1 Property consists of five (5) legacy mining claims that have been converted into 35 boundary claims defined under the new Mining Act in Ontario. These grant the holder, Joshua Gold, through its option with Kencana Technical Services Inc., the sole right to explore for minerals, and to apply for a mining lease for extraction of the minerals. This does not grant any surface rights to the Crown land, nor rights to extract or mine aggregates from the claim areas. The table lists the legacy claim numbers and the new cell claims that these legacy mining claims have been converted to under the new Ontario mining Act. Cells with IDs 41O15G360 (claims 289156, 280401), 41O14H341 (claims 107471, 129129), 41O14H343 (claims 157059, 190225), 41O15H344 (claims 230404, 144217, 216941) although indicated as boundary cells are fully owned due an overlap of the C1 and Rollo Properties. These require annual exploration expenditures of $7,000 CAD per year, accompanied by an industry standard report detailing the work completed. However, portions of this amount are due on individual claim anniversary dates which are summarized below:

Carson Property
Location and Access
The Carson Property is located in a remote area approximately 195 kilometers north-northwest of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Direct access is only possible via fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft from Yellowknife. However, winter access via the Colomac Winter road is possible. The road comes within 5km to the West of the property area.
Property and Ownership
The Carson Property is 1141 acres comprising one mining lease registered in good standing with the NT Mining Recorder’s office and is geographically centered at 115°8’35"W 64°9'57”N, NTS 086G/03, Mackenzie Mining District, North West Territories. The lease number is 3446, issued to John P Rapski June 30, 1993 and expiring June 30, 2024.
Regional Geology
The Damoti Lake area lies within the Slave Structural Province within the INdin Lake Supracrustal belt. This belt is composed of Archean age metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Yelloknife Supergroup, and is truncated to the west by Archean age plutons and migamtites, and to the east by gneissic basement rocks.The Indin Lake belt form a series of north to northeast trending volcanic assemblages.
The Yellowknife Supergroup is composed of a lower Hewlitt group, a sequence of pillowed mafic tholeiitic basalts intercalated with more rare felsic calc-alkaline volcanics and are older than approximately 2.67 Ga. Overlying the Hewlitt group is Leta Arm group, a sequence of pollowed and massive mafic and felsic flows, and intermediate to felsic volcaniclastic rocks (2.6y Ga). The Chalco Lake group, consisting of conglomerates, sandstone-mudstones, and volcaniclastic rocks (<2.65 Ga). Sediments composed of interbedded agillites, siltstones, and greywacke beds are consistent with turbite deposition. Sedimentary horizons host iron formations of pyrite +/- pyrrhotite, as well as sulphide-bearing argillite units in the eastern area of the Indin Lake area.
Gabbro and quartz-diorite sills in the Indin Lake are thought to be related to volcanic units in the area. Volcanic rocks are intruded by grandodiorite and pegmatites of variable ages. Diabase dykes also cut all units in the Indin Lake area.
Property Geology
The Carson property is underlain by mafic and lesser felsic metavolcanic and subordinate metadsedimentary rocks of the Yellowknife Supergroup. Felsic metavolcanic rocks occur at the metavolcanic-metasedimentary contacts. The 1985 mapping program identified 8 major rock assemblages in the property area, which contacts trending slightly east of north.
To the central area of the property is the Snowden andesite and consists of pillowed, variolitic, porphyritic, and amigoidal flows. Two horizons of mafic volcaniclastic rocks are defined by mafic tuff and matric with felsic clasts which overly the Snowden andesite. A strongly sheared unit is equivalent to this unit but is identified as a mafic agglomerate. The Oti rhyolite occurs to the western side of the property. It is strongly brecciated and sericitized, hosting pyritic argillite are associated with graphitic shear zones within lenses of this unit. The Damoti rhyolite is mapped at the metavolcanic-metasedimentary rock contact, and is a fine grained and tuffaceous unit, with local interbeds of lapilli size fragments.
Yellowknife Supergoup metasediments underly the eastern side of the property, and consist of fine grained greywacke and argillite sequences. This sequence sows graded bedding of a turbidite sequence, and interpretation of top indicators suggests this unit overlies the metavolcanic sequences.
Several felsic porphyritic dykes intrude the property, and can be up to 20 meters in width. Additionally, several steeply dipping diabase dykes intrude the entire property stratigraphy.
Mineralization
Gold mineralization in the Damoti Lake area is characterized by quartz carbonate veins associated with regional scale structural deformation. Shear zones on the property are northeast trending and parallel to the regional tectonic fabric. The Hillop, Chuck vein, and Pond showings all occur in these northeast trending shear zones.
This style of mineralization is consistent with volcanic hosted orogenic lode-gold deposits. Quartz-carbonate veins are typically associated with altered volcanic wall rocks with sillification, pyrite, and chlorite alteration, which can include pyrrhotite and biotite alteration minerals. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite and galena can occur in mafic volcanic hosted shear zones. Gold grades on the property associated with quartz-carbonate veins typically show higher grade gold mineralization over narrow widths from 6 to 60 inches (~2.5 to 23.5 cm). Gold mineralization can also be associated with iron formations in volcanic and sedimentary sequences that are prospective for polymetallic base metal mineralization.
In the property area, shear zones parallel to regional scale deformation zones host auriferous quartz-carbonate veins occur at the Check vein and the Hilltop showing in felsic, intermediate volcanics and sedimentary rocks. Lithological contacts also present a mineralization target for these styles of veins, of which is exemplified by the Pond showing.
Previous Exploration Work
Prospecting and exploration work in the Damoti Lake and Indin Lake areas began in 1938 with the discovery of the Barker (Anne) showing. This discovery lead to the staking and subsequent mapping and prospecting of much of the Indin Lake supracrustal belt by government and invested industry personnel. A number of showings were discovered including Diversiﬁed, North Inca and Colomac, all of which reached an advanced stage of exploration.
Reconnaissance mapping of the lndin Lake belt commenced in 1939 by C5. Lord and J.T. Wilson of the Geological Survey of Canada, and was competed in 1948 (Lord, 1951; Fortier, 1949). Detailed geological examination was then conducted at Chalco Lake (Stanton et al., 1948; Pehrrson and Kerswill, 1997), Ranji Lake (Tremblay et al., 1953; Pehrrson and Kerswill, 1997b), and Ghost Lake (Wright, 1954; Pehrrson and Kerswill, 1997b).
A second round of exploration in the 1970's was focused on volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) mineralization. This work resulted in a number of base metal occurrences. During the 1980’s renewed interest in the belt culminated with the development of the Colomac mine and the Cass deposit.
Between 1970 and 1972, Freeport Oil Company explored the belt for base metal mineralization. A 2700 line kilometer airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey was conducted over ground west of the Damoti Lake area, this survey did identify a conductor on the west shore of Damoti Lake (Klein, 1970).
In 1981, Noranda staked the Betam claims adjacent to the present day Carson property. Geological, geochemical, and geophysical investigation were conducted. Anomalous, but low grade gold values were found in small sulphide-bearing quartz veins in the mafic volcanic rocks and the ground was allowed to lapse (Cluff and Myres, 1982).
In 1985, the Oti claims were staked along the western shore of Damoti Lake by Comaplex Resources International Ltd. and were examined by Placer Development Ltd. A number of low grade showings were discovered by geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys (Pinsent, 1985).
The Geologic Survey of Canada initiated 1:125,000 scale mapping furthered the geological understanding of the area (Frith, 1986; 1993). Detailed examination of the mineralized areas in the Indin Lake area was conducted from 1987 to 1991 (Morgan, 1992). Most recently the Indin belt was examined in the context of structural and sedimentological relationships (Pehrsson and Beaumont - Smith, 1994; Pehrsson and Villeneuve, 1999; Pehrsson, 2002; Pehrsson, 2009).
In 1992, J. Brophy conducted mapping and sampling on BIF Island of Damoti Lake. Prospective results from this sampling lead to the staking the discovery of the Damoti Lake deposit by Covello Bryan and Associates in 1993. Exploration at Damoti Lake has been ongoing through to present day. Puritch and Ewert (2005) present a very thorough summary of exploration on the Damoti Lake iron-formation property.
Exploration has been periodically conducted in the Indin Lake area since the mid 1930’s with the discovery of lode gold in the mafic volcanic rocks that surround the lake. Prospecting of the area around the lake identiﬁed a number of additional gold showings in the volcanic and surrounding sedimentary rocks. In the 1970's, exploration shifted focus to polymetallic base metal targets and lead to the discovery of new occurrences in the Indin Lake belt. The discovery of iron formation-hosted gold at Damoti Lake, and active mining at the Colomac deposit, fueled the exploration effort during the 1990’s. At present, elevated gold prices have renewed staking and exploration interest in the Indin Lake belt.
The earliest organized exploration recorded on the property was conducted by Snowden Yellowknife Mines (Snowden) in 1947. This exploration effort may have lead to the discovery of the Pond. Chuck Vein, and Hilltop showings. These showings remain the most prominent mineral occurrences recognized on the property. Snowden reported trenching and diamond drilling activities on the Pond showing and isolated localities along strike to the northeast. Grades as high as
1.26 oz/t Au over 7 inches in hole 5-18 and 0.55 oz/t Au ever 7 inches in hole 5-16 are reported (Glidden and Burton, 1948). In 1981, Wollex Exploration examined the property through prospecting, mapping, and re-sampling existing trenches.
A total of nine trenches and 35 x-ray diamond drill holes have been completed on the Pond showing. The showing occurs in sheared mafic and felsic volcanic rocks. Drilled gold-bearing intervals show silicacarbonate-pyriteipyrrhoite alteration. One grab sample from Trench 16 assayed 2.66 oz/t.
The Chuck vein showing is a milky white quartz vein hosted in a ten meter wide shear zone. This vein is lesoidal and can be traced discontinuously for 200 meters. A chip sample collected in 1985 assayed 870 ppb Au over 0.5 meters in Trench 2.
The Hilltop showing is a weakly silicified zone in intermediate volcanic rocks. Four trenches have been excavated on the showing. No signiﬁcant gold assays are reported.
The area covering the Chuck Vein showing was originally staked in 1939 by P.A. Schwerdt and restaked in 1945 by Schwerdt again after the Dions claims were allowed to lapse.
In 1946, Snowden acquired the Doins claim and commenced with trenching, stripping, and x-ray diamond drilling. A total of 13 trenches/pits and 43 drill holes totaling 6384.26 feet was completed. Drilling on the Pond Zone encountered visible gold.
Comaplex Resource International Ltd. in 1981 staked the showing area (KIM 1 claim) and Wollex Exploration (Wollex) located and re-sampled the existing trenches in the summer of 1981. The sampling returned some elevated gold values which included 4820 ppb Au from the Chuck vein and 5940 ppb Au from the G-Zone [Pond] (Dickson, 1983).
The KIM 1 claim was allowed to lapse and in 1985 the showing area was re-staked as the BR2 claim by W. Brink. Noranda explored the property in 1985. The showing area was prospected then mapped at a scale of 110,000. The property was chip sampled (92 collected), grab sampled (55 samples) and 63 samples were taken for lithogeochemistry. Sampling on the Pond showing returned signiﬁcant gold values up to 2.66 oz/ton while the Chuck Vein had a chip sample assaying 870 ppb gold. Noranda did not complete any further work on the property. Geophysical surveys were conducted and the property was taken to lease in June of 1993 (Puritch and Ewert, 2005).
Mapping, sampling and geochemical analysis
Wollex prospected and sampled the Carson property in 1981. A number of shear zones were identified on the then called KIM1 claim (owned 100% by Comaplex Resources International Ltd.), the largest of which was the G-Zone (Pond zone as of 1985). The G-zone is described to continue from the claim boundaries for many kilometers in both directions and coincide with the contact of the maﬁc and felsic volcanic rocks (Dickson, 1982).
An analysis error occurred at the lab when processing the 1981 samples (Dickson, 1983). Due to the packaging of the samples, the lab mistakenly assayed several rock chips from the same trench as one sample; therefore some reported results are the averages of several samples over the length of the trench (Dickson, 1982).
Four trenches were sampling at the Pond showing. Gold values are described as erratic with a best result of 0.17 oz/ton Au from an average of two samples (Dickson, 1982).
In 1985, Noranda collected and analyzed 117 chip samples and 30 grab samples for gold across the property. An additional 63 samples were collected for lithogeochemisty and geochemical analysis for gold (Powers, 1986). Chip samples consisted of continuous chisel samples across quartz vein and altered walk rock material.
A total of 20 lithogeochemical samples, eight grab samples, and 78 chip samples were collected from the Pond zone.
Geophysics
Noranda completed ground magnetic and Very Low Frequency Electromagnetic (VLF-EM) surveys in the fall of 1985 after the geology program had finished. A 2.1 kilometer baseline oriented at 034° azm was established by chaining. A line spacing of 100 meters with 50 meter station spacing were chained and flagged from the baseline to establish 15.4 line kilometers of survey lines.
Magnetic survey
Survey speciﬁcations: The magnetometer employed on the survey was a UNIMAG model 6836 proton magnetometer manufactured by Geometrics of Toronto, Ontario. The diurnal variation was monitored with a geometries base station unit. Base station measurements were made every four seconds and used to correct the ﬁeld data. The magnetic variation ranges from 3350 to -1630 nts (Powers, 1986).
Discussion: Powers (1986) suggests that there is a trend from low to high magnetic response along the eastern portion of the property interpreted to be the contact between [volcanic and sedimentary] rocks. Within the magnetic terrane there are a number of interpreted linear highs that trend parallel to the regional fabric.
VLF-EM survey
Survey speciﬁcations: An EM16 manufactured by Geonics Limited of Toronto, Ontario was used to carry out the VLF-EM survey. This instrument measures the in-phase and quadrature component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld transmitted from various naval facilities. In this ca5e the transmitter employed was Seattle, Washington (Powers, 1986).
Discussion: Powers (1986) summarizes three VLF-EM anomalies (Figure 5). A small anomaly interpreted to be shallow in origin occurs at the north end of the grid (L11+00N at 1+50E). A second shallow but more prominent anomaly trends approximately parallel to the baseline on the eastern side of the survey grid (L6+00N at 3+50E to L4+OOS at 2+50E). Powers (1986) suggests that this anomaly may actually be two anomalies offset between 3+005 and 4+OOS. The third anomaly is coincident with the Chuck vein (L1+OOS and L2+OOS at 3+00W). All conductors are interpreted to strike parallel to regional foliation.
Trenching
Snowden exposed 2782 cubic feet in nine trenches on the Carson property (Figure 6). The locations of nine of these trenches are shown to be at the Pond showing (Glidden and Burton, 1948). Trenches are reported at the Chuck vein and Hilltop zone showings and were sampled during the 1981 Wollex program and 1985 Noranda programs (Dickson, 1982; Powers 1986). The author cannot conﬁrm when the trenches outside the Pond zone were created. Assay values from any material sampled from the trenches is not presented in Glidden and Burton (1948).
Diamond drilling
In 1946, Snowden acquired the Doins claim and commenced with trenching, stripping, and may diamond drilling. A total 43 drill holes totaling 6384.26 feet were completed (Glidden and Burton, 1948).
Local Infrastructure
The Colomac Winter road passes within 5 km to the west of the property. The Colomac Mine is approximately 25 kilometers to the North. No power lines, gas lines, or settlements occur near the property. The property is approximately 100 kilometers north-northeast from Northwest Territories Power Corporation's Snare River Hydro power complex.
C-1 Property Claims and Ownership
The C-1 property consists of 5 mineral claims contiguous with the Rollo property and Kenty area claims were optioned from a mining group representing full, 100% interest in the mining claims.
Kenty Mine Claims and Ownership
The Company entered into an agreement with Brian MacClay to purchase the Kenty Mine claims, which are comprised of patented mining claims. However, a separate group claimed title and ownership of these patented mining claims, and therefore, the Company is currently in litigation to resolve the title and determine the rightful owners of the claims. The Company has been added as an owner on title as a result of the current legal proceedings to date.
Regional Geology
The Swayze Greenstone Belt (SGB) is located within the western Abitibi Subprovince of the Superior Province. It is similar in age and composition the better known Abitibi Subprovince, a prolific producer of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposits, and is thought to be the western extension of the Abitibi. The SGB is bounded to the east by the Kenogamissi
Batholith (2713 Ma), to the north by the Nat River granitoid complex (2692 Ma), the Ramsey-Algoma grantitoid complex to the south (2692 Ma), and the Kapukasing Structural Zone to the east.
The Swayze Greenstone Belt hosts Archean age volcanic assemblages with a general east-west trending structure. The oldest rocks are of the mafic to intermediate rocks of the Chester Group (2730 Ma), which are overlain by rocks of the Marion Group (2729 Ma) rocks predominantly of felsic volcanics and iron formations. The Trailbreaker Group (2705 Ma) overlies the Marion group, and is equivalent in age and composition to the tholeiitic Tisdale in the Timmins camp. The Tisdale group hosts most of the major gold deposits in the Timmins gold camp, and is uncomformably overlain by the Timiskaming sediments, which are thought to resemble the Rideout Group (<2690 Ma). The Trailbreaker Group consists of ultramafic, mafic, and felsic volcanic assemblages.
Mineralization
Mineralization in the SGB targets similar mineralization style to quartz vein hosted lode-gold deposits in the Abitibi Subprovince. These deposits are typically structurally controller epigenetic deposits, characterized by complex structural features hosting laminted quartz-carbonate veins in brittle, steeply dipping fault-fill veins, as well as narrow flat-lying extensional veins. These deposits are typically associated with regional unconformities, Archean-age tholeiitic basalts intruded by felsic porphyry bodies. Additionally, major crustal-scale compressional to transtensional fault zone structures resulting from accretionary processes necessary to create the deformational structures that transport deep crustal Au-rich metamorphic fluid along the deformation structures leading to gold mineralization.
Mineralization on the claim group is characterized by quartz-carbonate veins in Archean age metavolcanic rocks, that are typically with porphyritic felsic intrusions. Mineralization occurs within quartz-ankerite-pyrite veins with an associated altered volcanic wall rocks and porphyry. Gold grades are nuggety and sporadic, with anomalous gold values occurring in the vein material, altered wall rock, and altered porphyritic units on the property. The most impression example is a flat-lying quartz-carbonate vein, named the C-1 occurrence, that hosts intensely altered, flat-lying, quart-carbonate veins where visible gold is present. Elsewhere on the property, quartz-ankerite-pyrite veins are associated with less intense wallrock alteration and can trend either ~40-60 degrees or ~ 345 degrees. These are similar orientation to regional scale fault structures in the property area, as well as vein mineralization in the adjacent Kenty Mine claims.
Property Geology
Kenty Property
The Kenty property is underlain by pillowed mafic volcanics, which are in contact with felsic volanics and metasediments in the southern area of the property. Small bodies and dykes of felsic volcanic rocks intrude the mafic volcanic rocks on the property. Local structural deformation and quartz veining are parallel to regional fault and deformation structures and generally trend 40 - 60 degrees. More minor auriferous veins trend at ~340 degrees and are also associated with regional scale deformation structures. These regional structures offset and truncate veins that trends 40 - 60 degrees, which is observed in the No. 17 vein at surface, and in the No. 1 shaft.
Around the No. 2 shaft, veining and mineralization is associated with a "lamprophyrye" body that hosts quartz vein style mineralization and is visible in trenches at surface. Historically it was identified as a lamprophyre, but is has also been classified as an altered diorite. The rock is massive and medium grained with abundant biotite in its matrix.
C1 Property
The property is underlain by mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks that are bounded to the north and south by felsic volcanic rocks. The mafic volcanics are intruded by several smaller felsic porphyry intrusions, as well as intermediate to felsic dykes. A narrow band of altered ultramfic volcanics are suggested from historic geological mapping on the Kenty Mine area, as well as regional mapping by Heather et al (1991). Faulting and shearing appears to occur in a north-south orientation group, as well as a more east-west orientation group that is slight north of the eastern trend of the volcanic rocks. Airborne and ground geophysics suggest electromagnetic anomalies are associated with sediments and felsic volcanic assemlages at the contact with the mafic volcanics, representing accessory graphite mineralization.
Past Exploration Work
Regional Goverment Programs
Donovan (1965) mapped Swayze and Dore townships at a scale of 1:50,000. The claim 4270364 is shown to be underlain by mafic to intermediate massive flows and intermediate to felsic volcaincs with porphyritic textures. Limited
metasediment lenses occur within the felsic and intermediate volcanics. On a regional scale NW trending fault are noted, as well as ENE trending synclinal and anticlinal fold axis, although none are noted on claim 4270364.
The Geological Survey of Canada mapped the Swayze Greenstone Belt at a scale of 1:50,00 (Heather and Shore, 1999). General fault and fold structures agree with those observed by Donovan (1965), although additional high strain deformation zones are noted. More differentiation of volcanic sequences are made, leading to a more detailed representation of the geology underlying claim 4270364. The claim is underlain by intrusive ultramafic volcaincs (SNui) and mafic volcanics (SNm), with felsic units intercalated with metasediments to the north and south of the claims.
The Kenty Property
Initial work by Kenty Gold Mines in 1930 - 1934 identified several auriferous quartz veins, and completed a diamond drilling program, as well as sinking two shafts with limited drift underground drift development. The No. 1 shaft was sunk to a total of 500 ft (152m), and lateral development took place at the 250 foot (76m), 375 foot (114m), and 500 foot (152m) levels. The number 2 shaft was sunk to a depth of 534 feet (162m), with lateral development on the 290 foot (88m) and 525 foot (160m) levels.
In 1936, Brett-Trethway Mines Limited ran a small 5-ton/day test mill and reported no grades. In 1947, Erndale Mines Ltd. acquired the property and drilled 8 DDH for a total of 498 meters. The comapny dewatered the mine, and extracted 1,3333 tonnes of ore were extracted from scaling the No. 1 vein. Sampling averaged 0.92 g/t for the program. In 1950, Elancra mines carried out some work with a local mill, with no grades/records produced.
In 1983, Heron Resources carried out a magnetic and self-potential geophysical survey and collected humus samples on the property, and carried out a mapping program and carried out underground sampling on the veins via access from the No. 1 shaft.
In 1986, Emerald Isle Resources carried out an exploration program consisting of bulk sampling and stripping, and identified an hematitic zone with quartz stockworks to the southeast of the No. 2 shaft. Several diamond drillholes were completed to test for gold mineralization around the No. 2 shaft, with the best grades occurring with quartz-ankerite-pyrite veins associated with felsic porphyry dykes.
The C-1 Property
The Company owns a one hundred percent interest in 37 contiguous staked mining claims formerly comprised of Legacy Claim Numbers 4275244, 4275245, and 4275246.
This 734ha claims group is located within Swayze, Rollo, Coppel and Dore Townships, Porcupine Mining Division, approximately 150 km northwest of the City of Sudbury, west off Highway 144, midway between the established mining camps of Timmins to the north and Sudbury to the south and km south of the town of Gogama in the province of Ontario.
This interest grants claimholder JSHG with the sole right to explore for minerals, and to apply for a mining lease for extraction of the minerals. This does not grant any surface rights to the Crown land, nor rights to extract or mine aggregates from the claim areas.
This claims group requires annual exploration expenditures of $11,200.00 CAD per year ($400.00 per 19 single cell claims and $200.00 per 18 boundary claims), accompanied by an industry standard report detailing the work completed, due on their various anniversary dates (recorded in table below).

Red Pine Exploration Inc. (2010 - 2011) explored the claims directly surrounding the Kenty mine, which include the current claim group. Their work program consisted of line-cutting, IP, stripping and trenching, and limited diamond drilling. Trenching and striping identified several anomalous gold values associated with quartz-carbonate altered volcanics and quartz veins, with more limited showings associated with a felsic porphyry unit with significant gold assays. Some higher grade assays were reported associated with north-south trending quartz veins. Diamond drilling showed very limited anomalous gold mineralization occurring in relation to the felsic porphyry unit targeting some IP anomalies, although several IP anomalies with high resistivity and high chargeability related to the auriferous quartz carbonate vein mineralization remain untested.
Prospector Charles Mortimer completed some stripping of the Hopkins 1 vein allowing for the observation both the vein and wall rock mineralization in an assessment file with limited documentation. Nuggety gold mineralization is noted in a past report by Swayze Resources Ltd. Several pits and trenches of varying age are noted on claim 4270364. It appears that trenching focused on uncovering quartz stringers, veins, and altered wall rock associated with the historic Hopkins 1 vein, located on a striped hillside in the northeast area of the claim. This work was completed on the claim group to the west and north of the Kenty patent boundaries.
Several pits and trenches of varying age are noted on the current claim group to the east, mostly occurring on claim 4275471, with limited assays reported. Several altered and weathered pits and trenches were noted during the completion of the survey. Several of these trenches are still visible on the property, and were extended as part of Red Pine Exploration Inc. program. This work was completed from 1986 to approximately 2010.
