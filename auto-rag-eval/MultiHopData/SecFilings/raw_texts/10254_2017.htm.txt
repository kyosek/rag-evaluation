Item 2. Properties
Summary of Oil and Gas Properties
Midland Basin
We have an operated position of 20,498 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin of west Texas across Reagan, Upton, and Midland counties with an average working interest of approximately 87%. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 13 gross vertical and 26 gross horizontal operated producing wells. Current internal estimates indicate approximately 526 potential gross, largely de-risked, operated drilling locations, the vast majority of which are in various benches of the Wolfcamp and the Spraberry formations. Of these 526 operated locations, 466 locations are expected to have an average working interest of 79%, whereas 60 locations are expected to be operated units where we would hold less than a 50% working interest. We are actively pursuing trades and acquisitions of additional acreage that would increase our working interest in these 60 locations. At this time, we expect that these 60 locations would have an average working interest of approximately 28%.
We also have a non-operated position of 6,167 net acres in the Midland Basin of west Texas, located in Howard, Glasscock, Martin and Midland counties, Texas. As of December 31, 2017, we had an interest in approximately 134 gross vertical and 26 gross horizontal non-operated producing wells with an average working interest of approximately 37%.
We have identified approximately 417 potential gross horizontal locations in various benches of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations with an estimated average working interest of approximately 28%. We have also identified approximately 117 potential gross vertical well locations in the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Strawn and Fussleman formations with an estimated average working interest of approximately 41%.
Eagle Ford Trend
As of December 31, 2017, we held 33,557 gross (16,045 net) operated leasehold acres in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of south Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations. We serve as the operator with a range of approximately 16% to 50% undivided ownership interest in substantially all of the acreage.
As of December 31, 2017, we operated 91 gross Eagle Ford wells and 12 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in five gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk well. We have identified a total of approximately 165 potential gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey.
We have a non-operated position in 25,097 gross (2,863 net) acres within La Salle County, Texas. The acreage is prone to natural gas and condensate produced from the Eagle Ford formation. The two areas are summarized below:
a)
White Kitchen - We have an average working interest of approximately 15% in 7,075 gross acres, all of which is held by production. As of December 31, 2017, 30 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 40 potential additional drilling locations.
b)
Martin Ranch - We have a 10% working interest in 18,022 gross acres. As of December 31, 2017, 31 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 134 potential drilling locations in the acreage.
Additionally, we have a non-operated position in 2,055 gross (948 net) acres within Frio and Wilson counties of Texas.
Other
Our other 2017 operations primarily related to our recently divested Bakken properties, and other non-core oil and natural gas properties.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
As of December 31, 2017, primarily all of our oil and natural gas reserves were located in the state of Texas. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling and completion operations. Our reserve estimates have been prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), an independent petroleum engineering firm. The scope and results of CG&A’s procedures are summarized in a letter which is included as an exhibit to this report. For further information on estimated reserves, including information on estimated future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please refer to the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves totaled 79,976 MBOE and had a PV-10 value of approximately $598.6 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $592.7 million, all of which relate to our properties in Texas. In addition to the completion of the Bold Transaction in May 2017, we incurred approximately $81.1 million in capital expenditures, primarily drilling and completion costs, during 2017. We expect to further develop our properties through additional drilling.
2017 Activity in Proved Reserves
From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, our total estimated proved reserves increased 564% from 12,051 MBOE to 79,976 MBOE. Of that, estimated proved developed reserves increased 113% from 9,361 MBOE to 19,961 MBOE and estimated proved undeveloped reserves increased 2,131% from 2,690 MBOE to 60,015 MBOE. These increases are primarily attributable to the Bold Transaction that closed in May 2017.
Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2017
The below table sets forth a summary of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as of December 31, 2017, based on the annual reserve estimate prepared by CG&A. In preparing this reserve report, CG&A evaluated 100% of our properties at December 31, 2017. Proved reserves are estimated based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period for the year. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with the SEC guidelines.
Our proved reserve categories as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below:
(1)
Includes 26.8 MMBbl of oil, 51.6 Bcf of natural gas and 9.9 MMBbl of NGL reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, $339.4 million of PV-10 and $320.1 million of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows were attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure that differs from a measure under GAAP known as “standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows” in that PV-10 is calculated without including future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV-10 value of its oil and natural gas properties is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves. We believe the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies because the timing and quantification of future income taxes is dependent on company-specific factors, many of which are difficult to determine. For these reasons, management uses and believes that the industry generally uses the PV-10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential rate of return on investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The table below provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (in thousands):
(1)
Includes $339.4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Includes $320.1 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Drilled But Uncompleted Wells
In order to achieve efficiencies from a pricing and logistics standpoint, our customary sequence of drilling and completion operations is to drill a group of wells and defer completion operations until all drilling operations for the group are concluded and then commence completion activities.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 16.2 net wells (1,789 MBOE) included in PDNP which included 13 gross (4.8 net wells) (1,673 MBOE) that were drilled but uncompleted. The costs associated with the drilled but uncompleted wells totaled $9.5 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we have completed 10 gross (3.3 net) wells (1,092 MBOE) and completion operations are ongoing with the remaining 1.5 net wells (502 MBOE). We anticipate completion of all the remaining drilled but uncompleted wells by April 2018.
Reserve Quantity Information
The following table illustrates our estimated net proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves for the periods indicated. The oil prices as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of the month prices of the West Texas Intermediate spot prices which equates to $51.34 per barrel, $42.75 per barrel, and $50.28 per barrel, respectively. The natural gas prices as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of month prices of the Henry Hub spot price which equates to $2.98 per MMBtu, $2.48 per MMBtu and $2.59 per MMBtu, respectively. The natural gas liquids prices used to value reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 averaged $22.59 per barrel, $13.21 per barrel and $14.11 per barrel, respectively. All prices are adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines.
A summary of the changes in the quantities of our proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
(1)
Includes 26.8 MMBbl of oil, 51.6 Bcf of natural gas and 9.9 MMBbl of NGL reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Includes 6.8 MMBbl of oil, 13.2 Bcf of natural gas and 2.3 MMBbl of NGL reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(3)
Includes 20.0 MMBbl of oil, 38.4 Bcf of natural gas and 7.6 MMBbl of NGL reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Notable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the following:
•
Extensions and discoveries. In 2017, total extensions and discoveries of 30,763 MBOE was a result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin. The closing of the Bold Transaction in May 2017 which included primarily operated acreage in the Midland Basin was a significant contributor to this.
•
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 2,976 MBOE during 2017 and were primarily related to the disposition of our Bakken properties, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Purchases of minerals in place. In 2017, total purchases of minerals in place of 45,911 MBOE were primarily attributable to the Bold Transaction, whereby the Company acquired interests in 63 producing oil and natural gas wells, four proved
developed non-producing wells and undeveloped acreage in the Midland Basin, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Revision to previous estimates. In 2017, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 2,901 MBOE consisted of negative revisions to PUD reserves of 4,832 MBOE with improved proved developed reserves of 1,931 MBOE. PUD revisions are a result of (1) removal of approximately 2,011 MBOE of reserves due to delayed development plans of other operators in the Midland Basin that management previously expected to be developed within five years, (2) reduction of 2,378 MBOE upon closing of the Bold Transaction and making adjustments to development plans and PUD reserve assignments, and (3) non-participation in three Eagle Ford natural gas PUDs that were expected to develop 443 MBOE. Positive revisions are primarily a result of increased oil and natural gas prices during 2017.
Notable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following:
•
Extension and discoveries. In 2016, total extensions and discoveries of 423 MBOE were primarily attributable to the successful drilling on the operated Eagle Ford and non-operated Bakken properties.
•
Purchase of minerals in place. In 2016, total purchases of minerals in place of 10,647 MBOE were primarily attributable to our acquisition of Lynden Corp in May 2016 (the “Lynden Arrangement”), whereby we acquired interests in non-operated Midland Basin properties.
•
Revision to previous estimates. In 2016, the downward revision to previous estimates of 10,128 MBOE for total proved reserves occurred primarily as a result of decreased oil and natural gas prices.
Notable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the following:
•
Extensions and discoveries. In 2015, total extensions and discoveries of 685 MBOE were primarily attributable to the successful drilling on the operated Eagle Ford and non-operated Bakken properties.
•
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 1,344 MBOE during 2015 and were primarily related to the disposition of our Louisiana properties, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Purchases of minerals in place. In 2015, total purchases of minerals in place of 1,962 MBOE were primarily attributable to interests acquired in the Eagle Ford Trend.
•
Revision to previous estimates. In 2015, the downward revision to previous estimates of 9,484 MBOE for total proved reserves occurred primarily as a result of decreased oil and natural gas prices.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Proved undeveloped reserves increased from 2,690 MBOE to 60,015 MBOE or 2,131%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Proved undeveloped reserves represent 75% of our total proved reserves. Certain previously booked PUDs were reclassified as proved developed reserves due to successful drilling efforts. Revisions of prior estimates include certain PUDs that were reclassified to unproved categories due to development plan changes. In accordance with our 2017 year-end independent engineering reserve report, we plan to drill all of our individual PUD drilling locations within the next five years.
Changes in our PUD reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in MBOE):
(1)
Includes 34,029 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.
2017 Changes in PUD reserves
Conversions to developed. In our year-end 2016 plan to develop our PUDs within five years, we estimated that $6.9 million of capital would be incurred in 2017 and that we would convert 732 MBOE. Because of the improvement in commodity prices and the change in our development plan for 2017, we actually incurred $8.5 million to convert 622 MBOE to developed. Our plan changed in that we developed more oil PUDs and elected not to participate in natural gas PUDs which included the above mentioned 443 MBOE associated with the Eagle Ford non-participation. The capital to develop our oil PUDs was higher on a per unit basis than the natural gas PUDs, however, the margins are higher for oil PUDs. The oil PUDs further benefited our longer-term operated development plans. Since the Bold Transaction closed in May 2017, the associated capital plan for the Bold properties was not considered in our year-end 2016 report. We did however incur $63.4 million to convert 2,134 MBOE of purchased PUD reserves to Developed. We intend to convert our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed producing reserves in accordance with our estimates as of the date of our year-end 2017 reserve report.
Extensions and discoveries. Additionally, 27,977 MBOE were added as extensions and discoveries due to successful drilling results on our acreage positions because of the wells we drilled. The increase was also supported by successful drilling results by other operators directly offsetting and in close proximity to our acreage. All of these drilling results increased the confidence of the reservoir continuity and performance of the associated reservoirs which increased the number of PUDs primarily in the Midland Basin.
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 391 MBOE during 2017 and were primarily related to the disposition of our Bakken properties, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchases of minerals in place. During 2017, 37,327 MBOE were added to PUD reserves upon the closing of the Bold Transaction.
Revision to previous estimates. Revisions of 4,832 MBOE were primarily due to (1) removal of approximately 2,011 MBOE of reserves due to delayed development plans of other operators in the Midland Basin that management previously expected to be developed within five years, (2) reduction of 2,378 MBOE upon the closing of the Bold Transaction and making adjustments to development plans and PUD reserve assignments, and (3) non-participation in three Eagle Ford natural gas PUDs that were expected to develop 443 MBOE. This non-participation has no impact on our ability to participate in future wells in this acreage position.
2016 Changes in PUD reserves
In early 2016, due primarily to depressed prices of oil and natural gas, we placed a lower emphasis on the conversion of our PUDs into proved developed producing reserves. In our plan to convert these reserves over a five-year period, we estimated that $3.1 million of capital expenditure would be incurred in 2016, and the bulk of capital expenditures would occur over the following four years. Our actual 2016 capital expenditures for conversion of proved undeveloped reserves were $3.2 million, in line with our estimates. We also had estimated that these capital expenditures would result in 258 MBOE of proved developed producing reserves. Our actual estimated conversions were 169 MBOE. The difference was due primarily to one less location being drilled than we had estimated and lower initial reserve estimates for wells in certain units where all wells in the units had not been developed. This resulted in lower reserve estimates until the remaining wells in the units are drilled.
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were significantly lower than as of December 31, 2015, due to lower oil and natural gas prices used in making our 2016 estimates.
Extensions and Discoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016, were from our operated Eagle Ford and non-operated Bakken properties.
2015 Changes in PUD reserves
All of our purchases of minerals in place reserves during the year ended December 31, 2015, occurred in our Eagle Ford property in Gonzales County, Texas.
Estimated Costs Related to Conversion of Proved Undeveloped Reserves to Proved Developed Reserves
The following table sets forth the estimated timing and cash flows of developing our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):
(1)
Beginning in 2018 and thereafter, the production and cash flows represent the drilling results from the respective year plus the incremental effects from the results of proved undeveloped drilling from previous years. These production volumes, inflows, expenses, development costs and cash flows are limited to the PUD reserves and do not include any production or cash flows from the Proved Developed category which will also help to fund our capital program.
(2)
Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
(3)
Computation is based on SEC pricing of (i) $48.91 per Bbl (WTI posted oil prices) and (ii) $2.53 per MMBtu (Henry Hub spot natural gas price), adjusted for location and quality by property.
Historically, our drilling programs have been substantially funded from our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility. Based on current commodity prices and our current expectations over the next five years of our cash flows and drilling programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped and unproven locations, we believe that we can continue to substantially fund our drilling activities from our cash flow and with borrowings under the EEH Credit Agreement. In addition, historically, we have been able to take advantage of the capital markets, as needed, when opportunities arose.
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
We engaged an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, CG&A, to prepare our annual reserve estimates and we have relied on CG&A’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC guidelines.
The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is Mr. W. Todd Brooker, President of CG&A. He graduated with honors from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum engineering. Mr. Brooker is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 83462) and has more than 25 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of oil and natural gas reserves. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Robert J. Anderson, our Executive Vice President responsible for reservoir engineering, is a qualified reserve estimator and auditor and is primarily responsible for overseeing CG&A during the preparation of our annual reserve estimates. His professional qualifications meet or exceed the qualifications of reserve estimators and auditors set forth in the “Standards Pertaining to Estimation and Auditing of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. His qualifications include a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Wyoming in 1986; a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Denver in 1988; member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1985; and more than 31 years of practical experience in estimating and evaluating reserve information with more than five of those years being in charge of estimating and evaluating reserves.
We maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which is updated, at least, annually, is assessed for validity when CG&A has technical meetings with our engineers, geologists, operations and land personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and our own set of internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting are assessed for effectiveness annually using criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, (2013 Version) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to our internal controls over financial reporting, and they are incorporated in our reserve database as well and verified internally by our personnel to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, CG&A meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to further verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to CG&A so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimates and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by CG&A are reviewed and compared to our internal estimates by our Executive Vice President responsible for reservoir engineering. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between CG&A and us, and additional data is provided to address the differences. If the supporting documentation will not justify additional changes, the CG&A reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, CG&A will analyze the additional data, and may make changes it solely deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled, the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by CG&A.
Net Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Production, Average Price and Average Production Cost
