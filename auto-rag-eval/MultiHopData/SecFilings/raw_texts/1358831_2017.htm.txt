ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2017, we owned interests in producing oil and natural gas properties in 606 fields in the Permian Basin, East Texas, Piceance Basin of Colorado, Texas Panhandle, Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and several other states, from 10,492 gross productive wells of which 3,497 are operated and 6,995 are non-operated. The following table sets forth information about our proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2017. The standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. For a definition of “standardized measure,” please see the glossary of terms at the beginning of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Our most significant fields and regions are Spraberry, East Texas, Lea and Piceance Basin. As of December 31, 2017, these four areas accounted for approximately 67% of our standardized measure and 73% of our total estimated proved reserves.
Spraberry Field. The Spraberry field is located in Andrews, Howard, Midland, Martin, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas. This Spraberry field summary includes wells in the War San field which produce from the same formations and in the same area as our Spraberry field wells. This field produces from Spraberry and Wolfcamp age formations from 5,000 to 11,000 feet. We operate 193 active wells (187 producing, 6 injecting) in this field with working interests ranging from 12.9% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 9.6% to 90.8%. We also own another 169 non-operated wells (165 producing, 4 injecting). As of December 31, 2017, our properties in the Spraberry field contained 19.2 MMBoe (76% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $289.9 million. The average net daily production from this field was 7,365 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 7.1 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
20 wells were drilled on our properties in the Spraberry field in 2017. We have identified six more proved undeveloped projects, four of which are horizontal Wolfcamp or horizontal Spraberry locations and the remainder are primarily 40-acre infill drilling locations, and three behind-pipe or proved developed non-producing recompletion projects in this field. We have also identified numerous unproved drilling locations in this field.
East Texas. Legacy's wells in the East Texas basin are primarily located in Freestone, Leon and Robertson Counties, Texas. The wells in our East Texas fields are produced from multiple fields and formations which primarily include the Bossier and Cotton Valley formations at depths of approximately 12,000 to 14,000 feet. Legacy operates 911 active wells (905 producing, 6 injecting) in East Texas with working interests ranging from 19.2% to 100% and net revenue interests ranging from 3.2% to 87.5%. We also own another 545 non-operated wells (527 producing, 18 injecting). As of December 31, 2017, our properties in East Texas contained 57.0 MMBoe of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $195.2 million. The average net daily production from this field was 12,128 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 12.9 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
Lea Field. The Lea field is located in Lea County, New Mexico. Our Lea field properties consist primarily of interests in the Lea Unit. The majority of the production from these properties is from the Bone Spring formation at depths of 9,500 feet to 11,500 feet. These properties also produce from the Morrow, Devonian, Delaware and Pennsylvania formations at depths ranging from 6,500 feet to 14,500 feet. We operate 36 wells (35 producing, 1 injecting) in the Lea Field with working interests ranging from 2.4% to 91.3% and net revenue interests ranging from 4.1% to 75.9%. As of December 31, 2017, our properties in the Lea Field contained 10.6 MMBoe (78% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $166.4 million. The average net daily production from this field was 4,205 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. The estimated reserve life (R/P) of the field is 6.9 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
10 wells were drilled on our properties in the Lea field in 2017. Our engineers have identified nine additional proved undeveloped horizontal Bone Spring drilling locations and two behind-pipe or proved developed non-producing recompletion projects in this field. We have also identified numerous unproved horizontal drilling locations in this field.
Piceance Basin. Legacy's wells in the Piceance Basin are located in Garfield County, Colorado in the Grand Valley, Parachute and Rulison fields. Most of the wells in these fields produce from the Williams Fork formation at depths of approximately 7,000 to 9,000 feet and some wells produce from the Wasatch formation at depths of 1,600 to 4,000 feet. Legacy's ownership in this basin is comprised of non-operated interests in 2,676 active wells acquired in 2014 (the "Piceance Acquisition"). As of December 31, 2017, our properties in the Piceance Basin contained 44.6 MMBoe (13% liquids) of net proved reserves with a standardized measure of $133.4 million. The average net daily production from this field was 11,464 Boe/d for the fourth quarter of 2017. The estimated reserve life (R/P) for this field is 10.7 years based on the annualized fourth quarter production rate.
Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth a summary of information related to our estimated net proved reserves as of the dates indicated based on reserve reports prepared by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. (“LaRoche”). The estimates of net proved reserves have not been filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency. Standardized measure amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
The following information represents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These reserve estimates have been prepared in compliance with the SEC rules and accounting standards using current costs and the average annual prices based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As a result of this methodology, we used an average WTI posted price of $47.79 per Bbl for oil and an average Platts' Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.98 per MMBtu to calculate our estimate of proved reserves as of December 31, 2017. Please see the table below.
____________________
(a)
Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with assumptions required by the FASB and the SEC (using current costs and the average annual prices based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general administrative expenses and debt service or to depletion, depreciation and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. For the purpose of calculating the standardized measure, the costs and prices are unescalated. Federal income taxes have not been deducted from future production revenues in the calculation of standardized measure as each partner is separately taxed on its share of Legacy's taxable income. In addition, Texas margin taxes and the federal income taxes associated with a corporate subsidiary have not been deducted from future production revenues in the calculation of the standardized measure as the impact of these taxes would not have a significant effect on the calculated standardized measure. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Investing Activities.” Oil and natural gas prices as of each date are based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month as posted by Plains Marketing L.P. and Platts Gas Daily for oil and natural gas, respectively, with these representative prices adjusted by property to arrive at the appropriate net sales price, which is held constant over the economic life of the property.
(b)
Oil and natural gas prices as of each date are based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month as posted by Plains Marketing L.P. and Platts Gas Daily for oil and natural gas, respectively, with these representative prices adjusted by property to arrive at the appropriate net sales price, which is held constant over the economic life of the property.
Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Please read “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business-Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.” Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by FASB pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
From time to time, we engage LaRoche to prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of properties that we are considering purchasing. Neither LaRoche nor any of its employees have any interest in those properties, and the compensation for these engagements is not contingent on their estimates of reserves and future net revenues for the subject properties. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid LaRoche approximately $314,186, $395,740 and $621,822, respectively, for such reserve and economic evaluations as well as its annual reserve report.
Internal Control Over Reserve Estimations
Legacy's proved reserves are estimated at the well or unit level and compiled for reporting purposes by Legacy's reservoir engineering staff, none of whom are members of Legacy's operating teams nor are they managed by members of Legacy's operating teams. Legacy maintains internal evaluations of its reserves in a secure engineering database. Legacy's reservoir engineering staff meets with LaRoche periodically throughout the year to discuss assumptions and methods used in the reserve estimation process. Legacy provides LaRoche information on all properties acquired during the year for addition to Legacy’s reserve report. LaRoche updates production data from public sources and then modifies production forecasts for all properties as necessary. Legacy provides to LaRoche lease operating statement data at the property level from Legacy’s accounting system for estimation of each property’s operating expenses, price differentials, gas shrinkage and NGL yield. Legacy's reserve engineering staff provides all changes to Legacy’s ownership interests in the properties to LaRoche for input into the reserve report. Legacy provides information on all capital projects completed during the year as well as changes in the expected timing of future capital projects. Legacy provides updated capital project cost estimates and abandonment cost and salvage value estimates. Legacy's internal engineering staff coordinates with Legacy's accounting and other departments and works closely with LaRoche to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to LaRoche for its reserve estimation process. All of the reserve information in Legacy's secure reserve engineering data base is provided to LaRoche. After evaluating and inputting all information provided by Legacy, LaRoche, as independent third-party petroleum engineers, provides Legacy with a preliminary reserve report which Legacy's engineering staff and its Chief Financial Officer review for accuracy and completeness with an emphasis on ownership interest, capital spending and timing, expense estimates and production curves. After considering comments provided by Legacy, LaRoche completes and publishes the final reserve report. Legacy's engineering staff, in coordination with Legacy's accounting department and its Chief Financial Officer, ensure that the information derived from LaRoche's reports is properly disclosed in our filings.
Legacy’s Corporate Planning Manager is the reservoir engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates by the third-party engineering firm, LaRoche. He has held a wide variety of technical and supervisory positions during a 40-year career with four publicly traded oil and natural gas producing companies, including Legacy. He has over 30 years of SEC reserve report preparation experience in addition to continuing education courses on reserve estimation and reporting, including one in 2009 covering the effect of the SEC’s Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. For the professional qualifications of the primary person responsible for the third-party reserve evaluation, please see the last paragraph of Exhibit 99.1 - Summary Reserve Report from LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth a summary of unaudited information with respect to our production and sales of oil and natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
____________________
(a)
Includes the production and operating results of the properties acquired as a part of our asset acquisition in conjunction with the Acceleration Payment from the closing date on August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.
(b)
Includes the production and operating results of the properties acquired as a part of our acquisition of both 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership interests in Dew Gathering LLC from WGR Operating LP and various oil and natural gas properties and associated exploration and production assets from Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC (collectively, the "Anadarko Acquisitions") from the closing date on July 31, 2015 through December 31, 2015.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2017 relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own an interest, and net wells are the product of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2017 relating to our leasehold acreage.
____________________
(a)
Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells or wells capable of production.
(b)
Undeveloped acres include acres held by production but not currently allocated or assigned to producing wells or wells capable of production and acres not held by production and subject to the primary term of the leases, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. The majority of our proved undeveloped locations are located on acreage currently held by production. As the economic viability of any potential oil and natural gas development related to the acres not held by production is remote, we have assigned minimal value to our acreage not held by production and thus the minimum remaining term of those leases is immaterial to us.
(c)
A gross acre is an acre in which we own a working interest. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which we own a working interest.
(d)
A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the product of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed by Legacy during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the numbers of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.
Summary of Development Projects
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $176.8 million in implementing our development strategy, including $101.0 million related to the drilling and completion of 42 gross (27.4 net) development wells. The remaining $75.8 million was comprised of the development of proved undeveloped reserves still in process, recompletions, fracture stimulation projects and various infrastructure capital. We estimate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2018 will be approximately $225 million for development drilling, recompletions and fracture stimulation and other development-related projects to implement this strategy. Over 90% of this capital is expected to be deployed in the Permian Basin while the balance is expected to be spread across East Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota and the East Binger field in Oklahoma. We will consider adjustments to this capital program based on our assessment of additional development opportunities that are identified during the year and the cash available to invest in our development projects.
Present Activities
As of December 31, 2017, we were in the process of drilling or completing 22 gross (14.1 net) wells, all of which were development wells. Further, 4 were classified as PUD within our year-end reserve report while 18 were classified as unproved and therefore not included in our year-end reserve report.
Operations
General
We operate approximately 62% of our total net daily production of oil and natural gas. Excluding our assets in the Piceance Basin, we operate approximately 84% of our net daily production of oil and natural gas. We design and manage the development, recompletion or workover for all of the wells we operate and supervise operation and maintenance activities. We do not own drilling rigs or any material oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties we operate. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ drilling, production and reservoir engineers, geologists and other specialists who have worked and will work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. We also employ field operating personnel including production superintendents, production foremen, production technicians and lease operators. We charge the non-operating partners an operating fee for operating the wells, typically on a fee per well-operated basis proportionate to each owner's working interest. Our non-operated wells are managed by third-party operators who are typically independent oil and natural gas companies.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. In our areas of operation, this amount generally ranges from 12.5% to 33.7%, resulting in an 87.5% to 66.3% net revenue interest to the working interest owners, including us. Most of our leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments.
Derivative Activity
We enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties with respect to oil and natural gas prices to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We have entered into derivative contracts in the form of fixed price swaps for NYMEX WTI oil, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas as well as Midland-to-Cushing crude oil basis differentials. We have also entered into multiple NYMEX WTI oil derivative three-way collar contracts and enhanced swap contracts, as well as NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas three-way collar contracts. We also enter into derivative transactions with respect to London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") interest rates to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates. All of our interest rate derivative transactions are LIBOR interest rate swaps. Our derivatives swap floating LIBOR rates for fixed rates. All of these commodity and interest rate contracts were executed in a costless manner, requiring no payment of premiums. Furthermore, none
of our current derivative counterparties require us to post collateral. For a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities, please read “Business-Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Activities,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cash Flow from Operations” and “-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title opinions have been obtained on a portion of our properties.
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this document.
