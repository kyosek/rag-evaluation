Item 2. Properties
Original lease terms for the majority of the investment properties were generally 5 - 20 years from their inception. All leases are triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating costs including maintenance, repairs, utilities, property taxes, and insurance. A majority of the leases contain percentage rent provisions, which require the tenant to pay a specified percentage (5% to 8%) of gross sales above a threshold amount.
The Partnership owned the following Properties as of December 31, 2009:
Footnotes:
(1) Purchase price includes all costs incurred to acquire the property.
(2) The tenant has two (5) year lease renewal options available.
(3) The tenant has one (5) year lease renewal option available.
(4) The tenant has five (2) year lease renewal options available.
(5) In December of 2009, the tenant notified Management of its intent to terminate its lease, which was set to expire on April 30, 2011, as of March 15, 2010. In January of 2010, Management and tenant agreed to a temporary rent modification for the first six months of 2010. Unless further rent negotiations are agreed upon by Management and the tenant, the expiration date of the lease will be effectively June 30, 2010. See Denny’s- Phoenix, AZ property paragraphs below for further information.
(6) Ownership of lessee’s interest under a ground lease. The tenant is responsible for payment of all rent obligations under the ground lease.
(7) Six (6) of the fifteen (15) properties owned as of December 31, 2009 were leased to Wendgusta, LLC (“Wendgusta”). Since more than 20% of the Partnership’s properties, both by asset value and number, are leased to a single tenant, the financial status of the tenant may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendgusta provided it with a copy of its reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008. Those reviewed financial statements are attached to this Annual Report 10-K as Exhibit 99.1.
(8) Three (3) of the fifteen (15) properties owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2009 were leased to Wendcharles I, LLC (“Wendcharles”). Since nearly 20% of the Partnership’s properties, both by asset value and number, are leased to a single tenant, the financial status of the tenant may be considered relevant to investors. Wendcharles was formed during 2008, and at the request of the Partnership, Wendcharles provided it with a copy of its reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2009 and the initial period June 24 to December 28, 2008. Those reviewed financial statements are attached to this Annual Report 10-K as Exhibit 99.2.
(9) The property is currently vacant. The lease on the property was terminated with former tenant, Popeye’s, during the Third Quarter of 2008.
The following summarizes significant developments, by property, for properties with such developments.
Panda Buffet Restaurant- Grand Forks, ND Property
A sales contract was executed on September 30, 2009 for the installment sale of the Panda Buffet restaurant property to the tenant for $520,000 (sales amount was to be reduced to $450,000 if closing occurred on or before November 15, 2009). The closing date on the sale of the property was November 12, 2009 at a sales price of $450,000. The buyer paid $150,000 at closing with the remaining balance of $300,000 being delivered in the form of a Promissory note (“Buyers Note”) to the Partnership. The Buyers Note reflects a term of three years, an interest rate of 7.25%, and principal and interest payments paid monthly and principal amortized over a period of ten years beginning December 1, 2009 with a balloon payment after year three. Pursuant to the Buyers Note, there will be no penalty for early payment of principal. A net gain on the sale of approximately $29,000 was recognized in the Fourth Quarter of 2009. Closing and other sale related costs amounted to approximately $21,000 and included a $13,500 sales commission paid to the General Partner. The Buyers Note also requires the buyer to escrow property taxes with the Partnership beginning January of 2010.
Per the amortization schedule, the monthly payments are to total approximately $3,522 per month. The first payment was received by the Partnership on November 30, 2009 and included approximately $2,374 in principal and $1,148 in interest.
Applebee’s- Columbus, OH Property
An Amendment and Extension of Lease (“Amendment”) was fully executed with the tenant on November 4, 2009. The Amendment, effective as of November 1, 2009, provides for an annual base rent of $135,996 and is set to expire on October 31, 2012. The Amendment also provides for five (5) options to renew the lease for an additional two (2) years (base rent will increase by 2% percent for each year of each option). The Amendment also increased the percentage rent sales breakpoint from $1,500,000 to $2,300,000 and decreased the additional percentage rent from 7% to 5%. A leasing commission of approximately $12,000 was paid to a General Partner affiliate in the Fourth Quarter of 2009 in relation to the Amendment.
Daytona’s All Sports Café- Des Moines, IA Property
The previous lease, with an annual base rent of $72,000, expired on February 28, 2009. In July of 2009, Management agreed to the terms of a twenty seven (27) month lease extension with Daytona’s All Sports Café (“Daytona’s”). The lease amendment, which was executed in early August of 2009, began, and was effective, as of March 1, 2009, provides for an annual base rent of $72,000 (less a potential $600 rent credit per month for both timely payment and sales reporting), and is set to expire on May 31, 2011. A commission of approximately $5,000 was paid to a General Partner affiliate in the Third Quarter upon the execution of the lease amendment. In accordance with the lease amendment, building improvements of approximately $17,000 were made to the property during the Fourth Quarter of 2009, which included $9,000 paid by the Partnership.
Beginning in December of 2005, Management requested that Daytona’s escrow its future property tax liabilities with the Partnership on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2009, Daytona’s was current on its monthly rent and property tax escrow obligations and escrow payments held by the Partnership totaled approximately $26,000.
Denny’s- Phoenix, Arizona Property
The former property lease, with an annual base rent of $72,000, expired on April 30, 2009. The tenant then paid month-to-month rent of $6,000 for May of 2009. A new twenty three (23) month lease was executed with the tenant, Denny’s #6423, LLC (“Denny’s), in June of 2009. The lease (which was effective as of June 1, 2009) provides for an annual base rent of $72,000 (less a potential $600 rent credit per month for both timely payment and sales reporting), and is set to expire on April 30, 2011. A commission of approximately $4,000 was paid to a General Partner affiliate in the Second Quarter of 2009 in relation to the lease. In December of 2009, due to recent sluggish sales figures, Denny’s notified Management of its intent to terminate the lease, pursuant to its lease rights, as of March 15, 2010. Responsive to the depressed Phoenix market, during January of 2010, Management and Denny’s agreed to a six month temporary modification to the lease retroactive to January 1, 2010. The tenant’s rent from January 2010 through June of 2010 will be strictly percentage rent at eight (8) percent of monthly sales over $50,000. Management is uncertain as to whether there will be rent modifications for the remaining six months of 2010 or whether the expiration date of the lease will be effectively June 30, 2010.
The Denny’s- Northern, Phoenix, AZ property was reclassified to a property held for sale in January of 2008, due to the execution of a listing agreement with an unaffiliated broker. A sales contract with an unaffiliated party was then executed in February of 2008. The sales contract, dated February 22, 2008, for the sale of the Denny’s- Phoenix, AZ property was terminated by the potential buyer in early May of 2008 due to financing difficulties. The $25,000 escrow deposit continued to be held with the title company until June of 2009, when both parties agreed to release the escrow deposit and to share the released funds equally between seller and buyer. Although the listing agreement had expired, Management continued to hold the property for sale at June 30, 2008, as other options for the sale of the property were being pursued. However, the property was reclassified to an investment property in September of 2008, as Management did not plan to actively pursue options for its sale.
Vacant Park Forest, IL Property
Popeye’s ceased its operations in June of 2008. The lease was terminated and the tenant vacated the property in July of 2008. As of June 30, 2008, the former defaulted tenant owed the Partnership approximately $19,000 and $14,000 in past due billings of monthly rent and property tax escrow, respectively. The Partnership received full payment of both of these items from Popeye’s in August of 2008 in accordance with the terms of the lease termination and settlement agreement.
The Partnership has been unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for the vacant Park Forest, IL property. The Partnership agreed to sell the property for $50,000 to a prospective purchaser. Negotiations ended due to uncertainty over 2008 real estate tax obligations due in 2009. The Partnership has no other interested parties for this vacant property in a distressed location. Accordingly, the carrying value of the
vacant Park Forest, IL property was reduced by $276,186 to its estimated fair market value of $50,000 at September 30, 2008. The reduction included $129,450 related to land and $137,736 related to buildings and improvements. During the Fourth Quarter of 2009, the land carrying value of the vacant Park Forest, IL property was reduced by $50,000 to an estimated fair market value of zero.
Property tax in Cook County, IL is paid in arrears (2009 tax will be paid in 2010) and is paid in two installments, one in the First Quarter and one in the Third or Fourth Quarter (depending upon the timing of tax rate determinations and property tax bill issuance by the County). The former tenant’s property tax escrow balance held with the Partnership as of September 30, 2008 met all but $1,300 of the second installment of 2007 property tax paid in November of 2008 for the Park Forest property. The minimal shortage was accrued and expensed by the Partnership as of September 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Partnership had accrued approximately $56,000 of estimated 2008 property tax related to the Park Forest property, which would be payable to the Cook County taxing authority in 2009. The first installment of 2008 property tax, totaling approximately $27,500, was paid in February of 2009. During the Third Quarter of 2009, Cook County responded to the Partnership’s appraisal appeal for Park Forest (due to the property’s vacancy) and lowered the property’s 2008 appraised value. At September 30, 2009, the remaining accrued 2008 property tax balance was decreased by $20,000 and at October 31, 2009 it was further decreased by $3,000 upon receipt of the actual tax statement. The 2008 second installment of approximately $5,500 was paid in November of 2009. Due to the lease termination and settlement, the 2008 property taxes paid in 2009 will not be collectible from the former tenant. Therefore, beginning with the property tax related to the 2008 tax year, property tax related to the vacant Park Forest property are the responsibility of the Partnership. As of December 31, 2009, the Partnership has accrued twelve months of estimated 2009 property tax totaling approximately $36,000 related to the Park Forest property, which the Partnership will be obligated to pay to the Cook County taxing authority in 2010. The first installment of 2009 property tax, totaling approximately $18,000 was paid in January of 2010.
Due to the vacancy of the Park Forest, IL property, the Partnership has assumed maintenance responsibility. Approximately $1,400 in maintenance expenditures were incurred by the Partnership during 2009 in relation to lawn and landscaping services.

Other Property Information
Property taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Partnership’s investment properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes vacant (such as the vacant Park Forest, IL property formerly operated as a Popeye’s Famous Fried Chicken restaurant), the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property and in a property vacancy the Partnership pays for maintenance related to the vacant property. Such taxes, insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Partnership owns one (1) restaurant, which is located on a parcel of land where it has entered into a long-term ground lease. The tenant, Kentucky Fried Chicken, is responsible for the $3,400 per month ground lease payment.
