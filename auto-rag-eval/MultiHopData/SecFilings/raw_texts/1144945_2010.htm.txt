Item 2 Properties
Title to Properties
The following map shows the general locations of our coal reserves and related infrastructure investments and our natural gas gathering and processing systems as of December 31, 2010:
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our properties and the associated coal reserves in accordance with standards generally accepted in the coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream industries.
Facilities
We currently lease our office space in Radnor, Pennsylvania, Dallas and Houston, Texas as well as Kingsport, Tennessee. We own the field office in Charleston, West Virginia. We believe that our properties are adequate for our current needs.
Coal Reserves and Production
As of December 31, 2010, we owned or controlled approximately 804 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves located in Illinois, Kentucky, New Mexico, Virginia and West Virginia. Our coal reserves are in various surface and underground mine seams located on the following properties:
•
Central Appalachia Basin : properties located in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia;
•
Northern Appalachia Basin : properties located in northern West Virginia;
•
Illinois Basin : properties located in southern Illinois and western Kentucky; and
•
San Juan Basin : properties located in the four corners area of New Mexico.
Coal reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal, economic and technical limitations. All of the estimates of our coal reserves are classified as proven and probable reserves. Proven and probable coal reserves are defined as follows:
Proven Coal Reserves. Proven coal reserves are reserves for which: (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely, and the geologic character is so well defined, that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.
Probable Coal Reserves. Probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and
measurement are more widely spaced or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven coal reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
In areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves, we perform additional exploration to ensure the continuity and mineability of the coal reserves. Consequently, sampling in those areas involves drill holes or channel samples that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above.
Coal reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production, unmineable areas, acquisitions and sales of coal in place. The majority of our coal reserves are high in energy content, low in sulfur and suitable for either the steam or to a lesser extent metallurgical market.
The amount of coal that a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from “proven and probable coal reserves.” Included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price, coal quality and operating costs.
Our lessees mine coal using both underground and surface methods. As of December 31, 2010, our lessees operated 28 surface mines and 39 underground mines. Approximately 46% of the coal produced from our properties in 2010 came from underground mines and 54% came from surface mines. Most of our lessees use the continuous mining method in their underground mines located on our properties. In continuous mining, main airways and transportation entries are developed and remote-controlled continuous miners extract coal from “rooms,” leaving “pillars” to support the roof. Shuttle cars transport coal to a conveyor belt for transportation to the surface. In several underground mines, our lessees use two continuous miners running at the same time, also known as a supersection, to improve productivity and reduce unit costs.
One of our lessees uses the longwall mining method at two different mines to mine underground reserves. Longwall mining uses hydraulic jacks or shields, varying from four feet to twelve feet in height, to support the roof of the mine while a mobile cutting shearer advances through the coal. Chain conveyors then move the coal to a standard deep mine conveyor belt system for delivery to the surface. Continuous mining is used to develop access to long rectangular panels of coal that are mined with longwall equipment, allowing controlled caving behind the advancing machinery. Longwall mining is typically highly productive when used for large blocks of medium to thick coal seams.
Surface mining methods used by our lessees include auger and highwall mining to enhance production, improve reserve recovery and reduce unit costs. On our San Juan Basin property, a combination of the dragline and truck-and-shovel surface mining methods is used to mine the coal. Dragline and truck-and-shovel mining uses large capacity machines to remove overburden to expose the coal seams. Wheel loaders then load the coal in haul trucks for transportation to a loading facility.
Our lessees’ customers are primarily electric utilities, also referred to as “steam” markets. Coal produced from our properties is transported by rail, barge and truck, or a combination of these means of transportation. Coal from the Virginia portion of the Wise property and the Buchanan property is primarily shipped to electric utilities in the Southeast by the Norfolk Southern railroad. Coal from the Kentucky portion of the Wise property is primarily shipped to electric utilities in the Southeast by the CSX railroad. Coal from the Coal River and Spruce Laurel properties in West Virginia is shipped to steam and metallurgical customers by the CSX railroad, by barge along the Kanawha River and by truck or by a combination thereof. Coal from the Northern Appalachia properties is shipped by barge on the Monongahela River, by truck and by the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads. Coal from the Illinois Basin properties is shipped by barge on the Green River and by truck. Coal from the San Juan Basin property is shipped to steam markets in New Mexico and Arizona by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad. All of our properties contain and have access to numerous roads and state or interstate highways.
The following tables set forth production data for the periods presented and reserve information with respect to each of our properties for the period presented (tons in millions):
Of the approximately 804 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves to which we had rights as of December 31, 2010, we owned the mineral interests and the related surface rights to 432 million tons, or 54%, and we owned only the mineral interests to 190 million tons, or 23%. We leased the mineral rights to the remaining 182 million tons, or 23%, from unaffiliated third parties and, in turn, subleased these reserves to our lessees. For the reserves we lease from third parties, we pay royalties to the owner based on the amount of coal produced from the leased reserves. Additionally, in some instances, we purchase surface rights or otherwise compensate surface right owners for mining activities on their properties. In 2010, our aggregate expenses to third-party surface and mineral owners were $7.7 million.
The following table sets forth the coal reserves we owned and leased with respect to each of our coal properties as of December 31, 2010 (tons in millions):
The following table sets forth our coal reserve activity for the periods presented and ended (tons in millions):
(1) See Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20. Subsequent Event” for a discussion of a recent purchase of coal reserves.
Our coal reserve estimates are prepared from geological data assembled and analyzed by our general partner’s or its affiliates’ geologists and engineers. These estimates are compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes, geophysical logs, adjacent mine workings, outcrop prospect openings and other sources. These estimates also take into account legal, qualitative, technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined. Coal reserve estimates will change from time to time due to mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geological data, acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings, modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors.
We classify low sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.0%, medium sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content between 1.0% and 1.5% and high sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 1.5%. Compliance coal is that portion of low sulfur coal that meets compliance standards for the CAA. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 24% of our reserves met compliance standards for the CAA and 36% were low sulfur. The following table sets forth our estimate of the sulfur content and the typical clean coal quality of our recoverable coal reserves for the period presented (tons in millions):
(1) Compliance coal is low sulfur coal which, when burned, emits less than 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTU. Compliance coal meets the sulfur dioxide emission standards imposed by Phase II of the CAA without blending in other coals or using sulfur dioxide reduction technologies. Compliance coal is a subset of low sulfur coal and is, therefore, also reported within the amounts for low sulfur coal.
(2) Includes compliance coal.
(3) As-received BTU per pound includes the weight of moisture in the coal on an as sold basis.

Other Natural Resource Management Assets
Coal Preparation and Loading Facilities
We generate coal services revenues from fees we charge to our lessees for the use of our coal preparation and loading facilities, which are located in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The facilities provide efficient methods to enhance lessee production levels and exploit our reserves.
Timber and Oil and Gas Royalty Interests
We own approximately 243,000 acres of forestland in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. The majority of our forestland is located on properties that also contain our coal reserves.
We own royalty interests in approximately 6.3 Bcfe of proved oil and gas reserves located in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.
Natural Gas Midstream Systems
Our natural gas midstream business derives revenues primarily from gas processing contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering natural gas volumes and providing other related services. We own, lease or have rights-of-way to the properties where the majority of our natural gas midstream facilities are located. We also own a natural gas marketing business, which aggregates third-party volumes and sells those volumes into intrastate pipeline systems and at market hubs accessed by various interstate pipelines.
We owned six natural gas processing facilities having 400 MMcfd of total capacity as of December 31, 2010. Our natural gas midstream operations currently include four natural gas gathering and processing systems and three stand-alone natural gas gathering systems, including: (i) the Panhandle gathering and processing facilities in the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle area; (ii) the Crossroads gathering and processing facilities in East Texas; (iii) the Crescent gathering and processing facilities in central Oklahoma; (iv) the Arkoma gathering system in eastern Oklahoma; (v) the North Texas gathering and pipeline facilities in the Fort Worth Basin; (vi) the Hamlin gathering and processing facilities in west-central Texas; (vii) the Marcellus gathering system located in northern Pennsylvania. These assets included approximately 4,263 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we own a 25% member interest in Thunder Creek, a joint venture that gathers and transports coalbed methane in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin. We also own a 50% member interest in Crosspoint, a joint venture that gathers residue gas from our Crossroads Plant and transports it to market.
Panhandle System
General. The Panhandle System is a natural gas gathering system stretching over ten counties in the Anadarko Basin of the panhandle of Texas and Oklahoma. The system consists of approximately 1,817 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, ranging in size from two to 16 inches in diameter, and the Beaver, Spearman and Sweetwater natural gas processing plants. Included in the system is an 11-mile, 10-inch diameter, FERC-jurisdictional residue line.
In July 2009, we completed an acquisition of a natural gas processing and residue pipeline facilities in western Oklahoma for approximately $22.6 million in cash. The acquired assets included a 60 MMcfd gas processing plant located near Sweetwater, Oklahoma (the “Sweetwater” plant). Additionally, we completed a 40 MMcfd processing plant expansion in our Spearman complex that was put into service on July 31, 2009. The acquired and expanded processing facilities increased our processing capacity in the Panhandle System to 260 MMcfd. The increased processing capacity has allowed us to process gas volumes that were previously being bypassed due to processing capacity constraints in the Panhandle System and has alleviated pipeline pressure-related volume constraints in the eastern portion of the Panhandle System.
The Panhandle System is comprised of a number of major gathering systems and 30 compressor stations that gather natural gas, directly or indirectly, to the Beaver, Spearman and Sweetwater plants. These include the Beaver, Perryton, Spearman, Wolf Creek/Kiowa Creek and Ellis systems. These gathering systems are located in Beaver, Ellis, Harper and Roger Mills Counties in Oklahoma and Hansford, Hemphill, Hutchinson, Lipscomb, Ochiltree, Roberts and Wheeler Counties in Texas.
The Beaver plant has 100 MMcfd of inlet gas capacity. The plant is capable of operating in high ethane recovery mode or in ethane rejection mode and has instrumentation allowing for unattended operation of up to 16 hours per day.
The Spearman plant has 100 MMcfd of inlet capacity. The plant is capable of operating in high ethane recovery mode or in ethane rejection mode and has instrumentation allowing for unattended operation of up to 16 hours per day.
The Sweetwater plant is capable of operating in high ethane recovery mode or in ethane rejection mode and has instrumentation allowing for unattended operation of up to 16 hours per day.
Natural Gas Supply and Markets for Sale of Natural Gas and NGLs. The residue gas from the Beaver plant can be delivered into the Northern Natural Gas, Southern Star Central Gas or ANR Pipeline Company pipelines for sale or transportation to market. The NGLs produced at the Beaver plant are delivered into ONEOK Hydrocarbon’s pipeline system for transportation to and fractionation at ONEOK’s Conway fractionator.
The residue gas from the Spearman plant is delivered into ONG, Natural Gas Pipeline and or ANR pipelines for sale or transportation to market. The NGLs produced at the Spearman plant are delivered into MAPCO’s (Mid-America Pipeline Company) pipeline system. MAPCO’s pipeline system has the flexibility of delivering the NGLs to either Mont Belvieu or Conway for fractionation.
The residue gas from the Sweetwater plant is delivered into Northern Natural Gas pipelines for sale or transportation to market. The NGLs produced at the Sweetwater plant are delivered into ONEOK Hydrocarbon’s pipeline system for transportation to and fractionation at ONEOK’s Conway fractionator.
Crossroads System
General. The Crossroads System is a natural gas gathering system located in east Texas. The Crossroads System consists of approximately eight miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, ranging in size from eight to twelve inches in diameter, and the Crossroads plant. The Crossroads System also includes approximately 20 miles of six-inch NGL pipeline that transports the NGLs produced at the Crossroads plant to the Panola Pipeline.
The Crossroads plant has 80 MMcfd of inlet capacity. The plant is capable of operating in high ethane recovery mode or in ethane rejection mode and has instrumentation allowing for unattended operation of up to 16 hours per day.

The Crossroads System delivers the residue gas from the Crossroads plant into the CenterPoint Energy pipeline for sale or transportation to market. The NGLs produced at the Crossroads plant are delivered into the Panola Pipeline for transportation to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation.
Crescent System
General. The Crescent System is a natural gas gathering system stretching over seven counties within central Oklahoma’s Sooner Trend. The system consists of approximately 1,705 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, ranging in size from two to 10 inches in diameter, and the Crescent natural gas processing plant located in Logan County, Oklahoma. Fourteen compressor stations are operating across the Crescent System.
The Crescent plant is a NGL recovery plant with current capacity of approximately 40 MMcfd. The Crescent facility also includes a gas engine-driven generator which is routinely operated, making the plant self-sufficient with respect to electric power. The cost of fuel (residue gas) for the generator is borne by the producers under the terms of their respective gas contracts.
Natural Gas Supply and Markets for Sale of Natural Gas and NGLs. The gas supply on the Crescent System is primarily gas associated with the production of oil or “casinghead gas” from the mature Sooner Trend. Wells in this region producing casinghead gas are generally characterized as low volume, long-lived producers of gas with large quantities of NGLs. The Crescent plant’s connection to the Enogex and ONEOK Gas Transportation pipelines for residue gas and the ONEOK Hydrocarbon pipeline for NGLs gives the Crescent System access to a variety of market outlets.
Hamlin System
General. The Hamlin System is a natural gas gathering system stretching over eight counties in West Central Texas. The system consists of approximately 517 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, ranging in size from two to 12 inches in diameter and with current capacity of approximately 20 MMcfd, and the Hamlin natural gas processing plant located in Fisher County, Texas. Eight compressor stations are operating across the system.
Natural Gas Supply and Markets for Sale of Natural Gas and NGLs. The gas on the Hamlin System is primarily gas associated with the production of oil or “casinghead gas.” The Hamlin System delivers the residue gas from the Hamlin plant into the Enbridge or Atmos pipelines. The NGLs produced at the Hamlin plant are delivered into TEPPCO’s pipeline system.
North Texas System
General. The North Texas assets are located in the southern portion of the Fort Worth Basin of North Texas and include approximately 136 miles of gas gathering pipelines and approximately 240,000 acres dedicated by active producers. This expands the geographic scope of the natural gas midstream segment into the Barnett Shale play in the Fort Worth Basin.
Natural Gas Supply. The gathering and transportation infrastructure captures current and expected volumes in Johnson, Hill, Bosque, Somervell, Hamilton and Erath counties.
Marcellus System
General. The Marcellus assets are located in Wyoming and Lycoming Counties in Pennsylvania. We have currently completed construction of three miles of 12-inch gas gathering pipelines in Wyoming County and began gathering natural gas in June 2010. Construction and development to provide gathering, compression and related services in Lycoming County continues and the first segment of the system began operations in February 2011.
Natural Gas Supply. The gathering and transportation infrastructure captures current and expected volumes in the Marcellus Shale area. The Marcellus System delivers the natural gas to local customers as well providing avenues for local producers to major pipeline systems such as Transco.
