Major Properties - ----------------
General - -------
This section describes the major operating properties in which the Company has an interest either directly or indirectly through joint venture arrangements. A "negative investment" in a joint venture results from distributions of capital to the Company, if any, exceeding the sum of (i) the Company's contributions of capital and (ii) reported earnings (losses) of the joint venture allocated to the Company. "Investment" in a joint venture means the book value of the Company's investment in the joint venture.
Wildwood Office Park - --------------------
Wildwood Office Park is a 285 acre Class A commercial development in suburban Atlanta master planned by I.M. Pei, including 8 office buildings containing 2,437,000 rentable square feet. The property is zoned for office, institutional and commercial use. Approximately 105 acres in the park are owned by, or committed to be contributed to, Wildwood Associates (see below), including approximately 34 acres of land held for future development. The Company owns 100% of the 146 acre balance of the land available for future development. Located in Atlanta's northwest commercial district, just north of the Interstate 285/Interstate 75 intersection, Wildwood features convenient access to all of Atlanta's major office, commercial and residential districts. The Wildwood complex overlooks the Chattahoochee River and borders 1,200 acres of national forest, thus providing an urban office facility in a forest setting. Wildwood Associates. Wildwood Associates is a joint venture formed in 1985 between the Company and IBM. The Company and IBM each have a 50% interest in Wildwood Associates. At December 31, 1998, the Company's investment in Wildwood Associates and a related partnership, which included the cost of the land the Company is committed to contribute to Wildwood Associates, was reduced to a negative investment of approximately $36,364,000 due to partnership distributions in excess of net income made during 1998 and prior years. Wildwood Associates owns the 3200 Windy Hill Road Building (685,000 rentable square feet), the 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (634,000 rentable square feet), the 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway Building (314,000 rentable square feet), the 4100 and 4300 Wildwood Parkway Buildings (250,000 rentable square feet in total) and the 4200 Wildwood Parkway Building (260,000 rentable square feet). At March 15, 1999, these buildings were 91%, 100%, 95%, 100% and 100% leased, respectively. Wildwood Associates also owns 14 acres leased to two banking facilities and five restaurants. On June 30, 1998, Wildwood Associates completed the $44 million financing of the 4200 Wildwood Parkway Building (see Note 4). In conjunction with this financing, Wildwood Associates made non-operating cash distributions of approximately $22.6 million to each partner during 1998. Wildwood Associates has a $10 million bank line of credit(the Company severally guarantees one-half) under which $0 was drawn as of December 31, 1998. Other Buildings in Wildwood Office Park. Wildwood Office Park also contains the 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building, a 106,000 rentable square foot office building located on approximately 10 acres which is wholly owned by the Company. The 3301 Windy Ridge Parkway Building was 100% leased as of March 15, 1999. In addition, the 3100 Windy Hill Road Building, a 188,000 rentable square foot corporate training facility occupies a 13-acre parcel of land which is wholly owned by the Company. The training facility improvements were sold in 1983 to a limited partnership of private investors, at which time the Company received a leasehold mortgage note. The training facility land was simultaneously leased to the partnership for thirty years, along with certain equipment for varying periods. The training facility had been leased by the partnership to IBM through November 30, 1998. Effective January 1, 1997, the IBM lease was extended eight years beyond its previous expiration, to November 30, 2006. Based on the economics of the lease, the Company will receive substantially all of the economic risks and rewards from the property through the term of the IBM lease. In addition, the Company will receive substantially all of the future economic risks and rewards from the property beyond the IBM lease because of the short term remaining on the land lease (7 years) and the large mortgage note balance ($25.9 million) that would have to be paid off, with interest, in that 7 year period before the limited partnership would receive any significant benefit. Therefore, effective January 1, 1997, the $17,005,000 balance of the mortgage note and land was reclassified to Operating Properties, and revenues and expenses (including depreciation) from that point forward have been recorded as if the building were owned by the Company.

(2%), owns a 20% interest in the partnership that owns One Ninety One Peachtree Tower. C-H Associates' 20% ownership of One Ninety One Peachtree Tower results in an effective 9.8% ownership interest by CREC, subject to a preference in favor of the majority partner, in the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project. The balance of the One Ninety One Peachtree Tower project was owned by DIHC Peachtree Associates, which was an affiliate of Dutch Institutional Holding Company, but was acquired by Cornerstone Properties, Inc. in October 1997.

The partnership acquired the property in 1991 for a nominal cash investment, subject to a ten-year purchase money note. This 8% purchase money note had an outstanding balance of $18.4 million at December 31, 1998. If the purchase money note is paid in accordance with its terms, it will amortize to approximately $15.3 million ($59 per rentable square foot) over the ten-year term of the Coca-Cola lease, at which time Coca-Cola is entitled to receive the preferred return described below, and the property may be sold, released, or returned to the lender under the purchase money note for $1.00 without penalty or any further liability to the Company for the indebtedness. At December 31, 1998, the Company had an investment in Ten Peachtree Place Associates of approximately $104,000. The Company anticipates that Ten Peachtree Place Associates will generate approximately $400,000 per year of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization during the ten-year lease. The partnership agreement generally provides that each of the partners is entitled to receive 50% of cash flows from operating activities net of note principal amortization (excluding any sale proceeds) for ten years, after which time the Company is entitled to 15% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds) and its partner is entitled to receive 85% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds), until the two partners have received a combined distribution of $15.3 million, after which time each partner is entitled to receive 50% of cash flows (including any sale proceeds).
