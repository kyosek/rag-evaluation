ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST'S PROPERTIES
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Trust's properties (excluding property in receivership at El Portal) as of and for the year ended December 31, 1996:
- ---------------------- (1) Lucky Stores owns its store at Monterey Plaza Shopping Center and, therefore, is not a tenant of the Trust. Even though the Trust does not benefit directly from the economic performance of this anchor store, the anchor is nonetheless critical to the success of the shopping center.
(2) The aggregate gross leasable area does not include approximately 51,000 square feet at Monterey Plaza Shopping Center. This represents the store owned by Lucky Stores.
(3) Annual minimum rent excludes (a) percentage rents, (b) additional rent payable by tenants such as common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other expense reimbursements, and (c) future contractual rent escalations or Consumer Price Index adjustments. Percentage rents are paid over and above base rents, and are calculated as a percentage of a tenant's gross sales above a predetermined threshold. The amount of percentage rents received to date by the Trust has not been material to the Trust's operations. Figures for total annual minimum rent in the above table have been calculated based on rental payments for the calendar year 1996, and have been adjusted for the effects of recognizing rent on a straight-line basis as reported in the Trust's financial statements.
(4) WalMart has assumed the HomeBase lease and was currently paying a minimum rent at December 31, 1996. HomeBase also paid a partial rent until WalMart opened for business on January 29, 1997.
(5) Title to the Wanlass Shopping Center is a leasehold estate based on a ground lease which expires in 2045. The lease contains an option to purchase for the benefit of the Trust, as well as a put option requiring the Trust to purchase the property freehold upon the death of one of the ground lessors or at any time after May 25, 1998. The property is proposed for redevelopment.
KING'S COURT SHOPPING CENTER. This neighborhood shopping center is located in the town of Los Gatos, California. The center is anchored by Lunardi's Supermarket, a local supermarket chain, and an array of retail and service tenants such as Hallmark Cards, Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of America. King's Court Shopping Center has 78,576 square feet of gross leasable space. The Trust presently owns a 40% interest in Kingsco, the general partnership which owns this shopping center. In addition, the Trust manages King's Court Shopping Center and has control over the shopping center's operations, including any leasing, renovation, sale and financing activities.
Kingsco owns a leasehold estate as to the land and fee title as to the improvements (excluding a gas station). The ground lease has only 27 years left in a 50-year term, expiring in 2024, and requiring minimum annual lease rental payments of $40,000 plus between 10% and 12% of the property's gross rental revenue in excess of $333,333 per annum. The Trust is presently negotiating with the ground lessors to extend the ground lease, however there can be no assurance that these negotiations will succeed on economically acceptable terms. The carrying cost of the center, which includes the other partners' interest in the property, was $5,784,000 after depreciation at December 31, 1996. The property is security for a first mortgage loan with an interest rate of prime +1.75%. At December 31, 1996 the rate was 10.25% and the outstanding balance was $1,307,000.
At December 31, 1996, King's Court Shopping Center was 93% leased. Tenants occupying 10% or more of the rentable space as of December 31, 1996 are:
(1) Additional percentage rents paid by Lunardi's Supermarket were $156,000 in 1996, $140,000 in 1995, and $99,000 in 1994.
The Trust has discovered toxic pollution of the ground water under King's Court Shopping Center. See "Governmental Regulation--Environmental Matters" for discussion of this circumstance.
MONTEREY PLAZA SHOPPING CENTER. This community shopping center is located in San Jose, California. The Trust began the development of this shopping center in 1987, and completed development in 1990. The center has 233,000 square feet of retail space, of which the Trust owns 183,180 square feet, or all but the Lucky Store. In addition to the Lucky Store anchor, other retailers include WalMart, Walgreen, McDonald's, Lyon's Restaurant and Taco Bell.
Negotiations amongst the Trust, HomeBase and WalMart concerning the terms of WalMart's assumption of the HomeBase lease required that the base rents for the premises be reduced substantially from the contact rents required under the HomeBase lease. Also WalMart's merchandising practices demanded modifications to Walgreen's lease in respect of pharmaceutical, health and beauty product sales. As a result Walgreen's lease was amended to relieve Walgreen's of reimbursements of property taxes, to pay Walgreen up to one million dollars for release of its exclusive rights and to permit Walgreen to terminate its lease upon its sole discretion prior to maturity. Under the terms of the lease assumption HomeBase and the Trust each made certain financial contributions towards the remodel costs for the premises to accommodate WalMart.
The Trust is in a dispute with WalMart concerning alleged deficiencies in the tenant's premises at Monterey Plaza. The sum in question is approximately $136,000 and represents roof and skylight repairs and upgrades. The Trust has declined to accept responsibility for these items and is contesting WalMart's claim of Landlord responsibilities. Trust management does not expect the ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Trust.
Monterey Plaza is security for a first mortgage loan with an interest rate of 9.720%. At December 31, 1996, the outstanding balance was $18,412,000. This loan matures on February 7, 2000. At December 31, 1996 the Trust's investment in Monterey Plaza Shopping Center was $25,236,000 after accumulated depreciation.
At December 31, 1996, Monterey Plaza Shopping Center was 95% leased. Tenants leasing 10% or more of the rentable space as of December 31, 1996 are:
WANLASS SHOPPING CENTER. Wanlass Shopping Center is a strip shopping center located in San Pablo, California. The property has a total of 36,135 square feet of gross leasable area. Located adjacent to the Trust's El Portal Shopping Center and fronting onto San Pablo Avenue, it was acquired as a leasehold investment by the Trust in 1995 in connection with the plan to redevelop El Portal Shopping Center. However the property is able to stand alone as a retail investment, once certain physical improvements are made and retail tenants installed. If capital is available, the Trust expects to undertake these improvements for certain retail tenants on a build-to-suit basis. The property is a fee title as to the improvement and a leasehold estate as to the land under
a ground lease which expires in 2045 with annual ground rent of $192,000. There is currently no Trust indebtedness or financing secured by the leasehold. The anchor tenant is Mechanics Bank.
The percentage of the center that is both leased and occupied at December 31, 1996 was 28%. Tenants leasing 10% or more of the rentable space as of December 31, 1996 are:
EL PORTAL SHOPPING CENTER. El Portal Shopping Center is a community shopping center located in the city of San Pablo, California. The center was acquired by the Trust in 1976, and repositioned and expanded in 1978 and 1986, respectively. The center has a total of 271,426 square feet of gross leasable area. From 1976 to 1995 El Portal was an important source of cash flow to the Trust. Between 1994 through 1996 El Portal suffered a complete reversal arising from the loss or closure of all of its anchor tenants. The resultant cash drain from the property prompted the Trust to suspend making any further mortgage payments to the Trust Deed Non-Recourse Note holder, Nationwide Life Insurance Company. The lender accordingly sought to place the property in receivership as a prerequisite to obtaining fee title to the property. This step was also prompted by the discovery in 1995 of a toxic spill emanating from a former dry cleaner tenant. This spill probably occurred prior to the Trust's acquisition of the property. The property was officially confirmed into permanent receivership in January 1997. The Trust expects that there is no residual equity for the Trust in the El Portal Shopping Center.
VESTING OF TITLE TO PROPERTIES
Monterey Plaza and El Portal are owned in fee title, King's Court Shopping Center and a parcel of land under the Wanlass Shopping Center fee title to the properties is owned by the Trust. For King's Court Shopping Center, the Trust acquired a 40% controlling interest in the general partnership which owns a leasehold estate as to the land and fee title as to the improvements (excluding a gas station). The ground lease term expires in 2024. In San Pablo the Trust leases a 2.513-acre parcel of land adjacent to the El Portal Shopping Center and fronting onto San Pablo Avenue (the Wanlass property). The ground lease expires in 2045 and contains a sell/put option to purchase upon either the death of one of the ground lessors or on or after March 1, 1998.
PROPERTY CONDITION
All of the buildings are suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they were designed, are being used for those purposes, where leased and occupied, and are in a good state of repair with the exception of El Portal Shopping Center, which is in receivership, and the Wanlass Shopping Center, which is a redevelopment property. However, due to changes in retail industry practice, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that tenant improvements for new and replacement tenants have escalated in cost significantly in excess of the rate of inflation and have tended to increase capitalization in Trust properties to a material extent. This trend is partially a consequence of the growing competitiveness of the rental marketplace in which the Trust's properties operate.
Routine ongoing requirements of building upkeep and tenant replacements will necessitate capital expenditures during the future. The precise extent of such expenditures cannot yet be determined.
PROPERTY SALES
On February 29, 1996, the Trust sold Menlo Center for a sales price of $16,200,000. The existing financing was assumed by the buyer. After provision for closing costs, transfer fees and real estate commissions, the proceeds of this sale were all used to pay down other short-term Trust indebtedness and to provide working
capital for the Trust. The Trust remains liable to the buyer for an annual net income subsidy for the remaining term of the First Deed of Trust financing which matures in 2000.
PRINCIPAL TENANTS
WalMart Stores, Inc. ("WalMart") is the Trust's largest tenant. WalMart is a national discount retailer chain, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and, as of December 31, 1996, has credit rating of AA1 determined by Moody's and Standard and Poor's. In August 1996, WalMart assumed the HomeBase lease after significant modifications including rental reductions as well as concomitant economic rental concessions from Walgreen.
Other significant tenants at the Trust's properties include Walgreen, Lunardi's Supermarkets and Wells Fargo Bank, which lease properties representing approximately 17% of the Trust's gross leasable area and 18% of its base rental revenues.
Information with respect to the Trust's five largest tenants as of December 31, 1996 is set forth in the following table:

LEASE EXPIRATIONS
The following table shows lease expirations for the next ten years for existing tenants at the Trust's properties as of December 31, 1996, assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
LEASES
The majority of the anchor leases on the Trust's retail properties provide for initial lease terms of between ten and twenty years, and the leases on the Trust's smaller shop spaces typically provide for lease terms of between three and five years. The Trust typically seeks to structure the leases on its properties as "triple net" leases that impose on the tenant pro rata obligations for real property taxes and assessments, repairs and maintenance of common areas and insurance. Through the use of triple net leases, the Trust seeks to reduce its exposure to escalating operational costs and risks and the demands upon managerial time typically associated with investments in real estate. In this way, triple net leases provide opportunities for income growth from contractual rent increases without corresponding increases in operational costs. However, the Trust has agreed in certain instances to retain or limit the responsibility for some obligations that would otherwise be the responsibility of the tenant under a triple net lease.
OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS
As of December 31, 1996, the combined total indebtedness of the Trust was approximately $33,400,000, consisting entirely of fixed rate debt except for $1,307,000 of floating rate debt. Aggregate indebtedness included $25,700,000 in long-term mortgage loans with maturity dates ranging from 1999 to 2000 and $7,700,000 in short-term notes payable with maturity dates in 1997. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Trust's mortgage loans:
- ------------------- (1) Assumes no prepayments of principal prior to due dates thereof. The mortgage loan with respect to Monterey Plaza Shopping Center permits prepayment, but with substantial prepayment penalties.
(2) This property is in receivership.
(3) This mortgage loan bears interest at prime +1.75%, figure given is as of December 31, 1996.
(4) This property is no longer owned by the Trust, but the Trust remains the primary obligor on the underlying mortgage and ground lease. See "Mortgage Notes Relating to Property Sales" below.
The following table shows the scheduled maturity of the Trust's long-term mortgage loans over the next five years:
PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL YEAR MATURING INDEBTEDNESS - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1997 $4,743,000 18.46% 1998 332,000 1.29% 1999 2,782,000 10.82% 2000 17,843,000 69.43% 2001 000 0.00% ------------- ------ Total, December 31, 1996 $ 25,700,000 100.00% ------------- ------ ------------- ------
The 1997 amount shown in above includes a $4,438,000 loan secured by the property in receivership at El Portal Shopping Center (see note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein).
MORTGAGE NOTES RELATING TO PROPERTY SALES
As part of its strategy to focus on metropolitan "in-fill" locations as opposed to more rural locations, the Trust sold two properties, one each in 1988 and 1990. In connection with such sales, the Trust accepted seller financing:
(i) WESTWOOD VILLAGE SHOPPING CENTER. In December 1988, the Trust sold the Westwood Village Shopping Center for $6,475,000, payable in cash of $1,100,000 and a $5,375,000 seller carry-back note receivable due in seven years with interest only payments at a rate of 9%. In March 1990, the purchaser obtained a $4,100,000 loan secured by a first mortgage on this shopping center to pay down the Trust's note. The remaining amount owed to the Trust is subordinate to this new loan. The principal balance owed to the Trust on December 31, 1996 was $1,104,000 and payments are current. This loan was to mature in December 1995, but has been successively extended and now matures December 1997. The shopping center income is sufficient to cover the payments on this Note. However, there is considerable chronic high level of vacancy at Westwood Village due to overbuilding of retail facilities in the Redding area. This has put downward pressure on rents and property values. The Trust feels that this Note may ultimately be only partially collectible and its book carrying value has been reduced to $600,000 at December 31, 1996.
(II) MT. SHASTA SHOPPING CENTER. In August 1990, the Trust sold the Mt. Shasta Shopping Center for $5,100,000, payable in cash of $900,000 and a $4,200,000 all-inclusive promissory note and second deed of trust due January 1, 1999 (the "Mt. Shasta Note"). The Mt. Shasta Note bears interest 9.25%. Because the interest rate was less than the market rate during the initial period, the Mt. Shasta Note was discounted by $303,000 which is being recognized as additional interest income over the term of the Mt. Shasta Note. The Mt. Shasta Note requires interest only payments until it matures on January 1, 1999. The Trust continues to be the primary obligor on the underlying first mortgage note, the principal balance of which at December 31, 1996 was $1,543,000. Payments on the Mt. Shasta note are current. The current owner of Mt. Shasta Shopping Center expects to refinance the property and thereby repay the Trust's remaining loan balance. There is no assurance, however, that this refinancing can be accomplished.
PROPERTY IN RECEIVERSHIP
On October 24, 1996, El Portal Shopping Center, located in San Pablo, California was placed in receivership by the Superior Court of the State of California. The receiver is an unrelated entity selected by Nationwide Life Insurance Company, the holder of a non-recourse first mortgage on the property, and the Superior Court. The Trust's decision to withhold further mortgage payment obligations to the holder of the first mortgage was a result of the property's continued negative cash flow resulting from recurring losses and required capital expenditures. At the time of the receivership, El Portal's first mortgage loan balance was $4,438,000. The Trust remains liable for environmental matters, including a toxic spill from a former dry cleaning establishment at El Portal Shopping Center. See discussion in Government Regulation-Environmental Matters. Loss on disposition of $987,000 was recorded in 1996.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
The Trust entered into a purchase and sale agreement in 1993 (the "1993 Agreement") and three additional purchase and sale agreements in 1994 (the "1994 Agreements") to purchase a total of four shopping centers.
In 1994 the Trust assigned its interest in the 1993 Agreement and the 1994 Agreements to another real estate investment trust for the sum of $2,361,000, adjusted for certain closing costs and prorations. The Trust also guaranteed the payment of certain rentals at the properties to the buyer for a 24-month period.
During 1994, the Trust recorded a gain of $994,000 net of a rent guarantee reserve accrual of $390,000, as the result the above transaction. In 1995, the Trust increased the reserve by an additional $213,000,
In connection with the above transactions, on June 7, 1994, (i) Scotts Valley Plaza, a California limited partnership ("Scott"), granted to the Trust a one-year option to acquire the shopping center commonly known as Scotts Village Plaza and (ii) Scotts Village Phase II, a California limited partnership ("Scotts II"), granted a one-year option to the Trust to purchase Scotts Valley Square, both of which are located in Scotts Valley, California. Concurrently with the grant of these options and in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Assignment and Agreement dated May 9 1994 and amended May 25, 1994, executed by and between Pacific Real Estate Investment Trust and Western Investment Real Estate Trust, the Trust made a loan to Malcolm R. Riley, one of the principals in Scotts and Scotts II, in the amount of $750,000. The loan bears interest at 9% per annum, payable monthly, and the principal is due and payable in 6 years. Simultaneously, the Trust made a loan to Russell R. Pratt, in the amount of $500,000. That loan bears interest at 8% per annum, payable monthly, and the principal is due and payable in 6 years. Each of these loans is secured by the borrower's respective partnership interests in Scotts and Scotts II. The Trust also made a loan in the amount of $75,000 to Scotts, which bears interest at 8.6% per annum (payable monthly), is due in 6 years and is secured by a second deed of trust on Scotts Village Plaza. Payment on these notes are current.
