HOTEL FINANCINGS
On December 18, 2013: (i) Justice Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Operating”), entered into a loan agreement (“Mortgage Loan Agreement”) with Bank of America (“Mortgage Lender”); and (ii) Justice Mezzanine Company, a Delaware limited liability company (“Mezzanine”), entered into a mezzanine loan agreement (“Mezzanine Loan Agreement” and, together with the Mortgage Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”) with ISBI San Francisco Mezz Lender LLC (“Mezzanine Lender” and, together with Mortgage Lender, the “Lenders”). The Partnership is the sole member of Mezzanine, and Mezzanine is the sole member of Operating.
The Loan Agreements provide for a $97,000,000 Mortgage Loan and a $20,000,000 Mezzanine Loan. The proceeds of the Loan Agreements were used to fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and the pay-off of the prior mortgage.
The Mortgage Loan is secured by the Partnership’s principal asset, the Hotel. The Mortgage Loan bears an interest rate of 5.275% per annum and matures in January 2024. The term of the loan is 10 years with interest only due in the first three years and principal and interest payments to be made during the remaining seven years of the loan based on a thirty year amortization schedule. The Mortgage Loan also requires payments for impounds related to property tax, insurance and capital improvement reserves. As additional security for the Mortgage Loan, there is a limited guaranty (“Mortgage Guaranty”) executed by the Company in favor of Mortgage Lender.
The Mezzanine Loan is a secured by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan. The Mezzanine Loan bears interest at 9.75% per annum and matures on January 1, 2024. Interest only payments are due monthly. As additional security for the Mezzanine Loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by the Company in favor of Mezzanine Lender (the “Mezzanine Guaranty” and, together with the Mortgage Guaranty, the “Guaranties”).
The Guaranties are limited to what are commonly referred to as “bad boy” acts, including: (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentations; (ii) gross negligence or willful misconduct; (iii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, security deposits, insurance or condemnation proceeds; and (iv) failure to pay taxes or insurance. The Guaranties are full recourse guaranties under identified circumstances, including failure to maintain “single purpose” status which is a factor in a consolidation of Operating or Mezzanine in a bankruptcy of another person, transfer or encumbrance of the Property in violation of the applicable loan documents, Operating or Mezzanine incurring debts that are not permitted, and the Property becoming subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Guaranties, the Partnership is required to maintain a certain minimum net worth and liquidity. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership is in compliance with both requirements.
Each of the Loan Agreements contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, reporting requirements, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which impose restrictions on, among other things, organizational changes of the respective borrower, operations of the Property, agreements with affiliates and third parties. Each of the Loan Agreements also provides for mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances (including casualty or condemnation events) and voluntary prepayments, subject to satisfaction of prescribed conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements.
On July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from the Intergroup Corporation (a related party) an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $4,250,000 at 12% per year fixed interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only each month. Intergroup received a 3% loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The proceeds of the loan were applied to the July 2014 payments to Holdings described in Note 2. The loan was extended to September 30, 2016. InterGroup is currently working on amending the loan agreement to extend the loan for a longer period. The loan is eliminated in consolidation.
