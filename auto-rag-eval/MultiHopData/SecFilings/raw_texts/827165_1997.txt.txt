Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a substantial portion of the Company's assets have been and are expected to continue to be invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally those secured by income-producing real estate. The Company's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound, and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. In addition to originating its own mortgage loans, the Company may acquire existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services the Company's mortgage notes receivable.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1997 consisted of office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping centers, single-family residences, hotels and developed land. The Company's Board of Directors may alter the types of properties subject to mortgages in which the Company invests without a vote of the Company's stockholders.

The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage note balance at December 31, 1997), by both property type and geographic region, of the properties that serve as collateral for the Company's mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 1997. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for additional details of the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the Company's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1997 is as follows:
- ---------------- * Includes a mortgage note receivable collateralized by three condominium mortgage loans in 1996 and two condominium mortgage loans in 1997.
During 1997, the Company collected $2.6 million in interest and $4.5 million in principal on its mortgage notes receivable and sold two mortgage notes receivable for $17.0 million. The Company plans, for the foreseeable future, to hold, to the extent its liquidity permits, rather than sell in the secondary market, the remainder of the mortgage notes in its portfolio.
First Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in first mortgage loans, with either short-, medium- or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate or negative amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is the Company's general policy to require that the borrower provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. The Company may grant to other lenders participations in first mortgage loans originated by the Company.

The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1997.
The borrower on a $1.7 million mortgage note receivable secured by land in Osceola, Florida, failed to pay the note on its November 1, 1993 maturity. The Company instituted foreclosure proceedings and was awarded summary judgment in January 1994. During 1994 and 1995, the borrower paid the Company a total of $270,000 in nonrefundable fees to delay foreclosure of the property until April 24, 1995. On April 21, 1995, the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. On August 24, 1996, the bankruptcy court's stay was lifted allowing the Company to proceed with foreclosure. The note had a principal balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 1996. On February 21, 1997, the Company sold its note for $1.8 million in cash. The Company recognized a gain of $171,000 on the sale.
Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in wraparound mortgage loans, sometimes called all-inclusive loans, made on real estate subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound mortgage note is a mortgage note having an original principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the prior existing mortgage loan plus the amount actually advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan.
Wraparound mortgage loans may provide for full, partial or no amortization of principal. The Company's policy is to make wraparound mortgage loans in amounts and on properties as to which it would otherwise make a first mortgage loan.
The following discussion briefly describes the wraparound mortgage loans funded during 1997 and the events that affected previously funded wraparound mortgage loans during 1997.
In August 1990, the Company obtained the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, through foreclosure subject to first and second lien mortgages totaling $10.0 million. In June 1992, the Company sold the hotel and casino for, among other consideration, a $22.0 million wraparound mortgage note receivable. In March 1997, the wraparound note was modified and extended in exchange for, among other things, the borrower's commitment to invest $2.0 million in improvements to the hotel and casino within four months of the March 1997, modification and an additional $2.0 million prior to December 1997. The borrower also pledged 1,500,000 shares of common stock in Crowne Ventures, Inc., as additional collateral. The borrower has not made the required note payments since April 1997, nor the required improvements. In December 1997, the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection. In February 1998, a hearing was held to allow the Company to foreclose on the hotel and casino. At the hearing, the court allowed the borrower 90 days to submit a reorganization plan and beginning March 2, 1998 required the borrower to make monthly payments of $175,000 to the Company. The Company received the first such payment on March 2, 1998. If the
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Mortgage Loans (Continued)
Company is allowed to foreclose on the property it does not expect to incur a loss as the fair value of the property exceeds the carrying value of the Company's note receivable.
In September 1997, the Company sold its $16.3 million wraparound mortgage note receivable secured by the Las Vegas Plaza Shopping Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, for $15.0 million. The Company received net cash of $5.5 million after the payoff of $9.2 million in underlying debt and the payment of various closing costs associated with the sale. The Company incurred no loss on the sale in excess of the reserve previously established.
In December 1997, the Company sold the Pin Oak land, in conjunction with the sale, as more fully described under "Real Estate," above. The Company provided $6.9 million in short term purchase money financing. The note bore interest at 2% of the unpaid purchase price and matured in January 1998. The note was paid in full at maturity.
Junior Mortgage Loans. The Company may invest in junior mortgage loans. Such notes are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such notes ordinarily includes the real estate which secures the note, other collateral and personal guarantees of the borrower.
The following discussion briefly describes the junior mortgage loans funded during 1997 and the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage notes during 1997.
At December 31, 1996, the Company held a junior mortgage note receivable secured by the Williamsburg Hospitality House in Williamsburg, Virginia, that is subject to a first mortgage of $12.0 million. The Company's junior mortgage had matured April 1, 1996. In September 1997, the Company foreclosed on its $8.9 million junior mortgage. The Company obtained the property through foreclosure subject to the first mortgage of $12.0 million. The Company incurred no loss on foreclosure as the fair value of the property exceeded the carrying value of the Company's mortgage note receivable and assumed mortgage debt. The property is included in real estate held for investment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In May 1997, the $3.7 million note receivable secured by an apartment complex in Merrillville, Indiana, owned by a subsidiary of Davister Corp., a general partner in a partnership that owns approximately 15.6% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock, was paid in full. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS."
In December 1997, the Company sold 25.1 acres of Valley Ranch land, as more fully described under "Real Estate," above. In conjunction with the sale, the Company provided $891,000 of purchase money financing. The purchase money financing bore interest at 10.0% per annum and

matured in January 1998. The Company received a $624,000 paydown on the purchase money financing in January with the remainder being deferred until a zoning issue is resolved.
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships
Real estate entities. The Company's investment in real estate entities includes (i) equity securities of three publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (collectively the "REITs"), CMET, IORI and TCI, (ii) units of limited partner interest of NRLP, (iii) a general partner interest in NRLP and NOLP, through the Company's 96% limited partner interest in SAMLP and (iv) interests in real estate joint venture partnerships. Gene E. Phillips, Chairman of the Board and Director of the Company until November 16, 1992, served until May 15, 1996, as a director and Chief Executive Officer of SAMI, a company owned by BCM, which serves as SAMLP's managing general partner. Randall M. Paulson, Executive Vice President of the Company, serves as the sole director and President of SAMI. Mr. Phillips is also a general partner of SAMLP. BCM, the Company's advisor, serves as advisor to the REITs, and performs certain administrative and management functions for NRLP and NOLP on behalf of SAMLP.
Since acquiring its initial investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP in 1989, the Company has made additional investments in the equity securities of these entities through private and open market purchases. The Company's cost with respect to shares of the REITs at December 31, 1997 totaled $21.6 million, and its cost with respect to units of limited partner interest in NRLP totaled $23.3 million. The aggregate carrying value (cost plus or minus equity in income or losses and less distributions received) of such equity securities of the REITs and NRLP was $38.3 million at December 31, 1997 and the aggregate market value of such equity securities was $134.6 million. The aggregate investee book value of the equity securities of the REITs and the Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity based upon the December 31, 1997 financial statements of each such entity was $69.8 million and $198.9 million, respectively. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the expenditure by the Company of up to an aggregate of $35.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, units of NRLP and shares of the REITs, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had expended $4.0 million to acquire units of NRLP and an aggregate of $5.6 million to acquire shares of the REITs, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. The Company expects to make additional investments in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP.
At December 31, 1997, SAMLP, the general partner of NRLP and NOLP, owned 26,475 shares of TCI. The Company owns a 96% limited partnership interest in SAMLP which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
The purchases of the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP were made for the purpose of investment and were based principally on the opinion of the Company's management that the equity securities of each were and are currently undervalued. The determination by the Company to purchase additional equity securities of the REITs and NRLP is made on an entity-by-entity basis and depends on the market price of each entity's equity securities relative to the value of its assets, the availability of sufficient funds and the judgment of the Company's management regarding the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities. Substantially all of the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP owned by the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings. Pertinent information regarding the Company's investment in the equity securities of the REITs and NRLP, at December 31, 1997, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
- ---------------------
* At December 31, 1997, NRLP reported a deficit partners' capital. The Company's share of NRLP's revaluation equity, however, was $198.9 million. Revaluation equity is defined as the difference between the estimated current value of the partnership's real estate, adjusted to reflect the partnership's estimate of disposition costs, and the amount of the mortgage notes payable and accrued interest encumbering such real estate as reported in NRLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.
Each of the REITs and NRLP own a considerable amount of real estate, much of which, particularly in the case of NRLP, has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, these entities may earn substantial amounts in periods in which they sell real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which they do not. The Company's reported income or loss attributable to these entities will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to them.
The Company does not have a controlling equity interest in any of the REITs and therefore it cannot, acting by itself, determine either the individual investments or the overall investment policies of such investees. However, due to the Company's equity investments in, and the existence of common officers with, each of the REITs, and that the REITs have the same advisor as the Company and that Mr. Paulson, an Executive Vice President of the Company, is also the President of the REITs and
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
BCM, the Company's advisor, and is the President and sole director of SAMI, a Company owned by BCM, that is the managing general partner of SAMLP, the Company may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investing policies of these entities. The Company accounts for its investment in these entities using the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the income or loss from the operations of these entities currently, rather than when realized through dividends or on sale. The Company continues to account for its investment in NRLP under the equity method due to the pending resignation of SAMLP as general partner of NRLP and NOLP, as more fully discussed in "NRLP" below. The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities, as set forth in the table above, is the original cost of each such investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of each entity's income or loss and distributions received.
The following is a summary description of each of NRLP and the REITs, based upon information publicly reported by such entities.
NRLP. NRLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership which was formed under the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act on January 29, 1987. It commenced operations on September 18, 1987 when, through NOLP, it acquired all of the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of 35 public and private limited partnerships. NRLP is the sole limited partner of NOLP and owns 99% of the beneficial interest in NOLP. NRLP and NOLP operate as an economic unit and, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Partnership shall constitute references to NRLP and NOLP as a unit. The general partner and owner of 1% of the beneficial interest in each of NRLP and NOLP is SAMLP, a Delaware limited partnership. SAMI, a company owned by BCM, is the managing general partner of SAMLP. In November 1992, NOLP transferred 52 apartment complexes and a wraparound mortgage note receivable to Garden Capital, L.P. ("GCLP"), a Delaware limited partnership in which NOLP owns a 99.3% limited partner interest. Concurrent with such transfer, GCLP refinanced all of the mortgage debt associated with the transferred properties and the wraparound mortgage note under a new first mortgage in the amount of $223.0 million.
The Company is a limited partner in SAMLP, holding a 96% limited partner interest therein, which the Company consolidates for financial statement purposes. Gene E. Phillips and SAMI are the general partners of SAMLP. At December 31, 1997, the Company owned approximately 54% of the outstanding limited partner units of NRLP.
SAMI, as the managing general partner of SAMLP, has discretion in determining methods of obtaining funds for the Partnership's operations, and the acquisition and disposition of its assets. The Partnership's governing documents place no limitation on the amount of leverage that

the Partnership may incur either in the aggregate or with respect to any particular property or other investment. At December 31, 1997, the aggregate loan-to-value ratio of the Partnership's real estate portfolio was 43.4% computed on the basis of the ratio of total property-related debt to aggregate appraised values.
At December 31, 1997, NRLP owned 79 properties located in 22 states. These properties consisted of 66 apartment complexes comprising 16,538 units, five office buildings with an aggregate 367,271 square feet and eight shopping centers with an aggregate of 1.1 million square feet.
For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Partnership reported net income of $8.7 million compared to a net loss of $375,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The Partnership had income from operations, prior to gains on sale of real estate of $362,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to a loss of $436,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The improvement in the Partnership's 1997 income from operations is due to an average 3.0% increase in average rental rates at the Partnership's apartment complexes and an average 1.0% increase in rental rates at the Partnership's commercial properties coupled with an average 1.0% increase in occupancy at the Partnership's apartment complexes and an average 3.0% increase at the Partnership's commercial properties.
The Partnership's cash flow from property operations (rents collected less payments for property operations) improved from $43.7 million in 1996 to $49.4 million in 1997. At December 31, 1997, the Partnership had total assets of $279.6 million, which consisted of $211.4 million of real estate held for investment, $25.0 million of notes and interest receivable, $26.0 million of investments in equity securities and other assets and $17.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.

The Partnership, SAMLP and Mr. Phillips were among the defendants in a class action lawsuit arising out of the formation of the Partnership. An agreement settling such lawsuit (the "Settlement Agreement") for the above mentioned defendants became effective on July 5, 1990. The Settlement Agreement provided for, among other things, the appointment of an NRLP oversight committee; the establishment of specified annually increasing targets for five years relating to the price of NRLP's units of limited partner interest; a limitation and deferral or waiver of NRLP's reimbursement to SAMLP of certain future salary costs; a deferral or waiver of certain future compensation to SAMLP; the required distribution to unitholders of all of NRLP's cash from operations in excess of certain renovation costs unless the NRLP oversight committee approves alternative uses for such cash from operations; the issuance of unit purchase warrants to members of the plaintiff class; and the

contribution by the then individual general partners of $2.5 million to NRLP over a four-year period. In accordance with the indemnification provisions of SAMLP's agreement of limited partnership, SAMLP agreed to indemnify, the individual general partners, of SAMLP, for the $2.5 million payment to NRLP. The final annual installment of principal and interest was paid by SAMLP in May 1994.
The Settlement Agreement provides for the resignation and replacement of SAMLP as general partner if the unit price targets are not met for two consecutive anniversary dates. NRLP did not meet the unit price targets for the first and second anniversary dates. On July 8, 1992, SAMLP notified the NRLP oversight committee of the failure of NRLP to meet the unit price targets for two successive years and that it expects to resign as general partner of NRLP and NOLP.
The withdrawal of SAMLP as general partner would require NRLP to purchase SAMLP's general partner interest (the "Redeemable General Partner Interest") at its then fair value, and to pay certain fees and other compensation as provided in the partnership agreement. SAMI, the managing general partner of SAMLP, has calculated the fair value of such Redeemable General Partner Interest to be $49.6 million at December 31, 1997, before reduction for the principal balance ($4.2 million at December 31, 1997) and accrued interest ($7.2 million at December 31, 1997) on the note receivable from SAMLP for its original capital contribution to the partnership.
In January 1995, NRLP, SAMLP, William H. Elliott and the NRLP oversight committee executed an Implementation Agreement which provided for the nomination of an entity controlled by Mr. Elliott as successor general partner and for the resolution of all related matters under the Settlement Agreement. In February 1996, the parties to the Implementation Agreement executed an Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement.
In September 1996, the Judge appointed to supervise the class action settlement (the "Supervising Judge") entered an order granting tentative approval of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement and the form of notice to be sent to the plaintiff class members. In April 1997, the Supervising Judge entered an order amending the September 1996 order, approving the formal notice and setting a hearing on the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement for June 1997. A notice was sent to all plaintiff class members and NRLP unitholders in April 1997 and the hearing was held in June 1997. In September 1997, the Supervising Judge rendered a Statement of Decision in which he declined to approve the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement. As a result of the Statement of Decision, the original Settlement Agreement remains in full force and effect and all of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Implementation Agreement have been voided.
On December 15, 1997, NRLP, SAMLP, the NRLP oversight committee, Joseph B. Moorman, Invenex and the Counsel for the plaintiff class members
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES (Continued)
Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts and Real Estate Partnerships (Continued)
executed an Agreement for Establishment of Class Distribution Fund and Election of Successor General Partner (the "Resolution Agreement") which provides for the nomination of an entity affiliated with SAMLP to be the successor general partner of the Partnership, for the establishment of a fund for the benefit of the plaintiff class members consisting of cash and properties owned by the Partnership and for the resolution of all related matters under the Settlement Agreement.
The Resolution Agreement was submitted to the Supervising Judge and on February 11, 1998, the Supervising Judge entered an order granting preliminary approval of the Resolution Agreement and scheduled a hearing to be held on April 24, 1998, for consideration of preliminary approval of a business plan for the operation of the entity which will receive the cash and properties and to consider a form of notice to be distributed to the plaintiff class members describing the Resolution Agreement and the business plan.
Upon final approval by the Supervising Judge, the proposal to elect the successor general partner will be submitted to the NRLP unitholders for a vote.
Upon approval by the NRLP unitholders, SAMLP shall withdraw as general partner and the successor general partner shall take office. If the required approvals are obtained, it is anticipated that the successor general partner will be elected and take office during the third quarter of 1998.
SAMLP has agreed to waive its rights under the Settlement Agreement to receive any payment from the Partnership of the fees it is entitled to receive upon the election of a successor general partner. As of December 31, 1997, these fees were calculated to be $49.6 million.
Upon final approval by the Supervising Judge, the Partnership will transfer $1.9 million in cash and five shopping centers to the new entity which will be owned by the plaintiff class members and managed for their benefit by a court approved board. This fund is being established in order to provide additional benefits to the plaintiff class members.
Upon the election and taking office of the successor general partner and the transfer of the cash and properties to the fund for the benefit of the plaintiff class members, the original Settlement Agreement and the NRLP oversight committee shall be terminated.
In September 1997, one of the original class action defendants, Robert A. McNeil, filed motions to (i) be installed as receiver for the Partnership and (ii) disband the NRLP oversight committee. A hearing on the motion was set for February 5, 1998. However, the Supervising Judge continued the hearing to April 24, 1998.
