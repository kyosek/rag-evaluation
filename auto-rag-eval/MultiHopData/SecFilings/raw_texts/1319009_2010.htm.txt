Spring Valley Project
Location, means of access and state of property
The Spring Valley property is located in the Spring Valley Mining District, Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 20 miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The property is accessed from Nevada State Highway 50, which extends eastward from US Interstate 80 and is paved to the Rochester turn-off; thereafter it is a dirt road. Water is readily available from two water wells drilled on the property under a temporary grant of water rights. Power availability from three power lines that cross the property has not been determined.
Agreement with Barrick Gold
On March 10, 2009, Midway, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MGC Resources Inc., executed an Exploration, Development and Mine Operating Agreement, effective March 9, 2009 (the "EDM Agreement"), with Barrick Gold Exploration Inc. ("Barrick"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, regarding the exploration, development and possible joint venture of Midway's Spring Valley Project.
Exploration Period
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, MGC granted to Barrick the exclusive right to explore and develop the Spring Valley Project. During this exploration period, Barrick has the exclusive right to earn a 60% interest in the Spring Valley Project by spending US$30,000,000 on the property over a five-year period ending December 31, 2013. During this five-year period Barrick has the sole right to determine the nature, scope, extent and method of all operations in relation to the property, without having to consult or gain the approval of the Midway. Barrick is required to provide Midway with certain information and reports and access to the Spring Valley Project to conduct inspections of operations during this period.
After vesting at 60%, Barrick may increase its interest by 10% (70% total) by spending an additional US$8,000,000 on or before December 31, 2014. At Midway's election, Barrick may also earn an additional 5% (75% total) by carrying Midway to a production decision and arranging financing for Midway's share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by Barrick once production has been established.
Midway is coordinating certain geologic and administrative activities during the earn-in period for a negotiated administrative fee.
Joint Venture
Under the terms of the EDM Agreement, Midway shall have a period of 120 days from the last of the following events to occur to elect to enter into a joint venture agreement with Barrick with respect to the Spring Valley Project: (i) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has not elected to earn the additional 10% interest by spending an additional US$8,000,000; (ii) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has timely incurred the additional US$8,000,000 expenditure on the Spring Valley Project to earn the additional 10% interest; (iii) upon receipt of notice from Barrick that it has elected but failed to timely incur the additional US$8,000,000 expenditure on the Spring Valley Project. If Midway fails to notify Barrick within the 120-day period, Midway will be deemed to have elected to enter into the joint venture with Barrick.
If Midway elects or is deemed to have elected to enter into the joint venture agreement with Barrick, initial capital accounts will be established in accordance with Barrick's earned interest in the Spring Valley Project and Barrick will be the manager of the joint venture.
If Midway elects not to enter into the joint venture, then either: (i) within 365 days of Midway's notice electing not to enter into the joint venture, Barrick will exercise its option to purchase Midway's interest in the Spring Valley Project for US$40,000,000 and a 2% net smelter royalty return (NSR) on production from the Spring Valley Project; or (ii) Barrick will elect not to exercise its option to purchase Midway's interest in the Spring Valley Project and the joint venture will be formed with Midway being deemed to have elected the carry option and any operations costs incurred by Barrick in the 365-day election period will be treated as Midway's development costs.
The EDM Agreement also provides for the adjustment of a party's participating interest in the joint venture upon default in making agreed-upon contributions to adopted programs and budgets or upon contributing less to a program and budget than a percentage equal to the party's participating interest.
Further, the EDM Agreement provides that if Midway's participation interest falls below 10%, Midway shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and all of Midway's participating interests will be assigned to Barrick, with Midway reserving a 2% NSR.
Under the EDM Agreement, a party's whose recalculated participating interest is reduced to 10% shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the joint venture and shall relinquish its entire participating interest. Such relinquished participating interest shall be deemed to have accrued automatically to the other party. The reduced party shall have the right to receive 10% of net proceeds, if any, to a maximum amount of 75% percent of the reduced party's equity account balance as of the effective date of the withdrawal. Upon receipt of such amount, the reduced party shall thereafter have no further right, title, or interest in the Spring Valley Project or under the EDM Agreement.
Barrick conducted and funded exploration in 2009 on the Spring Valley Project at the required level of US$4,000,000 and in 2010 at the required program of US$5,000,000. Barrick has informed Midway that it intends to conduct and fund the 2011 required program of US$7,000,000 to maintain the EDM Agreement.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since 2003 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") and through mining leases. Unpatented mining claims are kept active through payment of a maintenance fee due to the BLM and each county the claims are located in on 31 August of each year. Certain areas of the Spring Valley project are subject to Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalties ranging from 1% to 7% on different claim groups within the project package. Midway's land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 11,022.5 acres containing federal lode and placer mining claims and patented fee properties.
The Company has prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.
In 2010, Barrick, on behalf of the Company, paid the following lease payments to maintain certain mineral leases in the Spring Valley project:
·
On April 25, 2010, Barrick paid Midway's annual payment of US$36,000 to Lamonte J. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 12 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner retained a 3% NSR Royalty. Alternatively, Midway can purchase these claims for US$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
On July 1, 2010 Barrick paid Midway's US$1,000 a month option payment totaling US$12,000 to George D. Duffy to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$500,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total.
·
On July 18, 2010 Barrick paid Midway's annual payment of US$20,000 to Dave Rowe and Randall Stoeberl to maintain its option to purchase 97 unpatented mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$600,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Rowe and Mr. Stoeberl retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
·
On October 30, 2010 Barrick paid Midway's annual payment of US$6,000 to Dale and Diana Chabino to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$100,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Chabino and Mrs. Chabino retained a 3% NSR royalty from commercial production on these claims.
In 2010, Barrick, on behalf of the Company, entered into two new agreements within the area of interest of the EDM Agreement:
·
On September 15, 2010 Barrick signed an option agreement with a third party for surface and mineral rights. Option payments totalling US$150,000 are payable over five years of which Barrick paid the first and last year's lease payments totaling US$56,250.
·
On December 2, 2010 Barrick entered into a sub-lease and option agreement with a third party for mineral rights underlying the surface rights acquired by the Company in 2006. The agreement requires Barrick to spend a cumulative amount of US$2,000,000 in work expenditures on the ground leased over a period of six years, and to make advance royalty payments in the amount of US$100,000 per year thereafter, up to a cap of US$2,500,000. The advance royalty payments may be credited against a 3% NSR royalty payable from production on the area of ground leased.
Over the years Midway has staked additional claims and purchased rights to additional claims outright within and adjacent to the Spring Valley property.
Geology
The Spring Valley gold deposit is hosted in Permo-Triassic Koipato Group rocks made up of rhyolite flows, breccias, and volcaniclastic sediments. These volcanics were intruded by fine grained feldspar porphyry. Hydrothermal alteration includes quartz-sericite + pyrite alteration associated with gold, argillic alteration in hydrothermal breccias, and lesser secondary potassium feldspar, iron carbonate, and hematite-quartz alteration.
Gold mineralization occurs in sheeted quartz veins, hydrothermal breccias, and open fractures. The gold is distributed along the top of the intrusion, and in overlying volcanic rocks, commonly at stratigraphic contacts, fracture zones, and in the remains of a diatreme breccia. Gold is found as grains of free gold up to 3 mm across, and has been observed along the edges of sulfide grains, indicating gold deposition is later than the sulfides.
Exploration completed by Midway
During 2004-2005, Midway evaluated previous drill results by Kennecott and Echo Bay to generate new targets. These were subsequently tested by drilling 90 RC holes totaling 44,965 feet and 21 diamond drill holes totaling 10,008.7 feet resulting in discovery of the Porphyry and Sill zones. At the end of the program, the mineralized zone covered an area 3,200 feet long by 1,600 feet wide with mineralization to a depth of 984 feet. Based on drill results through January 2006, Midway commissioned AMEC E&C Services, Inc. ("AMEC") to develop a mineral resource estimate conforming to NI 43-101 that was reported in May 2006.
In 2006, Midway completed 66,616 feet of drilling in 90 holes to expand the resource to the north and west, as well as to test a much larger porphyry gold target at depth. At the end of the program, the mineralized zone covered an area 4,500 feet long by 3,000 feet wide that is mineralized to a depth of 1,400 feet. Surface exploration including a 3,000 soil sample grid survey, gravity and self-potential geophysical surveys, geologic mapping and rock chip sampling over the 17 square miles of claim holdings resulting in the identification of 12 new targets for follow up work.
In 2007, the Company drilled 102,000 feet to expand the west and north zones and to test the deep porphyry potential. Limited infill drilling was completed. An additional 10,850 feet was drilled on the Limerick, American Canyon, King David and Golden Gate satellite targets. In August 2007, the Company completed the purchase of the key Schmidt lease in Spring Valley by paying the final US$3,000,000 due. This payment was the final advance royalty payment for the first 500,000 ounces of gold to be produced from the Schmidt claim package.
Based on drilling results through 2007, an updated inferred resource estimate was made by AMEC and reported in January, 2008. The resource model showed a large number of grade blocks outside of the L-G optimization shell that were not included in the resource.
In 2008, the Company completed 87 holes including 63,565 feet of RC and 8,985 feet of core drilling. The drilling identified a coherent gold mineralization zone 5,200 feet long by 3,500 feet wide that extended to a depth of 1,400 feet. Two outlying targets, the Fitting and Limerick areas, were tested with a total of 22 exploration drill holes with no significant results.
By January 1, 2009, a total of 318,510 feet of drilling from 450 holes has been completed in six drilling campaigns in the Spring Valley resource area. Based on these results, the Company completed an in-house resource update that was reported in March 2009.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource", which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines adopted by the CIM. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the "Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates" above.
Exploration completed by Barrick
In 2009, Barrick drilled 34 holes totaling 29,002 feet of RC drilling and 8,738 feet of core drilling. Barrick's drilling focused on confirmation of previous drill results, infilling defined mineralized areas and initial metallurgical test work.
Barrick completed a scoping level metallurgical study on 13 composites from drill core. Results indicated no significant difference in recovery between oxide and sulfide material. Bottle roll test results ranged from 86% to 98% gold recoveries from oxide, sulfide and transition composites. Column leach tests indicated a 60% to 90% gold recovery over an average 260-day leach period. Gravity separation tests showed gold recoveries of 91% to 50.6% of the calculated head grade. The majority of gravity recoverable gold was released with the coarsest grind and gravity tails were found to be amenable to leaching of the remaining gold.
In 2010 Barrick completed 30,565 feet of RC drilling in 15 holes and 20 pre-collars and 21,760 feet of core drilling in 19 holes. A hydrology study to assess de-watering requirements determined that pump rates would be in the 650-1,100 gallon per minute range.
2011 Exploration Program
Barrick has informed Midway that it intends to conduct and fund the 2011 minimum required program of US$7,000,000 to maintain the EDM Agreement.
The Company has commissioned an independent resource update to assess potential additions to the resource as a result of Barrick's 2009 and 2010 drilling.
To date the Company has incurred total costs of $20,071,977 relating to the exploration of the Spring Valley project.
The Spring Valley project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Pan Project
Location and means of access
The Pan property is located at the northern end of the Pancake mountain range in western White Pine County, Nevada, approximately 22 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada, and 50 miles west of Ely, Nevada. Access is via a seven mile dirt road running south-southeast from US Highway 50, at a point about 17 miles southeast of Eureka, Nevada. Eureka has a population of about 2,000. Water is readily available from wells west of the property. Power availability is currently being assessed from existing power lines north of the property.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since April 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. Midway's land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 9,794.5 acres containing federal lode mining claims.
Midway acquired its interest in the January 7, 2003 mineral lease agreement with Newark Valley Mining Corp. ("NVMC") formerly Gold Standard Royalty Corporation and formerly the Lyle Campbell Trust as a result of its acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5 of each year Midway must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of US$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 174 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale NSR production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. Midway must incur a minimum of US$65,000 year work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease. On January 1, 2010 the Company paid $174,702 (US$167,040). Subsequent to the year end the Company paid US$213,455 on January 1, 2011.
Midway staked additional claims adjacent to the Pan property some of which fall within the one mile area of interest of the NVMC mining lease and will be subject to the NSR royalty to NVMC. Midway has staked additional claims around the project, increasing the land holdings to over 13 square miles. Midway's land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 9,794.5 acres containing federal lode and placer mining claims and patented fee properties.
The Company has prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.
Mineral Resources
On July 20, 2010, Midway announced the results of a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") for the Pan gold project. The PEA included an independent audit of an updated mineral resource estimate prepared by Midway. The updated resource estimates are shown in the table below. The PEA assumes the Pan gold deposit will be developed as an open pit mine and heap leach operation. The forecast mine life was 9 years with a total of 327,000 ounces of gold recovered and produced for sale. Initial project capital costs, as evaluated in the PEA, are estimated at US$45,000,000 plus working capital of US$5,000,000 and a 20% contingency totaling US$9,000,000. The PEA was prepared under the supervision of William J. Crowl, Donald Hulse, and Terre Lane of Gustavson Associates, LLC, each of whom is independent of Midway and is a "qualified person" under NI 43-101. For further information on this project, please see the PEA entitled "NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Pan Gold Project, White Pine County, Nevada", dated July 20, 2010, which is available under Midway's company profile at www.sedar.com.

Geology
The Pan project is a sediment-hosted gold deposit on the prolific Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend in Nevada. It is an oxide deposit exposed on the surface. Host rocks are Devonian-Mississippian marine siltstone and limestone of the Pilot Formation and the Devils Gate Formation. Breccias developed along the Pan fault are the primary host of gold mineralization. Argillic alteration and silicification are the dominant alteration types associated with gold. At North Pan gold mineralization is primarily hosted by silicified breccia in the Pilot Formation. At South Pan, gold occurs primarily in argillic altered breccia in the Devils Gate Formation. Gold occurs as stratabound mineralization outside of the breccias particularly in the Wendy zone adjacent to South Pan.
Exploration
The Pan mineralization was discovered in 1978 and over 860 holes have been drilled by 10 different exploration companies. These include: Amselco, Hecla, Echo Bay, Alta Gold, Pan Nevada Gold, and a number of other junior exploration companies.
In 2007, the Company drilled 35,510 feet in 113 exploration holes outside of the known resource. Drill results at Boulders extended gold north for 1,300 feet under volcanic outcrop at North Pan. Drill results at Barite and Wendy extended gold at South Pan by 400 feet south and 300 feet east respectively. The Nana zone, 4,000 feet northwest of North Pan, represents a new exploration opportunity. A large scale soil survey identified four previously unknown gold-arsenic anomalies with no previous exploration drilling.
In 2008, Midway completed 26,245 feet of drilling in 49 RC holes. Fourteen new holes in the resource area were drilled to verify results from previous operators. Most intercepted higher grades and greater thicknesses than previously reported (Press Release July 9, 2008). Preliminary investigations suggest that assay techniques used by a previous operator may have under-estimated gold values in some of the holes. A higher-grade gold zone was found at North Pan with true widths of 10 to 25 feet and grades from 0.07 to 0.51 opt gold over 800 feet in length. Additional near surface oxide gold was discovered at South Pan where the Wendy zone was expanded to the east under volcanic cover. Three targets outside the resource were tested with no significant results.
In 2009, an internal mineral resource update was completed by Midway and announced in November 2009.
In 2010, Midway commissioned the PEA that included an independent review of the resource. Results of the PEA encouraged Midway to move the project toward production at an accelerated pace. A total of 5,764 feet of core in 14 holes was completed to obtain samples for additional metallurgical testing, geotechnical studies of potential pit walls, and waste rock characterization studies. The gold grades in these core holes were higher than expected based on previous analyses from nearby holes. Insights into the geology and alteration based on the core holes resulted in reassessing the geological constraints of the deposit. Engineering studies were initiated in support of a pre-feasibility study planned for 2011. Environmental base line studies were initiated to support submitting a mining permit, planned for 2011.
2011 Exploration Program
Midway plans additional drilling to expand the resource and confirm the new geological interpretations. A portion of the 2011 drilling will test for undiscovered mineralization beneath proposed mine facilities. Engineering and design work will continue with the intention to complete a feasibility study on the Pan project in 2011.
To date Midway has incurred total costs of $6,625,094 relating to the exploration of the Pan project. We have budgeted approximately $4.5 million for the 2011 exploration program.
The Pan project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Midway Project
Location and means of access
The Midway property is located in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles northeast of the town of Tonopah, 210 miles northwest of Las Vegas and 236 miles southeast of Reno. The property is over the northeastern flank of the San Antonio Mountains and in the Ralston Valley. Water is readily available from water wells drilled on the property under a temporary grant of water rights and power may be accessible as a power line crosses the property.
The Midway project is located at the intersection of the well-known Round Mountain/Goldfield trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon vein clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization. The best previously reported gold intercept was 2.5 feet of 119 opt gold in 17 feet that averaged 34.7 opt gold in core hole MW210 from the Midway vein.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since 2001. Through a series of agreements, amendments and payments the Company has the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Midway property subject only to a sliding scale royalty on NSR royalty from any commercial production of between 2% to 7%, based on changes in gold prices. To maintain the option the Company must pay an advance minimum royalty, recoverable from commercial production, of US$300,000 per year on each August 15. On September 29, 2009 the optionors agreed to waive the US$300,000 payment that would have otherwise been due on August 15, 2010.
In addition, the surface rights to 560 acres in Section 32 are held by the Town of Tonopah. The remaining 80 acres of surface rights in Section 32 are held as two 40-acre parcels by two owners. We hold federal mineral rights for the entirety of Section 32 in unpatented claims.
The Company has prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.
Geology
The Midway project is located at the intersection of the Round Mountain/Goldfield gold trend and the Walker Lane. It is a low-sulfidation epithermal gold system with near-vertical quartz-adularia-gold veins. Host rocks are Ordovician black argillite of the Palmetto Formation and unconformably overlying Tertiary rhyolitic volcanics. Bonanza gold veins occur in a series of en echelon clusters along a 1.5 mile northwest-trending band of mineralization.
The veins are best defined in the Discovery zone with 132 holes. The veins occur in sub-parallel clusters, 10 to 20 feet apart, with an average width of 6 feet. Veins hosted in the argillite form well-defined veins and hydrothermal breccias. Where the veins pass upward into the volcanics, they splay out to form numerous thinner sub-parallel veins in a braided stockwork zone. Visible gold is common in the veins with higher-grade gold in an apparent boiling horizon at the unconformity between argillite and volcanics.
Exploration
Veins in the Discovery zone were discovered by Kennecott in 1992. Prior to this the property was explored by Houston Oil and Minerals, Coeur d'Alene Mines, and Rio Algom. Tombstone Exploration and Golconda Resources explored the property after Kennecott.
In 2002, we completed 26,689.5 feet of core drilling in 69 holes. Intercepts such as 2.5 feet of 119 opt gold in 17 feet that averaged 34.7 opt gold in the Midway vein encouraged Newmont to enter into a joint venture on the property in September 2002. Newmont completed an extensive regional exploration programs including airborne magnetic, EM, and radiometric surveys and ground radiometric, gravity and CSAMT surveys. From 2002 to 2003 the Newmont/Midway joint venture drilled a total of 67,703.5 feet in 121 holes in the greater Discovery area and other targets.
From 2003 to 2004, the joint venture drilled 10,195 feet in 7 RC holes and 5,847 feet in 16 core holes. Five holes were drilled in the 121 Zone and the others in a largely untested area south of the Discovery zone. Newmont terminated the joint venture in June 2004.
In 2005, we drilled 8,987 feet in 16 RC holes to test for extensions adjacent to the known resource areas. The program resulted in the discovery of the Dauntless Zone with hole MW399 which encountered 175 feet of 0.349 opt gold including a vein assaying 15 feet of 3.163 opt gold. An independent resource estimate was completed based on a model of disseminated, strataform mineralization in the Tertiary volcanics using open pit mining methods. The Company no longer believes this business case is optimal for this property and is evaluating a model that would support underground mine development.
In 2006, the Company drilled 26,450 feet in 56 holes. The Dauntless zone was extended 650 feet along strike with true width varying from 23 to 66 feet. Grades vary from 0.029 to 1.16 ounces per ton starting within 165 feet of the surface. Drilling identified 58 veins with at least one intercept greater than 0.15 ounces of gold per ton that are not yet defined. Plans were proposed for a decline that would allow bulk sampling of the Discovery and Dauntless gold zones for metallurgical testing and allow better access for exploration of the gold bearing quartz veins. Fourteen monitor wells were installed to study the dewatering costs for the decline. Four of the monitor holes encountered new gold mineralization.
In 2007, pump tests from a 450-foot water well in the Discovery area were conducted to determine dewatering needs for a decline. This program estimated the need to pump 2,000 gallons per minute to dewater the decline and mine workings. Engineering was initiated for a decline to provide access 200 feet below high grade portions of certain veins and to then take a 50,000 ton bulk sample.
In 2008, the Company drilled 1,234 feet in 12 RC holes and 2,321 feet in 9 core holes for hydrology and geotechnical testing along the planned route of the decline. Two new vein intercepts were discovered (Press Release May 14, 2008). No gold was noted in five holes drilled to test proposed waste rock storage sites. A preliminary mining plan was submitted to the BLM and NDEP for an underground decline.
Metallurgical testing by SGS Lakefield Research Limited (Canada) showed up to 94% gold recovery using gravity and cyanide from a 73-lb. composite sample of Discovery vein material grading 0.188 opt gold. Further work by Gekko Systems Metallurgical Laboratory (Australia) showed that gravity and flotation could achieve 86.7% gold recovery and 66.3% silver recovery without using cyanide, based on a 242-lb composite sample, grading 0.662 opt gold and 0.475 opt silver.
In 2009, the Company worked with the Town of Tonopah, Nevada to negotiate a plan to properly dispose of mine water to the standards required by the State Water Engineer. In early 2011 we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Town of Tonopah for continued cooperation with regards to development of the Midway project nearby to Tonopah's municipal water well fields. The memorandum of understanding provides for mutual information sharing between the Company and Tonopah's engineers for baseline studies and designs, development of water rights for the benefit of Tonopah, and cooperation to reduce redundant facilities.
2011 Exploration Program
In 2011, Midway plans to drill core holes in the Discovery zone to define the true width and continuity of gold grade of the known veins and to test extensions along strike. The angle holes will be sited so that additional veins to the east and west may be tested by the same holes. Additional metallurgical testing and engineering studies are planned, where warranted. A new resource estimate based on underground mining of high angle veins is planned in 2011.
To date Midway has incurred total costs of $8,665,767 relating to the exploration of the Midway project. We have budgeted approximately $2.5 million for the 2011 exploration program.
The Midway project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Gold Rock Project
Location and means of access
The Gold Rock property is situated in the eastern Pancake Range in western White Pine County, Nevada. The property is 8 miles southeast of the Company's Pan project. Access is via the Green Springs road from US Highway 50 approximately 65 miles from Ely, Nevada. Water is readily available from wells in the region. Power would be available by extending power lines from the Pan property.
Title
Midway has controlled the property since April 13, 2007 through direct ownership of unpatented lode and placer mining claims administered by the BLM and through mining leases. Midway's land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 8,929.5 acres containing federal lode and placer mining claims.
We acquired our interest in the March 20, 2006 mineral lease agreement with NVMC as a result of our acquisition of Pan-Nevada Gold Corporation on April 13, 2007. On or before January 5 of each year Midway must pay an advance minimum royalty of the greater of US$60,000 or the US dollar equivalent of 108.05 ounces of gold valued by the average of the London afternoon fixing for the third calendar quarter preceding January 1 of the year in which the payment is due. The minimum advance royalties will be creditable against a sliding scale NSR production royalty of between 2.5% and 4%. Midway must incur a minimum of US$75,000 year work expenditures, including claim maintenance fees, during the term of the mining lease. On January 1, 2010 Midway paid $108,486 (US$103,728). Subsequent to the year end we paid US$132,550 on January 1, 2011.
Midway has entered into or acquired four additional agreements for claims adjacent to and contiguous with the NVMC claims:
·
On or before January 15, 2010, we paid the annual advance royalty payment of US$20,000 to Anchor Minerals, Inc. to maintain its mineral lease for 80 unpatented lode mining claims. The owner holds a 3.5% gross production royalty.
·
On or before January 24, 2010, Midway paid the annual option payment of US$50,000 to Brian Peart to maintain its option to purchase 13 unpatented lode and placer mining claims. Alternatively Midway can purchase these claims for US$5,000,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Peart holds a sliding scale royalty of between 2 and 6% NSR from commercial production on these claims.
·
On or before February 13, 2010, Midway paid the annual option payment of US$7,750 to Jerry Pankow to maintain its option to purchase 2 unpatented lode mining claims. Alternatively we can purchase these claims for US$775,000 with any payments already paid credited against the total. Mr. Pankow holds a sliding scale royalty of between 2 and 5% NSR from commercial production on these claims.
·
On or before February 15, 2010, Midway paid the annual payment of US$15,000 to Ronald "Ronny" Jordan to maintain its option to purchase 10 unpatented lode mining claims.

The assignor of this lease agreement to Midway also holds a 0.5% NSR.
Over the years the Company has staked additional claims outright adjacent to and contiguous with the Gold Rock property, which are outside of any area of interest.
The Company has prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership area.
Geology
Gold Rock is a sediment-hosted gold system in highly prospective host rocks within a 14 square mile land position along the Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend. Gold was mined at the Easy Junior pit from Mississippian marine siltstone and limestone of the Joanna and Chainman Formations. Additional gold anomalies occur in the Devonian-Mississippian Pilot and Devils Gate Formations, the same host rocks as found at the nearby Pan project. These potential host rocks are exposed for 6 miles of strike length and may have been repeated by east verging thrust faulting. Exposures in the Easy Junior pit wall show mineralization is associated with the crest of a tight anticline cut by a high angle reverse fault. Gold is associated with silicification and argillic alteration of the host rocks along the structure. Historic drill data suggests additional folds and thrust faulting around and along strike of the pit.
Exploration
The Easy Junior Mine, in the center of the Gold Rock property, reportedly produced 2.9 million tons of 0.026 opt gold (74,945 ounces gold contained) during operations by Alta Gold and the Alta Bay joint venture (Alta Gold-Echo Bay). The mine was shut down in 1994, due to low gold prices. A historic database of 794 holes containing 269,446 feet of drilling was acquired in 2008. Analysis of this drill data by Midway outlined a gold zone in the walls of the pit and along strike extending south into the Decker Flat area. The gold zone is defined by 300 holes and extends for 9,200 feet along the strike of the Easy Junior anticline. This zone appears to be oxide, above the water table, and open in all directions.
Exploration work by Midway to date has primarily been data compilation and surface exploration. Data compilation has included drill hole data, rock and soil geochemical data, geologic mapping, and geophysical surveys generated by previous exploration companies. Midway has generated new geology and alteration mapping and additional rock and soil sampling. A gravity survey was conducted over the property position. The new and old data are being evaluated to generate exploration targets for future drilling.
In 2008, Midway drilled 3,525 feet in 11 RC holes on the Anchor target at the south end of the property. The target was gold bearing Pilot shale. Five holes found strongly anomalous gold in the Pilot formation, a regionally favorable host rock. Several targets were not tested due to large voids in the rock above the targets. The drill rig in use at that time was not equipped to get past these areas. Follow up drilling is planned when appropriate equipment is available.
2011 Exploration Program
Midway plans to initially focus its efforts on the Easy Junior-Decker Flats gold zone in 2011. A first round of drilling is designed to confirm the historic data, verify locations and grades, and test for expansion potential. This will be followed by a second round of drilling to convert the indicated historic gold zone to a NI43-101 compliant resource. A surface exploration program is on-going to identify additional targets that may be tested in a third round of drilling either in 2011 or 2012.
To date Midway has incurred total costs of $747,530 relating to the exploration of the Gold Rock project. We have budgeted approximately $2.6 million for the 2011 exploration program.
The Gold Rock project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
Other Nevada Properties
The Company's Thunder Mountain and Burnt Canyon projects are exploration projects that Midway does not consider to be material properties of Midway at this time. The Company abandoned the Roberts Gold property in fiscal 2010. These projects are without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7.
Thunder Mountain is a gold and silver rich epithermal vein and disseminated gold system hosted in rhyolite tuffs and flow dome complexes located six miles southeast of the Midway project in Nye County, Nevada. From August 2008 to May 2009, Kinross Gold USA funded the project under an exploration and option to joint venture agreement. Kinross conducted a first pass drill program but did not encounter any significant results.
Burnt Canyon is a volcanic hosted epithermal system with gold identified in numerous rock and soil samples. The project lies between high grade veins in the Seven Troughs district to the south and the Wildcat disseminated gold deposit to the north in Pershing County, Nevada. The Company plans a first pass drill program in 2011 on this project.
Roberts Gold, located on the Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend in Nevada, was abandoned and the Company wrote off $119,980 of deferred acquisition costs in the year ended December 31, 2010.
Washington Property
The map below shows the location of Midway's property located in Washington, USA. This property is described in further detail below.
Golden Eagle Project
Location and means of access
The Golden Eagle property is located on private land in the Eureka (Republic) mining district in Ferry County, Washington. The property is two miles northwest of the town of Republic, Washington and is accessed by the Knob Hill county road. Power is available at the nearby (< 1 mile) Knob Hill Mine. Water availability has not yet been determined.
Title
On August 1, 2008 the Company issued 600,000 common shares at US$2.50 per common share for proceeds of US$1,500,000 by way of a private placement to Kinross Gold USA Inc. ("Kinross") and concurrently purchased a 75% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Kinross at a cost of US$1,500,000 ($1,537,950). The Company then purchased a 25% interest in the Golden Eagle project from Hecla Limited at a cost of US$483,333 ($500,200). Kinross retained a 2% net smelter returns royalty and was granted a first right of refusal to toll mill ore from the Golden Eagle property at their Kettle River Mill. Midway completed the acquisition of the Golden Eagle property through a wholly-owned subsidiary created to hold the property.
In the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company staked additional claims and purchased two additional blocks of land at a cost of $177,393 to expand its Golden Eagle land property package.
Midway's land position encompasses a gross area of approximately 339.5 acres containing federal lode mining claims and patented lode mining claim and fee properties.
The Company has prepared a summary table shown below that identifies the nature of our ownership or interest in the property, describes our interest in the properties, describes the type, names, number, unique identifying numbers and the approximate size in acres of each ownership areas.
Mineral Resources
On June 25, 2009, the Company announced an indicated resource estimate of 31,400,000 tons at a grade of 0.055 opt containing 1,744,000 ounces of gold based on drilling by previous operators. There is an additional inferred resource estimate of 5,100,000 tons at a grade of 0.038 opt containing 192,000 ounces of gold. Both estimates are reported at a cut off grade of 0.02 opt gold and constrained within a Lerchs-Grossman pit shell using a $750 per ounce gold price and 85% gold recovery. The estimated metal content does not include consideration of any other mining, mineral processing, or metallurgical recoveries. The most likely cut-off grade for this deposit is not known at this time and must be confirmed by the appropriate economic studies. Mineral reserves have not been estimated. The report was prepared under the supervision of Eric Chapman and Dr. Thom Seal both of whom are independent of the Company and are "qualified persons" under NI 43-101. For further information on this project, please see the report entitled "Golden Eagle Project, Washington State, USA, Technical Report" dated effective July, 2009, which is available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - In this Annual Report we use the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource", which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines adopted by CIM, as CIM Standards in Mineral Resources and Reserve Definition and Guidelines. US investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the "Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates" above.
Geology
The Golden Eagle is a volcanic hosted, epithermal gold system with gold in quartz veins and disseminated in extensive breccia bodies. The host rocks are andesite flows and volcaniclastics of the Eocene age Sanpoil Formation along the western margin of the Republic Graben. Gold occurs primarily in silicified and argillized hydrothermal breccia that is 2,500 feet long and 1,000 feet wide. The gold zone is roughly east-west. It is exposed at the surface at the historic Mountain Lion mine to the west and plunges to the northeast. Locally the breccia is cut by quartz veins carrying higher grades of gold. Gold and silver mineralization is often found in solid solution with sulfide minerals and is considered refractory. Historical underground mining extracted gold and silver rich quartz veins adjacent to and beneath Golden Eagle.
Exploration
Exploration was conducted on the property from 1940 to 2000 by Knob Hill Mining, Day Mines, Hecla, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and Echo Bay. Hecla and Santa Fe Gold defined a large gold resource on the property and conducted pre-feasibility studies including numerous metallurgical tests. After Santa Fe Gold was acquired by Newmont, the property was traded to Echo Bay during a time of low gold prices. Kinross acquired Echo Bay and focused their efforts elsewhere.
In 2008, The Company acquired Golden Eagle and began compiling and reviewing the historic database of 835 drill holes containing 165,775 feet of mostly core drilling. Many of the older shallow holes could not be verified, leaving 126,591 feet in 164 holes that could be verified for use in creating a new gold model. Dr Thom Seal was contracted to review the numerous metallurgical reports and summarize the results for the Company. Company geologists mapped the historic pits and sampled pit walls and dumps.
In 2009, the Company contracted Snowden Mining Industry Consultants to produce an independent NI43-101 compliant resource estimate.
2011 Exploration Program
Issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting will be assessed in 2011. The Company has commissioned a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the economics of different mining options at current higher gold prices.
To date Midway has incurred total costs of $249,433 relating to the exploration of the Golden Eagle project. The Company has budgeted approximately $0.2 million for 2011.
The Golden Eagle project is without known reserves, as defined under SEC Guide 7, and the proposed program for the property is exploratory in nature.
