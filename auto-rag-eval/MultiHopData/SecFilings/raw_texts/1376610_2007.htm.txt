Item 2.
Properties
We classify our mineral properties into three categories: “Development Properties”, “Advanced Exploration Properties”, and “Other Exploration Properties”. Development Properties are properties where a decision to develop the property into a producing mine has been made. We currently have one Development Property, namely the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine as discussed below. Advanced Exploration Properties are those properties where we retain a significant ownership interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis to identify and report proven and probable reserves or other mineralized material. Other Exploration Properties are those that do not fall into the other categories. Please see below for information about our Development Properties, Advanced Exploration Properties and Other Exploration Properties.
Other than the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine, we cannot be certain that any mineral deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grade to justify commercial operations. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including the particular attributes of the deposit; metal prices, which are highly cyclical; the cost to extract and process the mineralized material; and government regulations and permitting requirements. We may be unable to upgrade our mineralized material to proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop our properties. Estimates of reserves and mineralization herein are subject to the effect of changes in metal prices, and to the risks inherent in mining and processing operations.
We acquired our properties as part of the Arrangement. See “Business-History of Allied Nevada” for further information.

Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine
We currently have one Development Property, the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine, which we also refer to as the “Hycroft Mine” in this prospectus. This mine and related facilities are located 54 miles west of Winnemucca, Nevada. Winnemucca (population 15,000) is a commercial community on Interstate 80, 164 miles northeast of Reno, Nevada. The town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a small airport. Access to the Hycroft Mine from Winnemucca, Nevada is by means of State Road No. 49 (Jungo Road), a good-quality, unpaved road. Access is also possible from Imlay and from Lovelock by dirt roads intersecting Interstate 80. There is access to adequate supplies of water and power. In the past, the majority of employees lived in the Winnemucca area.
The mine is situated on the eastern edge of the Black Rock Desert and on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains between Winnemucca and Gerlach, Nevada. There are no streams, rivers, or major lakes in the general area. Elevations in the mine area range between 4,500 and 5,500 ft above sea level.
The climate of the region is arid, with precipitation averaging 7.6 inches per year. Temperatures during the summer range from 50°F to 90°F and winter temperatures range from 20°F to 40°F.
One small and two large open pit operations comprise the Hycroft Mine. The Hycroft Mine was formally known as the Crofoot Lewis open pit mine. Mining began in the area in 1983 with a small heap-leach operation known as the Lewis mine. Lewis mine production was followed by production from the Crofoot property in the
Bay, South Central, Boneyard, Gap and Cut 4 pits along the Central fault, and finally the north end of the Brimstone pit and continued until it was halted in December 1998 due to low gold prices of below $300 per ounce.
The Lewis mine was acquired by Vista in early 1987 from F.W. Lewis, Inc. and the Crofoot mine was acquired by Vista in April 1988. The leasehold interest in the Lewis property was purchased by Vista on December 13, 2005 in consideration of the payment of $5.1 million and the elimination of the 5% NSR royalty on gold and 7.5% NSR royalty on silver produced from the property.
The Crofoot property was originally held under two leases and is now owned by Allied Nevada subject to a 4% net profits interest retained by the former owners. All advance royalty payments are credited against the 4% net profits royalty.
The Hycroft Mine produced over one million ounces of gold from the commencement of mining operations in 1987, until the operations were suspended, as a result of low gold prices in December of 1998.
Gold production from the leaching and rinsing of the heap leach pads, continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the amount of gold recovered was not material. The mine is currently on care and maintenance.
Geology and Ore Reserves
The Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine is located on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains. The deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the Tertiary Kamma Mountain volcanics. The volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs, flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks. Fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia. Volcanic rocks have been block-faulted by dominant north-trending structures, which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization. The Central Fault and East Fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation. A post-mineral range-front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent Pleistocene Lahontan Lake sediments in the Black Rock Desert. The geological events have created a physical setting ideally suited to the open-pit, heap-leach mining operation at the Hycroft Mine. The heap leach method is widely used in the southwestern United States and allows the economical treatment of oxidized low-grade ore deposits in large volumes.
The known gold mineralization within the Crofoot and Lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north-south direction by 1.5 miles in an east-west direction. Mineralization extends to a depth of less than 330 feet in the outcropping to near-outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over 990 feet in the Brimstone deposit in the east. Not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization.
The Crofoot and Lewis properties together comprise approximately 12,230 acres. An additional 13,090 acres of ground were staked by Vista in the fall of 2006 around and contiguous to the original Crofoot and Lewis properties. The Crofoot property, originally held under lease, is owned by Hycroft Resources & Development, Inc. subject to a 4% net profits interest retained by the former owners, and covers approximately 3,544 acres. The Lewis property, which virtually surrounds the Crofoot property, covers approximately 8,686 acres and was purchased by Vista as part of the acquisition of F.W. Lewis, Inc. in December 2005. The mine is accessible by road and has access to adequate supplies of water and power.
Planned Reactivation of Mine
Our Board of Directors approved the reactivation of the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine in September 2007, and the Hycroft Technical Report was commissioned to assess the costs of reactivation in light of current market conditions. Once reactivated, the Hycroft Mine is expected to produce 375,000 ounces of gold over its
first five years of operation. Gold production is targeted to begin in the fourth quarter of 2008 and is estimated to average 95,000 ounces per year from 2009-2011, and 82,000 ounces in 2012.
Wilson Consulting issued the Hycroft Technical Report on January 16, 2008, in accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines. The report and verification of the data employed in the report was undertaken under the supervision of Mr. Scott Wilson, C.P.G., a “qualified person” under NI 43-101 independent of Allied Nevada.
The scope of the Hycroft Technical Report included a review of pertinent technical reports and data in possession of Allied Nevada relative to the general setting, geology, project history, exploration activities and results, methodology, quality assurance, interpretations, and the resource and reserve data. Each scope element was addressed in the context of the company’s target concepts, recent results, and proposed activities.
All of the permits required to reactivate the Hycroft Mine are valid and the revised reclamation bond calculation has been submitted to Federal and State regulatory agencies. Regulatory approval of the revised reclamation bond is expected to be received in the first quarter of 2008. The basic infrastructure required to resume operations is in good condition, including the Merrill Crowe processing plant, maintenance shop, warehouse and the Brimstone heap leach pad. Immediately upon receipt of approval for the revised bonding, leaching of the ore that currently sits the historic Brimstone heap leach pad will begin.
Allied Nevada is evaluating whether to retain a mining contractor or acquire a used mining fleet to conduct to perform its mining operations. We have awarded the design and construction contract for the refinery and the contract for the redesign of the leach pad to provide additional capacity. Work is scheduled to begin under these contracts in the second quarter of this year.
We plan to utilize outside funding sources to provide the necessary capital required to re-open the Hycroft Mine, including the proceeds from the equity offering being made pursuant to this prospectus. Current cash expenditures for the project are being funded by Allied Nevada’s existing working capital. The Company may also rely on other forms of financing including debt financing. On March 3, 2008, the Board of Directors ratified the signing of an indicative letter of intent concerning a proposed CDN$30 million secured bridge credit facility with Quest Holdings Ltd. (“Quest Holdings”). The terms of the facility are not yet final and are subject to the normal due diligence by Quest Holdings and its counsel, the preparation of definitive documentation, the granting of security and such other steps as are usual to transactions of this nature. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Subsequent Events”.
The Hycroft Technical Report indicates approximately $40 million is required to fund the reactivation of the Hycroft Mine, as described below.
We plan that gold and silver will be produced utilizing a run-of-mine heap leach process and the Merrill Crowe gold recovery plant currently on-site. Selected operating unit rates utilizing a mining contractor for the project are estimated to be:
The estimated pre-tax internal rate of return of the project is 40% with an estimated net present value of $42.8 million, assuming a gold selling price of $650/oz. and a silver selling cost of $12/oz. The payback period for the capital costs is expected to be 41 months from January 1, 2008 without interest.
The Company is also evaluating the purchase of a used mining fleet. If the purchase price for the fleet was $15 million, this would be expected to reduce the unit mining costs by up to 25%.
On January 16, 2008, Allied Nevada announced the following developments related to the planned reactivation of the Hycroft Mine:
Allied Nevada has submitted a revised reclamation bond calculation reflecting the cost to mitigate current and future disturbance at the Hycroft Mine to the appropriate federal and state regulators. Management expects to receive approval of the final reclamation bond calculation in the first quarter of 2008. Promptly following receipt of this approval, Allied Nevada intends to begin leaching of historic mined and placed Brimstone ore. In addition, construction activities will begin in the field as required.
Allied Nevada has awarded the contract to design and construct the new gold and silver refinery to Summit Valley Engineering of Salt Lake City, Utah. The contract for the detailed design and quality assurance and quality control work for the expanded leach pad has been awarded to SRK of Reno, Nevada.
Allied Nevada personnel will operate the process facilities and provide technical, health and safety, environmental and general management support. Our total labor force is expected to be approximately 70 persons if contract mining is utilized. Approximately 140 employees would be required if we purchase our own mining fleet.
The critical constraints to achieving the scheduled gold production schedule include the timing of reclamation bond approval.
Based on historic drill data reviewed by Wilson Consulting, utilizing the guidelines prescribed by NI 43-101, proven and probable mineral reserves were determined within a design pit based on a $450 per ounce gold price employing a Lerchs-Grossman optimization. Gold recovery by heap leach is estimated at 56.6% for both proven and probable reserves.
* Represents the potential gold which would be recovered by using a cyanide process. It differs from a fire assay grade which is the total contained gold including cyanide soluble gold. The cyanide soluble gold varies by material type, but is approximately 70% of the fire assay grades for oxide mineralization.
The sulfide exploration program started in late August 2007 with one reverse circulation drill and was expanded to three reverse circulation drills and three core drills for the remainder of 2007 as part of this program. Allied Nevada drilled approximately 51,000 feet in 2007.
This drill program consists of wide spaced drilling (approximately 500 feet between drill holes) along the entire strike length of the major sulfide zones that are exposed beneath the historic mine workings at the Hycroft Mine. The combined strike length of these zones is over six miles. The current program envisions drilling approximately 150,000 feet. Drilling will be a combination of reverse circulation and core. Samples will be collected and assayed by one of two independent labs.
As of February 28, 2008, one hundred forty-three (143) drill holes have been completed at Hycroft since the program was initiated in August 2007, including 109 reverse circulation drill holes and 34 core holes for a total of 114,847 feet drilled. The holes were drilled to an average depth of approximately 800 feet.
Central Zone
Brimstone Zone
The analysis of the current drill results and historical geological information suggests that gold and silver mineralization is hosted along north-south trending zones of approximately 14,000 feet in length. These zones are partially defined laterally by post-mineral faults. The following individual zones, from west to east, currently recognized are: Camel, Cove, Central, Boneyard, Albert, Fire, Brimstone and Foothill. The expanded program is also planned to include further exploration of the Fire, Albert, Boneyard, Cove and Camel zones. There has been historic mine production from the Cove, Central and Brimstone zones. The other zones have been defined by historic drill holes and surface mapping.
Upon completion of a drill hole, the hole is surveyed and then plugged. Rock samples are collected from each of the drills on a daily basis. Samples are transported to one of two independent assay labs for sample preparation and the determination of contained gold and silver values. Over-all management of the drill program, sample collection and assay program is being carried out by Allied Nevada. Qualified independent consultants have reviewed all aspects of the exploration program. Qualified independent consultants will conduct regular reviews of the ongoing exploration program.
Historical Drilling
Approximately 3,100 exploration drill holes were completed and assayed for gold from 1985-1999. These holes were drilled along the known six miles of productive (mineralized) strike length on the Hycroft property. The distribution of silver mineralization, which provides significant value to the drill hole intersections, is not yet fully understood as historic drill holes were not assayed for the silver.
The chart below contains selected historical assay results:
SELECTED HISTORIC ASSAY RESULTS
Hycroft mine-Humboldt & Pershing Counties, Nevada, USA
Upon completion of the 2008 sulfide exploration drill program, and the review of the historical data, Allied Nevada intends to revise the sulfide mineralized material calculation estimate. We also plan to start metallurgical test work during 2008. This test work will focus on estimating gold and silver recovery that could be obtained from the sulfide material.
Management intends to continue exploration drilling on the sulfide system in 2009. We plan to conduct metallurgical testing as well as additional engineering work in 2009. We intend to complete a pre-feasibility study evaluating the economic viability of the sulfide project and anticipate completion of the study in 2010.
Any expansion of the Hycroft Mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our Hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan, will require us to obtain all permits, approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in Nevada.
Advanced Exploration Properties
Advanced Exploration Properties are those properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material. Allied Nevada currently has five properties in this category: Maverick Springs, Mountain View, Hasbrouck, Three Hills, and Wildcat.
We are currently evaluating these properties to determine how to best advance these projects by increasing the identified mineral resources, improving the quality of these mineral resources, or advancing the project to a development decision.
The following table summarizes material information concerning our Advanced Exploration Properties. The reader is directed to the more comprehensive information about these properties starting immediately following the summary table.
Advanced Exploration Properties
Summary Information
Maverick Springs
The Maverick Springs project is located in northeast Nevada at the southeast end of the Carlin Trend belt of gold-silver mineralization, approximately half-way between Elko and Ely, Nevada. The property consists of 246 claims with a total area of approximately 4,920 acres.
On October 7, 2002, Vista completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in the Maverick Springs gold and silver project from Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) and the Mountain View gold project (described below) from Newmont’s wholly-owned subsidiary Newmont Capital Limited (“Newmont Capital”). To acquire the interest in Maverick Springs, Vista paid cash of $250,000 and issued 141,243 equity units to Newmont, each unit comprised of one Vista share and one two-year Vista warrant. Newmont retained a 1.5% NSR, and on October 7, 2003, Vista issued to Newmont 122,923 Vista shares and 122,923 Vista warrants. All of the foregoing Vista warrants expired unexercised. In addition, pursuant to acquisition agreement terms Vista completed 34,060 feet of drilling as of October 7, 2004, and was required to complete an additional 15,940 feet of drilling before October 7, 2006; such drilling was completed in August 2006. Allied Nevada may terminate this agreement at any time. After October 7, 2006, Newmont had a one-time right to acquire a 51% interest in the Maverick Springs project, by paying to Allied Nevada twice the amount that Allied Nevada and, historically Vista, have spent on the project, including acquisition costs. In the event that Newmont exercises this right, Newmont would relinquish its 1.5% NSR. This one-time right expired 60 days after receipt of data on the property from Allied Nevada, which data was required to be delivered within 30 days of October 7, 2006. In January 2007, Newmont informed Vista that it would not be exercising this right.
Maverick Springs is subject to a lease agreement, between Newmont and Artemis Exploration Company. The lease was entered into on October 1, 2001, and the key terms include: payment of advance minimum royalties of $50,000 on October 1, 2003 (this has been paid) and advance minimum royalties of $100,000 on October 1, 2004 (this has been paid), $100,000 on October 1, 2005 (this has been paid) and each year thereafter
while the agreement is in effect; work commitments of 6,400 feet of exploration drilling, on or before October 1 in each of 2002 (extended by agreement to November 15, 2002), 2003 and 2004 (these commitments have been met), a preliminary economic evaluation to be conducted by October 1, 2004 which was extended to April 7, 2005 (this has been completed); and a net smelter returns royalty based on a sliding scale ranging from 2% to 6%, depending on gold and silver prices at the time of production.
On June 9, 2003, Vista entered into an agreement granting Silver Standard Resources Inc. (“SSRI”) an option to acquire its interest in the silver mineralized material hosted in the Maverick Springs project. Allied Nevada, as successor to Vista, will retain its 100% interest in the gold mineralized material. The agreement with SSRI is subject to the terms of the Newmont purchase agreement. Under the agreement, SSRI was to pay $1.5 million over four years, of which $949,823 was paid to Vista in 2003, $428,481 in 2004 and $144,285 in 2005, completing the $1.5 million obligation. Since SSRI has satisfied the $1.5 million obligation, all costs incurred for Maverick Springs are now being shared by the two corporations as stated below. SSRI and Vista formed a committee to jointly manage exploration of the Maverick Springs project. Allied Nevada, as successor to Vista, has a 45% vote on the committee, and SSRI is the operator and has a 55% vote. Since SSRI has completed its $1.5 million in payments, future costs will be shared by SSRI and Allied Nevada on the same ratio as established for operation of the management committee: Allied Nevada 45% / SSRI 55%, subject to standard dilution provisions.
Prior operators have conducted drilling on the Maverick Springs project. In November 2002, Vista completed a 7-hole reverse circulation drill program totalling 7,020 feet on the Maverick Springs project. The program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes, stepped out 500 feet to 2,200 feet from previously identified mineralization. All seven holes encountered flat-lying mineralization, predominantly oxidized to depths of up to 900 feet. The program outlined continuous mineralization in a 2,200-foot by 1,200-foot area, immediately adjacent to known gold-silver mineralization. With additional in-fill drilling, this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material.
In October 2003, Vista completed a 16-hole reverse circulation program totalling 14,015 feet, in October 2004, Vista completed a 13-hole reverse circulation program totalling 13,015 feet and in August 2006, Vista completed a 18-hole reverse circulation drill program totalling approximately 16,000 feet. Intercepts indicate the potential for bulk-mineable gold-silver mineralization.
Geology
Maverick Springs can be classified as a Carlin-type or sediment/carbonate hosted disseminated silver-gold deposit. Sediment hosted deposits are common within northern Nevada, although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver. Silver and gold mineralization at Maverick Springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch-shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit. The limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at 10-30o to the east and west. Overall, the mineralized zone is elongate in the north-south direction with a length of over 6,000 feet, a width of up to 3,000 feet, and a thickness of commonly 100-300 feet.
Mineralization consists of micron-sized silver and gold with related pyrite, stibnite and arsenic sulfides. It is usually associated with intense fracturing and brecciation, with or without accompanying whole-rock silicification or stockwork quartz.
Alteration consists of pervasive decalcification, weak to intense silicification and weak alunitic argillization. Massive jasperoid is common in surface exposures and in drill core. Oxidation has affected all sulfides on surface and is pervasive to a depth of at least 400 feet, intermittent to 900 feet, and generally absent below 1,000 feet.
Based on a third-party technical study completed on April 13, 2004, by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants of Vancouver, British Columbia, the Maverick Springs project contains approximately 69.6 million tons of mineralized material with an average grade of 0.01 ounces of gold per ton and 1.0 ounce of silver per ton at a silver-equivalent cut-off grade of 1.0 ounce of silver per ton.
On July 30, 2006, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants of Vancouver, British Columbia, issued a technical report describing the work done by it previously, and reporting drilling completed in 2004.
Mountain View
The Mountain View property is located in northwest Nevada near the Blackrock Desert. The property is approximately 15 miles northwest of Gerlach, Nevada in Washoe County; it straddles the boundary between the Squaw Valley and Banjo topographic quadrangles. The property currently consists of 128 claims with a total area of approximately 2,560 acres.
Vista’s acquisition of the Mountain View property was completed along with that of the Maverick Springs property, as described above. To acquire the interest in the Mountain View property, Vista paid cash of $50,000 and issued 56,497 equity units, each unit comprised of one Vista share and a two-year Vista warrant, to Newmont Capital, and Newmont Capital retains a 1.5% NSR. All of these Vista warrants expired unexercised. In addition, Vista completed 8,055 feet of drilling before October 7, 2004, as required by the underlying agreement. Allied Nevada may terminate this agreement at any time. After October 7, 2006, Newmont Capital had a one-time right to acquire a 51% interest in the project, by paying to Allied Nevada twice the amount that Allied Nevada, and historically Vista, have spent on the project, including acquisition costs. In the event that Newmont Capital were to exercise this right, Newmont Capital would relinquish its 1.5% NSR. This one-time right expired 60 days after receipt of data on the property from Allied Nevada, which data was required to be delivered within 30 days of October 7, 2006. In January 2007, Newmont Capital informed Vista that it would not be exercising this right.
Newmont Capital’s interest in the Mountain View property is subject to an underlying lease and two other royalty arrangements, the principal terms of which are: the underlying lease grants a 50% interest to Newmont in all claims, with a few exceptions where a 5% interest is granted; and the lessee may purchase the remaining interest in the claims for $250,000 at any time. The lessee is obligated to purchase the remaining 50% for $250,000 on achieving commercial production. Also, the lessee shall pay a 1% NSR during production, with advance minimum payments of $25,000 per year. Advanced royalties are deductible from the net smelter returns royalty and cease upon purchase of the remaining interest of the underlying lease. A 1% NSR also applies to certain other claims.
Prior operators have conducted drilling on the Mountain View property. Vista completed a five-hole reverse circulation program totalling 4,330 feet in November 2003. The results indicate the presence of a new zone of bulk mineralization approximately 200 feet east of the known core of mineralization. Vista completed a five-hole reverse circulation program totalling 4,070 feet in 2004, and the results indicate potential bulk-mineable gold mineralization and the down-dip extension of higher-grade gold mineralization.
Geology
The dominant rock types in the area are Miocene volcanics and interbedded volcaniclastic sediments. Minor greenschist facies Permo-Triassic strata occur to the northeast and a large body of granodiorite makes up the bulk of the Granite Range to the east and south.
The Miocene lithologies consist of mafic tuffs, rhyolite tuffs and flows, volcaniclastic sediments and basalts. These units are separated from the Granite Range to the east by a range front normal fault that dips steeply to the southwest. The Severance deposit is hosted by a unit known as the Severance rhyolite that is sandwiched between the range front fault to the northeast and older Tertiary tuffs, flows and volcaniclastic sediments to the southwest.
Structure on the property is dominated by northwest and northeast trending faults. Major fault offsets occur along the range-front fault system and these are offset by the northeast trending structures. Recent alluvium is offset by the range front faults.
Based on a third-party technical study completed December 17, 2002, by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants of Vancouver, British Columbia, the Mountain View project contains approximately 23.2 million tons of gold mineralized material with an average grade of 0.013 ounces of gold per ton at a cut-off grade of 0.006 ounces of gold per ton.
On July 31, 2006, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants of Vancouver, British Columbia, issued a technical report describing the work done by it previously, and reporting drilling completed in 2003 and 2004.
Hasbrouck
The Hasbrouck property is located in southwestern Nevada about 5 miles south-southwest of the town of Tonopah in Esmeralda County, Nevada, adjacent to U.S. Highway 95 and approximately half-way between Reno and Las Vegas. The property consists of 22 patented lode mining claims and 61 unpatented lode claims that cover an area of approximately 1,300 acres.
On May 23, 2003, Vista executed a purchase agreement with Newmont Capital, which includes both the Hasbrouck property and the Three Hills property, which lies approximately 4.5 miles to the north-northwest. Terms of the purchase included a $50,000 cash payment on signing and $200,000 or, at Vista’s discretion, the equivalent in Vista shares one year after signing. In June and July 2004, Vista issued to Newmont Capital an aggregate 50,475 Vista shares at a deemed per share price of $3.96. The value of the Vista shares was based on the average AMEX closing price of the Vista shares over the ten-trading-day period ending one day before the first anniversary of the agreement. Newmont Capital, at its option, will retain either: (a) a 2% NSR in each project together with the right to a $500,000 cash payment at the start of commercial production at either project and a further $500,000 cash payment if, after the start of commercial production, the gold price averages $400 per ounce or more for any three-month period; or (b) the right to acquire 51% of either or both projects. The latter right would be exercisable only after the later of four years or the time when Allied Nevada, and historically Vista, have incurred aggregate expenditures of $1.0 million to acquire, explore and hold the projects and would include Newmont Capital paying to Allied Nevada cash equaling 200% of the expenditures made by Allied Nevada, and historically Vista, on the related property. In this event, Newmont Capital would become operator of a joint venture with Allied Nevada, and both parties would fund the project through to a production decision. Allied Nevada’s contribution to the joint venture during this period is capped at $5.0 million, $3.0 million of which Newmont Capital would finance for Allied Nevada and recover, with interest, exclusively from related project cash flows. Allied Nevada would also grant Newmont Capital a right of first offer with respect to subsequent sale of the projects by Allied Nevada. An additional 1.5% NSR on the Hasbrouck property is held by a private party.
Geology
The property is located on Hasbrouck Mountain, which is thought to lie along the western edge of a caldera. The mountain is underlain by gently dipping ash-flow, air-fall and waterlain tuffs and volcaniclastic sediments of the Miocene Siebert Formation. Several occurrences of chalcedonic sinter deposits occur near the summit of the mountain. Gold and silver mineralization in the Hasbrouck deposit appears to have formed relatively close to the paleo-surface in an epithermal, hot spring environment. The mineralization is concentrated in the Siebert Formation, in units stratigraphically below the chalcedonic sinter deposits that are exposed near the top of Hasbrouck Mountain. Two zones of mineralization are presently defined. The “Main” zone includes the bulk of mineralization at Hasbrouck, while the small “South Adit” zone lies 700 to 1000 feet to the south of the “Main” zone.
A third-party technical study was completed for Vista by MDA of Reno, Nevada on August 29, 2003. The Hasbrouck study was developed using data from 54,339 feet of drilling, principally comprised of 105 reverse circulation holes totaling 44,400 feet and 22 rotary drill holes totaling 8,980 feet. The drilling database was compiled from work performed by FMC Gold Co., Cordex Syndicate and Franco Nevada Inc. between 1974 and 1988. Based on this study, mineralized material above a cut-off of 0.010 ounces of gold per ton is 20.3 million tons with an average grade of 0.023 ounces of gold per ton and 0.32 ounces of silver per ton.
On August 14, 2006, MDA of Reno, Nevada, issued a technical report describing the work done by it previously.
Three Hills
Three Hills is located in southwestern Nevada about 1 mile west of the town of Tonopah in Esmeralda County, Nevada, and about 4.5 miles northwest of the Hasbrouck property described above. Three Hills consists of 15 unpatented lode claims totalling approximately 201 acres.
On May 23, 2003, Vista executed a purchase agreement with Newmont Capital, which included both the Hasbrouck property and the Three Hills property. The terms of this agreement are detailed under the Hasbrouck description above.
Geology
Three Hills is located in the Walker Lane structural domain of the Basin and Range physiographic province. It is in an area of structural disruption resulting from a series of orogenic events occurring in Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic times. Basin and Range high-angle normal faults control the mineralization at Three Hills, where they cut the Siebert Formation. Gold mineralization occurs in a zone of pervasive silicification and in the Siebert Formation and the upper 10 to 30 feet of the Fraction Tuff. The contact between these two units contains consistently higher grades of gold and is more commonly argillized than silicified.
MDA of Reno, Nevada, completed a third-party technical study for Vista on August 29, 2003. The Three Hills study included data from 62,874 feet of drilling, comprised of 183 reverse circulation holes totaling 54,657 feet, 45 air-track and rotary holes totaling 6,320 feet and 9 diamond drill holes totaling 1,897 feet. The drilling was completed by Echo Bay Mines Ltd., Eastfield Resources, Saga Exploration and Cordex Syndicate between 1974 and 1996. Based on this study, gold mineralized material above a cut-off of 0.01 ounces of gold per ton was 5.7 million tons with an average grade of 0.023 ounces of gold per ton.
On August 14, 2006, MDA of Reno, Nevada, issued a technical report describing the work done by it previously.
Wildcat
Wildcat is located about 35 miles northwest of Lovelock and 26 miles south of the Hycroft Brimstone Open Pit Mine in Pershing County, Nevada. The project consists of 125 unpatented claims and 4 patented claims, comprising 2.500 acres.
During September and October 2003, Vista concluded due diligence reviews and executed formal purchase agreements to acquire the Wildcat project and the associated exploration data in three separate transactions. On September 23, 2003, Vista purchased 71 unpatented mining claims from Monex Exploration, a partnership, for $200,000 on signing and $300,000 on August 11, 2004. On commencement of commercial production, Allied Nevada will make a one-time production payment in the amount of $500,000. Thirteen of the claims are subject to an underlying 0.4% NSR, and the remaining 58 claims are subject to an underlying 1% NSR.
On October 12, 2003, Vista purchased a 100% interest in the Vernal unpatented mining claim from David C. Mough and Jody Ahlquist Mough for $50,000 on signing and $50,000 on October 1, 2004, for a total consideration of $100,000.
On October 28, 2003, Vista purchased four patented mining claims and exploration data from Sagebrush Exploration, Inc. (“Sagebrush”) for 50,000 Vista Shares issued and delivered to Sagebrush upon the closing
of the transaction. The four patented claims are subject to an underlying net smelter returns royalty of 1% for gold production between 500,000 and 1,000,000 ounces, increasing to 2% on production in excess of 1,000,000 ounces.
Geology
Wildcat lies in the Seven Troughs Range which is underlain by Triassic and Jurassic sedimentary rocks and has been intruded by Cretaceous granodiorite. Volcanic domes and plugs of rhyolite, quartz latite, trachyte, and andesite have been emplaced by Tertiary volcanism. Tertiary flows of pyroclastic debris, and vitrophyres of rhyolite, quartz latite, trachyte, and andesite composition blanket much of the area. The property contains structurally controlled epithermal gold and silver mineralization identified in four areas: Hero/Tag, Main, Northeast and Knob 32. The four areas have generally similar geology and mineralization with precious metals mineralization spatially associated with the contact between granodiorite and overlying tuff. Gold mineralization occurs with low-temperature silica, chalcedony and pyrite. The Main, Northeast, and Knob 32 deposits appear to be part of the Hero/Tag deposit, though structurally displaced.
The principal low-grade zone that essentially encompassed all the mineralization is tabular and dips gently to the southeast. There appear to be two main styles of mineralization based on mapping, sampling, and statistics. There is a broad, low-grade zone surrounding higher-grade material. The principal host is the tuff in which the low-grade precious metal mineralization is represented by pervasive and intense silicification. The underlying granodiorite also contains a low-grade disseminated style of mineralization with higher grade silicified breccias occurring generally as stockwork within it. Generally, the granodiorite has higher grade and is not silicified. Any silicification is restricted to adjacent veins and veinlets, occasionally being discrete veins as were exploited historically, but also resulting in a large-tonnage stockwork. All of the tuff was altered by epithermal solutions; however, much of the granodiorite is unaltered. High-grade material includes multi-episodic chalcedonic silica veins and breccias.
On November 11, 2003, MDA of Reno, Nevada completed a third-party technical study for Vista. Using data from one underground channel sample, 245 reverse circulation drill holes and 11 diamond drill holes totaling 95,466 feet, gold mineralized material above a cut-off grade of 0.010 ounces of gold per ton was estimated at 38.1 million tons grading 0.018 ounces of gold per ton and 0.16 ounces of silver per ton.
On August 14, 2006, MDA of Reno, Nevada, issued a technical report describing the work done by it previously.
Other Exploration Properties
Other Exploration Properties are those properties that are not Development Properties or Advanced Exploration Properties. In general, these properties either do not have sufficient work completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material or we do not have a significant controlling interest or joint venture on the property.
Most of these properties have been optioned and leased to other exploration companies in return for production royalties averaging approximately 2.6% advance minimum royalties and, on some of the properties, work commitments. The contractual royalty payments are planned to be approximately $4 million in 2008 and contribute funding for our exploration, development and other corporate activities. For the properties under lease, the lessee is also responsible for making the land payments including the U. S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) fees and county property tax payments.
The Contact property is one of the more significant properties within this category. Allied Nevada owns wholly or in fractional interest 110 patented claims in the Contact mining district in northeast Elko County, Nevada. We also staked 307 unpatented claims adjacent to the patented claims in early July 2007. The new
unpatented claims are contiguous to our 110 patented claims in the district as well as contiguous to patented and unpatented claims held by International Enexco Ltd. Data are being compiled and a field evaluation involving mapping and sampling is planned to better understand the economic potential of the district. There are no royalties associated with our ownership of both the patented and unpatented mining claims.
BLM filing fees and county property tax payments were paid for approximately 10,570 unpatented mining claims held by Allied Nevada. We paid the BLM and county fees for approximately 4,970 claims and strategic partners paid the fees for the remaining 5,600 claims.
Discussions have been initiated with various lessees to renegotiate agreements with terms that are in alignment with our corporate exploration objectives. We will pursue other strategic options that could include exploration joint ventures, royalty agreements, or the sale or release of the mineral property.
The following table summarizes material information concerning our Other Exploration Properties. The reader is directed to the more comprehensive information about the Contact and Pony Creek and Elliot Dome/Carlin Trend properties starting immediately following the summary table.

Contact District
Allied Nevada, through the acquisition from Vista of the F. W. Lewis, Inc. properties, owns wholly or in fractional interest 110 patented claims in the Contact mining district in northeast Elko County, Nevada. We also staked 307 unpatented claims adjacent to the patented claims in early July 2007. There are no royalties associated with our ownership of both the patented and unpatented mining claims.
The small settlement of Contact is located approximately 52 miles north of Wells, Nevada and 16 miles south of Jackpot, Nevada. The mining district is immediately west of the town of Contact and extends for several miles west and southwest of town. The mining district, referred to as either the “Contact” or “Salmon River” district, was discovered in the early 1870s and was first worked for gold and silver. However, copper was soon discovered and the vast majority of the historic work in the district has been directed toward the development and production of copper ores. Early work in the district was hampered by the inaccessibility of the area and the resultant high shipping costs for any ore produced. The later construction of the railroad eliminated this problem, but falling copper prices in the 1930s caused the district to cease production. The district saw a renewed period of activity in the 1940s and early 1950s, but little true exploration work was done and most efforts were directed toward mining already known ore deposits. More recently, various companies have looked at the district for precious metals in the 1980s and 1990s, and higher copper and molybdenum prices have recently renewed interest in those prospects.
Geology
The area is underlain by a granodiorite batholith and related rocks of Mesozoic age which intruded a Late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of shale and limestone. Contact metamorphism and metasomatism produced skarns and hornfels in the sediments up to a mile away from the contact zone. High-grade precious and base metal mineralization occurs along these contact metamorphic zones. The intrusion of the porphyry and alaskite was apparently centered near the North Contact Zone. This intrusion further metamorphosed the sedimentary rocks and culminated in a wave of copper mineralization that not only affected the contact zones, but mineralized masses of porphyry and alaskite.
Various companies, including Phelps Dodge Company in the early 1970s and Golden Phoenix in the early 1990s and their engineering and geological staffs have estimated the mineralization in the district and published historic mineralization estimates. These estimates are based on drilling primarily in and around the Banner Zone, the center of which is located approximately one mile west-northwest of town. There has been recent drilling in the Zone by another company and Allied Nevada controls patented claims on the west and east ends of the Banner Zone. Although Allied Nevada has not conducted any drilling on the property, our geologic staff is in the process of evaluating the potential of the district and will review business opportunities that might develop.
Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property
The Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property is located in the Larrabee mining district of Elko County, Nevada, in the southern half of the Carlin Trend, 28 miles southeast of the town of Carlin and 19 miles south of Newmont Gold Company’s Rain Mine.
The Pony Creek/Elliot Dome Property consists of 895 unpatented lode mining claims (approximately 17,900 acres). The property is located across the crest of the southern part of the Pinyon Range at elevations ranging from 6,600 feet to about 8,000 feet. Access to the property from the west is by traveling the Indian Pony road off State Highway 278, or from the east via the Red Rock Ranch road off a junction with State highway 228.
Pursuant to an agreement with the Pescios, Mill City owns a 100% interest in the property and was to pay the Pescios a NSR of 3%. Escalating annual property payments would have to be made to the Pescios and Mill City may purchase 1.0% of the 3.0% NSR for a total of $1 million. Mill City must also pay annual rentals to the BLM of $125 per claim on or before September 1 of each year and appropriate county filing fees to the Elko County Recorder on or before November 1 of each year.
If the conditions stated in the option agreement signed July 27, 2004 between Grandview, Mill City and the Pescios are satisfied, then the NSR will be reduced to 2% and Grandview will be given the option to purchase 1% of the 2% NSR, up to the time of commencement of production from the property for $1.5 million.
Pursuant to this option agreement with Mill City on July 27, 2004, Grandview Gold Inc. earned an option to purchase a 60% interest in the property and committed to spend a minimum of $3.5 million by July 31, 2007, complete a minimum of 30,000 feet of drilling on the Pony Creek and Elliot Dome properties and assume all BLM and County fees with respect to the property. By an amendment agreement dated December 17, 2004, the Pescios agreed that their right to receive cash payments will cease if the Grandview option agreement is terminated and will remain suspended until the property is re-optioned.
Prior to commencement of any surface disturbance, permits must be obtained from the BLM which permits exploration activities and a reclamation bond must also be posted.
Newmont Exploration Ltd. (“Newmont Exploration”) conducted regional exploration programs in search of additional gold deposits along the Carlin trend. In 1980 a stream-sediment sampling program identified anomalous gold and arsenic associated with an altered rhyolite body at what is now the Pony Creek Property. Newmont located 100 claims in 1980 to cover the prospect and located 80 more claims in 1982 to cover additional ground. Newmont began drilling in 1981 and conducted drill programs through 1985. Newmont
conducted additional drilling campaigns in 1987 and 1989 with limited success. An option was acquired by Westmont Mining, Inc. in 1990, and in April of 1993 Quest International Management Services, Inc. (formerly Ramrod Gold, Inc.) acquired Westmont. Quest then joint ventured the property with Uranerz U.S.A., Inc. in 1994. Uranerz drilled a total of 15 holes in 1994-1995 before terminating the JV in 1995. In 1997 Quest purchased Newmont’s remaining interest in the property and signed a JV agreement with Barrick. Four holes were drilled by Barrick before they terminated the agreement in 1998. In 1999, Quest International Resources was acquired by Standard Mining Co. and it abandoned the Pony Creek property. Mr. Pescio acquired Pony Creek by staking claims in the fall of 1999. Homestake optioned the property shortly afterward. A year later, after drilling 5 reverse circulation drill holes, Homestake terminated their agreement with Mr. Pescio. Nevada Contact Inc. optioned the property from the Pescios in 2001 and drilled 8 holes before terminating the agreement in early 2003. In July 2003, Mill City optioned the property from the Pescios.
As part of the Arrangement, Allied Nevada acquired the Pescios’ interest in the Pony Creek Property from the Pescios. Allied Nevada is now the holder of a royalty on the claims, and holds contractual rights that may in certain circumstances require the record owner to transfer ownership of the claims to Allied Nevada.
Geology
Most of the property is comprised of dry, sagebrush- and grass-covered hills with a few juniper and pinyon pines. The climate is favorable for year-round mining and exploration may be done from May through November.
Power for a modern mill can be brought in from the vicinity of Elko, but ranch power is available only a few miles away. Water is not available on the surface, but was encountered in most of the reverse circulation drill holes. Water may also be present in sufficient quantities in the nearby valleys to the east and west. The claims carry with them the surface rights for mining. Although the area is hilly, sufficient flat areas are present in the property area for potential processing plant sites, tailings storage areas, waste disposal areas and leach pads.
The Pony Creek property lies along the axis of a regional Mesozoic anticline that parallels the crest of the Pinyon Range. The project area is within a zone of convergence of two major structural trends which are the boundaries of a north-south series of grabens and half grabens collectively referred to as the Pinyon Graben. A series of Tertiary felsic intrusives have been emplaced at various points along this structural zone.
The lithologies of the region include the allochthonous, eugeoclinal, siliceous western assemblage, the autochthonous, miogeoclinal, eastern carbonate assemblage and the mixed overlap assemblage. The Late Devonian Early Mississippian Roberts Mountain Thrust and the post Pinyon Anticline, Mesozoic thrust faults have moved the western assemblage and a significant portion of the overlap series over the eastern facies. Other important stratigraphic units of the region are Mississippian through Pennsylvanian clastics of the overlap assemblage which overlie both autochthonous and allochthonous units of the Roberts Mountains Thrust. Younger Late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian clastics disconformably overlie the overlap assemblage.
In the Pinyon Range, high-angle northeast and northwest trending faults and north trending faults, all with oblique displacement, and a younger set of east trending normal faults, are important elements in the structural framework of the region. A Tertiary-age wrench faulting event, characterized by strike-slip faulting and intrusion of felsic rocks into graben faults, probably contributed to the emplacement of gold deposits into the Pinyon Graben.
Gold mineralization in the Bowl area is related to felsite breccias. The porphyritic phase consists of a series of rocks from feldspar porphyry to quartz porphyry and ranges in color from white to medium gray. The fragmental unit contains up to 5% of 1 to 2 mm diameter rounded and embayed quartz phenocrysts and feldspar phenocrysts in a white to light gray, fine-grained, ash-rich, clastic matrix. The dark colored felsite is very similar to the feldspar porphyry except that the aphanitic felsite is often nearly black. Porphyritic felsite appears to be interbedded with the fragmental felsite in gently dipping tabular masses up to 100 thick. In the Pot Holes area a
lens of fragmental felsite approximately 60 feet thick intersects the low-angle fault that is at the base of the Robinson Thrust plate. The felsite breccias of the Bowl area may be fault breccia to explosion breccias. The breccia fragments are of variable lithology, reportedly including sediment fragments. The matrix, which is generally altered, consists of fragmental felsite and is termed a “sandy” rhyolite. The breccias are mineralized in the Bowl area and possibly are important hosts in other parts of the property.
Alteration within the rhyolite intrusive includes classic quartz-sericite-pyrite (Qsp) associated with north and northeast trending shears. The shear zones are fragmental and brecciated and contain very fine-grained quartz, sericite and pyrite/goethite, both as disseminations and on fractures. Away from the shear zones the rhyolite gradually becomes fresher, grading outward from relict feldspar ghosts into porphyritic rhyolite. In the center of the intrusive along the east flank of Rhyolite Hill, as well as in some other areas, the intrusive has a granular texture and feldspars have been altered, leaving open clay-filled vugs. The sanded rhyolite consists of medium-grained rounded clasts of glassy rhyolite breccia occurring near the margins and at the base of the intrusive, and locally as narrow stockwork zones in the intrusive. The distribution and texture of the sanded rhyolite suggest that the unit formed in vitric chill margins and apparently was partially fluidized by subsequent hydrothermal activity. Sediments along the margins of the intrusive and immediately beneath the rhyolite have been silicified, decalcified and sulfidized and, in and around the mineralized cells, have been extensively oxidized (hypogene). Sediments also occur as xenoliths throughout the rhyolite and can be observed in outcrop and in subsurface. The margins of the xenoliths are usually partially absorbed and most contacts are gradational.
Recent Developments
Madison Enterprise Corp. Exercise of Option to Acquire Company’s Battle Mountain Property
On December 31, 2007 Madison Enterprise Corp. (“Madison”) exercised its option under an Exploration Agreement to acquire our Battle Mountain property consisting of 360 unpatented mining claims in Lander County, Nevada by paying Allied Nevada $2.0 million. Under the terms of the Exploration Agreement, Allied Nevada retained a NSR of 5% for gold and silver and 4% for other minerals. Additionally, Madison is required to pay an AMR of $60,000 annually subject to adjustment for inflation, which amount was paid together with Madison’s option exercise described above. Madison has an option in the Exploration Agreement to purchase the NSR for payment of $4.0 million subject to an annual escalation.
Proposed Sale of Company’s 50% Interest in Hamilton-Treasure Hill Mineral Property
Allied Nevada has accepted an offer to sell its 50% interest in the Hamilton-Treasure Hill mineral property consisting of 106 patented and 112 unpatented mining claims for $1.0 million. Under terms of the agreement, Allied Nevada retained a NSR of 1%, which is subject to a buyout for a payment of $0.5 million in the first 24 months from closing escalating thereafter to a maximum of $3.0 million.
Government Regulation of Mining-Related Activities
Property Interests and Mining Claims
Our exploration activities are conducted in the state of Nevada. Mineral interests may be owned in this state by (a) the United States, (b) the state itself, or (c) private parties. Where prospective mineral properties are owned by private parties, or by the state, some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for Allied Nevada to explore or develop such property. Generally, these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production. Other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements. Where prospective mineral properties are held by the United States, mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land. If the statutory requirements for the location of a mining claim are met, the locator obtains a valid
possessory right to develop and produce minerals from the claim. The right can be freely transferred and, provided that the locator is able to prove the discovery of locatable minerals on the claims, is protected against appropriation by the government without just compensation. The claim locator also acquires the right to obtain a patent or fee title to his claim from the federal government upon compliance with certain additional procedures.
Mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests. Additionally, mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained and therefore, possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim. If the validity of a patented mining claim is challenged by the BLM or the U.S. Forest Service on the grounds that mineralization has not been demonstrated, the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon. Such a challenge might be raised when a patent application is submitted or when the government seeks to include the land in an area to be dedicated to another use.
Reclamation
We generally are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
Allied Nevada’s principal reclamation liability is at the Hycroft Mine. On December 28, 2006, Vista put in place a new bond of $7.5 million through its insurance backed financial assurance program that includes a mine reclamation policy and a pollution legal liability policy, which is expected to cover anticipated reclamation costs for the existing disturbance at the Hycroft Mine. The estimated additional bond costs for future activities have been calculated at $3 million.
Government Regulation
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that Allied Nevada is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in the Nevada and United States and in any other jurisdiction in which we will operate. We are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to Allied Nevada with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
Environmental Regulation
Our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that Allied Nevada’s operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Nevada, where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
During 2006 and 2007, there were no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by Allied Nevada. Allied Nevada did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2006 or 2007.
