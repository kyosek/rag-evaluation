ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company's Common Stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol "LDVK.PK." The market for the Company's Common Stock is limited, volatile and sporadic and the price of the Company's Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results, news announcements, trading volume, sales of Common Stock by officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Company, general market trends, changes in the supply and demand for the Company's shares, and other factors. Our Common Stock was not traded on any exchange or quoted on any quotation service in 2006. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for each quarter relating to the Company's Common Stock for the last two fiscal years. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, markdown, or commissions, and may not reflect actual transactions.
Fiscal 2007 High Low ----------- ---- --- First Quarter (1) $ 10.00 $ 5.50 Second Quarter (1) $ 15.00 $ 5.50 Third Quarter (1) $ 6.00 $ .675 Fourth Quarter (1) $ 1.25 $ .080
Fiscal 2008 High Low ----------- ---- --- First Quarter (1) $ .65 $ .02 Second Quarter (1) $ .40 $ .04 Third Quarter (1) $ .40 $ .04 Fourth Quarter (1) $ .19 $ .01
Fiscal 2009 High Low ----------- ---- --- First Quarter (2) $ .130 $ .0100 Second Quarter (1) $ .020 $ .0021 Third Quarter (1) $ .015 $ .0023 Fourth Quarter (1) $ .012 $ .0024
- ---------- (1) This represents the closing bid information for the stock on the Pink Sheets. The bid and ask quotations represent prices between dealers and do not include retail markup, markdown or commission. They do not represent actual transactions and have not been adjusted for stock dividends or splits. (2) This represents the closing price for the stock on the Pink Sheets.
Our common stock is considered a "penny stock." The application of the "penny stock" rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. The Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093 dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
HOLDERS
As of August 16, 2010, there were approximately 125 shareholders of record of the Company's Common Stock.
DIVIDENDS
The Company has not declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock or preferred stock during the last two fiscal years and does not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future. There are no material restrictions limiting or that are likely to limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on its outstanding securities.
RECENT ISSUANCE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES
On August 17, 2007, the Company effected a 2:1 forward stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The share numbers below have been adjusted for such stock split. Since October 20, 2006, the Company has issued the following common stock without registration under the Securities Act of 1933:
On February 7, 2007 the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine entered an order confirming the December 12, 2006 agreement with the Debtor whereby, there were 40,000,000 (post forward stock split) unrestricted shares of the Company's Common Stock issued to creditors and plan participants.
On June 19, 2007, the Company issued 24,196 common shares for the acquisition of CyberSentry. This investment was assessed to have no value.
On July 30, 2007, the Company issued 2,055,710 shares of common stock to unrelated parties for $10,000 in services.
October 1, 2007, the Company issued 4,325,000 shares of common stock for $64,875 which was for repayment of advisory fees payable to a related party, Ludvik Nominees Pty Ltd., an entity controlled by Frank Kristan, who at time of issuance was the President of the Company.

June 27, 2008, the Company issued 3,069,269 shares of common stock for $44,375 which was for repayment of advisory fees payable to a related party, Ludvik Nominees Pty Ltd.
On February 1, 2009, the Company issued 5,000,000 common shares to an unrelated party, for $50,000 in services.
From May 31, 2010 through July 30, 2010 the Company sold 29,000,000 Common Shares for $290,000.
The Company did not utilize or engage a principal underwriter in connection with any of the above securities transactions. The 40,000,000 shares issued on February 7, 2007, were issued based on a court order issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maine, Case No. 04-20328, issued pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, and, therefore, did not require registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Management believes that, except for the 40,000,000 shares issued pursuant to the bankruptcy preceding, all of above shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of SavWatt USA, Inc. (f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc.
(A Development Stage Company):
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of operations and cash flows from inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations. These issues raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Ludvik Capital, Inc. (hereinafter "the Company") was incorporated on October 20, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of becoming a successor corporation by merger with Patriot Advisors, Inc. and Templar Corporation, pursuant to a plan of reorganization and merger approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maine in Case No. 04-20328 whereby Ludvik Capital, Inc is the continuing entity.
The Company's business plan consisted of investing in public and private companies, providing long term equity and debt investment capital to fund growth and acquisitions and recapitalizations of small and middle market companies in a variety of industries primarily located in the United States.
Since inception, the Company has had minimal operations and no revenues earned.
On April 5, 2010, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to SavWatt USA, Inc.
SavWatt USA, Inc. ("SavWatt") business plan is to capitalize on the largely unaddressed commercial and consumer market for energy-efficient LED lighting by investing in product and corporate marketing. With public relations and advertising throughout the media, a recognized, popular consumer LED brand will be cultivated, spearheading and establishing a leading market share in the growing energy-efficient bulb sector during the next three to five years.

SavWatt USA, Inc. f/k/a Ludvik Capital, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS From Inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2007
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Development Stage Activities The Company has been in the development stage since its formation and has not realized any revenue from operations. The Company is a shell corporation which is currently engaged in starting up the business of offering LED lighting for consumers
Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $26,161,720 for the period from inception, October 20, 2006 through December 31, 2007. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $26,161,720 at December 31, 2007. Since its inception, the Company has not generated any revenues and has minimal cash resources.
These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management's efforts have been directed towards the development and implementation of a plan to generate sufficient revenues to cover all of its present and future costs and expenses.
Management is taking steps to address this situation. The Company has determined that it cannot continue with its business operations as outlined in its original business plan because of a lack of financial resources; therefore, management has redirected their focus towards identifying and pursuing options regarding the development of a new business plan and direction. The Company intends to explore various business opportunities that have the potential to generate positive revenue, profits and cash flow in order to financially accommodate the costs of being a publicly held company. The Company is in the process of raising capita by implementing its business plan in Led lighting and expects to generate sufficient revenue by the fourth quarter of 2010 with a positive cash flow. Until then, the Company the Company will not have the required capital resources or credit lines available that are sufficient to fund operations.
The Company has minimal operating costs and expenses at the present time due to its limited business activities. The Company, however, will be required to raise additional capital over the next twelve months to meet its current administrative expenses, and it may do so in connection with or in anticipation of possible acquisition transactions. This financing may take the form of additional sales of its equity securities and/or loans from its directors. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available, if required, or on terms favorable to the Company.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments may include cash, subscription receivable, loans payable and related accrued interest, and accounts payable. All such instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and, (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has not earned any revenue since inception.
Use of Estimates The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.
Provision for Taxes Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe the Company has met the "more likely than not" standard to allow recognition of such an asset.
Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated on the weighted effect of all common shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share, which is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation, plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding, is not presented separately as it is anti-dilutive.
The average number of common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been retroactively adjusted for the 2:1 forward stock split effective August 17, 2007.
Stock Based Compensation - The Company accounts for stock based compensation transactions with employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 718, "Compensation, Stock Compensation" ("Topic No. 718"). Topic No. 718 requires the

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of the Company's equity instruments are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. In addition, the calculation of equity-based compensation costs requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited during the vesting period. The fair value of equity-based awards granted to employees is amortized over the vesting period of the award and the Company elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of Topic No. 718.
The Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees" ("Topic No. 505-50"). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, which ever is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of the equity instrument is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, the Company recognizes an asset or expense in the same manner as if it was to receive cash for the goods or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.
Forward stock split All references to the Company's outstanding shares, and options, have been adjusted to give effect to the 2 for 1 forward stock split effective August 17, 2007.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Affecting the Company The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. At that date, the ASC became FASB's officially recognized source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applicable to all public and non-public non-governmental entities, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is considered non-authoritative. The switch to the ASC affects the way companies refer to U.S. GAAP in financial statements and accounting policies. Citing particular content in the ASC involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the Topic, Subtopic, Section and Paragraph structure.
In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-08--Technical Corrections to Various Topics. This update's purpose is to eliminate GAAP inconsistencies, update outdated provisions, and provide needed clarifications. The adoption of ASU No. 2010-08 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value

NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued)
measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity's own assumptions.
The Company did not have any Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
The Company discloses the estimated fair values for all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value short-term financial instruments including subscriptions receivable, loans payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to their short-term duration.
In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," effective for January 1, 2008. This guidance expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value option for any of its qualifying financial instruments
NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the Company had a deferred tax asset of approximately $130,000 and $41,000, respectively calculated at a combined federal and state expected rate of 38%. As management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been recorded.
The significant components of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 are as follows:
December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 ---------- ---------- Deferred tax asset-net operating losses $ 41,000 $ 7,000 Accrued compensation 89,000 34,000 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance (130,000) (41,000) ---------- ----------
