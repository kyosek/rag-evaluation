BOND MORTGAGES
Each of the Properties is subject to a note together with a related first mortgage or deed of trust on that Property in principal amount up to 65% of the Partnership's purchase price of that Property (a "Bond Mortgage"), which was granted by the Partnership to United States Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee") (or, in the case of a deed of trust, to a deed of trust for the benefit of the Trustee) for the benefit of the holders of the Partnership's Escalating Rate Collateralized Mortgage Bonds due November 30, 1997 (the "Bonds"). The aggregate principal amount of Bonds outstanding as of March 15, 1996 was $16,452,000 and the Bonds are cross collateralized by all three properties. As of that date, the principal amount of the Bond Mortgages, on the Searcy Property, the Valencia Property and the Green Valley Property were $2,632,500, $7,523,500 and $6,296,000, respectively.
The Bonds bear interest, payable semi-annually, from the date of issuance at annual rates increasing from 8.15 percent to 10 percent (9.50 percent, 9.25 percent and 9.0 percent at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively) and mature on November 30, 1997. The Bonds have an effective interest rate of 9.66 percent.

The holders of the Bonds have a first lien on the Properties through the Bond Mortgages. The bond discount is amortized using the effective interest method.

Although 78% of the current leases expire in the next three years, the General Partner believes that it will be successful in either renewing these leases or originating new leases for these spaces. However, no assurance can be given that the Partnership will be successful at this, and if so, whether the terms of the leases will be advantageous to the Partnership.
Real estate taxes on the Green Valley Property are based on a primary tax rate of 7.3037% per $100 of assessed value and a secondary tax rate of 4.5779% per $100 of assessed value.

Real estate taxes are subject to increases in the future that may result from reassessment and/or increases in the tax rate.
The Partnership's adjusted federal income tax basis for the Green Valley Property is $9,803,000, of which $5,100,000 is allocated to land and $4,703,000 to the buildings and improvements. The Partnership depreciates the cost of the buildings over 31.5 years and improvements over 5 years using the straight-line method of cost recovery. In the opinion of the General Partner, the Green Valley Property is adequately insured.
The Green Valley Property has been experiencing leasing problems in the face of an increasingly difficult and overbuilt market. The strong competition combined with the limited trade area required capital improvements in 1995 and 1994 at the Property which were primarily cosmetic in nature (such as canopies, painting, new signage and general appearance) in order to attract new tenants and maintain the existing tenants. To increase occupancy, the Partnership has had to negotiate rent reductions on lease renewals and has had to lower the average effective rental on new leases. During 1993 and 1994, the General Partner determined, based on the current market conditions and projected future cash flows that the Green Valley Property had experienced declines in market value that were other than temporary and recorded $1,000,000 and $1,085,932 non-cash charges against earnings in 1993 and 1994, respectively, to write down the Property. In 1995, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for Impairment for Long-Lived Assets" (issued March 1995), the General Partner determined that an additional write down of the Property was not necessary based on the projected future cash flows of the Property.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Under various Federal, State and local laws and ordinances and regulations, an owner, operator or developer of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances (including asbestos containing materials) on or in such property. Such laws, ordinances and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of any required remediation of any property and the owner's, operator's or developer's liability therefor is generally not limited under such laws, ordinances and regulations, and could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner, operator or developer. While none of the Properties is presently subject to any environmental actions, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent the Properties or to borrow using any of the Properties as collateral.
