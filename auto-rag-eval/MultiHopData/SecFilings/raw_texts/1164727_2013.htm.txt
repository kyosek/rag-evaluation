Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
North America
Nevada, USA. We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.
On February 11, 2014, the sale of our Midas Operations to Klondex Mines, Ltd was completed.
Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.8 million ounces for 2013 with ore mined from nine open pit and seven underground mines. At December 31, 2013, we reported 31.0 million ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 75% of those ounces in open pit mines and 25% in underground mines. We are advancing several development opportunities in Nevada, including Long Canyon.
The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 82% of Nevada’s gold production in 2013, compared with 82% in 2012 and 79% in 2011. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately 83% are refractory ores and 17% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores are processed at Carlin by flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. The Phoenix mine also constructed a copper leaching facility and a solvent extraction electrowinning facility to produce copper cathode. Ore from the Midas mine was processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold doré at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas was refined on-site.
We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.
The Long Canyon project is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure at Carlin and we believe provides the potential for significant development and operating synergies. During 2013, the project completed selection and confirmation stage work as we continue to develop our understanding of Long Canyon and the district. We have submitted a Plan-of-Operations to the BLM in support of our EIS for Phase 1 of the operations. We continue to make progress on the exploration program; a total of 71 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2013 and we anticipate an additional 61 kilometers to be drilled in 2014. We anticipate Stage 3 detailed engineering and permitting to be completed on Phase 1 by the end of 2014. At December 31, 2013 we reported 1.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. We report our interest in Turquoise Ridge on a pro rata basis. We have an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold production of 54,000 ounces in 2013 were attributable to Newmont.
In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals.
Mexico. We have a 44% interest in the La Herradura joint venture and related gold properties (La Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena), which are located in the Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. We report our interest in La Herradura on a pro rata basis. La Herradura has been in operation since 1998. Soledad-Dipolos is located 9 kilometers northwest of La Herradura and commenced operations in January 2010. Noche Buena is located 23 kilometers northwest of La Herradura and operations commenced in Q1 2012. La Herradura produced 183,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2013, and at December 31, 2013 we reported 2.2 million attributable ounces of gold reserves. La Herradura is building an oxide mill to improve recoveries on higher grade material with commercial start-up expected in the first quarter of 2014 (depending on the timing of reinstatement of the explosives permit). The explosives permit for the Soledad-Dipolos and La Herradura operations has been suspended since mid-2013.
South America
The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).
MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course. MYSRL may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with a minimum annual production obligation. If the production obligations are not achieved by the end of the 20th year from the date of grant - for concessions granted in 2008 or thereafter - or by the end of 2028 - for concessions granted before 2008 - the mining concession expires. Beginning October 1, 2011, mining companies are subject to a revised royalty and special mining tax, dependent on whether or not a stabilization agreement is in effect. The revised royalty and special mining taxes are based on a sliding scale between 1% to 12%.
Yanacocha, Peru. Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has active open pit mines at Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua Sur, Chaquicocha, Maqui Maqui, Carachugo, Tapado Oeste, Marleny, and Cerro Negro. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2013 was 1.0 million ounces (523,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2013, we reported 3.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Conga, Peru. The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. Due to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
made recommendations to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a “water first” approach on June 22, 2012. During 2013 the project focused on building water reservoirs, completing the last engineering activities, and accepting delivery of the main equipment purchases. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If the project proceeds, average annual estimated attributable gold production of approximately 300,000 to 350,000 ounces and average annual estimated attributable copper production of approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year are expected during the first five years of production. At December 31, 2013, we reported 6.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves.
La Zanja, Peru. We hold a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold mine near the city of Cajamarca. We report La Zanja ounces on an attributable basis. The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. The mine consists of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 65,000 attributable gold ounces in 2013 and at December 31, 2013, we reported 0.2 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Merian, Suriname. At December 31, 2013, we held an 80% interest in the Merian project in Suriname. On February 19, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 20% noncontrolling interest in the project. The Mineral and Partnership agreements were signed by Newmont’s indirect subsidiary, Suriname Gold Company, LLC, and the Government of Suriname on November 22, 2013. The project feasibility study is now complete and subject to a final review process before being submitted to the Board of Directors for full funding in the second quarter of 2014. If approved, the development of the Merian project would allow Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. At December 31, 2013, we reported 3.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Australia/New Zealand
In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.
Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.
Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted native title
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.
In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights. A carbon dioxide tax commenced in Australia on July 1, 2012, whereby the largest emitters of carbon dioxide are required to pay A$24.15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The carbon price is indexed for inflation through June 30, 2015, when a cap and trade system will be in place. Carbon costs are primarily driven by electricity and diesel fuel consumption.
Boddington. Boddington (100% owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 704,000 ounces of gold and 66 million pounds of copper in 2013, and at December 31, 2013, we reported 13.7 million ounces of gold reserves and 1,490 million pounds of copper reserves.
Kalgoorlie. Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. We report our interest in Kalgoorlie on a pro rata basis. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. During 2013, Kalgoorlie produced 332,000 attributable ounces of gold, and at December 31, 2013, we reported 3.7 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
Jundee. Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore solely from underground sources in 2013, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 279,000 ounces of gold in 2013, and at December 31, 2013, we reported 0.4 million ounces of gold reserves.
Tanami. Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2013, the Tanami operations produced 323,000 ounces of gold, and at December 31, 2013 we reported 3.0 million ounces of gold reserves.
Waihi, New Zealand. Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 94 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Auckland and currently consists of the Trio underground deposit and the Martha open pit mine. The Waihi operation produced 110,000 ounces of gold in 2013, and at December 31, 2013, we reported 0.2 million ounces of gold reserves.
Duketon. We have a 19.52% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold project, located approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of Kalgoorlie. We report Regis ounces on an attributable basis. Duketon commenced production on its first mine in the third quarter of 2010 and completed construction of its second mine in 2012 and produced 56,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2013. At December 31, 2013, we reported 0.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Indonesia
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2013, Batu Hijau produced 161 million pounds of copper (78 million attributable pounds) and 48,000 ounces of gold (23,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2013, we reported 3,300 million attributable pounds of copper reserves and 3.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.
We own 31.50% of Batu Hijau through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which we own with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine. The remaining 44% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), 24%; P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), 17.8%; and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), 2.2%.
On May 6, 2011, we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake, as required under the terms of PTNNT’s Contract of Work with the Indonesian Government. NTPBV entered into the agreement with Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”). The Government of Indonesia designated PIP as the buyer for the final 7% interest by exercising a right of first refusal set out in the Contract of Work. Upon closing of the transaction, NTPBV’s interest in Batu Hijau will be reduced to 49%, as required under the Contract of Work. The price agreed for the 7% stake is approximately $247. Closing of the transaction is pending receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was required to allow PIP to make the share purchase. NTPBV and PIP have repeatedly agreed to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions of the agreement. Our ownership interest in PTNNT following the closing of the transaction will be 27.56%.
We have identified Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. We have financing arrangements with PTPI and PTIMI, unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the application of our standards to the operation of Batu Hijau, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be VIEs and our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% (20% interest net of withholding tax) to 48.50% during 2010. We currently manage the application of our standards to Batu Hijau’s operations.
In Indonesia, prior to the 2009 mining law, rights were granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Under the Contract of Work our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the future to as low as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTPBV in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau or apply our operating standards. As part of the negotiation of the divestiture sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the right of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards at Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to our standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTPBV owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we could lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by us. Such loss of effective control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Africa
In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The Investment Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Investment Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax not to exceed 32.5% and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In July 2009, the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Revenue Authority on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are pending, we have paid and included $39 in Income and mining tax expense to date under the levy.
In 2012, the government of Ghana enacted a law that increased the corporate income tax from 25% to 35%, eliminated the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, and changed capital allowances to 20% over 5 years from the previously allowed 80% deduction in year one and then 50% per year on the remaining balance. Per our Investment Agreement, the increase in the corporate income tax rate would be limited to 32.5% and capital allowances remain at the old rates and basis. The government of Ghana also introduced a bill in Parliament that sought to impose a “windfall profit tax” of 10% on windfall profits of mining companies. The bill was later withdrawn from Parliament, and it is not clear if or when it will be returned to Parliament and passed into law. The Company believes that the windfall tax of 10% would not be applicable to our Ghana operations due to our Investment Agreement.
In addition, the government of Ghana recently established a Mining Review Committee (“MRC”) to review fiscal regimes and mining agreements with a view to ensuring that Ghana benefits adequately and fairly from gains in the mining sector. Newmont is currently in discussions with the MRC on certain aspects of the Investment Agreement which the MRC would like to be reviewed. The discussions are in the early stages and we cannot determine the potential impact at this stage. See Risk Factor “Our operations are subject to risks of doing business” for a description of risks inherent in contracts with governments.
Ahafo, Ghana. Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits and an underground mine presently in development. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo produced 570,000 ounces of gold in 2013, and at December 31, 2013, we reported 10.1 million ounces of gold reserves.
Akyem, Ghana. Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. The process plant was commissioned in late August and ramped up to full commercial production in October, producing 129,000 ounces of gold in 2013. Gold production is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year for the first five years of the mine’s operating life of approximately 19 years (based on current gold reserves). At December 31, 2013, we reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves.

Proven and Probable Reserves
We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 88.4 million ounces at December 31, 2013, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,675 per ounce. Our 2013 reserves would decline by approximately 6% (5.6 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,200 per ounce gold price, all other assumptions remaining constant. An increase in the gold price to $1,400 per ounce
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
would increase reserves by approximately 4% (3.5 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2012, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce.
At December 31, 2013, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 33.2 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end attributable proven and probable gold reserves were 55.2 million ounces, including 13.0 million ounces in South America, 21.5 million ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 3.4 million ounces in Indonesia, and 17.3 million ounces in Africa.
Our attributable proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2013 were 8,130 million pounds. For 2013, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.00 or A$3.25 per pound. For 2012, reserves were calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.25 or A$3.25 per pound.
Our attributable proven and probable silver reserves at December 31, 2013 were 153 million ounces. For 2013, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $20.00 per ounce, decreased from $30.00 per ounce used in 2012. Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations.
Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.
We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2014, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2014.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2013, and 2012:
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
(1) The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.
The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates.
Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.
Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.
2013 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,300, A$1,415 or NZ$1,675 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
2012 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce unless otherwise noted.
(2) Tonnages include allowances for losses resulting from mining methods. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 100,000 unless they are less than 50,000.
(3) Ounces or pounds are estimates of metal contained in ore tonnages and do not include allowances for processing losses. Metallurgical recovery rates represent the estimated amount of metal to be recovered through metallurgical extraction processes. Ounces are rounded to the nearest 10,000.
(4) Property was sold to Klondex Mines Ltd., on February 11, 2014. Tonnage rounded to nearest 50,000.
(5) Gold cut-off grade varies with level of copper and silver credits.
(6) Project is currently undeveloped.
(7) Reserve estimates provided by Barrick, the operator of the Turquoise Ridge joint venture.
(8) In-process material is the material on leach pads at the end of the year from which gold remains to be recovered. In-process material reserves are reported separately where tonnage or ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and ounces are greater than 100,000.
(9) Stockpiles are comprised primarily of material that has been set aside to allow processing of higher grade material in the mills. Stockpiles increase or decrease depending on current mine plans. Stockpile reserves are reported separately where tonnage or ounces are greater than 5% of the total site-reported reserves and ounces are greater than 100,000.

Mineralized Material
We had attributable gold Mineralized Material of 1,690 million tons at an average grade of 0.016 ounces per ton at December 31, 2013, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,475 or NZ$1,700 per ounce. For 2012, attributable gold Mineralized Material was calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,600, A$1,600 or NZ$2,050 per ounce.
At December 31, 2013, our gold Mineralized Material included 355 million tons in North America, 126 million tons in South America, 226 million tons in Australia/New Zealand, 919 million tons in Indonesia, and 64 million tons in Africa.
At December 31, 2013, our attributable copper Mineralized Material of 1,401 million tons at a grade of 0.27% was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.50 or A$3.70 per pound. For 2012, attributable copper Mineralized Material was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.50 or A$3.50 per pound.
At December 31, 2013, our attributable silver Mineralized Material of 1,199 million tons at a grade of 0.060 ounces per ton was calculated at a silver price assumption of $25.00 per ounce, a decrease from $35.00 per ounce used in 2012. Silver Mineralized Material is generally a by-product of gold and/or copper Mineralized Material estimates, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in future calculations of potential economic extraction.
All of our Mineralized Material is located on fee property or mining claims. Mineralized material is a mineralized underground body which has been intersected by a sufficient number of closely spaced drill holes and or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal(s) to warrant further exploration-development work. The deposit does not qualify as a commercially minable orebody until it can be legally and economically extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Metal price assumptions are based on up to a twenty percent premium over reserve prices.
The Mineralized Material figures presented herein do not include that part of our Mineralized Material that have been converted to Proven and Probable Reserves as shown above (they are reported exclusive of reserves), and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper and silver, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain Mineralized Material containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of Mineralized Material.
We will publish Mineralized Materials annually, and will recalculate them at December 31, 2014, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2014.
