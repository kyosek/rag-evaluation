REGIONAL LOCATION MAP
Raft River, Idaho
The Raft River project, where the company’s geothermal operations are located, is in southeastern Idaho, approximately 55 miles southeast of Burley, the county seat of Cassia County. Burley, population 8,300, is the local agricultural and manufacturing center for the area, providing a full range of light to heavy industrial services.
A commercial airport is located 90 miles to the northeast in Pocatello, Idaho. Pocatello, population 53,000, is a regional center for agriculture, heavy industry (mining, phosphate refining), technology and education with Idaho State University. Malta, a town with a population of approximately 180, is 12 miles north of the project site where basic services, fuel, and groceries are available. Year-round access to the project from Burley is via Interstate Highway 84 south to State Highway 81 south, then east on the Narrows Canyon Road, an improved county road.
The Raft River project currently consists of ten parcels (generally referred to as the U.S. Geothermal Property, the Crank Lease, the Newbold Lease, the Jensen Investments Leases, the Stewart Lease, the Bighorn Mortgage Lease, the Doman Lease, the Griffin Lease, and the Glover Lease) comprising 783.93 acres of fee land and 4,736.79 acres of contiguous leased geothermal rights located on private property in Cassia County, Idaho. All parcels are defined by legal subdivision or by metes and bounds survey description. The ten parcels are as follows:
The U.S. Geothermal Property - Idaho. The U.S. Geothermal Property is comprised of four separate properties that total 1,723.93 acres: the Vulcan, Elena Corporation, Dewsnup and the Wilcox Ranch Properties. The Vulcan Property includes both surface and geothermal rights and consists of two parcels. The first parcel has a total area of approximately 240 acres and three geothermal wells (RRGE-1, RRGP-4 and RRGP-5) are located on this parcel. The second parcel has a total area of approximately 320 acres, and three additional geothermal wells (RRGE-3, RRGI-6 and RRGI-7) are located on this parcel. A fourth well, RRGE-2, although located on the property covered by the Crank lease, was acquired by the company from a local rancher. The Wilcox Ranch includes 940 acres of agricultural and range lands adjacent to Raft River that provides cooling water.
The Elena Property is comprised of surface and geothermal rights to approximately 100 acres of property, excluding the oil and gas rights to the property. The property is contiguous to other properties owned or leased by the company.

Raft River Energy Unit I
Unit I at Raft River became commercially operational on January 3, 2008. As a result of the project financing for Unit I of the Raft River project, the Company has contributed over $17.9 million in cash and property to Raft River Energy I LLC, the Unit I project joint venture company. Raft River Holdings, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group, has contributed approximately $34 million to the project. Property assigned to Raft River Energy by the Company includes seven production and injection wells, seven monitoring wells, the Stewart lease, the Crank lease, the Newbold lease, the Doman lease, and the Glover lease. All appropriate permits and contracts have also been assigned to Raft River Energy for Unit I.
Although significant detail has been provided about each specific lease area, the economics of the project is based on the total resource. The reservoir supporting the project encompasses the entire Known Geothermal Resource Area (“KGRA”), which includes all the property owned or leased by the company at Raft River. All discussions of the economics of the project, including future phases, will be based at the project level rather than at the lease level.

Neal Hot Springs, Oregon
Neal Hot Springs is a geothermal resource located in Eastern Oregon. The Company acquired the Neal Hot Springs geothermal energy and surface rights in September 2006. It is currently under development.
The first production well was completed in June 2008. A step-rate flow test, with pressure buildup, was conducted for 12 hours on July 12, 2008 and resulted in a flowing production temperature of 286.5º F (141º C). The well flowed under artesian pressure at a peak rate of 2,055 gallons per minute (“gpm”) at artesian pressure and then was stepped down to a lower flow rate of 1,210 gpm before it was shut in and the pressure buildup monitored. Richard Holt of Geothermal Science, Inc., an independent geothermal reservoir engineering firm, calculated a well productivity index of 450 gpm/psi, which is considered to be very high in the geothermal industry. The Company proceeded with permitting up to a 22 MW power plant. USG has acquired all state and federal permits necessary for project construction. A Conditional Use Permit has been issued by Malheur County. The only remaining permits required prior to construction are the septic approval for the office facility and the local building permit. The transmission line right-of-ways have been acquired, and a power purchase agreement (with Idaho Power) has been approved by the IPUC.
The Company has been issued permits for drilling up to 15 temperature gradient drill holes and 9 geothermal wells. Successful geothermal resource delineation has continued with the development of a second geothermal production well (NHS-5) located north of NHS-1 and temperature gradient well 21 which intersected additional geothermal resource south of NHS-1.

San Emidio, Nevada
Effective May 1, 2008, the Company acquired a 3.6 MW operating geothermal power plant and approximately 30,734.21 acres (48.0 square miles) of geothermal energy leases and certain ground water rights all located north of Reno, Nevada. The total purchase price was $16.6 million. The assets are comprised of two locations: the San Emidio assets and the Gerlach/Granite Creek assets. The San Emidio assets are located in the San Emidio Desert, Washoe County, Nevada and include the geothermal power project, approximately 22,944 acres (35.9 square miles) of geothermal leases, and ground water rights used for cooling water. The Gerlach assets are comprised of approximately 3,415 acres (5.3 square miles) of BLM geothermal leases located about 1 mile north of Gerlach, Nevada. The Granite Creek assets are comprised of approximately 5,414 acres (8.5 square miles) of BLM geothermal leases located about 7 miles north of Gerlach, Nevada. The Gerlach and Granite Creek assets are along a geologic structure known to host geothermal features including the Great Boiling Spring and the Fly Ranch Geyser.
The 3.6 -MW geothermal power plant has been producing power since 1987 and sells electricity to Sierra Pacific Power Corporation under an existing power purchase agreement that extends through 2017. A March 2008 resource assessment of the San Emidio geothermal leases by independent experts Susan Petty of Black Mountain Technology and Geologist, Dennis Trexler, estimated a total resource potential of 44 MWs with a 90% probability factor.
The power plant was constructed in 1986 with commercial power generation beginning in 1987. Deeper wells with higher temperatures were drilled in 1994 to supply the plant after output declined due to cooling of the original, shallow production wells. The current configuration of the plant consists of four 1.2 MW Ormat Energy Converters, three injection wells and two production wells. A three cell cooling tower was added in 1998 to improve summer power generation. The plant is connected to the transmission grid via a 60 kilovolt intertie.
San Emidio is our second operating geothermal power plant and is owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (USG Nevada LLC). The project is a small-scale geothermal power plant selling approximately 2.5 MWs. The plant is approximately 22 years old and employs four binary cycle units. We have conducted a review of the information regarding the project, and we believe that the existing production wells can provide 4,000 to 5,000 gallons per minute of 280 to 300 °F fluid to the current power plant.
Lease/Royalty Terms
BLM Leases. At the closing of the Empire Acquisition, the geothermal leases with the BLM were assigned to the Company. The lease contracts are for approximately 21,905 acres of land and geothermal rights located in the San Emidio Desert, Nevada. The lease contracts have primary terms of 10 years. Per federal regulations applicable for the contracts, the lessee has the option to extend the primary lease term another 10 years, under two extension periods, at 5 years each, if the BLM does not need the land for any other purpose and the lessee is maintaining production at commercial quantities. The leases require the lessee to conduct operations in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to the environment.
The terms of the BLM contracts are detailed as follows:
The BLM lease contracts require royalty payments for the use of geothermal resources. The rate is based upon 10% of the value of the resource at the well head. The amounts are calculated according to a formula established by MMS.
Kosmos Lease. This is a geothermal resource lease agreement for 1,040 acres with The Kosmos Company (“Kosmos”). The lease has been in effect since October l987 and continues so long as the lessee is drilling for, producing geothermal power, or conducting remedial operations. Under the terms of the first amendment to the lease which became effective upon our acquisition of the San Emidio Geothermal assets, Kosmos will be paid the greater of $8,000 per month or 3.5% of the gross sales price of electric power from fluids produced and injected until the proposed new power plant achieves commercial operation. When a new power plant is installed and producing commercial power, the royalty will change to 1.75% of the gross sales price of electric power sold by the lessee for 120 months and 3.5% thereafter.
Gerlach, Nevada
In May 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Gerlach Green Energy LLC of Nevada to form a limited liability company named Gerlach Geothermal LLC. The joint venture owns geothermal rights for 3,615 acres (5.6 square miles) located in northwestern Nevada near the town of Gerlach. The target of the joint venture is the exploration of the regional Gerlach geothermal system. The joint venture is located near the Company’s Granite Creek leases that were recently acquired as part of the San Emidio geothermal power plant acquisition.
Lease/Royalty Terms
BLM Leases. The Gerlach Geothermal LLC assets are comprised two BLM geothermal leases and one private lease totaling 3,615 acres. Both BLM leases have a royalty rate is based upon 10% of the value of the resource at the wellhead. The amounts are calculated according to a formula established by MMS. One of the two BLM leases has a second royalty commitment to a third party of 4% of gross revenue for power generation and 5% for direct use based on BTUs consumed at a set comparable price of $7.00 per million BTU of natural gas. The private lease has a 10 year primary term and would receive a royalty of 3% gross revenue for the first 10 years and 4% thereafter.
Granite Creek, Nevada
The Granite Creek assets are comprised of approximately 5,414 acres (8.5 square miles) of BLM geothermal leases located about 6 miles north of Gerlach, Nevada along a geologic structure known to host geothermal features including the Great Boiling Spring and the Fly Ranch Geyser.
Lease/Royalty Terms
BLM Leases. The Company has three geothermal lease contracts with the BLM. The lease contracts are for approximately 5,414 acres of land and geothermal water rights located in the northwestern Nevada. The lease contracts have primary terms of 10 years. Per federal regulations applicable for the contracts, the lessee has the option to extend the primary lease term another 40 years if the BLM does not need the land for any other purpose and the lessee is maintaining production at commercial quantities. The leases state annual lease payments of $5,414, not including processing fees, and expire October 31, 2012.
Republic of Guatemala
Subsequent to the end of the year, the Company announced on April 15 that it was successful in acquiring a geothermal concession in the Republic of Guatemala. The concession consists of 24,710 acres (100 square kilometers) and is located 14 miles southwest of Guatemala City, the capital. Nine wells with depths ranging from 560 to 2,000 feet (170 to 610 meters) were drilled in the El Ceibillo resource area within the concession area during the l990s. Six of the wells have measured reservoir temperatures in the range of 365 to 400°F (185 to 204°C). Fluid sample analysis and the mineralogy associated with drill cuttings suggest the existence of a deeper, higher permeability reservoir with temperature potential of 410 to 446°F (210 to 230°C).
Boise Administration Office, Idaho
The Company entered into a 3 year lease contract effective January 1, 2008 through January 31, 2011, for general office space for an executive office located in Boise, Idaho. The lease payments are due in monthly installments that start at $5,637 per month and increase annually to $5,981 per month.
