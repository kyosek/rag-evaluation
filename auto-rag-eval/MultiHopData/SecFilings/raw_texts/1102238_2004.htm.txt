ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
ARI’s principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for ARI’s present operations.
Details of ARI’s and its subsidiaries’ real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2004, are set forth in SCHEDULES III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.” The discussions set forth below under the headings “Real Estate” and “Mortgage Loans” provide certain summary information concerning ARI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 2004, no single asset accounted for 10.0% or more of total assets. At December 31, 2004, 82.6% of ARI’s assets consisted of real estate, and 6.1% consisted of notes and interest receivable. The remaining 11.3% of ARI’s assets were cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities, pizza parlor equipment, investments in equity investees, goodwill and other intangibles, and other assets. The percentage of assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of ARI’s assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
ARI’s real estate is geographically diverse, with concentrations in the Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest regions. At December 31, 2004, ARI’s real estate was located in all geographic regions of the continental United States, other than the Northeast region, as shown more specifically in the table under “Real Estate” below. ARI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southwest, Southeast, Pacific and Midwest regions of the continental United States. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of ARI’s notes receivable portfolio.

Excluded from above are 78 parcels of improved and unimproved land, and a single-family residence, as described below.
Real Estate
At December 31, 2004, 83.1% of ARI’s assets were invested in real estate and the equity securities of IORI. ARI invests in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or non-leveraged basis. ARI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, properties held for sale, investments in partnerships, and investments in equity securities of IORI.
Types of Real Estate Investments. ARI’s real estate consists of apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses, shopping centers, and a merchandise mart), hotels, and improved and unimproved land. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values, and physical condition are among the factors considered. Properties may be purchased subject to debt, or existing debt may be assumed and properties may be mortgaged, pledged or otherwise collateralized to obtain financing. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although ARI has typically invested in developed real estate, it may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with unaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the Board of Directors). To the extent that it invests in construction and development projects, such as the apartments described below, ARI is subject to business risks, which include cost overruns and construction delays, associated with higher risk projects.
Index to Financial Statements At December 31, 2004, ARI had the following properties under construction:
In 2004, ARI completed the 248 unit DeSoto Ranch Apartments in DeSoto, Texas, the 314 unit Verandas at Cityview Apartments in Fort Worth, Texas, the 216 unit Mariposa Villas (Echo Valley) in Dallas, Texas, the 176 unit Breakwater Bay Apartments in Beaumont, Texas, the 156 unit Capitol Hill Apartments in Little Rock, Arkansas and the 332 unit Vistas of Pinnacle Park Apartments in Dallas, Texas.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by ARI are adequately covered by insurance.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of owned real estate (excluding 78 parcels of improved and unimproved land, a hotel in Wroclaw, Poland and a single-family residence, described below) at December 31, 2004.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, amount of commercial square footage, and number of hotel rooms owned, and does not reflect the value of ARI’s investment in each region. See SCHEDULE III to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of owned real estate.

Index to Financial Statements
Partnership Properties. ARI accounts for partnership properties using the equity method. ARI had no property information for properties owned by partnerships.
ARI is a 30% general partner in Sacramento Nine (“SAC 9”), which owned the Prospect Park #29 Office Building. In December 2004, SAC 9 sold the Prospect Park #29 office building for $3.7 million, of which ARI received $1.1 million after closing costs and fees.

In December 2004, ARI sold a 95% interest in Garden Centura, L.P. that owns the 410,901 sq. ft. Centura Tower office building located in Farmers Branch, Texas. ARI retained a non-controlling 1% general partner and 4% limited partner interest in Garden Centura, L.P. ARI will account for its investment in this partnership on the cost basis.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of ARI’s assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, secured by income-producing real estate, unimproved land and partnership interests. Management expects that the percentage of ARI’s assets invested in mortgage loans will decline, as ARI will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, ARI may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in the portfolio. Mortgage notes receivable consist primarily of first mortgage loans.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2004, consisted of one apartment, four commercial buildings, unimproved land and partnership

interests. The type of properties subject to mortgages in which ARI invests may be altered without a vote of stockholders.
As of December 31, 2004, the obligors on $43.3 million or 59.0% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of ARI. Also at that date, $6.6 million or 8.9% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio was non-performing.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage loan balance at December 31, 2004), by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as collateral for ARI’s mortgage notes receivable. Excluded are $55.5 million of mortgage notes that are secured by unimproved land and other security, or are unsecured. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for additional details of ARI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2004 is as follows:
During 2004, $5.9 million in interest and $11.6 million in principal were collected on mortgage notes receivable.
First Mortgage Loans. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan at or prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments, moderate or negative amortization of principal, or all interest and a “balloon” principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is ARI’s general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of ARI’s mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders. ARI may grant participations in first mortgage loans that it originates to other lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes first mortgage loans funded in 2004, as well as events during 2004 that affected previously funded first mortgage loans.
In March 2004, ARI sold an 8.0 acre tract of its Mason Goodrich land parcel for $1.0 million, receiving $251,000 after payment of closing costs and providing purchase money financing of $523,000. The secured loan bears interest at 10.0% per annum, requires monthly payments of accrued interest and matures in March 2006. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due at maturity.
In March 2004, ARI sold 492.5 acres in Collin County, Texas for $20.0 million, receiving $8.0 million after payment of debt and closing costs, and providing purchase money financing of $7.2 million for a portion of the land on a contingent basis. The secured note bore interest at 7.0% per annum and matured in September 2004.
Index to Financial Statements
The purchaser extended the note to December 2004 with a $1.1 million extension payment in September 2004. In December 2004, the note was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In October 2004, ARI sold the In The Pines apartments to a third party and provided $1.0 million of the purchase price as seller financing in the form of two notes. The first note bears interest at 7.0% per annum, requires monthly interest payments and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance. In the event of a default, the note is also secured by membership rights in the purchaser’s entity. The second note is unsecured; bears interest at 8.5% per annum, requires monthly interest payments and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance.

In March 2002, ARI sold the 174,513 sq. ft. Hartford Office Building in Dallas, Texas, for $4.0 million and provided the $4.0 million purchase price as seller financing and an additional $1.4 million line of credit for leasehold improvements in the form of a first lien mortgage note. The note bears interest at a variable interest rate, currently 7.0% per annum, requires monthly payments of accrued interest and matures in March 2007. As of March 2005, ARI has funded $788,000 of the additional line of credit.
In October 2002, ARI sold its Varner Road land parcel for $3.7 million, receiving $0.7 million after payment of closing costs and providing purchase money financing of $2.8 million. The loan bore interest at 9.0% per annum, matured in October 2004 and required quarterly interest payments. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest were due at maturity. In October 2004, the note was collected in full, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In February 2003, ARI sold an 89.3 acre tract of its Katrina land parcel for $8.5 million, paying $410,000 after payment of closing costs and debt pay down and providing purchase money financing of $5.6 million. The note bears interest at 8.0% per annum and matures three years after the recording of the Deed of Trust. Interest will begin accruing after improvements to the site have been completed by ARI. At April 2004, the improvements were begun. The future costs to ARI to complete the improvements, estimated to be $2.5 million, were accrued in 2002. A principal payment of $450,000 is due within ten days after a Tentative Parcel Map (the “Map”) is recorded. At March 2005, negotiations with the buyer to settle any further obligations are under way. Interest payments will be due on the first day of each calendar quarter, beginning with the first quarter following the completion of the site improvements.
Junior participations. In August 2001, ARI agreed to fund up to $5.6 million secured by a second lien on an office building in Dallas, Texas. The note receivable bore interest at a variable rate, required monthly payments of accrued interest and matured in January 2003. As of March 2005, ARI has funded a total of $4.3 million and the note is classified as non-performing. The collateral used to secure ARI’s second lien was seized by the first lien holder. In March 2004, ARI agreed to accept an assignment of claims in litigation as security for the note. In December 2004, ARI agreed to a Modification Agreement with the borrower, which was effective November 1, 2003. As of the modified effective date, accrued interest of $582,000 was applied to the principal balance of the note, the interest rate was set to a fixed rate of 9.0% per annum and all principal and interest is due November 2005. ARI also received Pledge and Security Agreements in various partnership interests belonging to the borrower and received various Assignments of Proceeds from sales in certain entities owned by the borrower. ARI also agreed to reduce accrued interest and principal by $1.5 million from the receipt of notes receivable assigned to ARI by borrower and by $605,000 from cash received. ARI also received $1.4 million in January
Index to Financial Statements
2005 that was applied to accrued interest and principal effective December 30, 2004. As a result of this modification, ARI has released $1.4 million of allowance for loan losses to expense. The following notes were assigned to ARI as payment on the note:
•
$678,000 from a partnership that owns an apartment building. This note is unsecured, bears no interest and has no maturity date. Distributions made from the partnership operations will be used to pay the principal on the note.
•
$264,000 secured by a second lien on 13 acres of unimproved land. This note bears interest at 9.0% and matured in February 2003.
•
$341,000 secured by a second lien on 23.3 acres of unimproved land. This note bears interest at 4.0% and is payable upon demand.
•
$125,000 secured by a 100% interest in an affiliated company that owns an apartment building. This note bears interest at 12.0%, only requires payments if surplus cash is available and matures in April 2009.
In June 2003, ARI sold the 104 unit Willow Wick Apartments in North Augusta, South Carolina, for $2.7 million and provided $42,000 of the purchaser’s closing costs as seller financing. The note bore interest at 5.0% per annum and required all interest and principal payments be paid at maturity in December 2003. This loan was extended until February 2004 and $10,000 was received in March 2004. The note, including accrued and unpaid interest, was paid in June 2004. ARI discounted the note $2,000 and recognized a loss of $2,000.
In September 2003, ARI sold a 367.4 acre tract of its Pioneer Crossing land parcel for $22.5 million, receiving $4.9 million after payment of closing costs and providing purchase money financing of $16.9 million. The note bears interest at 8.0% per annum, matures in September 2006 and requires quarterly payments of accrued interest beginning in January 2004. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest are due at maturity. In November 2003, ARI sold an interest in $8.0 million of the note for $7.5 million, receiving $7.2 million in cash after payment of closing costs and debt paydown. In February 2004, ARI sold an additional interest in $6.6 million of the note for $6.3 million, receiving $6.3 million in cash after payment of closing costs.
In December 2003, ARI sold a tract of Marine Creek land to a subsidiary of United Housing Foundation, Inc. (“UHF”) for $1.5 million, receiving cash and a note receivable. This sale was not recognized as a sale at that time because UHF is a related party and ARI has continuing involvement and control. In February 2004, Marine Creek was refinanced by UHF, which paid in full ARI’s note payable on the land. ARI recorded the sale of the land and received a note receivable of $270,000, which was the difference between the sales price and the amount of ARI’s note payable. The note bears interest at 6.0%, requires quarterly payments from available surplus cash and matures in December 2007. See Note 9. “RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.”
Other. In July 2002, ARI entered into an agreement to fund up to $300,000 under a revolving line of credit secured by 100% interest in a partnership of the borrower. The line of credit bears interest at 12.0% per annum, requires monthly payments of accrued interest, and matures in June 2005. ARI has funded the entire $300,000.
In September 1999, in conjunction with the sale of two apartments in Austin, Texas, $2.1 million in purchase money financing was provided, secured by limited partnership interests in two limited partnerships owned by the buyer. The financing bore interest at 16.0% per annum, required monthly payments of interest only at 6.0%, beginning in February 2000 and required a $200,000 principal paydown in December 1999, which was not received, and matured in August 2000. ARI had the option of obtaining the buyer’s general and limited partnership interests in the collateral partnerships in full satisfaction of the financing. In March 2000, ARI agreed to forbear foreclosing on the collateral securing the note and released one of the partnership interests, in exchange for a payment of $250,000 and executed deeds of trusts on certain properties owned by the buyer. In March 2000, the borrower made a $1.1 million payment, upon receipt of which ARI returned the deeds of trust. The borrower executed a replacement promissory note for the remaining note balance of $1.0 million, which was unsecured, non-interest bearing and matured in April 2003. In April 2004, a demand letter was sent to the debtor. ARI initiated legal action in June 2004.
Index to Financial Statements Related Parties. In March 2004, ARI sold a K-Mart in Cary, North Carolina to BCM for $3.2 million, including the assumption of debt.

The assumption of debt by One Realco Office Investors, Inc. was not approved by the lender; therefore, the Board of Directors rescinded their approval of the transaction. ARI extended the loan on the Lexington Center with the lender in December 2004.
In October 2004, ARI advanced $3.3 million to the Class A Limited Partners of Edina Park Plaza Associates, Limited Partnership, of which ARI is the general partner. The loans bear interest at 10.0% per annum and mature in September 2017. Interest due to ARI will be deducted from the quarterly return owed by ARI to the Class A Limited Partners, eliminating the quarterly payments. The outstanding principal is due at maturity.
In October 1999, ARI funded a $4.7 million loan to Realty Advisors. The loan, to provide funds for acquisitions or working capital needs, was secured by all of the outstanding shares of common stock of American Reserve Life Insurance Company. The loan bore interest at 10.25% per annum and matured in November 2001. In January 2000, $100,000 was collected. In November 2001, the maturity date was extended to November 2004. The collateral was changed to a pledge of 850,000 shares of ARI Common Stock owned by BCM. The interest rate was changed to 2.0% over the prime rate, currently 7.75% per annum, and the accrued but unpaid interest of $1.0 million was added to the principal. The new principal balance is $5.6 million. In September 2003, $673,000 in accrued interest was collected. In August 2004, $342,000 in accrued interest was collected. In November 2004, the maturity date was extended to November 2006. All principal and accrued interest are due at maturity.
In March 2001, ARI funded $13.6 million of a $15.0 million unsecured line of credit to One Realco. A wholly-owned subsidiary of One Realco owns approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of ARI’s Common Stock. One Realco periodically borrows money to meet its cash obligations. The line of credit bore interest at 12.0% per annum. All principal and interest were due at maturity in February 2002. The line of credit is guaranteed by BCM. In June 2001, $810,000 in principal and interest was collected. In December 2001, $825,000 in principal and interest was collected. In February 2002, the line of credit was increased to $18.0 million, accrued but unpaid interest of $217,000 was added to the principal, and the maturity date was extended to February 2004. In March 2002, ARI funded an additional $1.8 million, increasing the outstanding principal balance to $15.5 million. In October 2002, $856,900 in interest was collected, by the return of 85,690 shares of ARI Series A Preferred Stock. In June 2003, ARI sold a participating interest in $5.8 million of the $15.5 million balance to BCM, receiving 314,141 TCI shares from BCM (see NOTE 1. “BASIS OF PRESENTATION.”) In February 2004, $2.3 million in interest was collected, accrued but unpaid interest of $161,000 was added to the principal, the maturity date was extended to February 2007, and the interest rate was changed to 3.0% over the prime rate, currently at 8.75%. All principal and interest are due at maturity. Ronald E. Kimbrough, Acting Principal Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of ARI until May 31, 2004, was a 10.0% shareholder of One Realco until July 31, 2004. Mr. Kimbrough did not participate in the day-to-day operations or management of One Realco.
Investments in Real Estate Companies
Real estate entities. ARI’s investment in real estate entities includes the equity securities of a publicly traded real estate company, IORI, and interests in real estate joint venture partnerships.
Index to Financial Statements The Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, shares of IORI, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. Through December 31, 2004, ARI had expended an aggregate of $10.0 million to acquire shares of IORI, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. As of December 31, 2004, ARI and its subsidiaries, other than TCI, owned no shares of common stock of IORI but TCI continued to own 345,728 IORI shares (approximately 24.0% of the outstanding IORI shares). ARI may make additional investments in the equity securities of IORI to the extent its liquidity permits.
The following summary description of IORI is based on information publicly reported by IORI in its Form 10-K Annual Report to the Commission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.
Pertinent information regarding ARI’s investment in the equity securities of the IORI at December 31, 2004, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
IORI owns real estate, some of which has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, IORI may earn substantial amounts in periods in which it sells real estate and will probably incur losses in periods in which it does not. ARI’s reported income or loss attributable to IORI will differ materially from its cash flow attributable to it.
IORI is a Nevada corporation, which was originally organized on December 14, 1984, as a California business trust and commenced operations on April 10, 1985. IORI’s business is investing in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships. At December 31, 2004, IORI had total assets of $91.2 million and owned six apartments, one office building, one shopping center, one industrial warehouse, and one parcel of unimproved land, all within the State of Texas. In 2004, IORI sold two apartments, two office buildings and a parcel of unimproved land for a total of $24.5 million, receiving net cash of $4.8 million after paying off $15.8 million in mortgage debt and the payment of various closing costs. IORI recognized gains of $5.6 million on the sales, of which ARI’s equity share was $1.1 million.
