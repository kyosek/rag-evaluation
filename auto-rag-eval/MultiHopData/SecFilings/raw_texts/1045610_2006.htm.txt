Properties
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2006, we owned and managed 964 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 100.7 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, we had 820 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 80.3 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 34 markets throughout the United States and in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands. Our industrial properties were 96.1% leased to 2,633 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.1% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information related to our operations.
Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings.
The following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on square footage, of our total owned and managed operating portfolio, which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term.
(1)
The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between 2006 and 2005 is not significant.
Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options.
Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are typically located near major airports, key interstate highways and seaports in major U.S. metropolitan areas, which currently comprise Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Our other U.S. target markets include Austin, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Boston, Houston, Minneapolis and Orlando. Our non-U.S. industrial properties are located in major distribution markets, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Guadalajara, Hamburg, Lyon, Mexico City, Osaka, Paris, Queretaro, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto.
Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in-fill locations are typically near major airports, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.
Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics(1)
As of December 31, 2006, we held investments in operating properties in 34 markets in our owned and managed operating portfolio throughout the United States and in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the

Properties held through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships
Consolidated Joint Ventures:
As of December 31, 2006, we held interests in joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties, which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general partner, exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell our or their interest in the joint venture to the joint venture or to the other joint-venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the joint ventures include buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2006, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $2.6 billion. Of the $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.0 billion was consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $1.9 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations.
