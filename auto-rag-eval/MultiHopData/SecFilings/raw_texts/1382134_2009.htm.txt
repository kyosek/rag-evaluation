ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2009, we owned seven properties and have made three real estate-related investments, one of which is outstanding as of December 31, 2009. A description of our activities with respect to real property and real estate-related investments is presented below:
Wasson Canyon Project On April 17, 2009, our affiliate, SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co., LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership (“SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co.”), closed on the purchase of real property constituting sixty five (65) finished residential lots located in the City of Lake Elsinore, Riverside County, California, commonly known as Wasson Canyon for the purchase price of $650,000. The purchase was made pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions, dated April 14, 2009, or the Wasson Purchase Agreement, by and between Shopoff Partners and MS Rialto Wasson Canyon CA, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Pursuant to the Wasson Purchase Agreement, Shopoff Partners agreed to replace existing subdivision improvement agreements and related bonds within 180 days of the closing and executed a deed of trust in the amount of $650,000 securing this obligation. This obligation is customary in transactions of this type. Other than the performance Deed of Trust described herein, there were no mortgages or encumbrances recorded against the project.
On February 3, 2010, SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co (“Seller”) sold the Wasson Canyon Project to D. R. Horton Los Angeles Holding Co. Inc, (“Buyer”) pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (the “Sale Agreement”), dated December 8, 2009, as amended, for the sales price of $2,231,775 in cash.
On February 3, 2010, Buyer and Seller executed a participation agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) in which Buyer agrees to pay to Seller, in addition to the sales price, fifty percent (50%) of any gross profit that exceeds a twenty four percent (24%) gross profit margin on the sale of units to be developed on the lots purchased by the Buyer.
Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Buyer did not assume the Seller’s obligation to replace existing subdivision improvement agreements (the “SIA’s”) and related bonds (the “Bonds”) which the Seller agreed to replace when Seller originally purchased the property on April 17, 2009 from MS Rialto Wasson Canyon CA, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
In connection with the Sale Agreement for the Wasson Canyon Project, Seller agreed to maintain its obligation to replace existing SIA’s with the City of Lake Elsinore and the County of Riverside, California relating to the construction of certain in-tract subdivision improvements, off-site improvements and, with respect to the common area (lettered lots), landscape improvements ( collectively, the “Improvements”), and in support of the SIA’s, Seller agreed to post the Bonds with the City of Lake Elsinore and the County of Riverside, California.
In the process of satisfying its obligation to replace existing SIA’s, which Seller agreed to replace when Seller originally purchased the property on April 17, 2009, Seller agreed to provide letters of credit to the surety underwriting the Bonds to satisfy the surety’s collateral requirement which was an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Bond amounts or $305,889, $130,102 which was issued on January 6, 2010 and $175,787 which was issued on February 8, 2010.
Seller has finished processing Bond reductions and has completed the replacement of all Bonds originally posted by MS Rialto Wasson Canyon CA, LLC.
Buyer agreed to reimburse Seller for the actual amount of premiums for the Bonds incurred by Seller commencing on the later of (i) the date of the close of escrow and (ii) the date Bond reductions are completed. Buyer’s obligation to reimburse Seller for the actual amount of the premiums will continue until Buyer has completed certain adjacent Improvement obligations.
Buyer agreed to assume the obligation for typical repair and replacement of the Improvements immediately adjacent to the lots as required by the SIA’s to the extent the Improvements are damaged following the close of escrow. Buyer also agreed to repair any damage to the Improvements that are not immediately adjacent to the lots to the extent damage is caused by Buyer or its agents, employees or contractors.
To secure Buyer’s obligations to timely complete the adjacent Improvement obligations, Buyer agreed to deliver to Seller a letter of credit in the amount of $102,000. If Buyer defaults in its obligations to timely perform the adjacent Improvement obligations, Seller has the right to draw on the letter of credit to complete the adjacent Improvement obligations to the extent necessary to cause the Bonds to be released.
Underwood Project On May 19, 2009, our affiliate, SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co., closed on the purchase of real property constituting 543 single family residential lots, a 9.4 acre park and over 70 acres of open space on a total of 225 acres of unimproved land commonly referred to as tract 29835 located in the City of Menifee, Riverside County, California, commonly known as the “Underwood Project.” The purchase price was $1,650,000. The purchase was made pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions, dated May 13, 2009 by and between SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co. as buyer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as seller.
As undeveloped land, the Underwood Project is not an income-producing property. The purchase was made based upon the anticipated capital appreciation of the property.
Desert Moon Estates Project On July 31, 2009, our affiliate, SPT AZ Land Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”) and wholly owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, closed on the purchase of real property consisting of a final plat of 739 single family residential lots on a total of 200 acres of unimproved land commonly known as “Desert Moon Estates” located in the Town of Buckeye, Maricopa County, Arizona (the “Desert Moon Estates Property”). The purchase price was $3,000,000. The purchase was made pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions, dated June 29, 2009 (the “Desert Moon Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Buyer and AZPro Developments, Inc., an Arizona corporation (“Seller”). On July 28, 2009, Buyer and Seller executed a First Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions modifying the terms of the original Desert Moon Purchase Agreement to provide for Buyer’s payment of the purchase price through a $2,000,000 Secured Promissory Note and Deed of Trust with Assignment of Rents.
In connection with the Desert Moon Purchase Agreement, Buyer executed a $2,000,000 Secured Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”) in favor of Seller. Interest on the Promissory Note will accrue on the principal outstanding from the date of the Promissory Note at a rate of six percent (6.00%) per annum. Payments of interest only will be made quarterly in arrears on November 1, 2009, February 1, 2010 and May 1, 2010. On the maturity date of the Promissory Note, July 31, 2010, the entire outstanding principal balance and all unpaid interest on the Promissory Note will be due and payable in full. The Promissory Note is secured by a Deed of Trust with Assignment of Rents which encumbers the Desert Moon Estates Property.
Buyer may prepay in whole or in part the principal amount outstanding under the Promissory Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon computed to the date of prepayment and any sums owing to Seller, without penalty or premium.
If Buyer fails to pay any installment of interest by the fifth day of each calendar quarter, Seller has the right to assess a late fee equal to 10% of the amount that is delinquent and the interest rate on the entire principal amount outstanding will adjust to 12% per annum from the date the delinquent payment was first due until the delinquent payment has been made. Similar penalties apply if the principal is not paid upon the maturity date.
On March 11, 2010, Seller and Buyer executed a First Amendment to Secured Promissory Note which extended the current maturity date of the Promissory Note to July, 31, 2011 provided Buyer has made a principal reduction of $500,000 on or before the current maturity date of July 31, 2010 and all property taxes and CFD bond payments on the property are current. Additionally, Buyer agreed to a two percent increase in the original interest rate beginning on the original maturity date of July 31, 2010.
As undeveloped land, the Desert Moon Estates Project is not an income-producing property. The purchase was made based upon the anticipated capital appreciation of the property.
Springbrook Properties On January 9, 2009, SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC, made two separate loans to Aware Development Company, Inc. (“Aware”), in the aggregate amount of $2,300,000. The loans to Aware were made pursuant to two promissory notes, which were secured by two separate collateral pledge agreements encumbering the following real property located in Riverside County, California:
• approximately 118 acres of vacant and unentitled land located near the City of Lake Elsinore, in an unincorporated area of Riverside County, California (the “Meadowbrook Project”); and
• approximately 6.11 acres of vacant and unentitled land located near the City of Lake Elsinore, in an unincorporated area of Riverside County, California (the “Coffman Project”).
The Meadowbrook Project and the Coffman Project are, collectively, the “Springbrook Properties.”
The making of the loans to Aware was a related party transaction in that, immediately prior to the loans being made, Aware purchased from Vineyard Bank two loans made by Vineyard Bank (the “Vineyard Loans”) to our affiliate Springbrook Investments, L.P. whose general partner is a California corporation wholly owned by the Shopoff Revocable Trust.
In lieu of payment of the Vineyard Loans, Aware assigned the Vineyard Loans to SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC. The assignment was completed and documented by two separate Memoranda of Assignment of Note, Deed of Trust and Loan Documents, each dated August 29, 2009.
At the time of the assignment of the Vineyard Loans to SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC, the Vineyard Loans were in default and all obligations of Springbrook were due and payable in full. Springbrook executed and delivered to SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC grant deeds to the Springbrook Properties, the underlying real estate collateral for the Vineyard Loans, in consideration for the discharge by SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC of all Springbrook’s obligations under the Vineyard Loans. On September 4, 2009, SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC took title to the Springbrook Properties and on September 24, 2009, SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC deeded the Springbrook Properties to our affiliate, SPT Lake Elsinore Holding Co., LLC.
We intend to hold the Springbrook Properties for the long-term for the purpose of capital appreciation and, accordingly, we have no current plans for improvement or development of the Springbrook Properties.
The Meadowbrook Project is an undeveloped property that is not anticipated to be developed until after 2015. The property is currently zoned rural residential, and a zone change, general plan amendment, and tentative map approval are necessary to achieve the entitlements being sought. As such, it is anticipated that the Meadowbrook Project will be developed after entitled or partially improved projects owned by others in the vicinity of the City of Lake Elsinore are developed. The Meadowbrook Project competes with nearby projects, such as Tentative Tract Maps 25475 (commonly known as Tuscany Crest) and 33725 (commonly known as Tuscany Valley), which consist of a total of approximately 355 single-family lots. Other competition
may come from nearby properties that obtain entitlements for residential development prior to the development of the Meadowbrook Project.
The Coffman Project is part of a proposed annexation, led by the City of Lake Elsinore, of a larger area of properties into the City of Lake Elsinore. The annexation will occur concurrently with the update of the City of Lake Elsinore’s General Plan and Environmental Report (the “General Plan”). This update to the General Plan will provide for a change to the zoning of the property from commercial-industrial to multi-family/high-density residential development, allowing up to 18 units per acre. The annexation is anticipated to be completed in 2010, although the City of Lake Elsinore has not committed to a completion date for the annexation and update of the General Plan. Projects with which the Coffman Project may compete include a 126-unit multi-family project proposed by MBK Homes near the Coffman Project. Timing for the MBK Homes project is unknown.
Tuscany Valley and Chino Hills Projects On November 5, 2009, our affiliate, SPT-Lake Elsinore Holding Co., (“Buyer”), purchased real property commonly known as “Tuscany Valley,” consisting of (a) 519 entitled but unimproved residential lots and 2 commercial lots located in the City of Lake Elsinore, California (the “Lake Elsinore Property”), and (b) 400 acres of unentitled and unimproved land located in the City of Chino Hills, California (the “Chino Hills Property”). The combined purchase price for the Lake Elsinore Property and the Chino Hills Property was $9,600,000.
The purchase of the Lake Elsinore Property and the Chino Hills Property was made pursuant to a series of purchase agreements and amendments thereto that were entered into by the parties over the course of more than twelve months between September 30, 2008 and November 5, 2009 (collectively, the “Tuscany Valley Purchase Agreement”), by and between Shopoff Advisors and TSG Little Valley L. P., a California limited partnership (“Seller”).
Pursuant to the Tuscany Valley Purchase Agreement, Seller agreed to sell and Shopoff Advisors agreed to buy, 163 entitled but unimproved residential lots located in the City of Lake Elsinore, California. The contract purchase price was $4,890,000. On September 3, 2009, the Tuscany Valley Purchase Agreement was amended as follows: (a) Buyer agreed to purchase additional property from Seller consisting of 356 entitled but unimproved, residential lots and 2 commercial lots located in the City of Lake Elsinore, California and 400 acres of unentitled and unimproved land located in the City of Chino Hills, California, (b) the purchase price was increased to $9,600,000 from $4,890,000, (c) the nonrefundable deposit requirement was increased to $2,000,000 from $1,000,000, and (d) the escrow closing date was amended to on or before November 30, 2009. In addition, Shopoff Advisors assigned all of its rights, title and interest in the Tuscany Valley Purchase Agreement to Buyer.
Of the total purchase price, $2,900,000 was paid by Buyer’s execution and delivery of (a) an all-inclusive purchase money note secured by deed of trust (“Promissory Note”) in favor of Seller, in the principal amount of $2,900,000, and (b) an all-inclusive deed of trust executed by Buyer in favor of Seller, as beneficiary therein, securing the Promissory Note. The Promissory Note bears interest at a rate of twelve percent per annum, and is payable in full on November 6, 2010. No payments are due during the term of the Promissory Note. The Promissory Note includes the unpaid balance of another promissory note made on April 3, 2006, in the original principal amount of $2,000,000, payable by Seller to 1st Centennial Bank (the “Included Note”). The Included Note is secured by a deed of trust encumbering a portion of the Lake Elsinore Property. The outstanding principal balance on the Included Note as of November 3, 2009 was approximately $1,750,000. The current payee under the Included Note is Multibank 2009-1 CRE Venture, LLC.
Even though the Promissory Note is all-inclusive, if Seller fails to pay any installments when due upon the Included Note, Buyer has retained the right to make such payments directly to payee of the Included Note, and the amount so paid shall be credited against the next following installment or installments due under the Promissory Note. If Buyer fails to make any payment when required under the Promissory Note, Seller has the option to immediately declare all sums due and owing under the Promissory Note.
On March 5, 2010, Seller and Buyer executed a First Amendment to Secured Promissory Note which extended the current maturity date of the Promissory Note to November, 6, 2011 provided Buyer has made a
principal reduction of at least $500,000 on or before the current maturity date of November 6, 2010. Additionally, Buyer agreed to a two percent increase in the original interest rate beginning on the original maturity date of November 6, 2010.
Seller is our shareholder, with ownership of 380,500 shares as of December 31, 2009, which represents approximately 19.90% of our total shares outstanding. Stevan J. Gromet, President of Portfolio Partners, Inc., a California corporation, the general partner of Seller, is also our shareholder, with ownership of 47,800 shares as of December 31, 2009, which represents approximately 2.50% of our total shares outstanding.
As undeveloped land, the Tuscany Valley Project is not an income-producing property. The purchase was made based upon the anticipated capital appreciation of the property.
We also owned the following real estate-related investment as of December 31, 2009:
Mesquite Venture I, LLC - $600,000 Secured Loan On September 30, 2008, we originated, through SPT Real Estate Finance, LLC, an affiliated entity 100% owned by the Operating Partnership (“SPT Real Estate Finance”), a real estate loan of $600,000. Mesquite Venture I, LLC was the borrower. The loan is a second position lien behind a $3,681,000 first position lien. The term of the loan was nine months and bore interest at an annual rate of 14%. The loan was secured by a second deed of trust, assignment of rents and security agreement encumbering real property situated in the City of Mesquite with an appraised value of $11,000,000 as of July 18, 2008. This loan is also secured by personal guarantees from four separate individuals. This real estate loan was recorded as a note receivable with $63,000 of prepaid interest netted against the note balance on our consolidated balance sheet.
On or about June 30, 2009, SPT Real Estate Finance agreed to extend the maturity date of its secured note with Mesquite Venture I, LLC from June 30, 2009 to May 15, 2010. In consideration of this loan extension, Mesquite Venture I, LLC agreed to pay a loan extension fee of five percent of the outstanding principal balance or $30,000 payable as follows: $10,000 upon execution of the secured note extension, $10,000 on October 1, 2009 and $10,000 on January 1, 2010. Mesquite Venture I, LLC also agreed to make a $10,000 payment on April 1, 2010, which will be applied against accrued and unpaid interest. Interest will accrue on the outstanding principal balance at an annual rate of fourteen percent and all accrued and unpaid interest and principal will be due and payable in full at the new maturity date of May 15, 2010.
On or about October 12, 2009, SPT Real Estate Finance was informed that on September 28, 2009 a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (“NOD”) was recorded on behalf of East West Bank, as beneficiary (“East West Bank”), with respect to the first position lien securing certain obligations of Mesquite Venture I, LLC to East West Bank, including without limitation indebtedness under a Promissory Note in the initial principal amount of $3,681,000 (the “Senior Loan”). The NOD was filed due to Mesquite Venture I, LLC’s failure to pay the August 1, 2009 installment of principal and interest and all subsequent installments of principal and interest under the Senior Loan.
A default on our secured note was triggered when Mesquite Venture I, LLC failed to make their $10,000 loan extension fee payment due on October 1, 2009. Mesquite Venture I, LLC subsequently failed to make its $10,000 loan extension fee payment due on January 1, 2010.
On December 24, 2009, an entity controlled by one of the original guarantors of the aforementioned Senior Loan, entered into a Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement whereby the holder of the Senior Loan, East West Bank, agreed to sell to PLQ Mesquite Investors, LLC (Paul J. Giuntini, one of the original guarantors of the Senior Loan is manager of PLQ Mesquite Investors, LLC), the $3,681,000 mortgage note together with all of East West Bank’s interest in and to any of Mesquite Venture I, LLC’s property held by East West Bank, all collateral and any guarantees obtained in connection with the $3,681,000 note. The purchase price paid by PLQ Mesquite Investors, LLC to East West Bank was $1,800,000.
On December 30, 2009, East West Bank officially assigned to PLQ Mesquite Investors, LLC, the beneficial interest under the Deed of Trust, Security Agreement, Assignment of Rents & Fixture Filing dated as of June 26, 2006, made by Mesquite Venture I, LLC as trustor, for the benefit of East West Bank, as beneficiary and recorded June 26, 2006. Mesquite Venture I, LLC cured its first lien position default upon the purchase, by PLQ
Mesquite Investors, LLC, of the $3,681,000 mortgage note from East West Bank as PLQ Mesquite Investors, LLC’s manager, was also a guarantor on the $3,681,000 mortgage note with East West Bank.
Mesquite Venture I, LLC and our Advisor agreed that if Mesquite Venture I, LLC paid (i) all past due payments required as outlined in the extension agreement, (ii) the April 1, 2010 payment of $10,000, and (iii) reimburses SPT Real Estate Finance $10,000 for attorney’s fees incurred due to Mesquite Venture I, LLC’s failure to make timely payments as outlined in the extension agreement, SPT Real Estate Finance would consider Mesquite Venture I, LLC reinstated and would not pursue the guarantees from Mesquite Venture I, LLC and would no longer demand payment in full on their secured note. The total amount due from Mesquite Venture I, LLC was $40,000.
On March 4, 2010, Mesquite Venture I, LLC paid SPT Real Estate Finance the negotiated $40,000, representing (i) the past due loan fee payments of $10,000 each due on October 1, 2009 and January 1, 2010, (ii) the April 1, 2010 payment of $10,000, and (iii) $10,000 for attorney’s fees incurred by SPT Real Estate Finance due to non-payment on behalf of Mesquite Venture I, LLC.
