ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
The significant properties in which the Company has an interest are described below.
Montanore Property
The Montanore Project is located in Sanders and Lincoln Counties in northwestern Montana and consists of 10 patented mining claims and 861 unpatented mining claims owned by the Company. The unpatented mining claims are held subject to a $155 per claim annual maintenance fee paid to the federal government.
The Company’s ownership of the Montanore deposit stems primarily from its ownership of two patented mining claims, identified as HR 133 and HR 134, which cover the surface outcrop or “apex” of the gently dipping mineralized beds. According to U.S. mining law, the holders of claims covering the apex of a dipping, tabular deposit own the minerals to depth, even if the deposit passes from beneath the apex claim. For the Company’s claims at Montanore, these “extralateral rights” have been confirmed by the U.S. Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior and upheld in U.S. District Court. In addition to the patented apex claims, the Company owns unpatented claims located along the fault which bounds the southwestern margin of the deposit and extends outside of the western border of the Cabinet Wilderness Area.
The Company’s property holdings for operational access and infrastructure support for the Montanore Project are located to the east of the deposit, south of the town of Libby, and are accessed from Libby by about 16 miles of secondary road up Libby Creek. The apex of the deposit can be reached from Noxon, the nearest town, by taking State Highway 200 about 2 miles to the east and then north about 5 miles on a secondary graveled road to the junction of the west and east forks of Rock Creek. From this point it is about a 4 mile hike up a Jeep trail behind a locked USFS gate to the deposit outcrop. The deposit outcrops near the border of and, other than the outcrop that occurs on the patented claims HR 133 and HR 134, lies entirely within the Cabinet Wilderness Area. Because any future mining of the deposit would take place underground and the Company has access to the deposit from outside the Cabinet Wilderness Area (our patented mining claims and certain other mineral rights predate the wilderness area designation), we do not believe that any future mining or associated surface activity would have a material impact on the wilderness area.
On May 31, 2006, the Company acquired the State Hard Rock Operating Permit 150 that covers certain exploration activities and the Montana Pollution Discharge Elimination System (“MPDES”) water discharge permit for the Montanore Project as well as title to properties providing access to the portal of the Libby adit. The 14,000 foot Libby adit was constructed in the early 1990s by previous operators. The adit stops approximately 3,000 feet short of the deposit. The Libby adit, when extended, will provide access to the Montanore deposit for a planned underground exploration and delineation drilling program. Prior to our activity in 2006, there were no plant, equipment, or subsurface improvements other than the Libby adit, which was plugged and in reclamation. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company reopened the adit and completed initial water testing to determine the treatment method for water discharged from the adit.
Non-Reserves-Mineralized Material
Non-Reserves Reported in the United States. The estimate of mineralized material set forth below was prepared by Mine Development Associates, or MDA, of Reno, Nevada in October 2005. The estimate was prepared in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7.
Mineralized Material Estimate in accordance with U.S. SEC Industry Guide 7
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under SEC’s Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the mineralized material at Montanore will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves.” Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
Geology
The Montanore Project contains a strata-bound silver-copper deposit occurring in the Revett Formation, which is part of an extensive series of Precambrian-aged metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Belt Supergroup. The Revett Formation has been subdivided into three members (upper, middle and lower) based on the contained amounts of quartzite, silty quartzite and siltite. The lower Revett, which hosts the mineralized horizons, is composed primarily of quartzite with lesser interbeds of siltite and silty quartzite.
The silver-copper mineralization at Montanore is strata-bound in the upper portions of the lower Revett Formation. Copper and silver values are carried predominately in the minerals bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite and native silver in variable proportions and concentrations. Sulfide content of the mineralized rock rarely exceeds 3% to 4% and is commonly 1% to 2%.
The mineralized zone crops out at the surface and extends down dip at least 12,000 feet to the north-northwest. The mineralization is open ended in the down dip direction. Mineralization occurs in at least two sub-parallel horizons separated by a silver- and copper-deficient zone containing low-grade lead in the form of galena. The two horizons are identified as the B1 for the upper zone and the B for the lower and more extensive zone. Both zones dip to the northwest between 15 degrees and 30 degrees, with an average of just over 15 degrees. The width of the main (B) horizon, in plane view, is defined by a fault on one side and a fold axis on the other, and varies from 804 feet to 3,540 feet. The property boundaries, however, limit the controlled portion of the deposit to a maximum of 2,000 feet. The average thickness for each of the two horizons is 35 feet, depending upon cutoff.
History and Development
The Montanore Project was owned by Noranda Minerals Corporation between 1988 and 2002. During that time, the project received a Record of Decision (“ROD”) approving a plan of operations from the USFS and the State of Montana, as well as all other permits required for the project, allowing Noranda to proceed with full operations, but the project was never put into operation. From 1988 to 2002, the Company held royalty rights to a portion of the deposit. In 2002, Noranda announced that it was withdrawing from the project, and subsequently transferred to us by quitclaim deed the patented and unpatented mining claims that control the mineral rights, and all drill core and intellectual property, including geologic, environmental and engineering studies, relating to the Montanore Project.
In May 2006, we acquired two Noranda subsidiaries that held title to the Montanore property, providing access to the 14,000 foot Libby adit which, when extended, will provide access to the Montanore deposit. Through this acquisition, we also received the Hard Rock Operating Permit 150 that covers certain exploration activities and the MPDES water discharge permit for the Montanore Project. The 14,000 foot Libby adit was constructed in the early 1990s by previous operators. The adit stops approximately 3,000 feet short of the deposit. Prior to our activity in 2006,
there were no plant, equipment, or subsurface improvements other than the Libby adit, which was plugged and in reclamation. During the third quarter of 2006, we reopened the adit and completed initial water testing to determine the treatment method for water discharged from the adit. The necessary permit revisions were received in November 2006 to undertake an underground evaluation drilling program. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased generators to provide power for the initial evaluation drilling program and erected a warehouse building and shop at the Libby adit site, along with an office and employee change facility.
In January 2007, we established a $1.124 million stand-by letter of credit to satisfy reclamation bonding requirements related to our planned exploration at the Libby adit. In 2007, we completed the construction of site infrastructure to support our planned underground evaluation program at the Montanore Project including a $1.5 million water treatment plant to process all water pumped out of the adit and a dry storage structure for inventory. We also acquired an initial fleet of surface and underground heavy equipment.
In 2008 and 2009, we continued the testing and installation of the adit dewatering system in preparation for the planned 3,000 foot extension of the Libby adit and initiation of the drilling program and installed sumps that allowed us to test most of the mining equipment that will be used during the adit advancement and future development activities. We dewatered the adit in 2009. Engineering and geology work also continued during 2008 and 2009.
The decline has been on care and maintenance since the second quarter 2009, pending completion of the environmental review process. Operations at the Libby adit are limited to maintaining the water level at the 7,400 foot level in the adit and treating the water pumped from the adit.
Advanced Exploration and Delineation Drilling Program
The objectives of our underground evaluation drilling program are to:
·
expand the known higher grade intercepts of the Montanore deposit;
·
develop additional information about the deposit;
·
further assess and define the mineralized zone; and
·
provide additional geotechnical, hydrological and other data.
The stages of the advanced exploration and delineation drilling program, and activities undertaken to date in each stage, are set out below. We expect that, following completion of permitting, Stages 2, 3 and 4 would take approximately 18 months.
Stage 1-Dewatering and Adit Rehabilitation
The construction of water pumping and treatment facilities and the addition of generators to provide power for the underground exploration program are described above. In addition, we have worked to rehabilitate the adit which involves, among other things, sealing the walls, installing new roof bolts and extending power, ventilation and dewatering infrastructure in the adit. To date, infrastructure placed in the decline includes a refuge chamber, mine power center and temporary pump station, along with the previously installed sumps and pumping system at the 700 foot location. As previously noted, the adit is now on care and maintenance until the environmental review process is complete. We are prohibited from doing further work in the adit until the USFS approves an operating plan for Montanore. Total costs for Stage 1 activities are projected at approximately $7.3 million, of which approximately $6.8 million had been spent by December 31, 2015.
Stage 2-Advancement of Adit, Drifting and Establishment of Drill Stations
Once the permitting process is complete and the adit rehabilitation completed, the Company plans to advance the adit approximately 3,000 feet towards the middle of the deposit. Upon reaching the deposit, we intend to commence
approximately 6,000 feet of development drifting and establishing drill stations, which will be necessary to provide drill access. We estimate that Stage 2 will cost approximately $12.0 million.
Stage 3-Phase I Delineation Drilling
In Stage 3 of the advanced exploration and delineation drilling program, we expect to commence approximately 25,000 feet of diamond core drilling. We expect to spend approximately $2.0 million on Phase I delineation drilling. We also expect to spend approximately $8.2 million (in addition to amounts set forth above) during Stages 1, 2 and 3 on site operating and capital costs, optimization studies and general corporate support.
Stage 4-Phase II Drilling and Bankable Feasibility Study
During this stage, we anticipate completing an additional 25,000 feet of diamond core drilling, undertaking additional metallurgical and geotechnical testing and analysis, and if the results of our exploration are successful, preparing for and completing a bankable feasibility study at an estimated cost, with site operating and capital costs, of approximately $6.0 million. A feasibility study and report would provide the basis for financing the development of the project, which was estimated in November 2010 to cost $550.0 million to develop and construct.
Permitting and Environmental
Approval by regulatory agencies is required before the Montanore Project can proceed with exploration and project development. The agencies that are involved with the major permits include the USFS, MDEQ, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”), and the USFWS. There are other permits required which will involve other agencies.
Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision
In December of 2015, the USFS and MDEQ issued a Joint Final Environmental Impact Statement that assesses the environmental impacts of the Montanore Project to endangered species, wetlands and water quality. After more than ten years of data collection, analyses, and public involvement, the completed Final Environmental Impact Statement (“FEIS”) describes the modifications to the proposed project that the agencies consider appropriate to minimize environmental impact utilizing mitigation measures and monitoring requirements. The USFS filed a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register on December 18, 2015 announcing the completion and availability of the FEIS. USFS regulations required a thirty day review period before issuing a ROD. The USFS and MDEQ both issued their RODs on February 12, 2016 providing approval for development of the Montanore Project contingent upon meeting subsequent analysis, permitting milestones, and environmental mitigation requirements.
Biological Opinion
As part of the permitting process, the USFS is required to prepare a biological assessment (“BA”) for both terrestrial and aquatic life. The USFWS reviews these reports in connection with its biological opinion addressing the impact of the Project on threatened and endangered species, including grizzly bear and bull trout. The issuance of a biological opinion was required prior to the completion of the FEIS and issuance of a ROD. On March 31, 2014, the USFWS issued the final biological opinion concluding that the project, as mitigated, will not adversely impact endangered species. With this determination, the USFS met the requirements of the Endangered Species Act necessary to advance the Montanore Project.
The FEIS issued in December of 2015 resulted in slight changes to the project’s mitigation measures to reduce impacts to grizzly bear and bull trout. The USFWS concurred with these changes prior to the issuance of the USFS ROD.
Section 404 Permit
The USACE has authority over jurisdictional waters of the U.S. and as part of the development of the FEIS, the USACE must complete an analysis of potential project discharges of dredged or fill material into water of the United
States, including wetlands. These discharges are regulated by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act which requires a permit before dredged or fill material may be discharged that is required for construction of the tailings facility. In 2012, the USACE completed a jurisdictional determination on the proposed tailings impoundment site. This process required extensive aquatic habitat data. The Company completed a compensatory mitigation plan for aquatic resources affected by the proposed tailings impoundment which was accepted by the USACE as complete during 2014. It is anticipated the USACE will make a permit decision during 2016.
The State of Montana must certify the USACE Section 404 authorization through the 401 certification process before the USACE can issue a permit. The State has been involved throughout the 404 review process and continued to work with the USACE during 2015. The Company expects that the 404 permit will be issued subsequent to the issuance of the ROD in 2016.
Hardrock Operating Permit
The Company currently holds Permit 150 (Hardrock Operating Permit) which has remained active since its issuance in 1993. Permit 150 was amended with the issuance of the ROD on February 12, 2016, authorizing the Company to conduct exploration activities.
MPDES Permit
The Company currently holds Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“MPDES”) Permit #0030279 that authorizes wastewater discharge from the project. The project is currently operating under an administratively extended permit which is valid until the FEIS, ROD, and an amended MPDES Permit is issued for the project. A draft MPDES permit amendment was issued and public notice filed announcing a public review process during 2015. The agency assessed the comments received during the public review process and analyzed any changes necessary to the draft permit. The Company anticipates the MPDES permit amendment to be issued during the second quarter of 2016.
State Permits
Many of the state permits required by the project were initiated by the agencies during 2015. Those permits under review will be issued subsequent to the issuance of the ROD in 2016. The Company will be submitting applications for other permits after receiving the ROD to coincide with required project activities.
A transmission certificate was issued concurrently with the MDEQ ROD which authorizes the Company to construct a transmission line to supply power to the project. The MDEQ also issued an air quality permit concurrent with the ROD which covers the evaluation, construction, and operational phases of the project.
The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (“DNRC”) is responsible for issuing water rights for the project during construction and operation. Reviews of water rights for the project were completed prior to 2015 but under state regulations, the water rights could not be issued until the USFS issued its ROD for the project. The Company anticipates the Montana DNRC will issue water rights during 2016.
Opposition
Private groups have been active in opposing permitting of projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area, and have taken and may in the future take actions to oppose or delay the Montanore Project. For example, Save Our Cabinets, Earthworks, and Defenders of Wildlife have filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the USFWS challenging the issuance of the Montanore biological opinion. In that complaint, the groups indicated their intention to include the USFS ROD when it was issued.
Engineering
In May 2006, McIntosh Engineering and Hatch Ltd. completed a Cost Update Study and generated a draft report for the Montanore Project. This report included engineering optimization, engineering review, cost updates, mine planning, and other aspects of the project. The report also provided additional optimization opportunities that will be evaluated as part of the on-going internal engineering work currently underway.
As part of the mine planning effort, we assembled all of the geologic information developed by Noranda and another previous owner and incorporated the information into the Vulcan mine modeling package. This 3-dimensional geologic model is a critical first step in further evaluating mine planning activities and projection of ore zones. This information was also used to develop the underground drilling targets for the evaluation drilling program.
Preliminary Economic Assessment
On December 22, 2010, we announced the completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the Montanore Project. The PEA was prepared to provide guidance on the potential viability of the Montanore Project and the basis for the continuation of exploration activities. Because of the uncertainties associated with any mineral deposit that, like the Montanore Project, does not have reserves, the PEA should not be relied on to value the Montanore Project, nor should it be considered to be a feasibility or pre-feasibility study.
The PEA did not update the mineral resource analysis of the Montanore deposit completed in October 2005 by Mine Development Associates (“MDA Report”). Mineralized material, as set forth in the MDA Report, is 81.5 million short tons of material grading 2.04 ounces per short ton silver and 0.75% copper with a cutoff grade of 1.0 ounces per short ton silver.
The PEA assumed pricing of the estimated Montanore resources based on a three year trailing average at August 16, 2010 (i.e. $3.10 per pound for copper and $15.00 per ounce for silver) and developed cost estimates for development of the Montanore Project. Initial capital costs for the project were estimated to be $552.3 million (with a ± 35% accuracy). The PEA assumed that the project would utilize conventional grinding and flotation processing techniques at an initial processing rate of 12,500 short tons per day.
The PEA concluded that the Montanore Project demonstrates favorable economic potential which justifies commencement of a resource evaluation program and subsequent pre-feasibility study.
On February 3, 2011, the PEA was filed in Canada in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101-Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The technical report summarizing the results of the PEA was prepared by or under the supervision of Mr. Chris Kaye and Mr. Geoffrey Challiner of Mine and Quarry Engineering Services, Inc. of San Mateo, California, each of whom is an independent “Qualified Person,” as such term is defined in Canadian National Instrument 43-101. The PEA filed in Canada is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Description of Royalties on our Patented Mining Claims
Under the HR 133 and HR 134 patented mining claims, which cover the Montanore deposit, we are required to pay a production payment royalty of twenty cents ($.20) per ton of ore extracted and milled therefrom, pursuant to (i) that Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 6, 1988, between Atlantic Goldfields Inc. and Montana Reserves Company, and (ii) that Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 6, 1988, between Jascan Resources Inc. and Montana Reserves Company, a former joint venture partner with Noranda. The royalty is payable with respect to the amount of resources included in an independent feasibility study prepared for project financing purposes, is payable at six month intervals following the commencement of commercial production as defined in the referenced agreements, and terminates when the reserve as defined in the feasibility study has been mined and milled.
Other Properties
The Company also owns certain patented and unpatented mining claims on zinc properties in northern Washington State, referred to as the Iroquois and Advance properties. No mining activities have been conducted on these properties since the 1960s.
ITEM 3.
