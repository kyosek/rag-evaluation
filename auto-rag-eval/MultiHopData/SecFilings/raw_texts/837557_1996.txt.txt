Evanston Galleria Limited Partnership On October 31, 1989, the Partnership acquired an interest in Evanston Galleria Limited Partnership (the "Galleria Partnership") which owns a 100% beneficial interest in the Evanston Galleria, a mixed-use residential and retail property located in Evanston, Illinois. The property, located on a 0.79 acre site, contains 36,068 square feet of rentable retail space and 55 loft apartments. The Partnership's acquisition of its interest was effected through its acquisition of an 18.30% general partnership interest in the Galleria Partnership from First Dearborn Evanston Associates Limited Partnership ("Evanston Associates"), an affiliate of the General Partners. Evanston Associates originally agreed to purchase a 76.67% interest in the Galleria Partnership by agreeing to contribute an aggregate $2,313,125 to the Galleria Partnership. The Partnership acquired a portion of the 76.67% general partnership interest on the same terms by contributing $552,066 for its 18.30% general partnership interest. The seller retained a 23.33% limited partnership interest.
The Partnership and Evanston Associates, as general partners of the Galleria Partnership, have certain preferences from operating cash flow and distributions from sales or refinancing. Profits are generally allocated in accordance with cash distributions (including preferences) and then in accordance with the respective partner's interest. Losses are allocated first to partners with positive capital account balances and then in accordance with the respective partner's interest.
The limited partners ("Guarantors") of the Galleria Partnership had provided the Partnership and Evanston Associates with a guaranty of minimum rentals on certain retail space, maximum debt service levels and maximum real estate tax expenses in the Galleria Partnership. The property has failed to perform as expected and the Galleria Partnership has called upon the Guarantors to satisfy their obligations under the guaranties. The Guarantors have failed to fulfill their obligations to the Partnership, and the General Partners have taken actions to protect the rights of the Partnership, including receipt of an assignment in favor of the Partnership of the Guarantors' limited partnership interests in the Galleria Partnership of 5.57% and the receipt of security interests in certain other limited partnership interests owned by the Guarantors. Amounts owed pursuant to such guaranties which are secured by the limited partners' partnership interests will be recorded upon receipt.
The property is managed by an affiliate of the General Partners. During 1996, management fees totaling $25,091 werre paid to an affiliate of the General Partners. No management fee was paid in 1995 or 1994.
In connection with the loan modification to the first mortgage on the Evanston Galleria, which closed in February of 1993 and was effective August 1, 1992, the Galleria Partnership received an infusion of additional capital and obtained modifications of the terms of its loans. $202,000 of additional capital was contributed to the Galleria Partnership by Evanston Associates, of which the Partnership's share was $50,000, in exchange for a preferred equity position. The preferred equity holders shall receive an annual preferred return from cash distributions in an amount equal to the lesser of: a) prime rate plus 2%, or b) 10% per annum. For financial reporting purposes, the Partnership has a 23.87% interest in the Galleria Partnership.
Evanston Galleria is located in downtown Evanston, Illinois, a short distance from Northwestern University. Demand for the apartments has been strong over the past five years with occupancy averaging 98%. Apartment rents have been rising approximately 3% per year. The ground floor retail space had been 100% occupied during the past five years, except for several instances where tenants defaulted. This resulted in vacancies and a reduction in rental income. Demand for the ground floor retail space has generally been strong. The lower level retail space, however, has been vacant since 1995. One retail tenant, with a lease for 11,500 square feet, filed a petition for bankruptcy on January 11, 1994. The tenant stopped paying rent and vacated the premises during the third quarter of 1995. During the fourth quarter of 1995, a second tenant representing 2,135 square feet defaulted under the terms of its lease and vacated the space. Management has taken legal action against the defaulted tenants, but currently has no estimate of the amount, if any, or timing of collection of amounts due from these tenants. The decrease in revenues resulting from these vacacies has made it difficult for the property to meet its financial obligations. The property is located in an established downtown area, and there is little vacant land upon which additional retail space or apartments could be developed, in the immediate area. Management is currently negotiating with prospective replacement tenants. However there can be no assurances that these prospective leases will be consummated.
The property is subject to a first mortgage which matured May 1, 1996. Effective May 1, 1996, a modification of the first mortgage was entered into which, among other modifications, extended the maturity of the loan until May 1, 1998. Commencing on May 1, 1996, monthly payments were adjusted to $57,143, which represents interest only payments at an annual rate of 8.25%, based on the outstanding principal balance of the loan as of May 1, 1996. Notwithstanding the pay rate of 8.25%, interest on the loan continues to accrue and compound monthly on the unpaid principal balance at the annual rate of 9.00%. The interest differential, as defined, will be paid only from proceeds resulting from a sale or refinancing of the property or from any remaining funds in the cash flow escrow. The unpaid interest together with the unpaid principal balance of the loan will be due and payable May, 1 1998. All net cash flow from the property, in excess of the payments due for interest, shall be deposited into a cash flow escrow account. If cash flow in any month is insufficient to pay amounts due under the loan, then the amounts may be withdrawn from the cash flow escrow account.
Sycamore Mall Associates On October 26, 1990, the Partnership contributed $2,275,000 to acquire a 53.40% general partnership interest in Sycamore Mall Associates, a general partnership formed to acquire the Sycamore Mall Shopping Center in Iowa City, Iowa. The property, situated on an approximate 21.2 acre site, includes a main building containing 213,206 square feet and an out parcel building containing 27,000 square feet. A 14,000 square foot parcel which contains a 4,590 square foot building is under a ground lease to McDonald's. Sycamore Mall Associates acquired the property on October 26, 1990 for a purchase price of $9,400,000, subject to a purchase money note of $5,140,000 bearing interest at 10% payable interest only until maturity on October 26, 1995. On August 8, 1991, Sycamore Mall Associates obtained a first mortgage in the amount of $5,140,000 which bore interest at a rate of 9.625% payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of $45,355 commencing October 1, 1991 for 60 months until September 30, 1996. The proceeds of this first mortgage were used to repay the original purchase money note. In October 1995, the first mortgage loan was modified. The terms of the modification reduced the interest rate to 8.125%, reduced the monthly payments of principal and interest to $44,375 and extended the maturity to March 1, 2002.
First Dearborn Income Properties L.P., a public limited partnership affiliated with the General Partners of the Partnership, and First Dearborn Sycamore Associates Limited Partnership ("FDSALP"), a privately offered limited partnership also affiliated with the General Partners, are the joint venture partners in Sycamore Mall Associates and contributed a total of $1,075,000 and $910,000 for 25.24% and 21.36% of the general partner interests, respectively. The terms of the Sycamore Mall Associates partnership agreement provide that cash flow, sale or refinancing proceeds and profit and loss will be distributed or allocated in proportion to the partner's ownership interests.
The property is managed by an affiliate of the General Partners and an affiliate of the seller under a five year management agreement that provides for a fee equal to 5% of the effective gross income, of which 1% is paid to an affiliate of the General Partners. During 1996, 1995 and 1994 the property incurred management fees of $96,048, $97,270 and $88,306, respectively.
During 1996, Randall's vacated its leased premises of 19,800 square feet. Occupancy fell to 86%, however, Randall's has continued to pay rent through December, 1996 so that there was no adverse financial impact in 1996. Management is currently negotiating with a potential replacement tenant, however there can be no assurance that a new lease will be entered into. If this space is not released, the ability of Sycamore Mall to meet its financial obligations could be effected. Further, there have been newspaper reports that Sears will be vacating Sycamore Mall and moving to a new mall which has recently begun construction. These reports are unconfirmed and no official word has been received from Sears. The Sears lease at Sycamore Mall expires in 2002. The Sears lease comprises 82,605 square feet which is 34% of the leaseable area of the shopping center. However, the annual rental income received from Sears is approximately $109,000 or approximately 6% of total revenues.
Sycamore Mall is located in Iowa City, Iowa. Construction has begun on a new regional shopping center in the area. This development will create additional competition for Sycamore Mall. As a precautionary measure, Sycamore Mall Associates had reduced distributions to its partners, in 1995 and 1996, in order to maintain its working capital reserves. It is believed that the additional working capital might be necessary to help maintain existing tenants and attract new tenants, due to the increased competition from the new shopping center. However, during the fourth quarter of 1996, Sycamore Mall Associates distributed the extra reserve to its partners. The partners have agreed to maintain these additional reserves and will contribute these amounts back to Sycamore Mall Associates if it is considered appropriate by the partners. The Partnership has no definite plans for improvements to the property at this time. Distributions to the Partners in 1996 were $407,998 as compared to $190,325 in 1995 and $245,974 in 1994.
Country Isles On July 12, 1991 the Partnership acquired from an unaffiliated seller, a 21% interest in Country Isles Associates, an Illinois general partnership owning Country Isles Shopping Center. The Partnership paid $775,000 for its 21% interest in the joint venture. The remaining interest in the joint venture is held by the Seller. The partners of Country Isles Associates are the Partnership and Arvida/JMB Partners. Arvida/JMB Partners, which owns a 79% interest in Country Isles Associates, is the managing general partner. All profits, losses and cash distributions of Country Isles Associates are allocated between its partners in accordance with their percentage interests, described above, except that, in the case of the Partnership, a special preferential distribution of cash is to be made to the Partnership to compensate it for certain rental discounts granted by the Seller in connection with the lease of the property.
The Country Isles Shopping Center, located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is an approximately 106,000 square foot retail shopping center containing approximately 71,000 square feet which opened in 1986 and an additional expansion of approximately 35,000 square feet which opened in 1989. The shopping center is 99% occupied as of December 31, 1996. The Country Isles Shopping Center is managed by an affiliate of the Seller.
There is over 4.0 million square feet of competing retail space availale within a 15 minute drive of the Country Isles property. Within 4 miles of the property there are two additional shopping centers which have recently opened, which added an additional 116,000 square feet of retail space to the competitive market. Country Isles is located in a rapidly growing area and management anticipates that the additional competition will not have an adverse impact on the operations of the property.
On April 25, 1996, Country Isles Associates completed the refinancing of Country Isles Plaza in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. The new mortgage provided funding of $8,100,000, the proceeds of which were used to repay the outstanding balance of $6,807,669 on the previous mortgage, pay the costs of completing the new loan (approximately $174,000), and provide for property tax escrow and working capital. Out of the remaining proceeds, the Partnership received a distribution of $210,650 from Country Isles Associates. The Partnership made a special distribution to the Limited Partners. No significant impact to the property is anticipated as a result of the increased mortgage indebtedness. As a result of the refinancing, the interest rate was reduced from 9.75% to 7.00%, the monthly payments have decreased from $60,141 to $57,250. The mortgage matures on May 1, 2001.
Through March of 1992, Country Isles Shopping Center was managed by Arvida Management, Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership which is affiliated with Arvida/JMB Partners. In March of 1992, JMB Property Management, also an affiliate of Arvida/JMB Partners, became the manager. Both the previous and current Management Agreements provide that the Manager will rent and manage the project for a term of five years, and thereafter for yearly periods, unless otherwise terminated by the parties in accordance with the management agreement. Country Isles Associates shall pay the Manager a management fee in an amount equal to 4% of the monthly operating revenues from the operation of the property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such time as the management agent notifies owner of its election to receive the management fee discussed immediately above, Country Isles Associates shall pay the Manager, in lieu of the management fee, an amount equal to 15% of amounts paid by tenants at the project on account of reimbursement of operating expenses, excluding taxes and insurance. During 1996, 1995 and 1994, the property incurred management fees of $68,053, $62,912, and $63,623, respectively.
