ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Executive Offices and Address for Service
Our current address for the principal place of business is located at Xiamen City, Si Ming District, Jia He Road No.25, Xinjing Centre, Unit C2606, PRC China 361009. We paid a monthly rent of RMB11,042 to an unrelated party.
Properties
The Shangzhai Coal Mine
We own 100% equity interest in the Fujian Huilong coal property, located at Yongding County, Fujian Province, People’s Republic of China, about 30 km south of the nearest major town, Longyan City, and about 130 km northwest of Xiamen, a major coastal port for Fujian Province. The nearest village, Shangzhai, is about 1.5 km away. The road between this property and Shangzhai village is paved. Provincial Highway 203 passes through the village and is in turn connected to a recently constructed freeway. The nearest rail access is about 15 km away at Canton City.
The Shangzhai coal property is comprised of a mining license about 5.7 km2 in area. Currently, we are producing about 150,000 t of coal annually from eight coal seams in two underground operating areas. We applied for a new mining permit to expand our mining area to 7.5 km2 in order to increase the amount of coal mined. As of May 13, 2011, we obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows us to mine at different mining levels.
The climate in this part of China is semi-tropical. The climate along the coastal area of the province is semi-tropical (hot in the summer, and cool in winter). Mean temperatures range from about 84°F (29°C) in July to about 52°F (11°C) in January. There are three seasons: November through February is the cool season, March through May, the warm season; and June through October, the hot season. The growing period lasts throughout the year; likewise, mining operations are possible on a year-round basis.
The Shangzhai coal property has sufficient surface rights for current and anticipated mining operations, as well as sufficient power, water, and personnel. The surface rights relate to the rights relating to the mining facilities on the surface. These surface rights are distinct from the rights conveyed in our existing mining license, which allow us to mine for coals underground. The mine is connected to the state power grid and a river flows through the Shangzhai coal property. This region of Fujian has numerous coal mining operations and a large skilled workforce.
History of Exploration and Development
The earliest documented exploration in the area dates from 1950 to 1960 when Fujian Province Coal Exploration Team 121 carried out regional exploration for coal. Exploration on the Shangzhai coal property itself began in 1989 by the same exploration team as part of a regional evaluation that was carried out until 1994. Part of this exploration consisted of driving adits so that production began at almost the same time that exploration was initiated.
Over the period of 1989 to 2003, this team excavated an unknown number of trenches and underground development, as well as drilled 26 core holes. In 2000, with increasing concern about mine safety, the government rescinded the mining licence that was issued to the initial operator whose operational procedures were sub-standard. Details pertaining to the amount of exploration, development, and extraction by the previous owner are not known.
Fujian Huilong incorporated and obtained the business licence on August 4, 2005 and first mining license was obtained in April of 2006, approximately 2.7 km2 in area and with an annual permitted production rate of 60,000 t, and have been in operation ever since. In 2005, the license area was expanded to its present size of approximately 5.7 km2 with an annual permitted mining rate of 90,000 t. Having rights to legally extract stated amount of coal does not guarantee reserves or the amount that may be economically extracted. We have not conducted any drilling or conducted any other exploration on the property that is subject to the existing mining permit.
Geology
The Shangzhai coal property contains eight coal seams of Permian age that are mined commercially within a mining licence that measures about 5.7 km2 in area. The eight commercial seams (numbered 3, 5, 7, 9, 23, 24, 28 Upper and 28), are among about 24 seams that occur within the Permian age Tongziyan Formation. The strata have been deformed by low-angle thrusting and folding. This deformation has resulted in the division of the mining areas into northern and southern sectors separated by a zone in which structural deformation has removed or truncated the coal-bearing strata.
Annual Production
The following table shows the annual sale and production volume from our Shangzhai coal mine and the average sale price before tax per ton for our coal for the last three years.
Coal Reserve
We retained Wardrop Engineering Inc., an independent firm, to prepare a technical report in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 on the Shangzhai coal property. The information that follows relating to the Shangzhai coal mine is derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from, the technical report dated May 10, 2011, authored by Greg Mosher, P.Geo, Wenchang Ni, P.Eng., and Doug Ramsey, P.Eng. of Wardrop Engineering Inc. in respect of the Shangzhai coal property. At the time of the preparation of the technical report, these authors were independent of our company and were a “qualified persons”, as that term is defined in National Instrument 43-101.
Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures which are not fully described herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the technical report on the Shangzhai coal property which has been filed with certain Canadian securities regulatory authorities pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 and is available for review at www.sedar.com.
The Shangzhai coal mine’s coal reserves as reported by Wardrop Engineering Inc. presented here comply with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The information we have provided in this Form 8-K is presented in accordance with the requirements of Industry Guide 7. However, information concerning the resources estimates contained in this report may not be comparable to information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC, specifically the SEC’s Industry Guide 7. National Instrument 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Unless otherwise indicated, all reserve estimates contained in this report have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC, and reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies.
Based on the report of Wardrop Engineering Inc. dated May 10, 2011, the total remaining coal reserve at the end of 2009 was 1,354,000 t, including 416,000 t of proven coal reserve, and 938,000 t of probable coal reserve. Modified factors mainly include a 25% coal pillar loss rate, 85% panel recovery rate, and 5% dilution rate. Because most of the annual production of 150,000t in year 2010 was produced outside of the 5.7 km2 area covered by our valid mining permit (permit number: 3500000620055), the coal reserve estimate as of December 31, 2010 remained at approximately 1,354,000 t. The coal production of 134,668 t in 2011 was conducted within the parameter stated in the mining permit. The remaining coal reserve as of December 31, 2012 still pending for the geological report to be issued from an independent and qualified Canada based geologist company, Wardrop Engineering Inc. (the “Wardrop”). Because the scope of Wardrop’s work on the NI-43-101 technical report covered 5.7 km2 area of the mining permit numbered 3500000620055, which provides for an annual production rate of 90,000 t/a and is in good standing until April 2016, but Wardrop noted that Fujian Huilong’s production was over 200,000 t in year 2009 and about 150,000 t in year 2010, and that portions of Fujian Huilong’s mine development were situated outside the boundaries of the 5.7 km2 mining permit, accordingly, it was Wardrop’s opinion that Shangzhai should renew the mining permit as soon as possible to verify the legality and safety of the mine. As of May 13, 2011, Shangzhai has obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by its existing mining permit, which also allows it to mine at different mining levels. As of May 13, 2011, Shangzhai has obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by its existing mining permit, which also allows it to mine at different mining levels.

Our Mining Operations
The Shangzhai coal property is comprised of Mining Licence No. 3500000620055, is 5.7 km2 in area and is held in the name of Fujian Huilong. This licence includes an earlier, smaller licence that is approximately 2.7 km2 in area. The licence was issued in April 2006 and remains in good standing until April 2016. As of May 13, 2011, we have obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows us to mine at different mining levels.
The Shangzhai coal mine located in the Shangzhai coal property is a typical multi-seam coal mine with decline shaft access that employs longwall mining with a low degree of mechanization. The Shangzhai coal mine operates on the eight thin coal seams. The thicknesses of coal seams seldom exceeds 1 m.
The mine exploits eight coal seams that do not outcrop on the Shangzhai coal property but are of regional extent; therefore the coal resource is more extensive than the Shangzhai coal property. The Shangzhai coal property does, however, contain all mine development and storage as well as all related infrastructure, including explosives storage and an electrical substation.
The main facilities at the Shangzhai coal mine include the north main shaft, the south main shaft, the north auxiliary shaft with two axial fans, the south auxiliary shaft, and the south vent shaft with two axial fans. Other ancillary facilities include an air compressor room, four ground surface winch rooms, two coal storage sheds, one old coal gangue storage area, one new coal gangue storage area, two mining water sedimentation tanks, office buildings, dormitories, kitchens, and canteens, etc.
The Shangzhai coal mine has two operation areas - North and South - divided by the fault. Both the North and South areas have independent ventilation and hoisting systems. The main decline shafts are equipped with winches to pull and lower mine cars on tracks between each production level to surface. Production levels, which generally have 40 m vertical interval, are grouped in a system with respect to the decline.
We utilize a central methane monitoring and controlling system. The mine dispatcher can continuously monitor the methane level of major underground working places and, in the event of unsafe methane levels, appropriate action can be taken immediately.
Since 2007, the Shangzhai coal mine production capacity has been progressively increased from approximately 50,000 t/a to 240,000 t/a, with the exception of a decrease in 2010 to 156,000 t/a and further decrease in 2013 to 67,701t/a due to the production stopped since august due to market conditions.
Most of the coal was produced from the Southern area, since mine development was not finished in the Northern area. However, we performed a lot of mine development in the Northern area, which is not subject to the existing mining permit, and prepared more than enough working places for extending the permitted production capacity.
Although the mine produced more than 100,000 t of coal from 2009 to 2012, this production capacity may not be sustainable because portions of the mine development are situated outside the boundaries of the valid mining permit. According to Wardrop Engineering Inc., the Shangzhai coal mine should have a production capacity of only 90,000 t/a under the current valid mining permit. Government authorities may order the Shangzhai coal mine to be closed or limited at any time, since the area of active mining currently exceeds the scope of the mining permit. However, our management believes that this risk has been minimized since as of May 13, 2011, we have obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows us to mine at different mining levels. We initially applied for a mining permit covering an area of 7.5 km2, including area covered by our past active mining operations. The new mining permit issued to us covers an area of 6.8 km2, which is the 7.5 km2 area we applied for less the area exhausted by our past mining activities. After receiving this new mining permit, we intend to conduct our mining operations only within the areas covered by our valid mining permits.
Our annual permitted mine production rate increased gradually since 2006 from 60,000 t/a to the current 90,000 t/a with full support of the local mining authorities. At the annual permitted mine production rate of 90,000 t/a, our mine operation is consider larger than the local artisan mining operations, which are target of government enforcement. As we expanded of our actual mine production beyond the 90,000 t/a, our mine production infrastructure has also been steadily developed to support the excess production. It is our management’s view that our current mine development can support an annual production of 300,000 t/a. Our management’s view of our production capability being 300,000 t/a is based on the facts that when we expanded our mining operation through the years, we have developed our mine production infrastructure with a goal of exceeding 300,000 t/a and also that we were able to produce 114,000t and 67,701t of coal for years 2012 and 2013 respectively. Our management is also of the view that this annual production capability of 300,000 t/a is based on mining operations only in the areas covered by current valid mining permits. We intend to and are in the process of applying for an increase to our annual permitted mine production rate to 300,000 t/a in stages over the next few years. The application process includes submitting an application and plan for the production increase, followed by the review of records and inspection by officials onsite. The factors in determining whether an application to increase annual production rate would be approved include past production records, actual production capacity, adequacy of equipment and infrastructure and past safety records. The government authorities may approve increase annual production rate in stages and with requirements of trial period. Because of the condition of our mining operation, we are confident that we will be able to secure future increase to our permitted rate of annual production from the authorities, if not directly to 300,000 t/a, to a rate of 180,000 t/a as the first stage increase. The likelihood of the authorities shutting down our mine for non-compliance is relatively small. In May of 2011, we also obtained a new mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by its existing mining permit, which also allows it to mine at different mining levels. This new mining permit also allows us to produce at an annual production rate of 90,000 t/a from the area covered by this ming permit. Accordingly, we are currently able to produce 90,000 t/a from each of the areas covered by our two mining permits. Should the authorities indicate to us that strict compliance with permitted mine production rate is required, we intend to limit our mine production to 90,000 t/a from each of the areas covered by our two mining permits until such time when our annual permitted mine production rate is increased.
Wardrop Engineering Inc. estimated that the Shangzhai coal mine had a remaining coal reserve of 1,354,000 t as of Dec 31, 2009. Because most of the mining activity in 2010 was performed outside the area covered by our valid mining permit, the remaining coal reserve in the 5.7 km2 area is essentially the same as that at the end of 2009. The coal production of 134,668 t in 2011 was conducted within the parameter stated in the mining permit. The remaining coal reserve as of December 31, 2013 still pending for the geological report to be issued from an independent and qualified Canada based geologist company, Wardrop Engineering Inc. (the “Wardrop”).Wardrop recommends that Shangzhai should renew the mining permit as soon as possible to verify the legality and safety of the mine. As of May 13, 2011, we obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows us to mine at different mining levels. Under the current valid mining permit, the life of mine will be approximately 15 years at a production rate of 90,000 t/a. The life of mine will be re-evaluated when Shangzhai renewed its mining permit with updated mining area and production rate. The remaining coal reserve as of December 31, 2013 still pending for the geological report to be issued from an independent and qualified Canada based geologist company, Wardrop Engineering Inc. (the “Wardrop”)
Growth Strategy
We plan to increase our coal reserves by: (i) performing further exploration programs in the current valid mining permit to upgrade our coal resources into the coal reserves; and (ii) expanding the mining boundary, and conducting corresponding feasibility studies with a new mining permit to increase the coal reserves. As of May 13, 2011, Shangzhai has obtained a mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by its existing mining permit but also allows it to mine at different mining levels. We expended approximately US$78,125 (RMB500,000) to retain Fujian Province Coal Exploration Team 8 to investigate preliminarily the geological characteristics, coal seam distribution, structure, thickness, lithology and formation. A preliminary coal resource estimate has been completed on this 6.83 km2 mining area. In addition, we also expended approximately US$70,313 (RMB450,000) to commission Fujian Huaxia Architecture Design Institute to complete a 300,000 t/year feasibility study. Shangzhai is planning to update the current NI 43-101 report prepared by Wardrop beginning in November of 2011 to incorporate the coal resource and reserves in the 6.83 km2 area, which is expected to be in compliance with the CIM standards (the standards set forth by Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum). We anticipate that we will need to spend approximately US$60,000 to update the NI 43-101 report. We anticipate that the updated NI 43-101 report will be finalized by June 2014. The National Instrument 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects, designed to improve the accuracy and integrity of the information provided by mining issuers.
Permits and Other Regulatory Requirements
Permits
We operate the Shangzhai coal mine pursuant to the following 7 permits:
*Note: the scope of Wardrop’s work is limited to the area covered by mining permit 3500000620055 only.
Wardrop Engineering Inc. recommended that we should renew and expand the mining permit as soon as possible to guarantee that mine production is legal and to ensure safe operation. We submitted applications to the authorities to expand our mining area for an additional 7.5 km2 and increase production capacity in May of 2010. As of May 13, 2011, we have obtained another mining permit (C3500002011051120112047) for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows us to mine at different mining levels.
A notice issued in 2006 by the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) deemed that the Environmental Impact Assessment of a coal mine construction project within an area covered by a coal mine master plan cannot be approved until a planning Environmental Impact Assessment of the coal mine master plan is approved, which management expects to be approved. Since the master plan for the Longyang Longtan - Shizhong coal mine area (which covers the Shangzhai coal mine) was under preparation as of November 2010, there is a risk that an Environmental Impact Assessment for the Shangzhai coal mine expansion will not be approved before the corresponding planning Environmental Impact Assessment is approved. However, we are not sure when the master plan for the Longyang Longtan - Shizhong coal mine area will be finalized so we have no way to assess the likely impact on our Shangzhai coal mine. We intend use commercial reasonable efforts to comply with any additional requirements imposed by the master plan for the Longyang Longtan - Shizhong coal mine area on our Shangzhai coal mine.
Safety Risk Deposit
On August 26, 2005, we paid about US$154,560 (equivalent to RMB 1 million) to the Yongding County Coal Development Company as a representative of the Yongding County Coal Industry Management Bureau. In 2005, the approved capacity of the Shangzhai Mine was 60,000 t/a. Since April 2006, the approved capacity of the Shangzhai coal mine was increased to 90,000 t/a. According to consultation with the Yongding County Coal Industry Management Bureau in November 2010, there is no regulation that specifically requires a coal mine that has paid the safety risk deposit at an originally approved capacity to increase the safety risk deposit once its capacity is increased. In addition, we have received from Yongding County Coal Industry Management Bureau a confirmation that our safety risk deposit will not increase as the safety risk deposit was an one-time fee. As we have already received this confirmation from Yongding County Coal Management Bureau, we believe the risk of any fines or other penalties being assessed against our company as a result of any failure to properly pay safety risk deposit is minimal.
Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit
The Fujian Provincial Mine Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit Management Measures (effective as of January 1, 2007) requires every mining license holder within Fujian Province to:
·
prepare a Mine Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Plan;
·
sign a Mine Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Agreement with the Fujian Land and Resources Bureau;
·
pay a Mine Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit.
The Mine Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit should be paid to the Fujian Province Land and Resources Bureau who issued the Mining License. The deposit can be paid in one lump sum, or in partial installments annually.
The total Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit for operating the Shangzhai coal mine is about US$596,782 (equivalent to RMB 3.86 million). We paid about US$179,035 (equivalent to RMB 1.16 million (or 30% of the total deposit)) to the Fujian Provincial Land and Resources Bureau on November 18, 2009. The balance of about US$417,747 (equivalent to RMB 2.702826 million (or 70% of the total deposit)) must be paid to the Fujian Provincial Land and Resources Bureau before April 2015 (one year ahead of the expiration of the mining license).
Environmental, Health, and Safety Approvals
Environmental Resources Management Shanghai Limited (“ERM”) was commissioned by Wardrop Engineering Inc. to undertake an environmental, health, safety review of the Shangzhai coal mine, which was used by Wardrop Engineering Inc. to complete a technical report on the Shangzhai coal property. ERM identified 13 environmental risks, 4 occupational health and safety risks, and no community (social) risks. According to the technical report of Wardrop Engineering Inc., most of the risks identified by ERM’s review may result in fines below the material threshold (US$250,000), but should not result in immediate shut-down of the operations.
ERM recommended that we apply for the following environmental, health, and safety approvals, which were not in place at the time of the site visit by ERM from October 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010:
·
Occupational Disease Hazard Pre-Assessment (ODHA);
·
Occupational Disease Hazard Control Effectiveness Assessment (ODHCEA);
·
Firefighting Design approval and Firefighting Completion Inspection approval;
·
Water Abstraction Permit.
Currently ODHA and ODHCEA systems have not been set up in Fujian province, accordingly, we are unable to complete these assessments as there are no regulatory bodies in Fujian province current responsible for implementation of these systems. Because the ODHA and ODHCEA systems have not been implemented in Fujian Province, our management does not believe that we are currently in violation of existing rules or laws in this regard. Our management intends to comply with the requirements of ODHA and ODHCEA systems when they are implemented in Fujian Province. However, because these systems are not yet in place, our management is not able to assess the likely length of time and costs that are required for our company to comply with these requirements. We do not know and have not basis to predict when ODHA and ODHCEA systems will be available in Fujian province. We will continue to monitor the status of potential implementation of ODHA and ODHCEA systems in Fujian province closely and be ready for future compliance requirements. However, Shangzhai has incorporated voluntarily the yearly occupational disease examination for coal miners. In addition, Shangzhai pays the work injury insurance at a 30% ration of all the employees without naming beneficiaries. The water abstraction has not been regulated in the Shangzhai mine area. We do not know and have not basis to predict when water abstraction regulations will be implemented in the Shangzhai mine area. We will monitor the status of potential implementation of water abstraction regulations in the Shangzhai mine area closely and be ready for future compliance requirements. When the relevant regulations are in place, Shangzhai intends to apply for these approvals. The water for mine operation is now shared with the local people at a pre-agreed payment. The written contractual agreement between Fujian Huilong and the villagers is valid until June 2016 and provides that Fujian Huilong shall pay Xia Village Charitable Affairs Commission an annual payment of RMB15,000 for the right to share the water resources with Xia Village.
The mine production in 2009 exceeded the permitted production capacity, as well as using a newly constructed coal gangue storage facility that may result in a fine up to about US$31,250 (equivalent to RMB 200,000) and temporarily shut-down of mine operation. The management is of the view that the likelihood of our company being fined or our mine operation being temporarily shut-down because of the use of the newly constructed coal gangue storage facility is small because we have already paid the first instalment of the Ecological Environment Rehabilitation Deposit, which we believe is being applied to ensure our use of the newly constructed coal gangue storage facility will not have severe environmental impact. Another material level risk is the lack of the firefighting design approval or firefighting completion inspection approval has not been presented during the site visit made by ERM, retained by Wardrop to undertake an EHS and community review of the Shangzhai Mine which is part of the independent technical report in accordance with the NI 43-101. The lack of firefighting design approval may result in a fine up to about US$46,875 (equivalent to RMB 300,000) and shut-down for non-compliance with the firefighting law. The original firefighting approval documents had been submitted to and filed in Longyan Coal Administrator Bureau in the application progress for the previous expansion in 2008 on the 5.7 km2 area. Fujian Huilong provided the 2008 expansion approval document issued by Longyan Coal Administrator Bureau “Longmeianjian 2008 (34)”. The approval and inspection occurred in the 5.7 km2 area covered by our mining permit No. 3500000620055. We believe that the risks of not receiving the environmental, health and safety approvals in connection with our coal mining operations outside of the area of your mining permits are now minimal because we have obtained the mining permit for an area of 6.8 km2 that is adjacent to (and with a small overlapping area with) the 5.7 km2 area covered by our existing mining permit, which also allows it to mine at different mining levels, and we intend to limit our mining operations the areas covered by our mining permits only in the future. The file shows the inspection and acceptance for the 5.7 km2 area covered by mining permit No. 3500000620055 were made in four disciplines: i) safety, ii) mining, iii) ventilation, including methane monitoring system and firefighting system, and iv) mechanics and electrical. Because the approval document issued by Longyan Coal Administrator Bureau “Longmeianjian 2008 (34)” indicated inspection and acceptance of “methane monitoring system and firefighting system”, we believe the likelihood of our company being fined for lack of firefighting design approval is relatively small. We also believe that the inspection and acceptance in the approval document covers firefighting design approval and we currently have no intention of applying for firefighting design approval. The inspection and acceptance for the 6.8 km2 area covered by mining permit C3500002011051120112047 in the following four disciplines: i) safety, ii) mining, iii) ventilation, including methane monitoring system and firefighting system, and iv) mechanics and electrical, is underway right now and we anticipate that we will receive final acceptance in all four disciplines by June of 2012. We believe that because the inspection and acceptance in the four disciplines described above cover firefighting design approval, we will not need to apply separately for firefighting design approval. Accordingly, we currently have no intention of applying for firefighting design approval for the 6.8 km2 area covered by mining permit C3500002011051120112047.
According to the technical report of Wardrop Engineering Inc., in order to expand capacity of the Shangzhai coal mine, the following environmental, health, and safety permitting requirements are applicable for mine expansion:
·
Environmental Impact Assessment Report and subsequent approval from the appropriate Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPB);
·
Environmental Completion Acceptance Inspection Investigation and the subsequent approval from the appropriate EPB;
·
ODHA Report and subsequent approval from the appropriate Health Bureau;
·
ODHCEA Report and subsequent approval from the appropriate Health Bureau;
·
Safety Pre-assessment Report and subsequent approval from the appropriate Safe Production Supervision and Management Bureau;
·
Safety Completion Acceptance Assessment Report and subsequent approval from the appropriate Safe Production Supervision and Management Bureau;
·
Firefighting Design Approval and Firefighting Completion Inspection and approval from the appropriate firefighting authority.
·
ERM recommended that we comply with these permitting requirements for any future expansion of the Shangzhai coal mine, which we plan to do so.
