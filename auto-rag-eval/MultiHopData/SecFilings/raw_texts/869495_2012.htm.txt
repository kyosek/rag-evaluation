ITEM 2.PROPERTIES
Office Leases
We lease and maintain office space in Edmonton, Alberta for corporate and administrative operations; the lease expires on December 31, 2013. We also lease and maintain office space in Calgary, Alberta; this lease expired on November 30, 2012 and will not be renewed.
Oil and Gas Properties
Acreage
Currently, Deep Well, through its subsidiaries, Northern and Deep Well Alberta, has a 90% working interest in 51 sections on seven oil sands leases, an 80% working interest in 5 sections on one oil sands lease, and a 50% working interest in an additional 12 sections on two oil sands leases in the Peace River oil sands area of Alberta all of these sections are contiguous. These nine oil sands leases cover 43,015 gross acres (17,408 gross hectares). Of the 68 contiguous sections on nine oil sands leases, Andora is the operator of 12 sections on two oil sands leases in which we have a 50% working interest, and we are the operator on 56 sections on seven leases where we have working interest of either 80% or 90%. For further information, see Oil and Gas Properties on our Balance Sheet included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Effective December 3, 2012, we entered into and subsequently closed upon a purchase and sale agreement with 113, one of our former joint venture partners, pursuant to which we acquired 113’s 10% working interest in 8 oil sands leases in the Sawn Lake heavy oil reservoir in the Peace River area of Alberta. The following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas rights under lease as of December 31, 2012.
(1) 90% working interest.
(2) 80% working interest
(3) 50% working interest.
A developed acre is considered to mean those acres spaced or assignable to productive wells; a gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned, and a net acre is the result that is obtained when the fractional ownership working interest of a lease is multiplied by gross acres of that lease. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
Undeveloped acreage is considered to be those lease acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether or not that acreage contains proven reserves, but does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of a lease. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we can generally retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases, or by paying delay rentals during the remaining primary term of such a lease. The oil sands leases in which we have an interest are for a primary term of 15 years, and if we meet the Minimum Level of Evaluation (“MLE”) as set out by the Alberta Government oil sands tenure guidelines we can continue these leases beyond their primary term for an indefinite period.
The Government of Alberta owns the land and we have acquired the rights to perform oil and gas activities on the land. If we meet the conditions of the 15-year leases we will be permitted to drill on and produce oil from the land into perpetuity. These conditions give us until the expiration of the leases to meet the following requirements on our primary oil sands leases:
a)	 drill 68 wells throughout the 68 sections; or
b)	 drill 44 wells within the 68 sections if we have acquired and processed 2 miles of seismic on all other undrilled sections.
We plan to meet the second of these conditions. As at December 31, 2012, we have an interest in ten wells, which can be counted toward these requirements.
We have also identified 2 other wells drilled on these leases, which may be included in the satisfaction of the MLE requirements. We have also acquired and processed 25 miles of seismic on the leases, which can be counted toward the MLE requirements.
Reserves, Production and Delivery Commitments
We did not engage in any sustained production activities during the years ending September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 nor did we have any proven reserves at the end of such periods. We do not have any obligations under existing delivery commitment contracts or agreements calling for the provision of fixed and determinable quantities of oil and gas over the next three years, and have therefore not filed any information or reports with any federal authority or agency containing estimates of total proven developed or undeveloped net oil or gas reserves.
Drilling Activity
We had no drilling activity during the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our last drilling activity was in the 2009 year end, during which we drilled 6 wells used to delineate our reservoir and plan for our HCSS thermal recovery project.
Present Activities
Currently we have in place joint operating agreements with one joint interest partner to manage our joint oil sands leases, which are all based on the 1990 Canadian Association of Petroleum Landmen (“CAPL”) Operating Procedure. Under these agreements our joint oil sands leases were evaluated seismically, geologically and by drilling to establish the continuity and the distribution of the crude bituminous-bearing Bluesky reservoir zone across our joint lands.
Effective December 3, 2012, we entered into and subsequently closed upon a purchase and sale agreement with 113, one of our former joint venture partners, pursuant to which we acquired 113’s 10% working interest in the Sawn Lake heavy oil reservoir in the Peace River area of Alberta. This acquisition increased our net acreage from 12,698 net hectares to 14,310 net hectares, an increase of 12.7%.
During the year ended September 30, 2012, we evaluated the options for production available to us to determine the preferable course of action for our Sawn Lake project. Being able to drill on lands now owned 90% by us has opened new avenues for testing and further development of our Sawn Lake project. We have worked with three independent reservoir engineering and modeling companies to prepare analyses of the Sawn Lake Bluesky reservoir resulting in the reservoir modeling simulation studies to determine the optimum strategy for us to develop our reservoir. Following these reservoir models and the recommendation of our independent reservoir engineers, we intend to develop a thermal recovery project on our properties, followed by a commercial expansion project. To further this goal our environmental consultants have completed an environmental assessment, as mandated by Alberta environmental regulations, in and around our proposed thermal recovery project located on our now 90% owned lands. We have also engaged drilling, completion and facilities engineers who have begun the planning and pre-drilling work for our HCSS pad site facility and horizontal well paths on the North half of section 10-92-13W5M. The development progress of our properties is governed by several factors such as federal and provincial governmental regulations. Long lead times in getting regulatory approval for thermal recovery projects are commonplace in our industry. Road bans, winter access only roads and environmental regulations can and often do delay development of similar projects. Because of these and other factors, our oil sands project can take significantly longer to complete than regular conventional drilling programs for lighter oil. Todate; our geological, engineering and economic studies lead us to believe that our working interest can support full profitable commercial production.
On February 3, 2012, we submitted an application to the ERCB to modify our previously approved in-situ pilot project for a well to test thermal production on our Sawn Lake oil sands leases. This modification seeks to change the vertical CSS well earlier approved, into a thermal recovery project to test 2 wells that use a horizontal application of CSS.
On April 16, 2012, we received a reserves report as of December 31, 2011 from DeGolyer & MacNaughton Canada Limited (“DeGolyer”), an independent third party reservoir engineering firm. This report estimated the heavy oil reserves from the working interests held by our subsidiaries in the Peace River Oil Sands area of Alberta. DeGolyer estimated and assigned probable and possible reserves on the north half square mile of land located on section 10-92-13W5 designated for our horizontal CSS recovery project. This half square mile of land covers 316 gross acres (128 gross hectares) of land. DeGolyer has estimated that in that portion alone there are probable reserves of 7,806,000 barrels of heavy oil and probable plus possible reserves of 9,370,000 barrels attributable to our working interests before adjusting for any Provincial or potential royalties. These estimated probable plus possible reserves are classified as undeveloped at this time. Proved reserves cannot be assigned until production begins.
Proved Reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and governmental regulations.
Probable Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
Possible Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil discovered.
Our proposed thermal recovery project will be located on the north half of section 10-92-13W5, which has good road access on hard packed roads recently built by Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (“Penn West”). The proposed thermal recovery project location is approximately 1.4 kilometers away from the nearest Penn West road. We intend to upgrade our existing winter road to section 10-92-13W5 to an all-weather road. We also intend to acquire the remaining road and build it as an all-weather road up to the proposed thermal recovery project site.
Past Activities
On April 26, 2004, Northern (now a 100% owned subsidiary of Deep Well) signed a Joint Operating Agreement with Pan Orient to provide for the manner of conducting operations on three Peace River oil sands leases for a total of 32 sections covering 20,243 gross acres (8,192 gross hectares). The 32 sections were acquired jointly on April 23, 2004, with Northern having an 80% working interest and Pan Orient having a 20% working interest in the joint lands.
On August 18, 2004, Deep Well and Pan Orient jointly participated in a public offering of Crown Oil Sands Rights held by the Alberta Department of Energy, in which the joint parties successfully bid on three Peace River oil sands leases for a total of 31 sections covering 19,610 gross acres (7,936 gross hectares). Deep Well acquired an undivided 80% working interest and Pan Orient acquired an undivided 20% working interest in the joint property.
On December 9, 2004, Deep Well signed Joint Operating Agreements with 113 under which 113 acknowledged the terms under which their 10% working interest acquired from Pan Orient in the joint lands acquired on August 18, 2004, would be governed.
On February 25, 2005, as previously disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K, Deep Well and Northern entered into a Farmout Agreement with Surge. This Farmout Agreement allowed Surge (previously known as Signet and now known as Andora) to earn up to a 40% working interest in the farmout lands (50% of our share). And on November 26, 2007, pursuant to the Minutes of Settlement between us, Andora and Signet, Signet acquired 40% of our working interest in 12 sections on two oil sands leases. As part of the 40% working interest transfer to Signet, two of the original oil sands leases previously acquired on April 26, 2004, were split into four oil sands leases.
On March 3, 2005, Deep Well, Northern and Surge mutually agreed by an amending agreement to extend the payment date of the prospect fee under Article 13 of the Farmout Agreement dated February 25, 2005, whereby Surge was granted an extension for payment of the prospect fee to the closing date of March 18, 2005.
On March 10, 2005, Deep Well, Northern and Surge mutually agreed by an amending agreement that Surge US is only a party to the Farmout Agreement for the purposes of Article 14 of the Farmout Agreement dated February 25, 2005. In addition, all three parties mutually agreed by an amending agreement to establish a procedure whereby Signet is to be appointed as the operator under the existing Joint Operating Agreements in respect of all Farmout Lands in which Signet earns an interest pursuant to Article 7 of the Farmout Agreement dated February 25, 2005.
On July 14, 2005, our Company and Surge mutually agreed to amend the Farmout Agreement dated February 25, 2005 in order to extend the date to spud the first well until September 25, 2005.
On September 21, 2005, Signet was granted a permit by the ERCB for a test well, and on September 28, 2005, Signet began drilling our first well 1-36-091-13W5 (hereinafter referred to as “1-36”) on our Sawn Lake project located in the Peace River oil sands of Alberta, Canada. Signet did not spud the first well by the 25th of September 2005 and we noted them in default of the Farmout Agreement.
On November 15, 2005, as part of a settlement agreement, we agreed to amend the Farmout Agreement signed on February 25, 2005 between our Company and Surge that had previously been terminated by Deep Well (as previously disclosed on Form 8-K on September 29, 2005). The amendments to the agreement provided that: 1.) all current conditions of the Farmout Agreement will be deemed to have been satisfied as at September 25, 2005; 2.) the earning period (the period during which Signet has to drill 10 wells) under the agreement will be extended until February 25, 2008; 3.) Signet will have until September 25, 2006 to drill an option well (the second well); 4.) an additional 6.5 sections of land will be added to the land subject to the agreement; 5.) Signet will pay Deep Well $1,000,000 on November 15, 2005 in satisfaction of the prospect fee outstanding instead of after drilling the second well as stated in the Farmout Agreement; and 6.) no shares of Surge US would be issued to Deep Well or Northern, but rather we would receive 7,550,000 common shares of Signet (now known as Andora), a private subsidiary company of Surge US.
On July 17, 2006, Signet had received the required licenses by the Government of Alberta to drill the next three horizontal wells in the Bluesky Formation of our Sawn Lake oil sands project. The next 3 wells drilled were within less than one mile (1.6 km) of the first test well that was already drilled. These surface locations were 4-32-091-12W5 (hereinafter referred to as “4-32”), 7-30-091-12W5 (hereinafter referred to as “7-30”) and 13-29-091-12W5 (hereinafter referred to as “13-29”). Seismic and reservoir mapping were undertaken to be used to support and progress work on near and long-term plans of development for our Sawn Lake oil sands project.
In October 2006, the 4-32 and 7-30 wells along with the 1-36 well were suspended. Signet (now known as Andora) had undertaken a mapping of the reservoir to assist in its delineation for any future development of our Sawn Lake property. The first three wells were drilled in the most heavily documented portion of the Sawn Lake lands. Although, as determined by Signet, the preliminary results from the last two wells indicated a lack of cold flow production from wells 4-32 and 7-30, the compartmentalized nature of the reservoir and varying characteristics of these compartments may show different results with further evaluation. Our Company felt that the level of testing on these wells to determine their complete potential was incomplete.
In late 2006, our joint venture partner acquired over 200 km of reprocessed seismic and aeromagnetic studies on our joint properties.
On November 26, 2007, we entered into mediation with Signet (now known as Andora) and resolved our differences and certain collateral matters. The settlement included but is not limited to:
·the Farmout Agreement dated February 25, 2005, being effectively terminated concurrently with the execution of the settlement agreement; and
·Signet being regarded as having earned the two sections on which the option wells were drilled and 4 additional sections as set out in the Settlement; and
·Signet being required to reconvey registered title to 57.5 unearned sections of the Farmout Lands, as defined in the Farmout Agreement, back to us; and
·our Company having the right to retest, at no cost to Signet, the option wells previously drilled.
·Andora has acknowledged that Deep Well is not responsible for any potential royalty assumed by Deep Well on behalf of Signet in the Farmout Agreement.
On March 18, 2008, the 6.5 section oil sands permit, which was originally scheduled to expire on April 9, 2008, was extended for one year pursuant to an application submitted by Northern to the Alberta Department of Energy.
On September 10, 2008, the ERCB granted us well licenses to drill 6 wells on our Sawn Lake oil sands properties.
On December 1, 2008, in conjunction with our 2008/2009 winter drilling program, we acquired two vertical wells they previously drilled along with existing road infrastructure. Of the two wells we acquired, one was drilled to a vertical depth of 737 meters on our existing oil sands lease and was cased for Bluesky heavy oil production. The casing of this well was perforated at intervals from 681.5m to 684.5m and 684.5m to 685.0m. This well’s status is drilled and cased for future bitumen production. The existing roads we acquired totalled 12km of access on our Sawn Lake properties.
On December 4, 2008, we successfully spudded the first well of six wells to be drilled in our 2008/2009 Sawn Lake winter drilling program in the Peace River oil sands area of Alberta. By early February of 2009, we successfully drilled all planned six wells of our Sawn Lake oil sands project. All of our exploratory wells were logged, cored and analyzed by independent service providers and are currently being evaluated for in-situ recovery methods.
On February 1, 2009, we acquired additional existing access roads on our Sawn Lake properties from Penn West Petroleum Ltd., adding 8.7 km of roads to our Sawn Lake infrastructure.
During our winter drilling season of 2008/2009 we successfully completed a drilling program and met our objectives by drilling six vertical wells, three of which were drilled on our oil sands permit in order to provide technical data to support the required Alberta Department of Energy regulation to convert our 5-year oil sands permit into a 15-year primary lease. The other three wells were drilled further to the North of any of our existing wells confirming the continuation of the main reservoir trend to the northwest. These wells were drilled to a depth of approximately 700 meters each. Along with the acquisition of road infrastructure on our properties, we acquired a well on our oil sands lease that was previously drilled and cased, for heavy oil production in the Bluesky reservoir zone, by an unrelated third party. In addition, we currently have working interests in three horizontal wells, which were previously drilled by our former farmout partner and are pending further evaluation and the development of an exploitation plan with our joint interest partner. All of our exploratory wells were logged, cored and analyzed by independent expert service providers.
On April 30, 2009, the Alberta Department of Energy approved our application to convert 5 sections of our oil sands permit to a 15-year primary lease. By drilling on these lands where the permits were set to expire, we have preserved title to 5 sections and now have a primary lease, which is valid for an additional 15 years.
In September 2009, we submitted an application to the ERCB for a commercial bitumen recovery scheme to evaluate the 12-14-092-13W5 well for potential development using CSS and later we added the 6-22-092-13W5 well to the application, and in late 2010 this application was approved by the ERCB to test one of the wells using steam injection.
In July 2010, Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. performed an independent technical evaluation of the heavy oil properties on some of our Sawn Lake properties. The report confirmed the suitability of the properties for employing thermal recovery methods on them. In addition, Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. identified a new hydrocarbon bearing zone up-hole from the Bluesky zone presently being concentrated on by our Company. This secondary heavy oil zone is in the Peace River formation. It is a clastic unit of lower cretaceous age found at a shallower depth than the Bluesky zone. It is approximately 35 meters thick and is a massive, very fine to medium grain sandstone conformably deposited on the Harmon Shale. We intend to continue the development of the Bluesky reservoir and at the same time we intend to evaluate this newly discovered reservoir by coring future wells within this zone.
In December 2010 and January 2011, two separate independent reservoir engineering firms prepared National Instrument 51-101 (a Canadian evaluation engineering standard) compliant resource appraisal reports for one of our joint venture partners. These reports evaluated the resource of some of our Sawn Lake joint properties and included an economic evaluation of the oil sands leases in the Sawn Lake area based on using thermal recovery to exploit the resource.
