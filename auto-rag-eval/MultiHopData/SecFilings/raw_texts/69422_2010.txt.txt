SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL PROPERTY
The Hotel is owned directly by the Partnership. The Hotel is centrally located near the Financial District in San Francisco, one block from the Transamerica Pyramid. The Embarcadero Center is within walking distance and North Beach is two blocks away. Chinatown is directly across the bridge that runs from the Hotel to Portsmouth Square Park. The Hotel is a 31-story (including parking garage), steel and concrete, A-frame building, built in 1970. The Hotel has 544 well appointed guest rooms and luxury suites situated on 22 floors as well as a 5,400 square foot Tru Spa health and beauty spa on the lobby level.

Since the Hotel just completed renovations, there is no present program for any further major renovations; however, the Partnership expects to reserve approximately 4% of gross annual Hotel revenues each year for future capital requirements. In the opinion of management, the Hotel is adequately covered by insurance.
HOTEL FINANCINGS
On July 27, 2005, Justice entered into a first mortgage loan with The Prudential Insurance Company of America in a principal amount of $30,000,000 (the "Prudential Loan"). The term of the Prudential Loan is for 120 months at a fixed interest rate of 5.22% per annum. The Prudential Loan calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately $165,000, calculated on a 30-year amortization schedule. The Loan is collateralized by a first deed of trust on the Partnership's Hotel property, including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents. The Prudential Loan is without recourse to the limited and general partners of Justice. The principal balance of the Prudential Loan was $27,723,000 as of June 30, 2010.
On March 27, 2007, Justice entered into a second mortgage loan with Prudential (the "Second Prudential Loan") in a principal amount of $19,000,000. The term of the Second Prudential Loan is for approximately 100 months and matures on August 5, 2015, the same date as the first Prudential Loan. The Second Prudential Loan is at a fixed interest rate of 6.42% per annum and calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately $119,000, calculated on a 30-year amortization schedule. The Second Prudential Loan is collateralized by a second deed of trust on the Partnership's Hotel property, including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents. The Second Prudential Loan is also without recourse to the limited and general partners of Justice. The principal balance of the Second Prudential Loan was $18,267,000 as of June 30, 2010.
The Partnership had a $2,500,000 unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a bank that was to mature on April 30, 2010. Borrowings under that line of credit bore interest at Prime plus 3.0% per annum or based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (3.25%) plus 3.0% per annum, floating, (but subject to a minimum floor rate at 5.0% per annum). Borrowings under the line of credit were subject to certain financial covenants, which are measured annually at June 30th and December 31st based on the credit arrangement. Effective April 29, 2010, the Partnership obtained a modification from the bank which converted its revolving line of credit facility to a term loan. The Partnership also obtained a waiver of any prior noncompliance with financial covenants.
The modification provides that Justice will pay the $2,500,000 balance on its line of credit facility over a period of four years, to mature on April 30, 2014. This term loan calls for monthly principal and interest payments of $41,000, calculated on a six-year amortization schedule, with interest only from May 1, 2010 to August 31, 2010. Pursuant to the modification, the annual floating interest rate was reduced by 0.5% to the WSJ Prime Rate plus 2.5% (with a minimum floor rate of 5.0% per annum). The modification includes financial covenants written to reflect financial conditions that all hotels are facing. The covenants include specific financial ratios and a return to minimum profitability by June 2011. Management believes that the Partnership has the ability to meet the specific covenants and the Partnership was in compliance with the covenants as of June 30, 2010. The Partnership paid a loan modification fee of $10,000. The loan continues as unsecured. As of June 30, 2010, the interest rate was 5.75% and the outstanding balance was $2,500,000. As of June 30, 2009, the interest rate was 6.25% and the outstanding balance on the line of credit was $1,811,000.
