ITEM 2.
Properties
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2010, the company owned and managed 1,128 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 141.9 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, the company had 697 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 79.8 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 49 global markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. The company’s industrial properties were 93.7% leased to 2,655 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.1% of the company’s annualized base rent from its industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information related to the company’s operations.
Property Characteristics. The company’s industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings.
The following table identifies types and characteristics of the company’s industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on square footage, of the company’s total owned and managed operating portfolio:
Lease Terms. The company’s industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of the company’s leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of the company’s industrial leases do not include renewal options.
Overview of Our Global Market Presence. The company’s industrial properties are located in the following markets:
Within these metropolitan areas, the company’s industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These infill locations are typically near major airports or seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. The company generally avoids locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.
Portfolio Overview
The following includes the company’s owned and managed operating portfolio and development properties, investments in operating properties through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, and recently completed developments that have not yet been placed in operations but are being held for sale or contribution:
(1)
Annualized base rent (“ABR”) is calculated as monthly base rent (cash basis) per the terms of the lease, as of December 31, 2010, multiplied by 12.
(2)
See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a reconciliation to net income and a discussion of why management believes same store cash basis NOI is a useful supplemental measure for the company’s management and investors, ways to use this measure when assessing the company’s financial performance, and the limitations of the measure as a measurement tool.
(3)
Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenant’s term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current
lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation.
(4)
Includes domestic on-tarmac air cargo facilities at 14 airports.
(5)
Annualized base rent for leases denominated in foreign currencies is translated using the currency exchange rate at December 31, 2010
(6)
Owned and managed is defined by the company as assets in which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is the property or asset manager, and which the company currently intends to hold for the long term.
(7)
Includes investments in operating properties through the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that it does not manage, and are therefore excluded from the company’s owned and managed portfolio, and the location of the company’s global headquarters.
(8)
Represents development projects available for sale or contribution that are not included in the operating portfolio.
(9)
Represents unstabilized properties which the company acquires as a part of management’s current belief that the discount in pricing attributed to the operating challenges of the property could provide greater returns, once stabilized, than the returns of stabilized properties, which are not value-added acquisitions. Value added acquisitions generally have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) existing vacancy, typically in excess of 20%, (ii) short-term lease rollover, typically during the first two years of ownership, or (iii) significant capital improvement requirements, typically in excess of 20% of the purchase price. The company excludes value-added acquisitions from its owned and managed and consolidated operating statistics prior to stabilization (generally 90% leased) in order to provide investors with data which it feels better reflects the performance of its core portfolio.
Lease Expirations(1)

PROPERTIES HELD THROUGH CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, LIMITED LIABILITY
COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS
The company holds interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control. Control is determined using accounting standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest entities. For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable interest entities, management first considers whether the company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are not structured as partnerships). The company consolidates joint ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore, consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where the company is the general partner (or the equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances where these factors indicate the company controls the joint venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise it uses the equity method of accounting.
The following table summarizes the company’s nine consolidated and unconsolidated significant co-investment ventures as of December 31, 2010:
(1)
Effective January 1, 2010, the name of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. was changed to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. Effective October 29, 2010, the name of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS was changed to AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS.

Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests by the company or the other party to the co-investment venture and typically provide certain rights to the company or the other party to the co-investment venture to sell the company’s or their interest in the co-investment venture to the co-investment venture or to the other co-investment venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures include buy/sell provisions.
