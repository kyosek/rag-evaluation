Item 2. Properties
The Partnership has acquired a Limited Partnership Interest in each of the
three hundred nine Operating Partnerships in six series identified in the table set forth below. In each instance the Apartment Complex owned by each
of the Operating Partnerships is eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit. Occupancy of a unit in each Apartment Complex which initially complied with
the Minimum Set-Aside Test (i.e., occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to
no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the Rent
Restriction Test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the
applicable income standards) is referred to hereinafter as "Qualified
Occupancy." Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective
Apartment Complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable
Report on Form 8-K filed during the past fiscal year. The General Partner
believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
Please refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of
operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.
