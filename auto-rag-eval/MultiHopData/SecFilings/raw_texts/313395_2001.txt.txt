Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. No reserve estimates have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign government authority or agency, other than the Securities and Exchange Commission, since the Company's latest Form 10-K filing.
PRODUCTION
The following table summarizes the Company's net oil and gas production, average sales prices, and average production costs per unit of production for the periods indicated. With respect to newly drilled wells, there can be no assurance that current production levels can be sustained. Depending upon reservoir characteristics, such levels of production could decline significantly.
(1) Oil and gas were combined by converting oil to gas Mcf equivalent on the basis of 1 barrel of oil = 6 Mcf of gas. Production costs include direct lease operations and production taxes.
PRODUCING PROPERTIES - WELLS AND ACREAGE
The following table sets forth the Company's producing wells and developed acreage assignable to such wells for the last three fiscal years:
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells and wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities.
A "gross well" or "gross acre" is a well or acre in which a working interest is held. The number of gross wells or gross acres is the total number of wells or acres in which working interests are owned. A "net well" or "net acre" is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership interest in gross wells or gross acres equals one. The number of net wells or net acres is the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE
As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned, by lease or in fee, the following undeveloped acres, all of which are located in the Continental United States, as follows: ESTIMATED FY2002 UNITED STATES GROSS ACRES NET ACRES DELAY RENTALS ------------- ----------- --------- ------------- Texas 372,000 329,000 $ 541,266 North Dakota 89,336 86,363 170,398 South Dakota 14,475 11,850 4,114 Montana 960 960 3,840 ---------- --------- -------------

Five large Texas leases totaling approximately 66,000 gross acres contain varying requirements to drill a well every 90 to 150 days to keep the respective lease in effect. The Company is presently drilling under the terms of the leases and expects to keep the leases in force by continuous development during the year.
DRILLING ACTIVITY
During calendar 2001, the Company's drilling activity increased to 73 wells drilled or re-entered compared to 27 in calendar 2000. In addition, current year activity included ongoing drilling operations on 16 wells that were in progress at the end of calendar year 2000. The following table sets forth the Company's drilling activity for the last three fiscal years:
The Exploration Company participated in the drilling of 25 wells (22.17 net) during 2001. Of these, 22 wells (19.67 net) were operated by the Company. At December 2001, 9 (9.0 net) of these wells remained in progress.
Included in the respective year 2001 columns are the results of the current year's drilling activity involving the 16 wells spud in the prior fiscal year and in progress at the beginning of 2001. These wells resulted in 9 producing (8.17 net) gas wells and 3 producing (2.02 net) oil wells. In addition, 2 wells resulted in 1 dry (0.88 net) gas well and 1 dry (1.0 net) oil well while 2 wells (1.63 net) remained in progress at December, 2001.
Included in the respective year 2000 columns were 2 producing (1.63 net) gas wells and 1 (0.25 net) dry well drilled during the four month transition period ended December 31, 1999, plus 1 producing (0.5 net) gas well spud in the prior fiscal year. In addition to the wells detailed in the table above, the Company had an interest in 14 wells (11.81 net) in progress at December 31, 2000 from year 2000 drilling and 1 well (0.88 net) from the prior fiscal year.
During the year 2001 the Company re-entered 48 (48.0 net) existing wells, of which 40 (40 net) wells are currently producing, while 1 well (1.0 net) remained in progress at December 31, 2001. During the year 2000 the Company re-entered 2 (1.84 net) existing wells, of which one well is currently producing, while the other well was in progress at December 31, 2000 and was dry in 2001.
The Company began year 2001 with 16 wells (13.70 net) in progress from year 2000. During year 2001, the Company initiated 73 (70.17 net) new drilling / re-entry wells. These wells resulted in 54 gas (51.53 net) wells, 9 oil (7.70 net) wells, 14 dry (13.00 net) wells and 12 wells (11.64 net) were in progress at December 31, 2001.
MAVERICK BASIN
Throughout the 1990's, the Company pursued a strategy to expand its core Maverick Basin producing properties. In addition to using internally generated working capital for exploration and development activities, TXCO accelerated its growth, where possible, by entering into strategic joint ventures or operating agreements targeted at leveraging the Company's increased leasehold values, recognized technical abilities and exploration success in its core area of interest. TXCO entered into several new joint venture or joint operating agreements during 2001 and 2000 while advancing on ventures entered into in past years, whereby the Company successfully teamed with qualified industry partners who contributed investment capital, mineral leases, 3-D seismic data and/or offered the Company a carried interest in mineral leases, 3-D seismic acquisition programs and wells to be drilled. These contributions were made in exchange for TXCO's geophysical, geological and operational expertise, and in certain instances, in exchange for an interest in a portion of the Company's non-producing oil and gas lease interests.
During September 1998, the Company entered into two separate joint operating agreements (JOA), one with Ashtola Exploration Company, Inc. and the second with Picosa Creek Partnership. In the first, TXCO earned a 63% working interest in Ashtola's 8,800 acres Alkek lease adjoining TXCO's Paloma lease, together with rights to an existing 3-D seismic survey over the subject block. The acreage was contributed to a JOA dated May 1999 with Castle Exploration Company and is being developed in conjunction with the JOA discussed below. Two wells were drilled under the Picosa Creek JOA during 2000. Both were placed on production by year-end 2000, one as a gas well, and the other as an oil producer.
In November 1998, the Company finalized a JOA with Ameritex Ventures, II Ltd., allowing Ameritex and its partners to earn a 50% interest in the shallow and intermediate depths in TXCO's existing 17,000 acre Kincaid lease by their funding 100% of a 27 square mile 3-D seismic program over 17,000 acre in 1999. During 2000, three gas prospects were drilled under the agreement resulting in one marginal oil completion and two non-economic wells which were plugged and abandoned.
In May 1999, the Company finalized a JOA with Castle Exploration Company, a subsidiary of Castle Energy Corporation, (NasdaqNM: CECX) whereby Castle committed up to $5,300,000 to fund 100% of the costs of purchasing leases, acquire 3-D seismic and drill up to 12 Glen Rose reef wells on targeted acreage contiguous to TXCO's productive Paloma lease. TXCO was named as operator, and contributed its 8,800 acre Alkek lease in exchange for shared rights to all 3-D seismic acquired, a 25% carried interest in the initial 12 wells, a 50% interest in future lease acquisitions and up to a 50% interest in all wells to be drilled on the leases. Pursuant to the agreement, Castle funded 100% of TXCO's costs to lease 31,700 acres and complete a 3-D seismic acquisition program by November 1999.
During 2000, the partners drilled two wells under the agreement. Neither well encountered economic quantities of gas and both were plugged and abandoned. Accordingly, Castle exercised its option under the agreement not to carry the Company on subsequent wells. Under the current phase of the agreement, TXCO retains its 50% interest in all acreage and 3-D seismic acquired and can participate with a 50% interest in all future wells to be drilled on the leases. Pursuant to the JOA and Castle's elections, Castle has a 50 % interest remaining only in the undeveloped portion of the Burr lease,
In August 1999, the Company purchased from Peacock-Maverick Drilling and Peacock Exploration their interests in producing wells and oil and gas leases covering in aggregate 24,500 acres in exchange for 325,000 shares of TXCO common stock valued at $493,594. The purchase included a 12.5 % working interest in a 12,800 acres tract out of the 190,000+ acres Chittim Ranch, including 6 producing gas wells located thereon. The acreage is contiguous to the eastern flank of TXCO's Paloma lease. In addition, the Company received a 100% working interest in the Wipff/Shaw lease, totaling 11,700 acres located within 5 miles to the west of TXCO's Paloma lease.
In September 1999, the Company finalized an agreement with Blue Star for an exploration project targeting the deep Jurassic interval underlying TXCO's Maverick Basin lease block. Blue Star paid TXCO a cash consideration upon closing and agreed to fund 100% of a 426 square mile 3-D seismic acquisition program including over 37,000 acres of TXCO's Paloma and Kincaid leases. Blue Star was also obligated to provide the Company approximately 50,000 acres of new 3-D seismic survey data, of TXCO's selection from the completed 426 square mile survey. In addition, Blue Star agreed to fund 100% of the costs of drilling 2 exploratory wells to test the deep Jurassic interval. Should both wells be drilled timely, Blue Star would earn a 50% interest in the deep rights in TXCO's Paloma and Kincaid leases covering in aggregate 50,000 acres. TXCO and its partners would keep a 50% working interest in future Jurassic wells drilled under the agreement. According to the original agreement, should initial drilling not occur within certain deadlines, Blue Star could be obligated to reimburse TXCO up to $900,000 for certain expenditures in order for Blue Star to maintain its rights under the agreement. By year end 2000, Blue Star had completed the acquisition of 3-D seismic data over 426 square miles of the Maverick Basin, including TXCO's related 37,000 acres. Preliminary results of the initial processing and interpretation of the Blue Star seismic data were extremely encouraging to the partners, and appear to corroborate the geologic model defined in the original 3-D seismic study completed by TXCO in 1999. That model supports the premise that structures that should contain significant deposits of hydrocarbons are present in the Jurassic interval under its acreage block. Based on these encouraging results, Blue Star indicated it anticipated beginning preparations to drill the first Jurassic test well on TXCO's Maverick Basin acreage in early part of 2001.
On March 13, 2001 Blue Star's Management advised TXCO of their decision to apply enhanced 3-D seismic processing techniques on their seismic survey data. Blue Star estimated the expanded seismic processing could cost an additional $1 million, would take months to finalize in order to better define their geologic model of the interval and would likely preclude any drilling prior to the end of 2001. Blue Star hoped to enhance its process of selecting the initial drilling locations to test the 18,000+ feet deep structure underlying the targeted acreage block. TXCO believed that the results of the expanded processing will reduce the initial drilling risk for the benefit of all its partners, enhancing the overall success of the venture while potentially reducing exploration costs in the long term.
While the advent of new, more advanced technology may reduce the overall drilling risks involved in this highly technical drilling project, undue delays in drilling the first well could cause the expiration of Blue Star's original option to drill on TXCO's acreage. Throughout 2001, TXCO closely monitored Blue Star's progress pursuant to their performance obligation under the agreement to assure the project was not being unreasonably delayed or detrimental to the ultimate development of the project. During the first quarter of 2002, Blue Star's team of geoscientists met with TXCO's exploration team on several occasions to include the Company's assistance in interpreting the final results of the long awaited newly enhanced 3-D seismic processing. Blue Star also requested TXCO's expertise in the identification and final ranking of multiple proposed Jurassic drilling locations on TXCO's effected acreage. In March 2002, Blue Star delivered a nearly final processed digital data set containing over 83 square miles of digitized seismic data for TXCO's ongoing review. As of the date of this report, Blue Star confirms that it has received acceptable proposals from several qualified drilling contractors and has conducted final inspections and is obtaining current title opinions on all drilling locations. TXCO believes drilling on its first Jurassic prospect will commence in the very near future.
In April 2000 the Company expanded its core Maverick Basin properties as it acquired a lease covering over 95,000 acres on the Comanche Ranch contiguous to the south of Blue Star's Chittim Ranch Lease and southeast of TXCO's existing Maverick Basin acreage block. The lease was granted by the Ewing Halsell Foundation giving the Company a 100% leasehold interest to all depths not reserved under any existing leases or held by production by other operators. There were no drilling obligations for six years and initial geologic interpretation of available seismic data indicated that multi-zone production potential existed, including evidence of approximately 40 Glen Rose reefs and indications of a deep Jurassic structure below 16,000 feet. Other progressively deepening targets and intervals include CBM gas from the coalbeds in the shallow Olmos formation, oil from the San Miguel and Austin Chalk formations above 4,000 feet, and primarily natural gas from the mid-depth Georgetown, Glen Rose, Pearsall, and Sligo formations above 8,000 feet.
By the third quarter of 2001, the Company had also acquired over 100 previously existing shut-in well bores from earlier operators on its new Comanche Ranch Lease. To date, most of the well bores have been inspected and identified as re-entry locations prospective for CBM production. Ongoing evaluation of geologic and available historic well data indicated that approximately (93) of the well bores appeared prospective for recompletion as CBM gas wells or San Miguel oil wells, while the remaining well bores may be suitable for future conversion to disposal or injection wells. The Company believes CBM production will eventually make up a significant portion of the future gas production from this acreage
During the first quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a joint venture with Houston based Saxet and Denver based Tom Brown, Inc. (NasdaqNM: TMBR). The Company sold a 50% working interest (Saxet 20% and Tom Brown 30%) in the Comanche lease below the base of the San Miguel formation for cash, with Saxet as the operator. By year-end 2001, the new partners had contracted Dawson Geophysical (NasdaqNM: DWSN) and completed the acquisition of a proprietary, 100-square-mile 3-D survey including over 78 square miles of the Comanche Ranch and 22 square miles of an adjoining property owned by Saxet. Based on early interpretation of the first half of the seismic survey, a well targeting the Glen Rose formation was spudded in June 2001. The Cinco B-1 gas prospect encountered a reef that was found to contain water and was not economic. Further drilling on the Comanche prospect in 2001 was curtailed pending the completion of processing of the entire 3-D seismic survey. An additional 30 seismically defined Glen Rose reefs were identified and a second well was planned after year end, targeting a particularly attractive prospect on TXCO's Comanche lease which contained evidence of multiple stacked Glen Rose reefs.
The Comanche 1-111 was spudded in February 2002, The well encountered significant flows of oil while drilling, producing over 5,000 barrels in a 24 hour period. It was subsequently completed and tested rates as high as 3600 BOPD and has been continually flowed at a rate of 500 BOPD over a week later. TXCO (50%WI) and its partner Saxet (50%) have established the oil discovery is in a large reef complex approximately 850 acres in size with 55 feet of net pay. Drilling on the Comanche 1-2, the first delineation well, commenced on March 27, 2002 and located approximately 4,500 feet northeast of the Comanche 1-111 oil discovery well. Pending further evaluation of the Comanche 1-111 discovery well and results of the currently drilling delineation well, the Company anticipates modifying its original 2002 drilling program to incorporate the expected development of this newly discovered field.
In January 2001, the Company exercised its option to purchase a five-year oil and gas mineral lease for the shallow rights above the base of the San Miguel Formation on 150,000 acres of the Chittim Ranch acreage in Maverick County, Texas. Highly prospective for CBM gas production, the acreage is contiguous to and between the Company's Paloma/Kincaid lease block to the northwest and its Comanche Ranch lease to the south. With some exceptions, the Company controlled drilling rights from the surface to the base of the San Miguel Formation ranging from 300 to 2000 feet in depth. TXCO's average working interest on the Chittim lease is 99.3%. This purchase increased the Company's leasehold position in the Maverick Basin to over 365,000 acres, and established the largest single leasehold position in Maverick County. Within these holdings, the Company now owns more than 250,000 acres of prospective CBM acreage covering portions of three South Texas counties, including Maverick, Dimmit and Zavala Counties, constituting what it believes to be the largest block of CBM gas prospective acreage in the state of Texas.
At December 31, 2001, the Company's 3-D seismic database grew to approximately 310 square miles from 231 square miles in 2000. During 2001 the Company received new high definition seismic data totaling approximately 84 square miles over a large portion of Blue Star's Chittim Ranch lease, contiguous to TXCO's Paloma/Kincaid lease block. Additionally, Blue Star also provided TXCO with approximately 80 square miles of newly processed, higher definition, seismic data covering most of the surface of the Company's Paloma and Kincaid leases. Company geophysicists have updated their seismic model incorporating the new seismic data providing TXCO with a much-enhanced overall image of the Jurassic interval extending far beyond the area of its previously available data.
WILLISTON BASIN
TXCO was not active in the Williston Basin in 2001. While oil prices have stabilized during the year, industry interest has not returned to the level it reached prior to the price collapse of late 1997. No new drilling had been pursued since exploration activities were suspended in 1998. The Company did elect to participate in one outside operated drilling well proposed on a spacing unit in which TXCO owned a minor interest which it contributed to the unit. This was the only opportunity to contribute acreage to a drilling prospect identified during the year. In 2000, TXCO contributed 10 net acres contiguous to a neighboring operator's prospect and joined in drilling the Hutzenbiler 1-19H. TXCO has a 1.60% working interest in this well which was completed as an oil well in January 2002.
Throughout 2001, the Company continued to evaluate its existing operations in the Williston Basin. Even with the higher oil prices during 2001, the Company's producing properties were still faced with high unit production costs and declining production volumes. The Company has continued to review the valuation of its properties through out the year, with particular emphasis on their continued economics. During 2001, Management identified one marginal Williston Basin producing property whose capitalized costs were in excess of anticipated future reserve potential and adjusted its remaining carrying basis to equal its anticipated potential value with a charge to impairment in the amount of $409,000. The Company also continued its selective lease maintenance program targeting primarily those leases not covered under existing 3-D seismic programs or otherwise not possessing known distinguishing features of particular geologic significance. During 2001, the Company charged a total of $808,200 to abandonment expense, related to 40,052 acres which expired during the year.
