Comstock Lode Project
Location, Access, and Title to the Property
We own or lease the following mineral exploration projects: The Comstock gold and silver exploration and test mining project, the Spring Valley and Gold Canyon placers project, the Como mineral claims, and the Big Mike copper project.
Our Comstock Lode Project is located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada. The property is physically situated roughly three (3) miles south of Virginia City, Nevada. Paved state highways from Reno, Carson City, and Virginia City provide access to the property.
The Spring Valley and Gold Canyon project (South Comstock) is located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 1.5 miles south of Silver City, Nevada. We have performed geological reconnaissance and limited sampling on this property. During 2009, six drill holes were drilled on the property.
The Como mineral Claims are located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles east of Carson City. We have performed geological reconnaissance on this property, but have not drilled or collected any samples.
The Big Mike copper project is located in Pershing County, Nevada, and has not been explored or developed by us.
Comstock Lode Project
Our property rights to the mineral estate of the Comstock Lode Project consist of several mineral leases, numerous unpatented mineral claims, and fee ownership of real property.
Obester Property Purchase (2009):
In 2009, we secured long-term control of eleven patented mining claims in Storey and Lyons Counties, Nevada, through a purchase agreement from the Obester Group. This property includes five patented claims in the Lucerne / Billie the Kid area, representing the focus of our recent drilling program. It also includes six claims in the Occidental area, which provide a target for future exploration. The purchase supersedes a mining lease with Claire Obester, dated January 1, 1997, and a mining lease with Claire Obester, Jim Obester, Alan Obester, and Julian Smith dated May 1, 2008.
The total price to be paid to the Obester Group is $1,650,000. A down-payment of $250,000 was accepted, with the balance to be paid in quarterly payments of $250,000 with an interest rate of 6%. These payments are current as of the date of this report. The transaction is expected to close through escrow on or before April 15, 2010. Once the transaction is complete, the Obester Group will receive a Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) of 1% of all future mineral production from the property, which reduces the our royalty obligation by 80%.
The purchase of this property was financed, in part, by an agreement to sell a NSR on the property to Precious Royalties, LLC. Under the agreement, Precious Royalties can earn up to a 5% NSR for a total price of $4,500,000. The agreement calls for all funding to be received by March 31, 2010. During 2009, $260,000 has been funded under the agreement, which was used to make the down payment on the property. As of December 31st, 2009, the Precious Royalties NSR was 0.29%.
Donovan Lease:
We have a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with the Donovan Silver Hills, LLC dated September 1, 1999 covering seven patented claims and 13 unpatented claims located in Storey and Lyon Counties. The lease remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor amounting to the greater of $500 per month or a royalty percentage of the Net Smelter Returns. The royalty percentage varies based on the price of gold: 3% if gold is less than $400 per ounce, 4% if gold is at least $400 per ounce but less than $500 per ounce, and 5% if gold is $500 or greater per ounce. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
Fred Garrett Lease:
We entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with the Fred Garrett et al on April 1, 2008, covering one patented claim located in Storey, Nevada. The lease remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor of $250 per month or a 3% Net Smelter Return, which ever is greater. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
James Obester Lease:
We have a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with James Obester dated August 1, 2008, covering ten unpatented claims located in Storey County. The lease remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor amounting to $200 per month for the first two years increasing to $300 a month for the next three years and then increasing to $500 per month thereafter, in addition to a royalty percentage of the Net Smelter Returns. The royalty percentage is a 2% NSR when gold is $900 or less per ounce and 3% NSR when gold is greater than $900 per ounce. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
DWC Resources Letter of Intent:
On August 13, 2008, we entered into a binding letter of intent to purchase certain property owned by DWC Resources, Inc. in Storey County, Nevada. The purchase price is $7,500,000, but is subject to adjustment pursuant to the results of a fairness opinion and/or appraisal to be obtained by us. The purchase price will be paid through issuance of a $7,500,000 convertible promissory note which shall bear interest at the rate of 9% per year with quarterly interest payments due throughout the term of the note which is 5 years. The purchased assets include patented and unpatented lode mining claims owned by DWC Resources, Inc. in the Comstock Lode district. The letter of intent also provides for the payment of royalties ranging from 2% - 6% of “net smelter returns” based upon the price of gold per ounce and a 1% royalty to be paid to the party which sold the subject property to DWC Resources in 2007. There is also a commitment by us to expend a minimum of $250,000 per year on exploration for five years. During 2009, we satisfied this annual obligation.
Sutro Tunnel Sublease:
Simultaneously with the DWC Resources Letter of intent, we entered into a binding letter of intent to sublease the Sutro Tunnel Lease dated January 1, 2008 between Sutro Tunnel Co. and John Winfield or his nominee. The purchase price for the sublease is $2,000,000 (which is subject to adjustment upon receipt of a third party fairness opinion/appraisal) payable pursuant to the issuance of a $2,000,000 convertible promissory note which shall bear interest at the rate of 9%per year with quarterly interest payments due throughout the term of the note which is 5 years. The letter of intent also provides for the payment of royalties ranging from 6% - 8% of “net smelter returns” based upon the price of gold per ounce and a 1% royalty to be paid to Mr. Winfield if Mr. Winfield provides an acceptable buyer of the Sutro property. We are also required to fulfill lessee’s obligations under the Sutro Tunnel Lease with regard to payment of royalties and exploration expenditures. During 2009, we satisfied this obligation.
Railroad & Gold Lease:
We entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with the Railroad and Gold, LLC on October 1, 2009 covering nine patented mining claims and sixteen unpatented mining claims in Storey County. The lease also includes rights for nine town lots and a rural parcel in American Flats. The lease is for an initial term of 15 years, but remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis. We made an initial payment of $25,000 for the lease. We will make annual advance minimum royalty payments, starting with $30,000 on the first anniversary, and increasing by $5,000 each year. We pay a royalty to the lessor of a 4% Net Smelter Return, which will be reduced by the sum of previously-paid advance minimum royalties. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
GoldSpring Unpatented Claims:
In addition to the mineral leases, we hold 179 unpatented mineral claims in Storey County, hold eight unpatented mineral claims in Lyon County, and own title to 40 acres of land in Storey County. The W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust has a lien against and a security interest in these unpatented mineral claims and the 40 acres of land pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated October 31, 2003, entered into with W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust. The Deed of Trust was granted to secure a promissory note, dated October 31, 2003, in the amount of $1 million for the balance of the purchase price for the property. The non-interest bearing promissory note requires ten quarterly payments of $100,000 each. In 2007, Mr. Winfield’s affiliates, Intergroup Corporation, Santa Fe Financial and Portsmouth Square, purchased the note from the W. Hughes Brockbank Living Trust. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of the note was $250,000.

Present Condition of Property and Work Performed
We have completed extensive geological mapping, sampling, and drilling on a portion of the Comstock Project property, in order to characterize the mineralized material. We have performed preliminary metallurgical testing, mine planning, and economic analysis, and have produced internal reports of our mineralized material inventory. However, we have not established reserves that meet the requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7. Therefore, any activity we perform on the property is considered exploratory in nature. Part of our exploration included operating a test mine. The purpose of the test mine was to determine our capital and operating costs, metallurgical recoveries, and other mining factors, and determine if we could make a profit over and above our capital and operating costs.
Description of Equipment and other Infrastructure Facilities
We own a mine office building and shop building, a Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant, an agglomerator, crusher, screen, water truck, generators, dozers, cement silo with a screw feeder, and conveyors. The Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant and the mineral processing equipment are less than five years old. The net book value of these assets and land at December 31, 2009 was $416,189 and $1,885,277 respectively.
Geology, Structure and Mineralization
Gold and silver mineralization in the project area is highly dependent on geologic structural ground preparation over million of years, as it is throughout the Comstock Mining District. The heavily-faulted, volcanic-hosted setting of the Plum Mine area is favorable with respect to the natural conditions under which gold and silver mineralization occurs.
Mineralization in the Hartford Complex area is hosted by the northwest striking Silver City fault zone and is enhanced in volume and grade where intersected by cross-cutting east-west and northeast striking structures. Detailed geologic studies by our geologic staff have identified four sub-parallel northwest striking faults within the Silver City fault zone. The spacing between these faults is about 150 feet, while thicknesses of mineralization along individual faults range from 40 to 120 feet.
Mineralization within the project drill area is more gold enriched with silver to gold ratios of approximately 10:1. This compares to ratios of silver to gold of 100:1 over the historic Comstock bonanzas. Drilling has outlined gold and silver mineralization over a strike distance of nearly one mile, with in-fill drilling on 50 to 70 foot centers over .6 of a mile. Mineralization is open-ended to the north and south along strike and down-dip to the east.
Mineralized Material
Based on the results of the 2007-2009 drilling program, our team of mining industry professionals drafted a report, compiled in accordance with the Society of Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (SME) 2007 reporting guidelines. That report, finalized in June, 2009, estimated that our deposit of mineralized material contained 22.9 million tons, with an average grade of 0.028 ounces per ton gold and 0.370 ounces per ton silver. The report further estimated a mineable portion of the mineralized material to be 20.3 million tons, with an average grade of 0.029 ounces per ton gold, and 0.395 ounces per ton silver. However, we have not established any proven or probable reserves that meet the requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7.
Future Exploration Potential
The Comstock Mining district is a well-known, historic mining district, with over 150 years of production history. We have access to extensive reports and maps on various properties in the district, but to-date, we have only conducted detailed geologic exploration on approximately 2% of our 5,200 acre land position. We are conducting an ongoing exploration program to locate and test surface mineral targets as well as deep underground bonanza targets by using historic compilation, geological mapping, geochemical and geophysical investigations and drilling.
Spring Valley Project (South Comstock)
We own a 100% interest in the 25 federal unpatented placer claims located in Lyon County, Nevada known as the Gold Canyon and Spring Valley claims. The 25 unpatented placer claims cover approximately 850 acres and are located about 30 miles southeast of Reno and six miles south of Virginia City, Nevada. In late 2008, we leased seven patented lode mining claims for this project. The properties are undeveloped and do not contain any open-pit or underground mines. We have not established any proven or probable reserves on the mineral claims. All of our activities associated with these properties are exploratory in nature. We have no plans to begin test mining operations on these properties in the near-term.
In 2008, we conducted geological reconnaissance in this area. As part of the 2007-2009 drilling program, six reverse circulation drill holes were drilled in Spring Valley. While all of these holes encountered anomalous mineralization, the fifth hole was significant as a “discovery hole”, encountering 30 feet of mineralized material averaging 0.209 ounces per ton gold, and 0.992 ounces per ton of silver. This previously-unknown mineral occurrence was found beneath just 40 feet of pediment. Additional drilling is needed to define the extent of this material.

Big Mike Copper Project
We own a 100% interest in the 17 unpatented lode claims and one placer claim, covering a total of approximately 310 acres in Pershing County, Nevada, that comprise the Big Mike Copper property. The Big Mike Copper property is located approximately 32 miles south of Winnemucca in Pershing County, Nevada. Access to this site is available by way of Grass Valley Road, a county maintained paved and gravel road, for 30 miles and then two miles on a BLM gravel road. The property is situated at an elevation of 5,000 to 5,500 feet. We have not completed any exploration activity or undertaken any geologic, engineering or economic studies on the Big Mike Copper property. The property includes an open pit, mineralized material in a stockpile, and waste dumps. As the site was previously mined, there are also roads and graded areas on the property. Two cased water wells with rights to two cubic feet per second are also present on the property.
At the end of September 2006, we entered into a ten year lease with a local company, controlled by a former GoldSpring director, for a 10 year lease of all of its mining claims for our Big Mike copper project. The lessor defaulted on the lease in 2009, and through his actions allowed a lien to be placed on the property by a contractor. We are negotiating to have the lien removed, and restore our property rights.
