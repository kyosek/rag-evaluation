Property Management and Leasing Strategy
Our property management and substantially all of our leasing activities and operating and administrative functions (including leasing, legal, acquisitions, development, data processing, finance and accounting) are administered or coordinated by our Administrative Service Company. On-site functions such as maintenance, landscaping, sweeping, plumbing and electrical are subcontracted out at each location and, to the extent permitted by their respective leases, the cost of these functions is passed on to the tenants.
We believe that focused property management, leasing and customer retention are essential to maximizing the sales per square foot, operating cash flow and value of our properties. Our primary goal in property management is to maintain an attractive shopping environment on a cost effective basis for our tenants.
The majority of our property management and leasing functions are supervised and administered by our Administrative Service Company. Our Administrative Service Company maintains regular contact with our tenants and frequently visits each asset to ensure the proper implementation and execution of our market strategies. As part of our ongoing property management, our Administrative Service Company conducts regular physical property reviews to improve our properties, react to changing market conditions and ensure proper maintenance.
Our leasing representatives have become experienced in the markets in which we operate by becoming familiar with current tenants as well as potential local, regional and national tenants that would complement our current tenant base. We study demographics, customer sales and merchandising mix to optimize the sales performance of our centers and thereby increase rents. We believe this hands-on approach maximizes the value of our shopping centers.
