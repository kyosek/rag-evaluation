ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company's principal office space is located at 1301 Avenue M, Cisco, Texas 76437. The office space is for corporate identification, mailing, and courier purposes and costs us approximately $3,200 a year to an affiliate. This $3,200 has been recorded as an expense and contributed capital in the financials.
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Company's overriding royalties total 488,040 net royalty acres under 13,679,838 gross surface acres in thirteen concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins. In addition the Company also owns 5,307 net royalty acres under 854,898 gross acres in four concessions located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership and size of each concession.
The Eromanga Basin encompasses the southwestern portion of the State of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australia's main onshore producing oil and gas basin.
The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Company's overrides are in a prime location since the majority of the Company's interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
On the 14,554,504 gross surface acres where ACOR holds overriding royalty interests, there are giant anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic highs, all of which indicate possibilities of oil and gas reserves. In addition, about $27 million worth of seismic information has been completed and is available on the areas.
During 2009 the Company received revenues from four of its overriding royalty interests - ATP 267, ATP 299, ATP 560 and PEL 115, and one of its working interests - PEL 100. A successful gas well was completed on ATP 543 in 1996, however; after completion of a gas pipeline, gas began to be marketed in August 1999, but the pipeline reduced the gas price and the well was shut in. No gas sales were made during 2009 on ATP 543.
The Company has overriding royalty interests in four Permits in the Gippsland Basin, VIC/P45, 53, 54 and 59. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964.
In addition to Company's large overriding royalty position it also has working interests in four concessions, which are all located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin. See the table for Working Interest Holdings for additional information.

The following is a summary of the Company's Australian properties divided into four areas: 1) Gippsland Basin - Victoria, 2) Carnarvon Basin of Western Australia, 3) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia, and 4) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland;
BASS STRAIT OF THE GIPPSLAND BASIN
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in four oil and gas concessions located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin:
VIC/P45
VIC/P45 is an offshore concession covering 214,896 gross acres under which the Company holds a 7.5% of 1% of gross production. This concession is located in the most prolific oil-producing basin in Australia, approximately 1.5 miles east of the Kingfish Oil Field in the southern Gippsland Basin in the Bass Straits. The Kingfish Oil Field, the largest oil field in Australia, has produced over one billion barrels of oil since its discovery. Apache drilled two unsuccessful wells (Megamouth #1 and Coelacanth #1) on VIC/P45 prior to 2009 and other prospective leads of interest caused Apache to apply in 2009 for new exploration terms. Apache, the Operator, was granted a variation in terms from the Victorian State Government requiring additional geotechnical studies and review of the remaining leads during the first five years and drill a well during the sixth year.
VIC/P53
VIC/P53 is an offshore concession covering 182,858 gross acres under which the Company holds a 15% of 1% of gross production. In the fourth quarter of 2008 the Bazzard #1 was drilled which encountered oil and gas shows but was not commercial and was plugged and abandoned. It should be noted that this concession is totally surrounded by huge offshore oil and gas fields that have produced in excess of 2.8 billion barrels of oil and 5 trillion cubic feet of gas to date. Six prospects were also identified during the 3-D seismic program. The joint venture partners of VIC/P53 are seeking variation of terms of the permit to allow more time to evaluate the remaining undrilled prospects.
VIC/P54
VIC/P54 is an offshore concession covering 155,676 gross acres under which the Company holds a 5% of 1% of gross production. The Longtom-3, drilled and completed during the summer of 2006, clearly demonstrated that wells can be drilled in the field that will enable the production of gas at commercial rates. Two production tests were conducted on the well:
The first test produced gas from the 400 sand at 23MMscf/d. The results from this test confirm the flow potential of the 400 sand reservoir in the Longtom field, addressing a major concern leading up to the drilling of the Longtom-3 well. A flow was not achieved in the second test of Longtom-2 (conducted over the 400 sand). Nexus has interpreted this test as having failed due to down-hole mechanical problems.
The second test, over the 100, 200 and 300 sand intervals in the horizontal hole section exceeded expectations producing an estimated 77MMcf/d when bypassing the test separator and 59MMcf/d when flowing through the test separator (the separator's flow capacity). Sampling during the test recorded expected levels of carbon dioxide (less than 1%) and less than one part per million hydrogen sulphide.
In addition, the second test indicated that the condensate yield is higher in the 100 sands than in the sands above it, which will provide an economic boost to the project.
The Longtom-4 development well was drilled during the summer of 2008. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.
A 12" pipeline was constructed to the Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009. Revenues from gas sales for the Company are expected to begin during the first half of 2010.
The Operator of VIC/P54 is reprocessing its 3D seismic data over the Longtom Field and the eastern part of VIC/P54 to determine the potential of extending the Longtom trend further east.
VIC/P59
VIC/P59 consists of 301,468 gross acres and is located offshore in the Gippsland Basin under which the Company holds 1,206 net royalty acres representing a 1/20th of 1% overriding royalty interest. VIC/P59 is adjoined by the Blackback Oil Field with estimated reserves of 80,000,000 barrels of oil. Apache drilled three wells in 2008 on VIC/P59. No significant activity was reported during 2009 on VIC/P59.
VIC/P60
During the year ended December 31, 2009, Holloman Energy relinquished VIC/P60 back to the Victoria State Government resulting in the Company's overriding royalty interest being cancelled.
CARNARVON BASIN - WESTERN AUSTRALIA
The Company holds an overriding royalty interest in one oil and gas concession located in the Carnarvon Basin. The Carnarvon Basin is located off the coast of Western Australia and is known for its prolific production. More than half of Australia's total hydrocarbon production comes from the Carnarvon Basin. The following is a report on the Company's interests in the Carnarvon Basin:
WA-400
In December 2009 the Company purchased a 1/20th of 1% overriding royalty interest under the offshore block known as WA-400. WA-400 is located in the center of Australia's premier hydrocarbon province. This concession consists of approximately 19,768 gross acres and is located in the northwest shelf of the Carnarvon Basin. Apache, the operator of WA-400, completed a 3D seismic survey over the entire concession.
WA-372 & WA-373
During the year ended December 31, 2009 both WA-372 and WA-373 were relinquished back to the Western Australian State Government resulting in the Company's overriding royalty interest being cancelled.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - SOUTH AUSTRALIA
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in five oil and gas concessions and holds working interests in three oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in South Australia:
PEL 88
ACOR owns a 3/10ths of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 88, which covers 816,436 gross acres. Three prospects have been identified on PEL 88, Acacia, Casuarina and Lancier. The potential recoverable reserves of each of these prospects are 15,000,000 barrels of oil in the Acacia, 18,000,000 barrels of oil in the Casuarina and 48,000,000 barrels of oil in the Lancier. No assurance can be made that these prospects will be drilled.
PEL 100
ACOR holds a 1% working interest in the Cleansweep #1, which was drilled in the 2008 fiscal year and was completed as a Birkhead formation producer. The well tested on 444 barrels of oil on a drill stem test. The Cleansweep well is estimated to have the potential of 4.8 million barrels of recoverable oil in place. Recent seismic mapping has confirmed that Angelica #1 drilled in 1998 was drilled off structure. A more detailed review of the existing seismic identified a four-way drape structure of Eromanga Basin sediments over a basement horst bald of Permian strata. A detailed 3D seismic program is planned to ensure that Angelica #2 tests the crest of this structure.
PEL 111
ACOR owns a 1/10th of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 111, which covers 290,101 gross acres. Mapping of PEL 111 seismic data coupled with the reprocessing of existing seismic data identified 20 leads and prospects for potential oil and gas in the Birkhead, Hutton, Tirrawarra and Patchawarra formations. The Warhawk #1 was drilled in 2008 and was cased and suspended as a future producer. During 2009 three wells (Snatcher 1, 2 & 3) were drilled and completed as producers in the Birkhead channel sands. The Snatcher #1 well tested 218 barrels of oil per day.
The Snatcher #1 began producing on December 20, 2009 with both the Snatcher wells 2 & 3 coming on line during the first quarter of 2010.
Plans are to drill Liberator #1 during the summer of 2010, which is located approximately 700 meters northwest of Snatcher well #3.
The operator states that a 3-D seismic program, followed by a 3 well drilling program on this area, is planned during 2010.
PEL 112 & 444
On June 21, 2006, ACOR signed a farm-out agreement with Holloman Corporation of Odessa, Texas for the oil & gas exploration of ACOR's PELs 108, 109, & 112, located in South Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. ACOR retained a 13.8325% carried working interest through the drilling and completion of the first 3 wells under PELs 108, 109, & 112.
Holloman Corp. agreed to drill and complete 3 wells to earn 66.667% working interest in all 3 areas. Holloman Corp. will carry ACOR for 13.8325% in the first three wells. After the third well, ACOR will pay its part of any future exploration performed on the 3 areas, subject to the terms of the Joint Operating Agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Holloman drilled the Pecos #1 well on PEL 112 being the first of the three well program. The Pecos #1 was completed as a dry hole.
During 2008 Holloman obtained approval from the South Australian Government for new exploration terms giving a new five-year work program for PEL 112 and consolidating PEL 108 & 109 to a new exploration permit PEL 444. The Company's terms and conditions mentioned above remain in force on these two permits.
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, Holloman opened bids for proposals for both PEL 112 and PEL 444. As of the date of this report no information has been received as to the results of the bids opened on January 14, 2010.
PEL 115
This permit covers 65,730 gross acres under which ACOR holds an overriding royalty interest of 10% of 1% of gross production. PEL 115 is located in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. The Mirage-1 well completed in July 2005 initially flowed clean oil at a rate of 372 barrels of oil per day on a 1/2 inch choke. Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet.
The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately 20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the north-east. Such an area has the potential of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir.
In the southern part of PEL 115 the interpretation of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra and Thunderbolt). During 2009 the Fury #1 and Airacobra #1 were drilled and completed as producers. Based on the analysis of the wire line log data and sidewall cores and similarity of the Murta oil column in Fury-1 to those seen in the producing Mirage Oil Field, 5 kilometers to the south west, Fury-1 has been completed for production with 7 inch production casing run to 6,446 feet.
The Fury-1 well will be production tested as soon as a work-over rig is available. Following production testing, the close proximity of the producing Mirage oil field production facilities offers the opportunity for a pipeline connection from the Fury-1 oil discovery to the Mirage oil field.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - QUEENSLAND
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in eight oil and gas concessions and holds working interests in one oil and gas concession located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in Queensland:
ATP 267
The Company owns an overriding royalty interest of 17.15% of 1% in ATP 267, which covers approximately 220,800 acres. ATP 267 has 25 producing wells in six oil fields known as the Kihee, Koora, Nockatunga, Winna, Maxwell, Dikera, Thungo and Murhero fields. The Company received revenues from its overriding royalty ownership in these wells during 2009. The Company's oil reserves as to its interest in ATP 267 are 2,550 barrels as of June 30, 2009 per the Department of Mines of the State of Queensland.
ATP 299
The Company owns a .0575% of 1% ORRI under ATP-299 and its Petroleum Licenses which covers 441,600 gross acres and currently has 104 completed wells under which ACOR receives overriding royalties. The Tintaburra Block is reported to contain approximately 84 million barrels of proved plus probable oil in place. ATP 299 has 104 producing wells in 25 oil fields. The Company received revenues from its overriding royalty ownership in these wells during 2009. The Company's oil reserves as to its interest in ATP 299 are 6,640 barrels as of June 30, 2009 per the Department of Mines of the State of Queensland.
Two new wells were drilled in 2009 on ATP 299, Ipundu #16 and Ipundu North #13 both of which were cased and suspended as future oil producers.
ATP 560
ATP 560 covers 625,600 acres under which the Company holds a 25% of 1% override. The Utopia Oil Field is situated in ATP 560P in the Eromanga Basin in southwest Queensland, approximately 150 km north east of the Jackson Oilfield and 50 km south of the Kenmore Oilfield. The Joint Venture is considering numerous options to accelerate production from the field. The Utopia field is a broad low-relief structure, with a maximum relief of approximately 10 m. The field produces from the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation and is the largest known Murta pool in the Queensland Eromanga Basin. The oil pool is at an approximate depth of 1020 m. The most recent technical review of Utopia undertaken in June 2004 determined the field could contain up to 2.86 million barrels of recoverable oil.
On Dec. 21st, 2009, the JV Partner of ATP 560 announced that they have had a good start to its three-well development drilling program on the Utopia oil field in Queensland with the first well, Utopia-7, to be completed as an oil producer. Utopia #8 & 9 are planned as part of a 5 well drilling program for 2010.
ATP 582
ATP-582 is located in Queensland Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. The permit area covers approximately 6,716,000 gross acres. The Southern zone of ATP-582 is currently the best part of the area for oil and gas exploration. Besides being up dip of the approximately $1 billion dollar annual production from the Santos-Exxon producing block, it is along strike with many new discovery wells that have sustained daily production of 1,000 - 3,000 barrels of oil per day. ACOR management has currently identified two prospects on ATP-582 from the 850 miles seismic data, owned by ACOR. Two prospects have been identified:
The Samphire prospect covers approximately 3,800 acres and exhibits approximately 110 feet of closure. It is possible that a good potential exists for a 10-15 million barrel field, with a possible potential of approximately 40 million barrels.
The Samphire West, which covers around 4,700 acres. If the Samphire prospect proves to be productive, a number of additional field discoveries may result from leads in the Southern part of ATP-582. Both prospects are a series of sandstone (clastic) reservoirs of pinch-outs and structural traps that have formed on the flank of the local high.
On September 26th, 2006 the Company entered into a Joint Venture arrangement where the partner will operate the concession, pay to obtain Native Title clearance, shoot a new seismic grid survey over the leads identified by ACOR management from old seismic data to confirm good drillable targets with plans to drill a well to earn a 50% working interest under ATP 582 (ACOR will be carried for 50% WI). No exploration work can begin until native title has been cleared.
ITEM 3.
