The Agreement calls for ISGC to fund operations totaling $18 million, or $8 million if SMMI exercises its participation option. SMMI will own 100% of the LLC membership units until such time as ISGC makes the stipulated qualifying expenditures (as defined by the operating agreement).
The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months, subject to business conditions, will be to continue the advanced exploration and pre-development program for the South Mountain Project. This work will include:
·
Selecting a third party contractor to organize a Feasibility Study.
·
Continue with the rehabilitation of the Laxey and Sonneman drifts, utilizing an underground contract miner to conduct the rehabilitation work.
·
Continue with the underground core drilling from within the Sonneman level, at drill stations engineered to define the mineralization and to intercept the down-dip extensions of the Texas, DMEA-2, and Laxey ore zones, as project finances allow, and
·
Continue the baseline environmental and engineering work.
Work on the Company`s other three wholly-owned properties will continue in 2014, although the South Mountain Project will still remain the focus. At the Trout Creek Project, the following is planned:
·
Prepare to drill a pre-defined drill target on the Joint Exploration area with Newmont Mining.
·
Analyze the drill data, and prepare for further exploration in the 2015/2016 seasons.
·
Continue geophysical interpretation of the valley area. Define potential drill targets and develop additional drill targets for remaining field season in 2015 and beyond, depending upon the results.

South Mountain Project, Owyhee County, Idaho
The land package at South Mountain consists of a total of approximately 1,158 acres, consisting of (i) 17 patented claims (326 acres) the Company owns outright; (ii) lease on private ranch land (542 acres); and, (iii) 21 unpatented lode mining claims on BLM managed land (290 acres). The Company is negotiating for additional private land surrounding the existing land package. All holdings are located in the South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho.
The property is located approximately 70 air miles southwest of Boise, Idaho and approximately 24 miles southeast of Jordan Valley, Oregon. It is accessible by highway 95 driving south from the Boise area to Jordan Valley Oregon, then by traveling southeast approximately 22 miles back into Idaho, via Owyhee County road that is dirt and improved to within 4 miles of historic mine site. The last 4 miles up the South Mountain Mine road are unimproved dirt road. The property is accessible year-round to within 4 miles of the property, where the property is accessible from May thru October without plowing snow. There is power to within 4 miles of the site as well. The climate is considered high desert. The Company has water rights on the property, and there is a potable spring on the property that once supplied water to the main camp.
During the development of the Sonneman Level during 2012-2013 several massive sulfide mineralized zones were mined through. Detailed rib sampling along some of these zones yielded the following results:

Other Underground Pre-Development Work
The reconstruction of the Sonneman and Laxey drifts continued successfully until January 2014 when the Project went into care and maintenance. The Sonneman Level advanced 2,711 feet from the portal and is constructed to 12 feet X 12 feet for future development and mining. There is approximately 350 feet of engineered drift to construct in order to reach the historic Texas ore zone located at the end of the old workings. This advance to and through this zone will allow for drill stations and underground drilling to further define the high-grade resource encountered by William Bowes group in the 1980s.
The historic 2,200-foot long Laxey Level drift has been rehabilitated to 10 feet by 10 feet for a distance of approximately 720 feet. At that point the old tunnel had recently collapsed in at an intrusive dike and preparations were being made to advance through the caved area. This old tunnel was rehabilitated and accessed along its full length in 2008, at which point it intercepted the Texas ore shoot, one of many that had limited mining during and after the World War II period. Excellent high grade massive sulfide is exposed in this area, and our drilling during 2013 proved its continuity between the Laxey Level and the surface, an up-dip distance of nearly 400 feet.
2013 Core Drilling Program
The surface drilling program was completed in November, 2013. Twelve core holes totaling 7,535.5 feet were drilled and targeted three separate ore shoots:
1.
Seven holes targeted the Texas Ore Shoot from the surface to the Laxey Level, and between the Laxey and Sonneman Levels. The continuity of sulfide mineralization was confirmed and the surface to Laxey Level offers an upside to the ore shoot that has never been explored. Additional drilling, primarily from underground, will be necessary to move this into a reserve category.
Long section looking north showing the Laxey and Sonneman tunnels and locations of some of the core drill holes.
2.
Three holes were drilled to test the DMEA 2 Ore Shoot between the two levels. The best hole, DMEA13-09, intercepted 15 feet of massive sulfide with a grade of 0.22 opt gold, 2.67 opt silver, 20.2% zinc, 0.27% copper and 0.35% lead.
3.
Two holes tested the down dip extension of the ore shoot mined during World War II from the 800-foot deep Laxey Shaft. Encouraging mineralization was intercepted in both holes, with the best being LX13-11 that cut 34 feet of sulfide grading 0.004 opt gold, 4.41 opt silver and 7.18% zinc.
A detailed underground fan drilling program commenced as soon as the surface drilling program was completed. Drilling on the DMEA 2 and Texas Ore Shoot were planned in order to define a mineable resource, but unfortunately the program was terminated after the first fan was drilled in the DMEA 2 down dip target.

Results from the first drill fan testing the down dip extension of the historic DMEA ore zones.
This drilling confirms and enhances the DMEA 2 and DMEA 3 massive sulfide zone mined during the completion of the Sonneman Tunnel. (The rib sample results from these zones are reported above.) Two additional fans were planned, one at a shallower angle and one further down dip. There is some indication that the two or three zones may be coalescing with depth. Additional fans are planned, but were put on hold due to lack of funding.
The advance of the Sonneman Level tunnel was stopped about 300 feet short of the primary target, the Texas Ore Shoot. The caved older tunnel built by Bowes around 1980 intercepted approximately 70 feet of sulfide grading 0.26 opt gold, 7.42 opt silver, 14.0% zinc, 3.7% lead and 0.16% copper. Once the new tunnel advances and drill stations construction, fan drilling is planned to test the up and down dip of this attractive zone.
Management remains encouraged by results of the underground pre-development work completed to date. The South Mountain Model continues to prove that the continuation of the replacement sulfide mineralized ore shoots at depth. Detailed follow-up core drilling will be needed to better define the quality and quantity of the historic ore zones at depth.
Other work on the Project included access road work, infrastructure facilities and some environmental remediation. In order to remediate any water contamination from the historic Sonneman waste rock dump, a 440-foot 48-inch culvert was constructed so that Williams Creek would flow beneath the waste rock.
Status of the Operating Agreement with Idaho State Gold Company (ISGC II)
On November 8, 2012, the Company and Idaho State Gold Company II LLC (“ISGC”) formed Owyhee Gold Trust, LLC, (“OGT”) a limited liability Corporation. As part of the Agreement, 6,000 membership units were created and represented SMMI’s contribution as its initial contribution to OGT. The Agreement calls for ISGC to fund operations totaling $18 million, or $8 million if SMMI exercises its participation option. SMMI holds all of the LLC membership units until such time as ISGC II makes the stipulated qualifying expenditures (as defined by the operating agreement).
Currently, ISGC II has chosen to put the property and care and maintenance.
Property History
The limited historic production peaked during World War II when, based on smelter receipts, the production of direct shipped ore totaled 53,653 tons containing 3,118 ounces of gold, 566,439 ounces of silver, 13,932 pounds of copper, 2,562,318 pounds of lead and 15,593,061 pounds of zinc. In addition to the direct-ship ore, a flotation mill was constructed and operated during the late-1940s and early-1950s.

South Mountain Mines Inc. controlled the patented claims from 1975 to the time the Company purchased the entity in 2007. They conducted extensive exploration work including extending the Sonneman Level by approximately 1,500 feet to intercept the down-dip extension of the Texas sulfide mineralization mined on the Laxey Level some 300 feet above the Sonneman. High grade sulfide mineralization was intercepted on the Sonneman Extension. In 1985 they did a feasibility study based on polygonal ore blocks exposed in the underground workings and drilling. This resulted in a historic resource of approximately 470,000 tons containing 23,500 ounces of gold, 3,530,000 ounces of silver, 8,339,000 pounds of copper, 13,157,000 pounds of lead and 91,817,000 lbs of zinc. Although they determined positive economics, the project was shut down and placed into care and maintenance.
In 2008, the Company engaged Kleinfelder, Inc., a nationwide engineering and consulting firm, to complete a technical report “Resources Data Evaluation, South Mountain Property, South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho”. The technical report was commissioned by Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. to evaluate all the existing data available on the South Mountain property. Kleinfelder utilized a panel modeling method using this data to determine potential mineralized material remaining and to make a comparison with the resource determined by South Mountain Mines in the mid-1980s.
Additional drilling and sampling will be necessary before the resource can be classified as a mineable reserve, but Kleinfelder’s calculations provided a potential resource number that is consistent with South Mountain Mines’ (Bowes 1985) reserve model.
Late in 2009, the Company contracted with Northwestern Groundwater & Geology to incorporate all the new drill and sampling data into an NI 43-101 Technical Report. This report was completed as part of the Company’s dual listing on the TSX Venture Exchange in 2010. The NI 43-101 can be reviewed on the Company`s website at www.thundermountaingold.com, or on www.SEDAR.com.
Gold Breccia Area
No additional work has been completed on the multi-lithic intrusive breccia outcrop that was identified and sampled in 2008 on property leased by the Company. An extensive ground magnetic survey consisting of approximately 81 line miles was completed over the project area by Jim Wright Geophysics and was designed to tie the sediment hosted mineralization with the Gold Breccia Zone. Additional geophysics will be justified and will consist of deep penetrating induced polarization work.
This large area (approximately one mile long and one-half a mile wide) is located several thousand feet south of the main mine area. The intrusive breccia is composed of rounded to sub-rounded fragments of altered intrusive rock and silicified fragments of altered schist and marble. Initial rock chip samples from the outcrop area ranged from 0.49 ppm to 1.70 ppm gold, and follow-up outcrop and float sampling in 2009 yielded gold values ranging from 0.047 ppm to 5.81 ppm. A first pass orientation soil survey completed in 2008 was conducted near the “discovery’ breccia outcrop at a spacing of 100 feet over a distance of 800 feet east/west and 1,000 feet north/south. The soil assays ranged from a trace to 0.31 ppm Gold. Surface mapping indicates that the intrusive breccia covers an area of approximately 5,000 feet x 1,500 feet.
Management believes that the “first-pass” drill results from the intrusive breccia drilling proves the existence of a significant gold system in an intrusive package that is related to the polymetallic mineralization in the carbonate in the historic mine area. Additionally, an IP survey is planned to isolate potential feeder structures and to evaluate the contact between the metasediments and the gold-bearing intrusive.
Qualified Person - Edward D. Fields is the Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 responsible for the technical data reported in this news release.
This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7. There are currently no permits required for conducting exploration in accordance with the Company`s current board approved exploration plan.
Trout Creek Project, Lander County, Nevada
The Trout Creek pediment exploration gold target is located along the eastern flank of Reese River Valley along the pediment of the Shoshone Range in Lander County, Nevada. The claim package consists of 78 unpatented mining claims (approximately 1560 acres) that are situated along a recognizable structural zone in the Eureka-Battle Mountain mineralized gold trend. In addition to the claims, a joint venture exploration agreement with Newmont Mining covering approximately 25 square miles on which Newmont owns the mineral rights on about half that amount. The mineral rights consist of their ownership of the Continental Railroad sections.
The Project is located approximately 155 air miles northeast of Reno, Nevada, or approximately 20 miles SW of Battle Mountain, Nevada, in Sections 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 27; T.29N.; R.44E. Mount Diablo Baseline & Meridian, Lander County, Nevada. Latitude: 40 23’ 36” North, Longitude: 117 00’ 58” West. The property is accessible by traveling south from Battle Mountain Nevada on state highway 305, which is paved. The project is generally accessible year round. There is no power, no water other than seasonal surface precipitation and associated streams that flow from the Shoshone Range, and there are no improvements on the property.

An extensive data package was made available by Newmont to Thunder Mountain Gold, and follow-up fieldwork was undertaken once the agreement was finalized. This fieldwork consisted of mapping the altered and mineralized structures that can be followed through the Shoshone Range. Of importance is that these structures align with the Cortez-Pipeline deposits and the Phoenix deposit (part of the Eureka-Battle Mountain-Getchell Trend).
In addition to the geologic fieldwork, Wright Geophysics conducted a ground gravity survey and CSMAT over the pediment target area and this provided insight into the gravel-bedrock contact as well as defining the favorable structural setting within the buried bedrock. An untested drill target was identified under the gravel pediment along these structures, and the geophysics showed that the bedrock was within a reasonable depth for exploration drilling and potential mining if a significant mineralization is encountered.
Lack of an adequate budget prevented drilling during 2014, but Newmont and the Company are currently amending the agreement to modify the work commitment timeframe. It is anticipated that funding will be available during the 2015 season and one or two reverse circulation holes can test the bedrock beneath the gravel along the mineralized structures.
The Trout Creek target is based on a regional gravity anomaly on a well-defined northwest-southeast trending break in the alluvial fill thickness and underlying bedrock. Previous geophysical work in the 1980s revealed an airborne magnetic anomaly associated with the same structure, and this was further verified and outlined in 2008 by Company personnel using a ground magnetometer. The target is covered by alluvial fan deposits of unknown thickness shed from the adjacent Shoshone Range, a fault block mountain range composed of Paleozoic sediments of both upper and lower plate rocks of the Roberts Mountains thrust. The geophysical anomaly could define a prospective and unexplored target within a well mineralized region.
The ongoing exploration field work, including claim maintenance and assessment, is financed by the Company through sales of unregistered common stock funded by the Company through private placements with accredited investors. Future work will be funded in the same manner or through a strategic partnership with another mining company. The Company is attempting to consolidate the land package to cover a larger area of the positive geophysical target in the pediment by acquiring and/or joint venturing adjoining mineral property.
There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, a notice of intent may be required with the Bureau of Land Management. This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7.
Competition
We are an exploration stage company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Employees
The Company had two employees during the year ended December 31, 2014; Eric Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Collord, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In early 2011, Mr. Collard and Mr. Jones voluntarily reduced his salary to $1/month until November 2012 when the financial condition of the Company improved. Later, Mr. Collard and Mr. Jones voluntarily suspended their salaries in July of 2013, until the company became financially able to pay them.
