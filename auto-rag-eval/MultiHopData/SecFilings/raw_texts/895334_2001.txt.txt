Because of the requirement for fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to ERISA to determine the value of the assets of such retirement plans on an annual basis, the General Partners are required under the Partnership Agreement to report estimated Unit values to the Limited Partners each year in the Partnership's annual Form 10-K. The methodology to be utilized for determining such estimated Unit values under the Partnership Agreement is for the General Partners to estimate the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Partnership's properties were sold at their estimated fair market values as of the end of the Partnership's fiscal year and the proceeds therefrom (without reduction for selling expenses) were distributed to the Limited Partners in liquidation of the Partnership. Utilizing this methodology, the General Partners have estimated Unit valuations, based upon their estimates of property values as of December 31, 2001, to be approximately $9.02 per Class A Unit and $9.02 per Class B Unit, based upon market conditions existing in early December 2001. In connection with these estimated valuations, the General Partners obtained an opinion from David L. Beal Company, an independent MAI appraiser, to the effect that such estimates of value were reasonable; however, due to the inordinate expense involved in obtaining appraisals for all of the Partnership's properties, no actual appraisals were obtained. Accordingly, these estimates should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of the Partnership's properties, nor do they represent the amount of net proceeds which would result from an immediate sale of the Partnership's properties. The valuations performed by the General Partners are estimates only, and are based a number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete. In addition, property values are subject to change and could decline in the future. Further, as set forth above, no appraisals have or will be obtained. For these reasons, the estimated Unit valuations set forth above should not be relied upon for any purpose other than required ERISA disclosures.
