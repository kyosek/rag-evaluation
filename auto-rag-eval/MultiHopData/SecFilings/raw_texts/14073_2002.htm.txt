Yorkshire Knolls, Prince George’s County, Maryland-The project consisted of 252 townhomes on a 31.5-acre tract of land. During 2002, the Company sold 49 of the 50 townhomes in inventory. The final townhome was sold in January 2003. Although sales at Yorkshire Knolls have been completed, the Company has an immaterial amount of site improvements remaining before the project is totally complete.
St. Mary’s County, Maryland-The project consisted of 64 subdivided residential lots and 31 farmsteads ranging in size from 15 to 30 acres each. As of December 31, 2002, all residential lots and farmsteads have been sold.
Clarksburg Ridge-Subsequent to December 31, 2002, the Company purchased a 100% interest in Clarksburg Ridge, LLC (“LLC”). The LLC owns a parcel of undeveloped residential land in Clarksburg, Maryland, which is subdivided into 159 residential lots. The parcel is commonly referred to as Clarksburg Ridge. Simultaneous with the acquisition, the Company entered into an approximately $7,000,000 development management agreement with a third party for the site grading, sewer installation, street paving and other infrastructure. In July 2002, the LLC entered into a sales contract with NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) that provides for the structured takedown of lots commencing in August 2003 and completing in January 2005. With the execution of the sales contract, NVR paid the LLC a non-refundable deposit of $4,950,000. Also in July 2002, the LLC entered into a loan agreement with Columbia Bank (“Bank”) for the acquisition, development, interest reserve, and real estate taxes associated with the property. The variable rate loan bears interest at the Bank’s Prime Rate of Interest plus 100 basis points. As security for this loan, the Company has deposited $2,000,000 in an investment account with the Bank. The aggregate purchase price of the LLC consisted of $5,000,000 in cash from the Company, the assumption of the outstanding balance on the Bank loan of $4,200,000, and the application of $3,000,000 of deposit proceeds from NVR. The remaining $1,950,000 of the NVR deposit was refunded to NVR and an appropriate amendment made to the NVR sales contract to reflect the return of deposit monies.

The partnership also owns a parcel of ground adjacent to the shopping center that is leased on a net basis to an apartment developer who is currently planning to construct approximately 400 apartment units thereon. The Company, for its contribution, acquired a 25% interest in this partnership. The partnership has an option to purchase the Company’s interest in the partnership for the original contributed capital plus a 20% return thereon, less any distributions paid through the repurchase date.
Waterfront Complex-Since 1964, B&R has been the redeveloper of a portion of the southwest Washington, D.C. Urban Renewal Area (the “Area”), located immediately south of the “Federal Mall,” which extends from the United States Capitol Building to the Washington Monument. The Company developed a shopping-office center (“Complex”) that consists of two high-rise office buildings (“Office Buildings”) containing approximately 326,000 square feet, an enclosed center (“Center”) consisting of approximately 740,000 square feet, most of which is office space and the balance consisting of retail space, approximately 1,100 parking spaces and approximately 78,000 square feet of storage space. These improvements were constructed on ground leased from The District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (“RLA”) for a term expiring in 2058 with an option to extend for an additional 20 years.
Prior to July 1, 2000, four entities held leasehold interests in the Complex. The Company was the lessee of the east portion of the Center. SEW Investors (“SEW”) was the lessee of the southeast wing of the Center. Trilon Plaza Company (“Trilon”) was the lessee of the west portion of the Center and the west office building. Town Center East Investors (“TCE”) was the lessee of the east office building. Trilon is a limited partnership in which Messrs. Bresler and Reiner hold a substantial majority interest, and whose wholly owned corporation is the general partner.
On July 1, 2000, TCE distributed to the Company a 49.568966% interest of its leasehold interest in the Mall Complex. In addition, on July 1, 2000, TCE assigned to the Company its remaining interest in the Complex and SEW also assigned its interest to the Company. In connection with these assignments, the Company paid cash of $2,100,000 and $1,600,000 and issued notes of $4,900,000 and $3,600,000, respectively, which notes were repaid in 2002. The Company assigned these newly acquired leasehold interests, in addition to one which the Company previously owned, to a newly formed entity, B&R Waterfront Properties, LLC (“BRW”). The Company is the managing member and holds a 54% interest in BRW. The results of operation of BRW have been reported on a consolidated basis with elimination of the minority interest. On March 15, 2001, BRW transferred these leasehold interests to a newly formed entity, Waterside Associates, LLC (“WALLC”).
The United States General Services Administration (“GSA”) previously leased all of the space in the two Office Buildings, as well as the second and third floors of the adjacent Center and a portion of another smaller structure totaling approximately 955,000 square feet. The GSA lease for the Waterfront Complex terminated on September 13, 2002. The termination of this lease, which represents 89.4% of the total space in the Complex, resulted in a 2002 revenue reduction of $6,767,000 of which the Company’s share was $3,654,000. In future years, and until the property is released, the annual revenue reduction will be approximately $23,200,000, of which the Company’s share is 54% or $12,500,000.
Further, the retail tenants in the Complex relied heavily on business generated by the employees who occupied the GSA space. Retail tenants have vacated and will continue to vacate resulting in the loss of commercial rental revenue.
In October 2002, the Company entered into a joint venture with K/FCE Management, LLC (“K/FCE”) an affiliate of the Washington, DC based developer, The Kaempfer Company, Inc. and of the national developer, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. The joint venture intends to redevelop and reposition the Waterfront Complex. Affiliates of K/FCE are marketing, leasing, redeveloping, and managing the complex. K/FCE has the right, subject to certain conditions, to increase its ownership in the joint venture up to 50% by the making of capital contributions. To the extent required, K/FCE has committed to contribute the first $25,000,000 of redevelopment funds. If necessary, the Company may be required to contribute a portion of the additional equity required in excess of the $25,000,000.
As part of the redevelopment of the Waterfront Complex, the Company may incur significant costs relating to the remediation of hazardous materials. A reserve has been established in the amount of $3,000,000, of which $1,620,000 is the Company’s share and the balance is the liability of the minority partners. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay the costs associated with tenant relocation expenses. The Company cannot determine, at this time, the timeframe for the redevelopment and re-tenanting of the Waterfront Complex.
Convenience Stores-The Company previously owned sixteen parcels of improved real estate, located in the southern and southeastern United States, that it leased as convenience stores. Circle K Corporation currently leases four sites under leases that expire in February 2005. During 2002, the Company negotiated three sales agreements and settled on two of the properties. At December 31, 2002, seven of the available twelve properties have been sold, one property is under an agreement of sale, five of the sites (including the Circle K leases) are leased to unrelated parties, and the remaining three sites have not yet been sold and remain vacant and available for sale. The Company has established an impairment reserve of approximately $197,000 for these assets.
Nursing Home-The Company owns a nursing home facility, Lakeview Manor, which it leases to an unaffiliated operating company. Lakeview Manor is a 120-bed skilled and intermediate care facility located in Lakewood, New Jersey. The one-story building of approximately 37,000 square feet is situated on eleven acres of land.
The Company has leased the nursing home to an unaffiliated party whose lease expires in May 2004. The monthly rent is currently $50,710. The tenant has four five-year lease renewal options that would extend the lease term for up to twenty additional years. The lessee pays taxes and other operating expenses, and is responsible for all structural and nonstructural repairs and replacements. The lessee has a right of first refusal in the event the Company seeks to sell the property.
We have entered into an agreement of sale for the Company’s Lakeview Nursing Home for a purchase price of $6,300,000, with $2,000,000 of that amount to be contributed as a charitable donation to the purchaser. The sale of this property, or any property, represents a departure from our normal course of business. However, given the ongoing divestiture strategy of the tenant, the short-term nature of the lease, the special purpose functionality of the property, and the unique opportunity of sale presented, management has decided to vacate its normal business practices and consummate this transaction. At present, the purchase contract is in a conditional study period. We anticipate that this sale transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2003.
Paradise Developers-The Company owns approximately 31 acres of undeveloped commercial land in Manassas, Virginia. This land is being held for development opportunities or for sale to third parties. The Company has submitted to Prince William County development plans for three separate commercial buildings totaling approximately 189,000 square feet to be constructed on a 10.5-acre portion of this land.
Undeveloped Land at Washington Business Park-In November 2001, a joint venture in which the Company owns an 80% interest and an unaffiliated third party owns 20%, acquired approximately 79 acres of undeveloped land in the Washington Business Park located in Lanham, Maryland. The purchase price was $11,000,000. The Company invested $3,415,000 for its 80% interest in the joint venture. An unaffiliated third party, the manager of the LLC, holds a 20% interest in this property. The third party has the right to acquire an additional 30% ownership interest. The joint venture may sell one or more land parcels while holding other land parcels for development opportunities. As of December 31, 2002, the joint venture sold and settled two land parcels of approximately 1.65 acres and 12.36 acres, at contract sales prices of $432,000 and $3,230,070, respectively. In December 2001, the joint venture placed a $5,000,000 first deed of trust lien on this property. Interest on the loan is calculated at the lender’s Prime Rate of Interest plus 75 basis points. The loan matures in two years, but may be extended for an additional year.
Redwood Commercial Management, LLC-In December 2001, the Company and an unaffiliated third party created a property management and leasing company, known as Redwood Commercial Management, LLC (“Redwood”). Each member holds a 50% ownership interest in Redwood with the unaffiliated third party managing the LLC on a day-to-day basis. The Company does not control Redwood and therefore accounts for this investment on the equity method. It is anticipated that Redwood will conduct its principal business activities in Virginia. Commencing December 2001, Redwood began managing and leasing the following properties of the Company, as well as approximately 1,000,000 square feet of office, commercial and warehouse space for unaffiliated owners.

In December 1983, the Company, with others, organized a general partnership to engage in equipment leasing known as Builders Leasing Company, and agreed to act as its managing partner with a 20% interest. Certain directors and officers of B&R also hold an aggregate 25% partnership interest, including Charles S. Bresler, Chairman of the Board and principal shareholder (20%), and Burton J. Reiner, President, Director and principal shareholder (5%). Builders Leasing Company’s only assets are transportation barges.
In February 1984, the Company organized Tech High Leasing Company, a general partnership in which it holds a 50% interest to engage in equipment leasing. A non-affiliated corporation holds the remaining 50%. Tech-High Leasing Company’s only asset is a 50% limited partnership interest in Marnat Creek L.P., a limited partnership that owns an approximately 18,000 square foot utility maintenance building in Dallas, Texas. At December 31, 2002, the Company established an impairment reserve of approximately $694,000 for this asset.
Neither the Company nor these partnerships are currently entering into new equipment leases.

WMC Management Company, Inc.-WMC Management Company, Inc. (“WMC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acted as managing and leasing agent, through June 30, 2000, for Trilon and SEW for their portions of the Waterfront Complex. From July 1, 2000 through March 15, 2001, WMC acted as management and leasing agent for BRW and for a brief period of time, through the date of formation of the joint venture with K/FCE, acted as management and leasing agent for WALLC.
