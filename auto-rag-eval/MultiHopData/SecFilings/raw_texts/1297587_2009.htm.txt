Property Portfolio Size
Our portfolio size at the end of each quarter since commencement of our initial public offering through December 31, 2009 is as follows (Net Rentable Square Feet and Approximate Total Acquisition Cost in thousands):
(1) Net Rentable Square Feet for unconsolidated properties is at 100%. Approximate Total Acquisition Cost is at our pro rata share of effective ownership and does not include our investment in CBRE Strategic Partners Asia.
Rental Operations
Our reportable segments consist of three types of commercial real estate properties for which our management internally evaluates operating performance and financial results: the Domestic Industrial Properties, Domestic Office Properties and International Office/Retail Properties. All periods presented have been revised to report our segment results under our new reportable segment structure. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on net operating income, defined as: rental income and tenant reimbursements less property and related expenses (operating and maintenance, management fees and real estate taxes) and excludes other non-property income and expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and our company-level general and administrative expenses. The following tables compare the net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
(1) Total Segment Net Operating Income is a Non-GAAP financial measure which may be useful as a supplemental measure for evaluating the relationship of each reporting segment to the combined total. This measure should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to our U.S. GAAP presentations provided. Segment “Net Operating Income” is defined as
operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, including real estate taxes) before depreciation and amortization expense. The Net Operating Income segment information presented consists of the same Net Operating Income segment information disclosed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Insurance Coverage on Properties
We carry comprehensive general liability coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all of our properties with limits of liability which we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us on a replacement basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. The cost of such insurance is passed through to tenants whenever possible.
Tax Basis and Real Estate Tax
The following table provides information regarding our tax basis and real estate taxes at each of our consolidated properties as of December 31, 2009:
(1) This amount is based on the pre-construction completion assessed value of this property and a forthcoming post-construction completion date assessment is likely to increase our future annualized real-estate taxes on this property.
Regulations
Our properties, as well as any other properties that we may acquire in the future, are subject to various international, U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. Our properties are subject to regulation under federal laws, such as the ADA, under which all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and state and local laws addressing earthquake, fire and life safety requirements. Although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements under applicable governmental regulations, none of our properties have been audited or investigated for compliance by any regulatory agency. If we were not in compliance with material provisions of the ADA or other regulations affecting our properties, we might be required to take remedial action, which could include making modifications or renovations to properties. Federal, state or local governments may also enact future laws and regulations that could require us to make significant modifications or renovations to our properties. If we were to incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the quoted trading prices of our securities and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our properties.
