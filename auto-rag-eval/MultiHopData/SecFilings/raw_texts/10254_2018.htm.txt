Summary of Oil and Gas Properties
Midland Basin
We have an operated position of approximately 22,800 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin of west Texas across Reagan, Upton, and Midland counties with an average working interest of approximately 94%. As of December 31, 2018, we had 15 gross vertical and 51 gross horizontal operated producing wells. Current internal estimates indicate 500 potential gross, largely de-risked, operated drilling locations, the vast majority of which are in various benches of the Wolfcamp and the Spraberry formations. Of these 500 operated locations, 462 locations are expected to have an average working interest of 83%, whereas 38 locations are expected to be operated units where we hold an average working interest of approximately 35%. We are actively pursuing trades
and acquisitions of additional acreage that may increase our working interest in these 38 locations as well as increase our operated acreage.
We also have a non-operated position of approximately 6,700 net acres in the Midland Basin of west Texas, located in Howard, Glasscock, Martin and Midland counties, Texas. As of December 31, 2018, we had an interest in 100 gross vertical and 26 gross horizontal non-operated producing wells with an average working interest of approximately 36%.
We have identified 366 potential gross horizontal non-operated drilling locations in various benches of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations with an estimated average working interest of approximately 25%.
Eagle Ford Trend
As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 29,000 gross (14,100 net) operated leasehold acres in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of south Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations. We serve as the operator with working interests ranging from approximately 17% to 67%.
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 93 gross Eagle Ford wells and 13 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in approximately five gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk well. We have identified a total of 68 potential gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
As of December 31, 2018, all of our oil and natural gas reserves were located in the state of Texas. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling and completion operations. Our reserve estimates have been prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), an independent petroleum engineering firm. The scope and results of CG&A’s procedures are summarized in a letter which is included as an exhibit to this report. For further information on estimated reserves, including information on estimated future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please refer to the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
As of December 31, 2018, our estimated proved reserves totaled 98,847 MBOE and had a PV-10 value of approximately $1,008.5 million (see Non-GAAP Reconciliation below) and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $959.5 million, all of which relate to our properties in Texas. We incurred approximately $153.2 million in capital expenditures, primarily drilling and completion costs, during 2018. We expect to further develop our properties through additional drilling.
2018 Activity in Proved Reserves
From January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, our total estimated proved reserves increased 24% from 79,976 MBOE to 98,847 MBOE. Of that, estimated proved developed reserves increased 18% from 19,961 MBOE to 23,646 MBOE and estimated proved undeveloped reserves increased 25% from 60,015 MBOE to 75,201 MBOE. These increases are primarily attributable to our successful drilling efforts in the Midland Basin, acquisitions and trades during the year, as well as improved commodity prices.
Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2018
The below table sets forth a summary of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as of December 31, 2018, based on the annual reserve estimate prepared by CG&A. In preparing this reserve report, CG&A evaluated 100% of our properties at December 31, 2018. Proved reserves are estimated based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period for the year. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with the SEC guidelines.
Our proved reserve categories as of December 31, 2018 are summarized in the table below:
(1)
Includes 32.6 MMBbl of oil, 62.6 Bcf of natural gas and 11.6 MMBbl of NGLs reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, $557.4 million of PV-10 and $530.2 million of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows were attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
Non-GAAP Reconciliation
PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure that differs from a measure under GAAP known as “standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows” in that PV-10 is calculated without including future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV-10 value of its oil and natural gas properties is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves. We believe the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies because the timing and quantification of future income taxes is dependent on company-specific factors, many of which are difficult to determine. For these reasons, management uses and believes that the industry generally uses the PV-10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential rate of return on investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The table below provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (in thousands):
(1)
Includes $557.4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Includes $530.2 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Drilled But Uncompleted Wells
In order to achieve efficiencies from a pricing and logistics standpoint, our customary sequence of drilling and completion operations is to drill a group of wells and defer completion operations until all drilling operations for the group are concluded and then commence completion activities. See activities related to wells included in our proved developed reserves subsequent to December 31, 2018 below.
Reserve Quantity Information
The following table illustrates our estimated net proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves for the periods indicated. The oil prices as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are based on the respective 12-month
unweighted average of the first of the month prices of the WTI spot prices which equates to $65.56 per barrel and $51.34 per barrel, respectively. The natural gas prices as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of month prices of the Henry Hub spot price which equates to $3.10 per MMBtu and $2.98 per MMBtu, respectively. The natural gas liquids prices used to value reserves as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 averaged $28.81 per barrel and $22.59 per barrel, respectively. All prices are adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines.
A summary of our changes in quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
The table below presents the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:
Notable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 included the following:
•
Extensions and discoveries. In 2018, total extensions and discoveries of 16.2 MMBOE was a result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin.
•
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 6.6 MMBOE during 2018, which consisted of 4.7 MMBOE resulting from the disposition of non-operated properties in the Midland Basin as part of an acreage trade and 1.9 MMBOE related to the disposition of non-operated Eagle Ford properties, both further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Purchases of minerals in place. In 2018, total purchases of minerals in place of 6.8 MMBOE were primarily attributable to developed non-producing wells and undeveloped acreage acquired in the Midland Basin as part of an acreage trade, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Revision to previous estimates. In 2018, the upward revisions of prior reserves of 6.1 MMBOE consisted of improved PUD reserves of 5.8 MMBOE with improved proved developed reserves of 0.3 MMBOE. PUD revisions are a result of our successful drilling efforts in the Midland Basin as well as improved commodity prices.
Notable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the following:
•
Extensions and discoveries. In 2017, total extensions and discoveries of 30,763 MBOE was a result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin. The closing of the Bold Transaction in May 2017 which included primarily operated acreage in the Midland Basin was a significant contributor to this.
•
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 2,976 MBOE during 2017 and were primarily related to the disposition of the Bakken properties, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Purchases of minerals in place. In 2017, total purchases of minerals in place of 45,911 MBOE were primarily attributable to the Bold Transaction, whereby we acquired interests in 63 producing oil and natural gas wells, developed non-producing wells and undeveloped acreage in the Midland Basin, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Revision to previous estimates. In 2017, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 2,901 MBOE consisted of negative revisions to PUD reserves of 4,832 MBOE with improved proved developed reserves of 1,931 MBOE. PUD revisions are a result of (1) removal of approximately 2,011 MBOE of reserves due to delayed development plans of other operators in the Midland Basin that management previously expected to be developed within five years, (2) reduction of 2,378 MBOE upon closing of the Bold Transaction and making adjustments to development plans and PUD reserve assignments, and (3) non-participation in three Eagle Ford natural gas PUDs that were expected to develop 443 MBOE. Positive revisions are primarily a result of increased oil and natural gas prices during 2017.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Proved undeveloped reserves ("PUDs") increased from 60,015 MBOE to 75,201 MBOE or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. PUDs represent 76% of our total proved reserves. Certain previously booked PUDs were reclassified as proved developed reserves due to successful drilling efforts. Revisions of prior estimates include certain PUDs that were reclassified to unproved categories due to development plan changes. In accordance with our 2018 year-end independent engineering reserve report, we plan to drill all of our individual PUD drilling locations within the next five years.
Changes in our PUD reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in MBOE):
(1)
Includes 34,029 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.
(2)
Includes 41,560 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.
2018 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Conversions to developed. In our year-end 2017 plan to develop our PUDs within five years, we estimated that $51.9 million of capital would be expended in 2018 and that it would convert 4.3 MMBOE, which was consistent with the $55.4 million actually spent to convert 4.4 MMBOE to developed.
Extensions and discoveries. Additionally, 13.7 MMBOE were added as extensions and discoveries due to successful drilling results on our acreage positions because of the wells we drilled. The increase was also supported by successful drilling results by other operators directly offsetting and in close proximity to our acreage. All of these drilling results increased the confidence of the reservoir continuity and performance of the associated reservoirs which increased the number of PUDs primarily in the Midland Basin.
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 4.7 MMBOE during 2018, which consisted of 3.7 MMBOE resulting from the disposition of non-operated properties in the Midland Basin as part of an acreage trade and 1.0 MMBOE related to the disposition of non-operated Eagle Ford properties, both further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchases of minerals in place. In 2018, purchases of minerals in place of 4.7 MMBOE were attributable to developed non-producing wells and undeveloped acreage acquired in the Midland Basin as part of an acreage trade, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revision to previous estimates. Revisions of 5.8 MMBOE were primarily due to our successful drilling efforts in the Midland Basin as well as improved commodity prices.
2017 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Conversions to developed. In our year-end 2016 plan to develop our PUDs within five years, we estimated that $6.9 million of capital would be expended in 2017 and that it would convert 732 MBOE. Because of the improvement in commodity prices and the change in its development plan for 2017, we actually spent $8.5 million to convert 622 MBOE to developed. Our plan changed in that we developed more oil PUDs and elected not to participate in natural gas PUDs which included the above mentioned 443 MBOE associated with the Eagle Ford non-participation. The capital to develop our oil PUDs was higher on a per unit basis than the natural gas PUDs however the margins are higher for oil PUDs. The oil PUDs further benefited our longer-term operated development plans. Since the Bold Transaction closed in May 2017, the associated capital plan for the properties acquired in the Bold Transaction during 2017 was not considered in our year-end 2016 report. We did however incur $63.4 million to convert 2,134 MBOE of purchased PUD reserves to developed.
Extensions and discoveries. Additionally, 27,977 MBOE were added as extensions and discoveries due to successful drilling results on our acreage positions because of the wells we drilled. The increase was also supported by successful drilling results by other operators directly offsetting and in close proximity to our acreage. All of these drilling results increased the confidence of the reservoir continuity and performance of the associated reservoirs which increased the number of PUDs primarily in the Midland Basin.
Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 391 MBOE during 2017 and were primarily related to the disposition of the Bakken properties, as further described in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Purchases of minerals in place. During 2017, 37,327 MBOE were added to PUD reserves upon the closing of the Bold Transaction.
Revision to previous estimates. Revisions of 4,832 MBOE were primarily due to (1) removal of approximately 2,011 MBOE of reserves due to delayed development plans of other operators in the Midland Basin that management previously expected to be developed within five years, (2) reduction of 2,378 MBOE upon the closing of the Bold Transaction and making adjustments to development plans and PUD reserve assignments, and (3) non-participation in three Eagle Ford natural gas PUDs that were expected to develop 443 MBOE. This non-participation has no impact on our ability to participate in future wells in this acreage position.
Estimated Costs Related to Conversion of Proved Undeveloped Reserves to Proved Developed Reserves
The following table sets forth the estimated timing and cash flows of developing our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):
(1)
Beginning in 2019 and thereafter, the production and cash flows represent the drilling results from the respective year plus the incremental effects from the results of proved undeveloped drilling from previous years. These production volumes, inflows, expenses, development costs and cash flows are limited to the PUD reserves and do not include any production or cash flows from the Proved Developed category which will also help to fund our capital program.
(2)
Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
(3)
Computation is based on SEC pricing of (i) $61.18 per Bbl (WTI-Cushing spot prices, adjusted for differentials) and (ii) $2.13 per Mcf (Henry Hub spot natural gas price), as adjusted for location and quality by property.
Historically, our drilling programs have been substantially funded from our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility. Based on current commodity prices and our current expectations over the next five years of our cash flows and drilling programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped and unproven locations, we believe that we can continue to substantially fund our drilling activities from our cash flow and with borrowings under the EEH Credit Agreement. In addition, historically, we have been able to take advantage of the capital markets, as needed, when opportunities arose.
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
We engaged an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, CG&A, to prepare our annual reserve estimates and we have relied on CG&A’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC guidelines.
The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is Mr. W. Todd Brooker, President of CG&A. He graduated with honors from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Brooker is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 83462) and has more than 25 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of oil and natural gas reserves. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Robert J. Anderson, our President, is responsible for reservoir engineering, is a qualified reserve estimator and auditor and is primarily responsible for overseeing CG&A during the preparation of our annual reserve estimates. His professional qualifications meet or exceed the qualifications of reserve estimators and auditors set forth in the “Standards Pertaining to Estimation and Auditing of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. His qualifications include a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Wyoming in 1986; a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Denver in 1988; member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1985; and more than 32 years of practical experience in estimating and evaluating reserve information with more than fifteen of those years being in charge of estimating and evaluating reserves.
We maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which is updated, at least, annually, is assessed for validity when CG&A has technical meetings with our engineers, geologists, operations and land personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and our own set of internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting are assessed for effectiveness annually using criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, (2013 Version) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses,
production taxes and field level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to our internal controls over financial reporting, and they are incorporated in our reserve database as well and verified internally by our personnel to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, CG&A meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to further verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to CG&A so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimates and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by CG&A are reviewed and compared to our internal estimates by our President. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between CG&A and us, and additional data is provided to address the differences. If the supporting documentation will not justify additional changes, the CG&A reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, CG&A will analyze the additional data, and may make changes it solely deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled, the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by CG&A.
Net Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Production, Average Price and Average Production Cost
The net quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold by us for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the average sales price per unit sold and the average production cost per unit are presented below:

Gross and Net Productive Wells
The following table summarizes our gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells by area as of December 31, 2018. A net well represents our percentage of ownership of a gross well.
Acreage
The following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage by state as of December 31, 2018. Net acreage represents our percentage ownership of gross acreage.
The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2018, the portion of our gross and net acreage subject to expiration over the next three years if not successfully developed or renewed.
We have development agreements related to certain of our operated leases in the Midland Basin which require us to drill 30 gross wells (30 net wells) over the next five years. If we do not drill the required wells, we would be in default of the agreements. All of the aforementioned wells are included in management’s five-year development plan. Approximately 75% of the Midland Basin net acreage is held by production and approximately 86% of the Eagle Ford net acreage is held by production. On a combined basis, our total net acreage is approximately 79% held by production.
Exploratory Wells and Development Wells
Set forth below for the two years ended December 31, 2018 is information concerning the number of wells we drilled during the years indicated.
Present Activities
As of March 1, 2019, we had two gross (1.3 net) operated wells and nine gross (0.9 net) non-operated wells in the process of drilling or completing.
