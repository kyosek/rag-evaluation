Mineral Properties
Lida Valley Property
A) Lithium Agreement:
Claims
On May 31, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with GeoXplor Corp. (“Lithium Agreement”). Under this Lithium Agreement, we have been granted an exclusive four year exploration license in regards to the two mineral properties described in the Lithium Agreement. One property encompasses 58 placer claims (9280 acres) located in Lida Valley, Esmeralda County, Nevada for Lithium and Lithium Carbonate exploration (the "Lida Valley Property"), and the other encompasses 70 placer claims (11,200 acres) located in Smokey Valley, Esmeralda County, Nevada for Lithium and Lithium Carbonate exploration (the "Smokey Valley Property"). These requirements apply to both the Lida Valley Property and the Smokey Valley Property, and the Work Program requirements may be allocated to the respective properties at the discretion of the Company. The Lida Valley Property encompasses claims previously included in agreements between the Company and GeoXplor, specifically the Purchase agreement between the Company and GeoXplor dated December 24, 2009. This Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior agreements in respect to those claims.

Lida Valley Claims, Esmeralda County, NV
Location and Access
The Lida Valley Property is located in South Western Nevada, approximately 150 miles north of Las Vegas and within 15 miles of the Montezuma peak. The project area has excellent infrastructure including a network of roads, railroads and cellular telephone coverage.
Regional & Property Geology
Lida Valley is one of a group of inter-mountain basins in west-central Nevada and is surrounded by Cuprite Hills to the Northwest, Stonewall Mountains to the East and Slate Ridge to the Southwest. It has a playa floor of about 12 square miles that receives surface drainage from an area of about 60 square miles. The playa floor contains erosion remnants of Lithium-rich rhyolite tuff and is surrounded by alluvial fan slopes of the mountain ranges. Altitudes range from 4,630 feet on the playa floor to 7,000 feet on the Stonewall Ridge.
The tertiary volcanic rocks are considered to be involved in the origin of the Lithium deposits in south-central Nevada. The volcanism that created the volcanic rocks also provided the heat energy and hydrothermal activity required to mobilize the Lithium from volcanic glass and other relatively unstable minerals. The Tertiary rhyolites from the Montezuma Range and surrounding mountain ranges are considered to be the most lithium rich rhyolites in the world, (MacDonald et. Al; 1992) Transport of the Lithium would require a hydrothermal fluid, surface water or meteoric groundwater. Evaporation concentrated the Lithium in the brine to economic grades which are considered to be in the 100 to 300 ppm range. The Lithium rich water would also alter the playa sediments to form Lithium-rich clays and Lithium rich inclusions in halite.
Exploration
In March of 2010, the Company commissioned a gravity survey on the Lida Valley Property, total cost of $85,287, undertaken by Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc. of Prescott, Arizona, which report was completed in June 2010. The gravity survey was conducted for lithium brine exploration over claims Lida Valley Property. The purpose of the survey was to map depth to bedrock or thickness of sediments, map any geologic structures that may be significant to the occurrence of lithium brine, and provide information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys.
Interpretation of the modeled gravity data indicates several areas with increased bedrock depths or lower bedrock elevations. These areas may be conducive for concentration of lithium-bearing brines, but the presence, dip and continuity of aquifer beds plus the detailed mapping of any structures both within the sedimentary section and bedrock should be determined through high resolution geophysical means prior to drilling.
In order to further detail on the above gravity survey, a 2nd gravity survey was commissioned for a cost of $22,000, which was completed in August 2010.
Based on the positive indicators found from the two gravity survey reports, two geophysical approaches were recommended in areas selected from the gravity surveys: 1) controlled-source audiomagnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSAMT/MT) surveys, and 2) reflection seismic surveys. It was recommended that the CSAMT/MT surveys be conducted because they will determine if conductive zones, possibly indicative of lithium-bearing brines, are present and continuous. Additionally these surveys may help define aquifer dip.
Based on the above recommendation, the Company engaged GeoXplor, in association with Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc., to undertake the CSAMT/MT surveys. The work was completed and a report provided to the Company in February 2011, for a total cost of $112,500. As with the previous two geophysical surveys conducted, the results were positive, and include having identified areas of potential lithium brine deposits. The mapping indicated a geologic stratigraphy and structure relative to the occurrence of lithium brine, and identified conductors that are thought to be representative of lithium-bearing brine, thus providing information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys or the identification of drilling locations.
Collectively, the three reports show several clear targets for further exploratory investigations. Drilling targets in both the southern end of the Property and in the northern area of the playa have been located based on the identification of several areas showing areas of low resistivity. The complete reports from Hasbrouck Geophysics from all exploration stages on the Property are currently available at the Company’s website, www.firstlibertystrategic.com.
Based on these results, in May 2011, the Company determined that the best and most efficient approach is to bypass seismic surveys, and proceed directly to a 3 - 5 hole drilling program, and therefore requested a work program estimate from GeoXplor, which has now been presented to the Company in October 2011. The drill program, estimated at 3000m total, will target areas of significant Lithium brine potential identified by the Company's exploration program (i.e., areas marked by gravity lows and low resistivity) through certain initial holes followed by the remaining holes depending on first results. By penetrating the formations comprising the basin fill in the Lida Valley Property, the drill results will allow the Company to identify the concentration, if any, of Lithium and other constituents in the groundwater in these target zones. GeoXplor Corp., who will perform the drilling, estimates that each hole will require one week's time, with a budgeted cost of $343,000.
The Company is required to undertake a combined total of approximately $1,500,000 worth of work on the Lida Valley Property and Smokey Valley Property prior to December 2014. The next steps for exploration, over the next year, are expected to be the drill program as indicated above. If the results are positive for the drill program, we will base our next phase exploration program on those results, though we would expect additional drilling to be involved.
As of July 31, 2012 and to date, the exploration work undertaken has provided continued positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are as of yet no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Lida Valley Property in order to determine if a commercially viable reserve does exist.
At present, the Company does not have sufficient funds for the planned drill program, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock. While initial arrangements have been made to accomplish the raising of additional funds, and the Company expects to be able to raise the required funds for the next phases of the exploration program, our success in doing so cannot be assured.
Smokey Valley Claims, Esmeralda County, NV
Location and Access
The Smokey Valley Property is also located in South Western Nevada, approximately 170 miles north of Las Vegas and within 15 miles of the Montezuma peak, positioned North-West as opposed to South, as is the Lida Valley Property. The project area, off highway 265 approximately 5 miles from Silver Creek road, the location of the lithium producing Chemetall Foote project, has excellent infrastructure including a network of paved roads, railroads and cellular telephone coverage.
Regional & Property Geology
The Smokey Valley Property, adjacent to Clayton Valley, is also located in one of a group of inter-mountain basins in west-central Nevada and is surrounded by Cuprite Hills to the Northwest, Stonewall Mountains to the East and Slate Ridge to the Southwest. It has a playa floor of an estimated 15 square miles that receives surface drainage from an area of about 140 square miles. The playa floor contains erosion remnants of Lithium-rich rhyolite tuff and is surrounded by alluvial fan slopes of the mountain ranges.
The tertiary volcanic rocks are considered to be involved in the origin of the Lithium deposits in south-central Nevada. The volcanism that created the volcanic rocks also provided the heat energy and hydrothermal activity required to mobilize the Lithium from volcanic glass and other relatively unstable minerals. The Tertiary rhyolites from the Montezuma Range and surrounding mountain ranges are considered to be the most lithium rich rhyolites in the world, (MacDonald et. Al; 1992) Transport of the Lithium would require a hydrothermal fluid, surface water or meteoric groundwater. Evaporation concentrated the Lithium in the brine to economic grades which are considered to be in the 100 to 300 ppm range. The Lithium rich water would also alter the playa sediments to form Lithium-rich clays and Lithium rich inclusions in halite.
Exploration
In the 1970’s USGS conducted a gravity survey covering Clayton Valley and the valley connecting Clayton Valley to Big Smoky where the Smokey Valley Property claims are located. The resulting maps show a relationship between the brine field in Clayton Valley and the deepest parts of the valley. The map also suggests that there is a height of bedrock between the Smoky Valley claims and Clayton Valley which may act as a barrier for water moving from Big Smoky Valley to Clayton Valley. The USGS performed two exploratory drill holes in Big Smoky Valley, (not on Smoky Valley Property) as part of a program to evaluate the lithium resource potential of the basins adjacent to Clayton Valley. Hole BS13 was terminated to 675 feet, Lithium in sediments ranged from 48-365ppm averaging 160ppm, lithium in water ranged from 100-1,700ppb. Hole BS14 was terminated at 215 feet. Lithium in sediments ranged from 40-287ppm, averaging 150ppm, lithium in water ranged from 820-1300ppb. These results were of indicative of the validity of additional work being performed on the Smoky Valley Property.
In February 2011, Hasbrouck Geophysics conducted a preliminary controlled source audio magnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSMAT/MT), the purpose of the survey was to determine if conductors that might be representative of lithium-bearing brine were present near a previously identified low value gravity anomaly. This geophysical survey indicated the presence of predominant zones of lower resistivities, which are interpreted as salty, water-saturated sediments or highly fractured bedrock, of sufficient extent and depth to further warrant additional exploration activity.
In May 2012, First Liberty commissioned a Gravity Survey report at a cost of $74,000, which survey was completed by July 2012.
A total of 116 separate gravity stations were acquired along seven profiles, as shown in Figure 1, at nominal line and station spacings of one kilometer. The station locations were first located on a topographic map, uploaded to a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS), and then staked in the field. Elevations of individual stations were acquired in the field with a Trimble GeoXH GPS unit and confirmed with elevations taken from USGS topographic maps. Because the survey was considered reconnaissance in nature, the generally better than one-half meter elevation accuracies of the stations were considered adequate.
From results of previous modeling conducted in the general area by the report author and other investigators, a density contrast between valley fill sediments and Paleozoic bedrock of 0.5 g/cm3 was chosen to best represent a two-layer case. All lines, except number 1, extended to outcrop at the beginning and/or ending stations and thus the depth to bedrock at those stations was considered as zero for modeling purposes. The middle of survey line number 1 was located near the base of the prominent cinder cone in the area with the idea that bedrock might be near the surface. The most accurate depth modeling results would require bedrock depths from drilling along the line(s) as constraints in the modeling. Since the survey was considered essentially reconnaissance, lines with identified bedrock outcrop at either or both ends were considered sufficiently accurate for the purposes of the survey.
There are two main factors that must be considered regarding target areas for lithium mineralization and concentration: 1) where is the source of the lithium, and 2) does a basin environment exist for the concentration of the lithium transported by meteoric water from the source In the Clayton Valley region it is thought that the source of the lithium is the dark gray lithium enriched rhyolite tuffs that outcrop near Montezuma Peak. Once lithium has been liberated into the water system it remains highly mobile and movement of the lithium with surface water and groundwater will follow basic hydrological principles. Hydrologic basins in Nevada consist of basin fill underlain by either low-permeability or permeable rock with water movement through the basin fill, permeable rock and along faults. Nothing more complex than a topographic low or closed basin is required to concentrate lithium-bearing water. For topographic lows with larger catchment areas there is a greater opportunity to accumulate lithium from wider sources. The water trapped in these lows may move through dipping aquifers until it reaches an impermeable barrier such as a fault scarp.
The complete Bouguer gravity map shown in Figure 2 is contoured from the total 116 stations, using Golden Software’s Surfer computer program (version 10.7.972), with a Bouguer slab density of 2.67 g/cm3. The bedrock depth map can be thought of as a thickness of sediments map, but because the surface elevation within the gravity survey area varies then the bedrock elevation map can often be more useful for identification of low bedrock areas.
If one reasonably assumes that lithium source material and transport mechanisms for this gravity survey area are present and similar to those that have supplied Clayton Valley lithium-bearing brines then areas with lower bedrock elevations (i.e., bedrock topographic lows) may be conducive to increased lithium-bearing brines concentration. Increased bedrock depth, or increased sedimentary thickness, and lower bedrock elevations that form a basin are present in the approximate middle of the survey area. This bedrock topographic low appears to be closed off to the south, but remains open to the north. The deepest portion of the bedrock low is modeled as about 1,850 meters below ground surface (bgs), or approximately -300 meters elevation, along line 7. Because no drilling results are available to those depths, the gravity modeling depths should be considered approximate. However, it is important that the gravity modeling results indicate the presence of a deep basin that
extends over a large area particularly if an arbitrary depth of 600 meters is chosen to represent the boundaries of the basin. With such a large catchment area there is a greater opportunity to accumulate lithium from wider sources. On both the bedrock depth and elevation maps it appears that an additional small, closed basin at a depth of about 900 meters is present near the eastern one-third of line 3 (essentially centered between stations 313 and 314). Somewhat similarly, an anomalous area is present at about the western one-third of line 4 (near station 405) and also approximately three to four kilometers from the western beginning of line 7 (between about stations 705 and 706). These additional anomalous areas may or may not be related to the main bedrock topographic low. From these profiles (either A-A’ or BA’) it is apparent that significantly shallower bedrock is located at the southern end of the geophysically surveyed area, while the bedrock continues to deepen to the northern extent of the survey area.
Based on the interpretation of the modeled gravity data indicates a large topographic low, or basin, that appears to be closed off to the south but remains open to the north. This extensive basin area may be favorable for the accumulation of lithium-bearing brines, but additional investigations need to be conducted. Additional geophysical surveys will further determine the structure of the basin identified in this survey, and map the presence, dip and continuity of conductive zones within the basin.
Recommended additional geophysical surveys prior to drilling are: 1) extend the gravity survey along line 1 to the west and east and add one additional line one kilometer south of line 1 to better define the indicated southern basin closure, 2) acquire additional gravity data along at least two lines to the north, separated by one kilometer each, to determine if the basin closes in that direction, and 3) conduct controlled-source audio-magnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSAMT / MT) surveys in selected areas from the gravity survey(s) to determine if conductive zones, possibly indicative of lithium-bearing brines, are present and if so then to map the dip and continuity of those aquifer beds. It is estimated that to satisfy items number 1 and 2 above that approximately 60 additional gravity stations will be required. It is anticipated that nominally 100 CSAMT / MT stations will be sufficient to satisfy item number 3 above. After additional gravity data and new CSAMT / MT data are acquired, processed and interpreted then either reflection seismic surveys or drilling can be conducted. The reflection seismic surveys will detail any possible lithium-bearing brines beds (e.g., similar to the Main Ash and Lower Gravel Aquifers, amongst others, in Clayton Valley) and will map structure in greater detail than the other geophysical techniques.
At present, the Company does not have sufficient funds for the planned additional exploration program, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock. While initial arrangements have been made to accomplish the raising of additional funds, and the Company expects to be able to raise the required funds for the next phases of the exploration program, our success in doing so cannot be assured.
B) Uravan Claims, San Juan Country, Utah (“Van-Ur Property”)
A property purchase agreement for claims located in San Juan County, Utah, for Vanadium and Uranium exploration (the “Van-Ur Agreement”). In regards to the Van-Ur Agreement, the Company was required to:

The initial 250,000 shares due and payable under the Van-Ur Agreement were issued in in June 2011. The remaining 250,000 shares were not issued, as a result of the assignment of the Van-Ur Agreement to New America Energy Corp. as described below, and no further share issuances are required.
3.
Comply with a work commitment of $1,000,000 within four years of the date of the Van-Ur Agreement.
a.
A total of $20,974 was expended on exploration and claim maintenance activities prior to the assignment of the Van-Ur Agreement to New America Energy Corp. as described below. No further payments are required.
On February 3, 2011, we entered into and closed agreements with New America Energy Corp. (“New America”) and GeoXplor Inc. (“NECA Agreement”), whereby the Company optioned its interest in the mining claims associated with the Van-Ur Agreement, granting an option, as well as exploration rights, in these claims to New America. Pursuant to the terms of the NECA Agreement, the consideration to the Company for entering into this agreement with New America was as follows:
1.
$10,000 on the execution of the NECA Agreement; $33,333 within 120 days of the execution of the NECA Agreement; $33,333 within 240 days of the execution of the NECA Agreement; and $33,334 within 360 days of the execution of the NECA Agreement;
a.
The amount of $10,000 was received by the Company on February 8, 2011
2.
500,000 shares of New America common stock
a.
These shares were issued to the Company on February 11, 2011. The fair value of the shares was recorded as an investment in the amount of $250,000 based on the trading price of the shares at the time of issuance, which was $0.50 per share. The value of these shares is to be periodically reviewed and adjusted as required.
3.
A 0.5% net smelter royalty on all net revenue derived from production.
Subject to New America fulfilling the terms of the NECA Agreement, the Company was not required to meet its obligations under the Van-Ur Agreement, including the December 24, 2010 payment of $100,000 (deferred until February 7, 2011) and all future payments, work program commitments, and stock issuances including the December 24, 2010 issuance for 250,000 shares.
Pursuant to the terms of the Van-Ur Agreement, New America made cash payments in the amount of $10,000, and issued 500,000 shares of common stock to the Company and made cash payments in the amount of $50,000 and issued 500,000 shares of common stock to GeoXplor.
The value of the mining property asset associated with this agreement has been divested from the Company’s financial statements, and as of July 31, 2012, the Company has recorded the gain on the transfer of the mineral property option in the amount of $75,000.
The payment of $33,333 due to the Company on June 3, 2011 and the payment of $50,000 due to GeoXplor on May 31, 2011 pursuant to the Van-Ur Agreement were not paid as due. The parties to the agreement verbally agreed to extend the payment due dates by 120 days and on August 1, 2011, with an effective date of May 31, 2011, the parties executed an extension agreement. Under the terms of the extension agreement, during the 120 day extension period commencing from May 31, 2011, GeoXplor had the right to solicit and accept offers by other parties on the property, in which case the Van-Ur Agreement would be terminated and neither New America nor the Company would have any further rights or interest in the Uravan property. At any time prior to the expiration of the 120 day term either NECA or the Company could pay the required payments to GeoXplor. If neither NECA nor the Company paid the required payments under the agreement then the property would revert to GeoXplor unless further extended.
The extension agreement lapsed on September 30, 2011, with neither New America nor the Company making any additional payments; therefore the claims fully reverted back to GeoXplor Corp. The Company has no further obligations in respect of the original Van-Ur Agreement or the assignment thereof.
Location and Access
The Uravan Property is located in the northeast corner of San Juan County approximately 40 miles southeast of Moab, Utah. The area is sparsely populated with a small village of La Sal, Utah, about 10 miles west of the claim block. Utah Highway 46, an all-weather paved road provides access to the southern region of the mineral claims. A network of forests roads, drill access roads and jeep trails make most of the claim block accessible year round.
The climate of San Juan County is semi-arid with minor precipitation. The average annual precipitation is 12.83 inches with an average snowfall of 44.5 inches. The snowfalls during November to May occasionally reach 15 inches or more. The Uravan Property is located in the high desert ecosystem with erosional landscape exposing the sandstone formations. Deep canyons with canyon walls composed of alternating erosion-resistant benches and highly erodible slopes, and broad flat benches are the predominant landscape features. Vegetation consists of greasewood, salt bush, rabbit bush with willows and cottonwood in the drainage area.
Regional & Property Geology
The Uravan Mineral claims are located within the Colorado Plateau near the Utah-Colorado border. The Colorado Plateau is a broad area of regional uplift consisting mainly of flat-lying Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. The strata is gently folded and faulted by uplift, intrusion and collapse of plastic evaporite formations on the east and by intrusion of laccolithic complexes now composing the La Sal Mountains on the west.
The uranium-vanadium deposits in the La Sal quadrangle occur in the uppermost sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The ore bearing sandstone range in thickness from a few feet to 100 feet. The sandstone is a medium to fine grained quartzose interbedded with siltstone and mudstone. Near the uranium-vanadium mineralization, the sandstone is white, light gray or light brown, and the siltstone and mudstone are usually light green or gray green.
The uranium-vanadium deposits mined in the nearby producing mines occur in the uppermost sandstone beds within the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation. This unit is commonly called the ore-bearing sandstone or third rim in reference to its position above the Entrada Sandstone.
The ore-bearing sandstone is composed of a single broad lens of cross-laminated sandstone ranging from 0 to 30 feet in thickness. In other areas it is composed of overlapping sandstone lenses which have a combined thickness of 30 to 100 feet. The cross-laminated sandstone appears to have been deposited in a flood-plain environment. Scour and fill bedding consisting of cross-bedded sandstone lenses truncated by and direct contact with other truncated lenses separated by thin discontinuous mudstone lenses or mudstone conglomerate. Fragments of fossil wood are abundant in the scour and fill beds and occur either along the bedding planes or in pot like masses called “trash pockets”.
Exploration
A radon survey was completed on the Uravan Mineral Claims during September, 2009. The theory of radon soil surveys is based on the element radon which is a radioactive daughter product of uranium decay. Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium, a product of uranium and thorium decay in rocks and soils. Theoretically, radon-222 concentrations in soil should be directly related to the uranium content of the minerals in the soil and rocks. Radon is a daughter product of uranium-238 and a non-reactive, highly mobile gas that migrates away from the site of its uranium parent by diffusion and advection along joints, faults, and intergranular permeable pathways.
The magnitude of a radon anomaly associated with a parent concentration of uranium will be due to the size and grade of the parent body. Dispersion and dilution along the pathways to the surface increase the size of the radon footprint but also reduce the magnitude. The location of the anomaly relative to the uranium body will be strongly influenced by the orientation of the pathways to the surface.
The radon survey uses a system that measures the radon by utilizing an ion chamber with a electrically charged Teflon, called an electret, located inside an electrically conducting plastic chamber of known air volume. The electrets serve as a source of high voltage needed for the chamber to operate as an ion chamber. It also serves as a sensor for the measurement of ionization in air. The ions produced inside the sensitive volume of the chamber are collected by the electrets causing a depletion of charge. The measurement of the depleted charge during the exposure period is a measure of integrated ionization during the measurement period. The electrets charge is read before and after the exposure using a specially built non-contact electret voltage reader.
The Uravan mineral claims radon survey consisted of 101 readings with a minimum reading of 0.35 and a maximum reading of 27.75. The median reading was 6.75 with a midrange of 14.05. The grid results were then contoured and presented in the attached report. Proposed drill locations have also been located and presented on the following map.
The preliminary radon survey data indicates an anomalous east-west radiometric trend. The size of the anomalies appears to be similar to the size of the high grade vanadium-uranium beds mined from the Firefly, Gray Daun and Vanadium Queen Mine. A detailed radon survey would define drill targets and thereby, delineate tonnage and grade within the Uravan Claim Block.
Data compiled from mining activity and regional studies indicates ground considered favorable for Vanadium-Uranium mineralization has the following features:
•
Sandstone beds over 30 feet in thickness with a light brown to light gray color with a medium to fine grain size.
•
The sandstone contains carbonaceous material and a gray or grayish-green mudstone.
•
The beds contain mudstone as a film, pebbles or seams.
•
The sandstone is overlain by gray, greenish-gray or green mudstone
As of July 31, 2011, the exploration conducted to date has provided positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Van-Ur Property.
As the Company is no longer in possession of this property as at July 31, 2012, the provided data is for historical reference only.
