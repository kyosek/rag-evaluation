Resource Properties
As at October 31, 2009, the Company currently o wns
a 32% gross working interest in 13 wells; a 45% gross working interest in 7 wells; and a 60% gross working interest in 43 wells (of which 38 remain to be drilled); all located in Mississippi under various agreements with Griffin and Griffin Exploration, L.L.C. The most significant of these wells are the producing oil wells PP-1 and PP-3 located within the Belmont Lake oil field which is itself located in the Palmetto Point region. The Belmont Lake oil field is onshore, as are all of the Company’s wells, but located in a flood plain of the Mississippi River which forces seasonal constraints on certain field activities. Additional details of these interests are noted below and not all of these wells were successful.
A description of the Company’s Palmetto Point Project and Frio-Wilcox Project follow. For a description of the Company’s other properties, please see the section titled “Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions”.
Mississippi: Palmetto Point Project
On December 21, 2005, the Company agreed to purchase a 20% gross working and revenue interest in a 10 well drilling program in Palmetto Point, Mississippi owned by Griffin & Griffin Exploration (“Griffin”) for cash payments of $700,000, comprised of $220,000 paid upon entering the Agreement and the remaining balance of $480,000 paid on January 17, 2006. The Company applied the full cost method to account for its oil and gas properties and as of July 31, 2009, seven wells were found to be proved wells, and three wells were found impaired. One of the wells was impaired due to uneconomic life, and the other two wells were abandoned due to no apparent gas or oil shows present. The costs of impaired properties were added to the capitalized cost in determination of the depletion expense. Palmetto Point is approximately 150 miles southwest of Jackson, Mississippi and approximately 50 miles north/northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It is 30 miles west of Woodville, Mississippi off of State Highway 33 and is entirely within Wilkinson County.
There were no further costs to the Company in earning its interest in the 10 well drilling program, including well development costs or pipeline connections. Griffin has agreed that the leases held by it covering any mineral estate underlying the applicable well site acreage shall not provide for more than twenty-five (25%) percent royalty and overriding royalty interest. The Company’s net interest in any oil and gas produced is calculated by subtracting the applicable royalties from its 20% gross interest. Consequently, its original net working interest in the drilling program was a minimum fifteen (15%) percent net working interest. Griffin conducted the Drilling Program in its capacity as Operator and receives a 15% carried interest.
One of these original 10 wells was the PP-1 well, which was the discovery well of a field now known as the Belmont Lake field. All of these original 10 wells were targeting the Frio geological formation of the Cenozoic era and Oligocene series, which is characterized in this region as a generally shallow, sandstone-rich layer. In this area of Mississippi, the Frio geologic formation is generally found between 2,000 and 4,500 foot depth from surface.
On September 22, 2006, the Company elected to participate in an additional two-well program in Palmetto Point, Mississippi owned by Griffin by paying an additional $140,000 (paid). The Company earned the same 20% gross interest in the two (2) additional wells (12 wells total and all drilled) and subsequently increased its gross interest to 32% in these 12 wells, or a net revenue interest of 20.802815%. As of July 31, 2009, the two wells were found to be proved wells.
On June 23, 2007, the Company acquired an assignment of a 10% gross working interest in the Palmetto Point wells described above from a third party for $520,000 which was payable by a secured loan. The $520,000 loan was valued at a Net Present Value of $501,922, which is the capitalized amount. The Company calculated the net present value of the secured loan payable by applying 8% interest rate, which was based on a T-bill rate of 4.28% plus a risk premium.
On October 4, 2007, the Company elected to participate in the drilling of the PP-3 well in Palmetto Point, Mississippi which was conducted by Griffin. This well was the second well drilled in the Belmont Lake oil field. The Company had a 30% gross working interest and paid $266,348. On July 31, 2008, the Company accrued and paid an additional cost of $127,707 for the workovers of wells PP and PP-3. PP has had intermittent production from October 2007, and PP-3 has had intermittent production from November 2007.
On April 3, 2009, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Delta Oil & Gas, Inc., and The Stallion Group to acquire additional interests in its existing core producing Mississippi oil and gas properties. The Company paid $40,073.39 to acquire an additional two percent (2%) working interest in the proven Belmont Lake oil and gas field and an additional 10% working interest in potential nearby exploration wells. Total working interest for Belmont Lake as of July 31, 2009 is 32%; and total working interest in the exploration wells on approximately 140,000 acres surrounding Belmont Lake in all directions as of October 31, 2009, is 60%.
As of October 31, 2009, the Company accrued and paid an additional $129,402 for additional interest and workovers of wells PP and PP-3.
As of December 24, 2009, the status of the Palmetto Point, Mississippi wells is as follows:
Mississippi and Louisiana: Frio-Wilcox Project
After participating in the Palmetto Point project, the Company entered into a separate agreement that expanded both its percentage interest in future wells, and also expanded the geographical area on which those wells could be drilled.
On August 3, 2006, the Company entered into a Phase II agreement with Griffin, to acquire a working interest in multiple zones of potential oil and gas production in Mississippi and Louisiana. This agreement contemplates up to a 50 well drill program, which are exclusive to the participants, for Wilcox and Frio wells, at the Company’s option, within the defined area of mutual interest (“AMI”). From these 50 prospects, Griffin and the participants will select all drill locations with the expectation that the wells will be drilled to depths sufficient to test prospectively for producible hydrocarbons from the top of the Frio Formation to the bottom of the Wilcox Formation.
These 50 wells are in addition to all wells drilled under the original 10-well agreement and also in addition to any development wells to be drilled at the Belmont Lake oil field discovery. The AMI includes over 200,000 gross acres located non-contiguously between Southwest Mississippi and North East Louisiana which include the approximately 32,000 acres of the Palmetto Point area but also include other areas.
The Company had contracted to assume a 40% gross interest in this AMI, meaning it was obligated to pay 40% of costs related to licensing, permitting, drilling, completion and all other related costs. Upon payment of 40% of the costs, the Company earned a net 32% of all production from all producible zones to the base of the Frio formation (Frio Targets); and, 30% of all production to the base of the Wilcox formation (Wilcox Targets). All working interests are to be registered in the name of the Company. This 50-well AMI is intended to be drilled in several stages.
The Company’s pro rate share of the first stage had a total cost $1.6 million. As of October 31 2007, the Company had placed $1,600,000 in trust to completely fund this initial commitment. During the drill program, an unrelated third party participant elected not to continue their participation in the program, and we assumed our pro-rata portion of their 10% gross working interest as our own, at no additional cost, bringing our total gross working interest in the seven (7) wells and their leases (Initial AMI Drilling Program), to 45%.
On June 21, 2007, the Company acquired an additional 10% from a third party for all rights, title and benefits excluding the seven wells drilled under the AMI Agreement between August 3, 2006 and June 19, 2007, specifically wells CMR-USA-39-14, Dixon #1, Faust #1 TEC, CMR/BR, RB Red Bug #2, BR, and Randall #1, and any offset wells that could be drilled to any of these specified wells (Subsequent AMI Drilling Program). This brought our interest in the remaining 43 wells to 50% and we drilled 5 wells under this arrangement.
On April 3, 2009, the Company acquired an additional 10% working interest in the 38 exploration wells remaining to be drilled, bringing its total gross working interest to 60% in the 38 wells that remain to be drilled of this original 50-well option in over 140,000 acres surrounding Belmont Lake in all directions.
On August 28, 2009, the Company entered into four separate assignment agreements, three of which were with people or companies with related management. The Company received from these four parties proceeds of $371,608.57 to fund additional interests in this well. As a result, the Company has a 25.84% perpetual gross interest in the well (18.0% net revenue interest); as well as a 5.2% net revenue interest in the non-consent interest. The non-consent interest remains valid until such time as the well produces 500% of all costs and expenses back to the participants in the form of revenue, at which time the non-consent interest ends. Golden Aria Corp, a company with related management, has acquired from Lexaria a 6.16% perpetual gross interest in the 12-4 well; David DeMartini, a director of Lexaria, has acquired from Lexaria a 5% gross interest in the non-consent interest in the 12-4 well; and 0743868 BC Ltd. a company owned by the President of the Company, has acquired from Lexaria a 11.6% gross interest in the non-consent interest in the 12-4 well.
Initial AMI Drilling Program
The Company’s pro rate share of the first stage had a total cost $1.6 million. As of October 31 2007, the Company had placed $1,600,000 in trust to completely fund this initial commitment. During the drill program, an unrelated third party participant elected not to continue their participation in the program, and we assumed our pro-rata portion of their 10% gross working interest as our own, at no additional cost, bringing our total gross working interest in these seven (7) drilled wells and their leases, to 45%.
The Company successfully drilled and completed seven (7) wells under this drilling program. Certain wells were placed into production.
Details of the drill program are outlined below:
In December 2006, the first well CMR-US 39-14 was found to have sufficient hydrocarbons to become economic. USA 1-37 and BR had started intermittent production from November 2007. The Company applied the full cost method to account for its oil and gas properties.
As at January 31, 2007, the Company abandoned Dixon #1 due to no economic hydrocarbons being present and $162,420 of drilling costs was added to the capitalized costs. The Dixon #1 was the only Wilcox well the Company has drilled to date. Every other well it has participated in located in Mississippi and Louisiana is a Frio well. Slightly deeper than the Frio targets, but also of the Cenozoic era, the Wilcox geologic formation is of the Eocene series, generally found at depths of less than 8,000 feet.
On June 2, 2007, the Company abandoned Randall #1 and $107,672 drilling costs were added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
During August to October 2007, three additional wells, PP, PP, and PP were drilled in the area. These Frio wells were abandoned due to modest gas shows and a total of $306,562 drilling costs was added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
During December 2007, two additional wells, PPA and PP, were drilled and were plugged and abandoned due to non-economic gas shows. A total of $247,086 drilling costs were added to the capitalized costs in determination of depletion expense.
The results of the initial drill program are as follows:
Subsequent AMI Drilling Program
As of April 30, 2008, five additional wells were drilled under the 50-well AMI. Each of these wells encountered non commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and were plugged and abandoned.
Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions

The Company wrote down the cost of the property to a nominal value of $1 as the future realization of the property is uncertain.
Subsequent to the year end, the Company’s working interest in Strachan Leduc Reef property has expired.
Option Agreement
On April 17, 2008, the Company entered into an option purchase agreement with a third party for a non-refundable fee of $25,000 (paid). Pursuant to the option agreement, the Company had the exclusive right and option to purchase on the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement all of the right, title and interest of every kind and nature set forth and established in that certain operating agreement dated January 5, 2006 covering the joint development as defined in Section I of said agreement, being a 50% working interest in those certain oil and gas fields commonly known as Palmetto Point and Belmont Lake. The purchase would include the total current 13 existing wells and lease associated with those 13 wells and all potential future wells drilled on any of these leases are included in this Option Agreement and defined as:,,,,,,-2,,,-1,B,A and-3. The option was irrevocable for a period of 60 days from the date hereof and the contemplated purchase price was US$4,500,000 at the time the option is exercised.
On June 2, 2008, the option agreement was amended to provide until June 30, 2008 to close the proposed transaction; for the Company to pay an additional $25,000 non-refundable deposit; and to adjust the total purchase price to US $4,689,000 at the time the option is exercised.
The amended option agreement has since expired and the contemplated purchase did not occur.
Production and Prices
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil and natural gas, and certain price and cost information for fiscal years ended October 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
Productive Wells
The following table summarizes information at October 31, 2009, relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, but specifically exclude wells drilled and cased during the fiscal year that have yet to be tested for completion (e.g., all of the operated wells drilled by the Company during this year have been cased in preparation for completion, but no operations have been initiated that would allow these wells to be productive). Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests in the gross wells.
Unaudited Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
The unaudited reserve estimates for Mississippi, as of October 31, 2009, were prepared by Veazey & Associates, an independent petroleum engineering firm.
The estimated proved reserves prepared by Veazey and Associates are summarized in the table below, in accordance with definitions and pricing requirements as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Prices paid for oil and natural gas vary widely depending upon the quality such as the Btu content of the natural gas, gravity of the oil, sulfur content and location of the production related to the refinery or pipelines.
There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating proved reserve quantities and in projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. In addition, reserve estimates of new discoveries that have little production history are more imprecise than those of properties with more production history. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed oil and gas reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Unaudited net quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil and natural gas (all located within United States) are as follows:
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas and oil reserves is as follows:
Year-end price per Mcf of natural gas used in making standardized measure determinations as of October 31, 2009 was $4.15. Year-end price per Bbl of oil used in making these same calculations was $73.00.
Estimated Net quantities of Natural Gas and Oil Reserves:
The following table sets forth our proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed reserves at the end of October 31, 2009.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth the undeveloped and developed acreage, by area, held by us as of October 31, 2009. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Developed acres are acres, which are spaced or assignable to productive wells. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which we have a working interest. Net acreage is obtained by multiplying gross acreage by our working interest percentage in the properties. The table does not include acreage in which we have a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects, or any other acreage for which we have not yet received leasehold assignments.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth our drilling activity during the years ended October 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
