Item 2. Properties. - ------- -----------
General: - --------
At September 30, 1996 the Trust had total invested assets of $39,015,000. The invested assets included $38,896,000 of properties held for sale and $119,000 of real estate mortgage loans.
The Trust's $38,896,000 of properties held for sale at September 30, 1996 included the following: eight office buildings with a carrying value of $20,304,000; five commercial properties with a carrying value of $18,552,000; and one investment in land with a carrying value of $40,000. Carrying value represents amounts included in the Trust's Statement of Financial Condition at September 30, 1996 after depreciation and the valuation reserve. On September 24, 1996 the Trustees of the Trust announced that they unanimously voted to recommend a Plan for the Orderly Liquidation (the "Plan") of the Trust. Since the Trust had previously adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" ("SFAS No. 121") the Trust, effective September 30, 1996, classified all real estate owned as "Properties held for sale." A review of the properties at September 30, 1996 determined that four properties required a valuation reserve, as the market values, less cost to sell, of these properties were less than their carrying value. Therefore a valuation reserve of $3,307,000 was established. In determining the estimated net sales prices the Trust applied an estimated capitalization rate to the individual properties' cash flow. The Trust did not deem it necessary to obtain appraisals of any of its properties.
Management will from time to time undertake a major renovation of a Property in order to keep it competitive within its market. Currently, the Cannon West Shopping Center located in Austin, Texas is having a trench drain installed at a cost of approximately $150,000. This work is being done in order to combat a sub-soil problem at the property. Management believes that the installation of this trench drain will alleviate the problem. The cost of this work will be reported in the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997. Additionally, Management is reviewing plans for the installation of new store fronts at Tiffany Plaza, a shopping center located in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The current estimated cost of this work is $250,000. If the Trust proceeds with this work it should begin in the spring of 1997.
In the opinion of Management, all Properties in the Trust's portfolio are adequately covered by insurance. Additionally, Management believes all properties are suitable and adequate for their intended use.
The amount of leverage varies among the Properties which the Trust owns. At September 30, 1996 two of the Trust's Properties were leveraged with long-term non-recourse individual mortgage financing and one property was leveraged with a $2,612,000 loan of which the first $750,000 is recourse and the balance is non-recourse. Additionally, as of September 30, 1996 six of the Trust's remaining investments serve as collateral for the Trust's bank notes payable.
At September 30, 1996 the Trust owned two real estate mortgage loans with a total balance of $119,000. Both loans are purchase money mortgages received by the Trust in connection with sales of vacant land in Akron, Ohio. The first was a $290,000 loan received in connection with the $834,000 March, 1994 sale of 70 acres. The second was a $212,000 loan received in connection with the $212,000 May, 1994 sale of 17.7697 acres.

(A) At September 30, 1996 the Trust had 338 tenants under lease in its office buildings (excluding the Littleton Bank Bldg., Littleton Colorado which was sold October 7, 1996), and its commercial properties, all of which are shopping centers, with Triangle Square also having mini-warehouse facilities behind the retail area (excluding the mini warehouses at Triangle Square). These tenants are under leases of one year or more. Additionally, the Trust had 215 month-to-month leases for mini-warehouse spaces at Triangle Square.
(B) The following lists individually those tenants who occupy 10,000 square feet or more, and whose original lease terms expire five years or more from September 30, 1996. Seventeen (17) other tenants occupy less than 10,000 square feet and have leases which expire in five years or more from September 30, 1996. These are grouped together and shown as "Others" on the table below:
All leases listed on the table are subject to an annual adjustment in rent based on the increase or decrease in the operating expenses of the Property.
The annual base rents of the tenants listed in the table equal 30% of the total 1996 rental income, and these tenants occupy 496,000 square feet (45%) of the total 1,100,000 square feet (excluding the Littleton Bank Bldg. which was sold October 7, 1996) currently occupied. The remaining 604,000 square feet are occupied by 307 tenants. These tenants' leases expire during the next five years. The loss of rentals from any one of these leases, if the Trust would not be able to renew or replace, would not have a significant effect on the Trust's operations.
(C) The following is the only tenant who occupies 50% or more of a Property: Englewood Bank Building -- Bank One, Denver -- 108,000 sq. ft. (84%).

(D) The Littleton Bank Building was sold on October 7, 1996. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $563,000 which will be reported in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 1997.
(E) ENGLEWOOD BANK BUILDING. The Englewood Bank Building is located in Englewood, Colorado. The building contains 10 stories and is suitable and adequate for its use as a bank and office building.
The main tenant is Bank One, Denver which occupies 84% of the building. The balance of the building is primarily leased to small service or professional organizations for use as general offices. The Trust's policy is to sign leases of three to five years in order to take advantage of changes in the market.
The Trust has been notified by the City of Englewood that the City has recently passed a law that would require the Trust to install a sprinkler system and fire pull stations on every floor of this property. The law requires that this work be done over a five (5) year period starting in 1997. The Trust is currently reviewing all of its options relating to this required work. At this time the Trust does not have any estimates as to the costs that would be involved in undertaking this work. Other than this required work there are no other significant renovations planned for this property beyond normal maintenance and repairs and tenant improvements done in conjunction with the leasing of space.
The Englewood Bank Building is subject to limited direct competition from comparable office projects in the general vicinity. There is only one competing high-rise office building in the area of similar size, quality, condition and location to the Englewood Bank Building. Other competing projects consist of low-rise office buildings and converted retail space generally considered to be of lesser quality.
The occupancy rates for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1992 through 1996 were as follows: 89% in 1992, 91% in 1993, 98% in 1994, 97% in 1995 and 1996 . The Property's average rental rate per occupied square foot for the same period was $6.65 in 1992, $6.69 in 1993, $6.80 in 1994, $6.63 in 1995, and $6.67 in 1996.
Bank One, Denver is the only tenant occupying over 10% of the rentable space. Its annual rent is currently $974,000 but is subject to an annual adjustment based on increases or decreases in property expenses. This lease expires September 30, 2005 and has six ten-year renewal options available.
Based upon leases in place at September 30, 1996 lease expirations for the next ten fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 are as follows:

The 1996 real estate taxes are not yet known.
(F) EXECUTIVE CLUB BUILDING. The Executive Club Building is located in Denver, Colorado. The building contains eleven floors and has a health club, which includes a swimming pool, located in the basement. The building is suitable and adequate for its use as an office building.
Space in the building is leased to service and professional organizations for use as general offices. The Trust's policy is to sign new leases with new and renewal tenants for periods of three to five years in order to take advantage of changes in the market.
Presently, the Trust has no plans for any significant renovations of the property beyond normal maintenance and repairs and tenant improvements done in conjunction with the leasing of space within the Property.
There are numerous office buildings in the direct vicinity, some of higher quality, and numerous projects of similar age, condition and quality that directly compete with the Executive Club Building. The Trust believes that the advantage that this building has is that the building caters to small tenant users, while the majority of the properties in the area prefer larger tenants.
Occupancy for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1992 through 1996 was as follows: 92% in 1992; 97% in 1993 and 1994; 93% in 1995 and 73% in 1996. The Property's average rental rates per occupied square foot for the same periods were: $9.69 in 1992; $9.55 in 1993; $10.15 in 1994; $11.63 in 1995 and $11.78 in 1996.

The depreciable tax basis was $1,862,000 at September 30, 1996. The 1995 real estate taxes for the Property were $79,693 based on a millage rate of $8.1161 per $1,000 of assessed value.

(G) PETROLEUM CLUB BUILDING. The Petroleum Club Building is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The building contains sixteen floors with an attached four level parking garage which is leased out to American Parking for an annual rent plus a percentage rent determined at the end of each year and offers valet, self parking both covered and uncovered. The building is suitable and adequate for its use as an office building.
The main tenant is The Petroleum Club which occupies the top four floors. The balance of the building is leased to service and professional organizations for use as general offices. The Trust's policy is to sign new leases with new and renewal tenants for periods of three to five years in order to take advantage of changes in the market.
Presently, the Trust has no plans for any significant renovations of the property beyond normal maintenance and repairs and tenant improvements done in conjunction with the leasing of space within the Property.
This property is located in the downtown area of Tulsa and, as such, there are numerous office buildings in the direct vicinity, some of higher quality, and numerous projects of similar age, condition and quality that directly compete with the Petroleum Club Building. The floor size of this property is only 7,800 square feet and as such the Trust can offer small tenants a substantial portion of a floor without the tenant competing with larger tenants who usually dominate downtown office space. Despite the stagnate economy of Tulsa, which depends primarily on the oil and gas industry, the Trust has made strides in recent years in increasing the occupancy of this property. One recent benefit has been the Petroleum Clubs willingness to open its membership to others outside of the petroleum industry. The majority of the tenants in the building now belong to the Club.
Occupancy for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1992 through 1996 was as follows: 75% in 1992; 72% in 1993; 78% in 1994; 81% in 1995; and 82% in 1996. The property's average rental rates per occupied square foot for the same periods were: $8.47 in 1992; $8.69 in 1993; $7.84 in 1994; $8.22 in 1995; and $8.84 in 1996.

This property originally was composed of nine single story buildings. Four of the buildings were sold in November, 1992. Two more buildings were sold September 30, 1996. All six buildings were sold to the same buyer. The remaining three buildings all have exterior entrances for the tenants, with no common areas.
Space in the buildings is leased to small businesses, the majority of which are just commencing operations. The Trust's policy is to sign three to five year leases with both new and renewal tenants with the tenant being responsible for all services within their space, such as, electricity and cleaning.
Presently, the Trust has no plans for any significant renovations of the property beyond normal maintenance and repairs and tenant improvements done in conjunction with the leasing of space within the Property.
There are similar properties in the immediate area of this Property. The surrounding area features restaurants, a bowling alley, and a chiropractic college. Since this property is primarily leased to first time businesses, there is significant turnover. The Trust believes that these three buildings will be purchased by the same buyer who purchased the other six buildings.

There are numerous office buildings in the direct vicinity, some of higher quality, and numerous projects of similar age, style, condition and quality that directly compete with the Brookside Office Building. As stated above, with several tenants desiring to expand the Trust believes that the size of the Property will be the only drawback in retaining tenants. Since the Property is new to the Trust's portfolio it remains to be seen what other competitive actions will be needed in the future to keep the Property at 100% occupied at a competitive rate.

The Property is subject to direct competition in its immediate trade area. There are several grocery anchored shopping centers located on both Dodge Street and John F. Kennedy Blvd. (this Property is located on the corner of these two streets). Across the street from the Property is a mall, which the Trust does not consider competition. Additionally, there is both a K-Mart and Wal-mart in the area which compete with the Target store. For both 1994 and 1995 this Property was 100% occupied, dropping to 98% for 1996. The Trust attributes this high occupancy for the past two years to both the grocery store and the Target Store. Both of these stores have been recently remodeled and expanded at the cost of the stores.

(P) TIFFANY PLAZA SHOPPING CENTER. The Tiffany Plaza Shopping Center is a grocery-anchored neighborhood strip center located in Ardmore, Oklahoma. Tiffany Plaza's main tenants operate retail businesses. The Property is suitable and adequate for its use as a strip shopping center.
The Trust is reviewing plans for the installation of new store fronts at the Property. The Trust believes that the Property, which was constructed in 1975, has begun to look old and that the new store fronts will give the center a new look. The estimated cost of this work is $250,000. If the Trust proceeds with this work it should begin in the spring of 1997. No other renovation work beyond normal maintenance and repairs and tenant improvements done in conjunction with the leasing of space within the Property is planned.
The main competition for this center is a mall and a Wal-mart center, both of which are located more than a mile away from Tiffany Plaza.
