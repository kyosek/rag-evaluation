Fiscal 2015 renewals
Approximately 6% of the Company’s gross leasable area, consisting of six leases totaling 778,702 square feet, were scheduled to expire during fiscal 2015. The Company has renewed all six leases, or 100% of the gross leasable area that were scheduled to expire during fiscal 2015.

The table below summarizes the lease terms of the six leases which were renewed and includes both the tenant improvement costs and the leasing costs, which are presented on a per square foot (PSF) basis averaged over the renewal term.
(1)Amount calculated based on the total cost divided by the square feet, divided by the renewal term.
(2)In December 2014, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with its tenant, Norton McNaughton of Squire, Inc. (Norton), whereby the Company received a lease termination fee of $238,625, terminating the lease effective January 31, 2015. Prior to the lease termination, Norton leased the Company’s 302,400 square foot building located in its Hanahan, SC location through April 29, 2015 at an annualized rent of approximately $1,389,000 or $4.54 per square foot. Prior to the lease termination, Norton sub-leased the Company’s space to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). In conjunction with the lease termination, the Company simultaneously entered into a lease agreement for four years and three months with SAIC from February 1, 2015 through April 30, 2019 at an initial annualized rent of approximately $1,406,000, or $4.65 per square foot, with 2% increases each year.
The six lease renewals resulted in an additional weighted average lease term of 3.8 years and a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $5.06 per square foot. The renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $4.95. This compares to the former weighted average rent on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis of $4.76 per square foot and the former weighted average cash rent of $4.91 per square foot, representing an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 6% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 1% on a cash basis.
During fiscal 2015, the Company completed work on three building expansions and one parking lot expansion, which resulted in extending the tenants’ lease expirations by approximately ten years from the date of completion for each of the three buildings that were expanded and increasing the tenants’ rent on each of the four expansions. Prior to the lease amendments being executed, these three properties had a remaining weighted average lease term of 5.7 years at the time of completion of the expansion work. By obtaining an additional ten years of lease term from the date of completion of the expansion work, an additional 4.3 years of weighted average term was added to these three leases. Commencing during fiscal 2015, these four lease amendments have resulted in an annual increase in base rent totaling approximately $1,503,000 on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and approximately $1,493,000 on a cash basis. The renewed U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate for the properties that were expanded is $6.85 per square foot and the renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $6.83. This compares to the former weighted average rent of $5.84 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and on an average cash rent basis, representing an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 17.29% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 16.95% on a cash basis.
The six leases that renewed, that were scheduled to expire in fiscal 2015, combined with the four leases that were amended due to expansions, resulted in an increase in the weighted average lease rate for these ten properties of 13.3% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 10.1% on a cash basis. In addition, the six leases that renewed combined with the three leases that were amended in connection with building expansions, resulted in an additional 4.0 years of weighted average term being added to these nine leases.
