ITEM 2 -- PROPERTIES
GENERAL
The Company's oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development activities are conducted mainly in four core areas: the Sonora area of West Texas, the Mid-Continent region, the Permian Basin and the Texas Gulf Coast. At December 31, 1996, the Company had interests in approximately 7,300 producing properties, 2,900 of which it operates. These operated properties comprised 84% of the Company's total proved reserves at such date, which included 23 MMBbls of oil and 849 Bcf of natural gas, aggregating 990 Bcfe. Net daily production during 1996 was 5.1 MBbls of oil and 174.6 MMcf of natural gas, or an aggregate 204.9 MMcfe. During such period, the Company received an average price of $19.56 per Bbl of oil and $2.34 per Mcf of gas, including the effects of the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts. See "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Results of Operations -- Fiscal Year 1996 Compared to Fiscal Year 1995 -- Oil and Gas Prices." During 1996, the Company drilled 280 developmental oil and gas wells, 271 of which were completed as commercial producers, and 25 exploratory wells, 18 which were successfully completed.
CORE AREAS
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company's activities in each of its principal producing areas as of December 31, 1996:
- ------------------- (1) - Includes the Company's Levelland properties which were sold in January 1997.
(2) - Consists of average net daily production for December 1996.
SONORA AREA
The Sonora area is located in the West Texas counties of Schleicher, Crockett, Sutton and Edwards. It is comprised of five fields, Sawyer, Shurley Ranch, MMW, Aldwell Ranch and Whitehead, which are located on the northeast side of the Val Verde Basin of West Central Texas. Development of the Company's Sonora properties was initiated in the 1970's. Production is predominately from the Canyon formation at depths ranging from 2,500 to 6,500 feet and the Strawn formation at depths ranging from 5,000 to 9,000 feet. The majority of the Company's interest in these properties was accumulated through acquisitions in 1993 and 1995.
CANYON FORMATION. Natural gas in the Canyon formation is stratigraphically trapped in lenticular sandstone reservoirs and the typical Sonora Area well encounters numerous such reservoirs over the Canyon formation's gross thickness of approximately 1,500 feet. The Canyon reservoirs tend to be discontinuous and to exhibit low porosity and permeability, characteristics which reduce the area that can be effectively drained by a single well. These characteristics have encouraged operators in the area to undertake Canyon infill drilling programs over the years. Initial wells were drilled on 640 acre drilling units, but well performance characteristics have indicated that denser well spacing is necessary for effective drainage. The Company continues to downsize these units, and the fields currently are developed in some areas on 40 acre spacing.
STRAWN FORMATION. The Strawn formation, a shallow-marine, fossiliferous limestone, produces natural gas from fractures and irregularly distributed porosity trends draped across anticlinal features. Original field development took place on 640 acre units, with subsequent infill programs downsizing to 160 acre density. Testing of the Strawn formation in Sonora wells, for which the primary drilling objective was the Canyon formation, has been an attractive play for the Company because the Strawn lies less than 1,000 feet below the Canyon formation. Because of the closeness in depth, the cost to evaluate the Strawn formation while drilling for the Canyon formation is relatively minor. The Strawn production is generally commingled with the Canyon production stream. The Company recently acquired over 10,000 gross acres and plans to drill several 100% working interest wells to test primarily the Strawn formation in the Buckhorn horst block, a localized fault-bounded structural feature. The Company is also evaluating the potential for drilling horizontal wells in the Strawn formation. The Company is encouraged by recent horizontal activity conducted by other operators west of the Company's acreage.
ELLENBURGER FORMATION. The Ellenburger formation, which lies approximately 500 feet below the Strawn formation, continues to be a play with interesting potential in the Sonora area. This formation, which is productive on acreage in close proximity to the Company's Sonora properties, is expected to produce from dolomitic porosity in structurally defined traps. Recent drilling into this formation has resulted in encouraging gas shows and helped define the structural and reservoir complexity of the Ellenburger. The Company is continuing a mapping program using 2-D seismic information in conjunction with sub-surface data obtained in the development of the Canyon and Strawn formations, to identify locations which are structurally suited for hydrocarbon accumulation in the Ellenburger. The relatively modest cost to deepen wells to this horizon make the potential economics of this play highly attractive. The Company anticipates at least three Ellenburger tests during 1997.
Since 1993, the Company has continued an aggressive development program in the Sonora area. Through December 31, 1996, the Company had drilled 306 Canyon and Strawn wells with only 3 dry holes. For 1997, the Company plans to drill an additional 100 wells in Sonora. A majority of the wells proposed to be drilled in 1997 are on relatively low risk locations which have not been assigned proved reserves. Since only a portion of the Company's Sonora acreage is developed on 40 acre density, the Company has identified over 550 undrilled locations on the Company's acreage of which 132 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves. The Company believes that, subject to further study and drilling results, additional proved reserves will ultimately be attributed to many of the other locations. In addition to the infill potential, many of the Company's producing wells in the Sonora Area have recompletion possibilities in existing wellbores from Canyon sands not currently producing.
MID-CONTINENT REGION
The Company was actively involved in the Mid-Continent region when it was acquired by S.A. Louis Dreyfus et Cie and has subsequently acquired additional interests in the area through multiple acquisitions that have increased reserves with minimal additional administrative costs. The Company's properties in the Mid-Continent region are located in and along the northern shelf of the Anadarko basin and in Southern Oklahoma. Development of the Company's Mid-Continent region properties began in the late 1970's. Production is predominately natural gas from numerous formations of Pennsylvanian and Pre-Pennsylvanian age rock. Productive depths range from 3,000 to 17,000 feet.
Pre-Pennsylvanian reservoirs include the Chester, Mississippi and Hunton formations, with greater production from these formations occurring in highly fractured carbonate intervals. Pennsylvanian reservoirs include the Granite Wash, Red Fork, Atoka, Morrow and Springer sandstones. These formations have potential for excellent production and reserves. The stratigraphic nature of these reservoirs frequently provides for multiple targets in the same wellbores. Spacing in these formations is generally on 640 acres with extensive increased density drilling having occurred over
the last 15 years.
The Company has pursued an active low risk infill drilling program over the past three years and plans to drill 80 development wells in the region during 1997. In addition, the Company has recently commenced drilling an initial horizontal well to begin evaluating its extensive acreage containing the Mississippi Lime formation. This well is planned to have a 2,300 foot lateral extension.
The Company has identified 250 undrilled locations in the Mid-Continent region, of which 110 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves.
PERMIAN REGION
The majority of the Company's interests in this region was acquired in acquisitions in 1992, 1993 and 1994. The Company is actively involved in drilling development and exploration wells in the Delaware basin of Southeast New Mexico and the Val Verde basin and Spraberry trend of West Texas. The primary drilling objectives in this region are the Delaware, Spraberry, Wolfcamp and Morrow sands.
DELAWARE FORMATION. The Delaware formation was deposited in broad, braided channel systems over most of the Delaware basin. The sands range in depth from 3,000 to 5,000 feet with multiple objectives in the Bell Canyon and Cherry Canyon. Over the past two years, the Company has pursued an active development program in the Happy Valley field in Eddy County of Southeast New Mexico to exploit the Delaware formation. Production is predominately oil with reserves ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 Bbls per well.
SPRABERRY TREND. The Spraberry trend is located in the West Texas counties of Martin, Midland, Glasscock, Upton, Reagan and Irion. The fields in the Spraberry trend are located in the Midland basin and are characterized by the production of both oil and gas from productive zones ranging from the Lower Clearfork formation at a depth of 4,500 feet, to the Dean formation at a depth of 7,000 feet, with the majority of the production from the Spraberry formation. The Spraberry formation, primarily an oil reservoir, produces from fractured sandstones and siltstones and is characterized by low porosity and permeability. These formation characteristics have encouraged operators to develop the area on 80 acre spacing. Over the last two years, the Company has pursued an active infill drilling program in the Spraberry trend which will continue in 1997.
WOLFCAMP. The Wolfcamp in the Southern Delaware and Val Verde basins are deposited as submarine fan sequences that are 200 to 800 feet thick and range in depth from 4,000 to 12,000 feet. During 1996, the Company drilled 5 gross wells in the Brown Bassett area with a 100% success rate. The Company plans to continue additional development in the field in 1997. Additionally, the Company plans to drill a second test well in its Pecos Grande prospect, in which it holds a 56% working interest in 11,000 gross acres in Pecos County, Texas. The Company drilled a dry hole on this prospect in 1996, but the Company believes that the prospect has not been adequately tested.
MORROW FORMATION. The Morrow formation consists of northwest to southeast trending fluvial systems exhibiting excellent porosity and permeability at depths between 10,500 to 11,500 feet. The Company continues to drill and participate in Morrow wells in the Artesia area which is situated along the Northwest shelf of the Delaware basin. Morrow formation gas reserves can range up to 6 Bcf for a single well.
The Company has identified 200 undrilled locations in the Permian region, of which 69 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves.
GULF COAST REGION
The Company's properties in the Gulf Coast Region consist of varying interests in the A.W.P. (Olmos) Field and the North Tatum Field, as well as in an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, West Delta 152, which is its most significant producing property in this region. At December 31, 1996, the Company owned between a 20% and 39% non-operated working interest in the West Delta 152 Field ("West Delta 152") which has 16 producing wells. The wells produce from an eight-pile, 24-slot platform located in the Gulf of Mexico in 380 feet of water approximately 40 miles south-southwest of Venice, Louisiana. The Company successfully completed seven of eight wells drilled in 1996. The Company anticipates that 3 wells will be drilled in West Delta 152 during 1997.
The Company has identified 200 undrilled locations in the Gulf Coast region of which 32 have been assigned proved undeveloped reserves.
EXPLORATION PROSPECTS
In 1996, the Company began to place more emphasis on exploratory drilling activities. The Company invested $15 million in 1996 for seismic and leasehold acquisition and the drilling of 25 wells. The Company has currently budgeted $25 million for exploration activities in 1997. The Company's exploration prospects are located throughout its core regions.
YOAKUM GORGE. The Yoakum Gorge project is located within the Company's Gulf Coast region in Lavaca County, Texas. The Company is currently reviewing the 150 square miles of high-fold 3-D seismic data that was obtained in 1996 and is evaluating drilling opportunities on its 60,000 gross acres. The target zones are the shallow Miocene, Frio, Yegua and Upper Wilcox sands, ranging in depth from 3,500 to 8,000 feet and the deeper Lower Wilcox sands from 13,000 to 16,000 feet. The shallow sands were deposited in a fluvial environment and are often point bar sands with high porosity and permeability. These sands have a reserve range potential of .5 to 3 Bcf per well and are relatively easy to identify using 3-D seismic. The Company successfully completed 9 shallow tests during 1996 and plans to drill up to 40 additional wells during 1997. Initial 3-D seismic interpretation indicates at least 70 shallow sand leads similar to those drilled in 1996. During 1997, the Company also plans to drill 4 exploratory wells to test the Lower Wilcox structures. The Lower Wilcox sands are part of an ancient deltaic system deposited across an unstable muddy continental shelf. The rapid subsidence of the underlying beds allowed accumulation of massive Wilcox sand packages with a high degree of structural complexity. These deeper structures present higher risk but have greater potential, ranging up to 100 Bcf per field. The Company holds a 35% working interest in this project.
SOUTHWEST SPEAKS. The Company has a 25% working interest in this Lower Wilcox project which is also located in Lavaca County, Texas. The Lower Wilcox sands are a series of deltaic sands trapped on a growth faulted structure formed during the Wilcox time. This setting yields multiple zones with high per well reserves and excellent flow rates. During 1996, the Company drilled and completed the Pilgreen No. 1 well at a depth of 13,700 feet, with initial production of 5,000 Mcf per day at 7,000 pounds flowing tubing pressure. This well is believed to have additional productive zones behind pipe. During 1997, the Company plans to drill at least one well in this prospect and up to three additional wells, if the results of a planned seismic project are favorable.
COTTON VALLEY REEF TREND. The Company has a 15% working interest in 26,000 acres in the Cotton Valley Reef trend in Leon and Freestone Counties of East Texas, an area that has attracted many of the largest independent producers. The targets are pinnacle reef build-ups at depths ranging from 13,000 to 16,000 feet that formed on the shelf slope in a shallow water environment during the Jurassic age. These reefs display a dimout on the Cotton Valley seismic event and therefore are readily identifiable on high quality 3-D seismic data. They are typically between 300 and 600 feet thick and can extend across 40 to 80 acres. Discoveries in the region by other operators have resulted in initial production of up to 40 MMcf per day with single well reserves of as much as 80 Bcfe. The Company has identified 40 leads based on its 2-D seismic data. The Company plans to begin a 3-D seismic project of 50 square miles in this area during the first quarter of 1997 with initial drilling to begin by year-end, if the results of the seismic project are favorable.
PITCHFORK RANCH. The Company has an option to explore on approximately 140,000 acres of the Pitchfork Ranch over the next three years. The Pitchfork Ranch is located in the Permian region in King and Dickens Counties, Texas. The Company will be the operator with at least a 77.5% working interest. Target zones are the Tannehill sand at a depth of 4,500 feet and the Strawn Lime at 5,500 feet. The Tannehill sands were deposited as northeast to southwest trending channel sands and extend over most of the acreage. Production is generally found within point bars on structural highs or in stratigraphic traps. Fields within this meandering channel system of the Tannehill can have potential reserves of up to 2 MMBbls, with the opportunity for numerous fields to exist on the ranch. The Company plans to complete a 30 square mile 3-D seismic project by mid-1997 with initial drilling to begin later in the year if the results of the seismic project are favorable.
SON OF BEVO. The Company is the operator and holds a 35% working interest in this project in Lipscomb County of the Texas Panhandle. The prolific Upper Morrow, at a depth of 10,000 feet, was deposited in a meandering river channel environment with gas stratigraphically trapped in point bars. These point bars can be up to 50 feet thick and
have very good rock properties that yield high flow rates. Using 3-D seismic, the Company has successfully completed the second of two wells drilled in this area at an initial flow rate of 5.3 MMcf per day. Seismic interpretations indicate at least six leads that have seismic signatures similar to those of the successful completion. The Company plans to commence the next well in the first quarter of 1997.
RESERVES
The following table sets forth the estimated net quantities of the Company's proved and proved developed reserves as of December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, and the estimated future net revenues and Present Values attributable to total proved reserves at such dates.
PROVED RESERVES (1)
AS OF DECEMBER 31, ------------------------------------- 1994 1995 1996 (2) ---------- ---------- ----------- ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES: Natural gas (Bcf)................... 574.0 753.9 849.2 Oil (MMBbls)........................ 19.3 20.4 23.5 Total (Bcfe)........................ 689.9 876.1 990.2

ESTIMATED PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES: Natural gas (Bcf)................... 433.3 630.6 709.7 Oil (MMBbls)........................ 13.1 14.8 17.9 Total (Bcfe)........................ 511.8 719.6 817.1
YEAR-END PRICES USED IN ESTIMATING FUTURE NET REVENUES: Natural gas (per Mcf)............... $2.61 $2.60 $3.55 Oil (per Bbl)....................... $16.08 $17.80 $24.66
------------------- (1) - The year-end prices used to estimate future net revenues include the effects of the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts which have escalating fixed prices. Estimated proved reserve quantities have been determined without regard to such contracts.
(2) - Includes 34 Bcfe of proved reserves (of which 24 Bcfe were proved developed) attributable to the Company's Levelland properties which were sold in January 1997 (the "Levelland Sale"). Future net revenues and the Present Value attributable to the Levelland properties were $68.5 million and $35.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 1996.
(3) - Increases in the Present Value for 1996 were due, in part, to a significant increase in December 1996 natural gas and crude oil prices. Holding the reserve quantities set forth in the December 31, 1996 reserve study (shown above) constant, the impact of using average 1996 natural gas and oil prices of $2.63 per Mcf and $21.18 per Bbl and would have been to lower the Present Value to $834 million.
No estimates of the Company's proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company's estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 1996 are based upon studies prepared by the Company's staff of engineers and reviewed by Ryder Scott Company, independent petroleum engineers. Estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic benefit that may be derived from the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts. Such calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. The estimated future net revenues and Present Value, as adjusted for Fixed-Price Contracts, were based on the engineers' production volume estimates with price adjustments based on the terms of the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts as of December 31, 1996. The amounts shown do not give effect to indirect expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense or to depletion, depreciation and amortization.
The Company estimates that if all other factors (including the estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves) were held constant, a $1.00 per Bbl change in oil prices and a $.10 per Mcf change in gas prices from those used in calculating the Present Value would change such Present Value by $11 million and $15 million, respectively.
The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves are determined using the Company's Fixed-Price Contracts for the corresponding volumes and production periods adjusted for estimated location and quality differentials. These prices are on average less than spot market prices at December 31, 1996. If such Fixed-Price Contracts were not in effect and the Company used December 31, 1996 wellhead prices, the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves and the Present Value thereof would be $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. The reserve data set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based.
For further information on reserves, future net revenues and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see "Note 12 -- Supplemental Information -- Oil and Gas Reserves" in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company appearing elsewhere herein.

TITLE TO PROPERTIES
The Company believes that it has satisfactory title to its properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in the opinion of the Company, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of its properties. The Company performs extensive title review in connection with acquisitions of proved reserves and has obtained title opinions on substantially all of its material producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, only a perfunctory title examination is performed in connection with acquisition of leases covering undeveloped properties. Generally, prior to drilling a well, a more thorough title examination of the drill site tract is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant title defects, if any, before proceeding with operations.
The Company's oil and gas properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry. Except as otherwise indicated, all information presented herein is presented net of such interests. The Company's properties are also subject to liens for current taxes not yet due and other encumbrances. The Company believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business. Approximately 30 Bcfe of the Company's oil and gas properties are mortgaged to a Fixed-Price Contract counterparty, securing the Company's performance under such contract.
