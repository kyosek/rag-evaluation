ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES
Our principal executive office, located in Dallas, Texas, is approximately 66,000 square feet of leased space. We also maintain two leased telemarketing centers in the Dallas area. Our sales are conducted primarily through sales centers located at our various resorts and a leased off-site sales center in Irving, Texas, which opened in March 2006. The square footage of our leased telemarketing centers and off-site sales center are approximately 21,000, 40,000, and 16,500, respectively. We also lease small office facilities in San Antonio and Houston, Texas and Alpharetta, Georgia which we use in our marketing efforts in those locales.
Pinnacle Lodge. In 2006, we purchased Pinnacle Lodge, a 64-room hotel property located near the Winter Park recreational area in Colorado which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives Silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area. We generated $1.1 million and $522,000 of revenues at the Pinnacle Lodge during the years 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Other Properties. We own a 500-acre tract of land in the Berkshire Mountains of Western Massachusetts that we are in the initial stages of developing. During September 2007, we purchased an additional 394.3 acre tract which adjoins the 500 acres. We have not yet finalized our future development plans for this site.
In November 2007, we purchased 15.3 acres of undeveloped land in Grand County, Colorado with plans to develop up to 136 Vacation Interval units on the property. The acquired land is located only two miles from the Pinnacle Lodge hotel.
At December 31, 2007, we owned a total of 13 timeshare resorts. Each of these resorts was encumbered by various liens and security agreements at December 31, 2007 due to inventory from each resort being pledged as collateral under our inventory credit facilities with our senior lenders.

Future Growth Strategy
Our future growth strategy is to conservatively increase annual revenues through a combination of:
·
continuing to develop new or existing resorts;
·
maintaining marketing, sales, and development activities at those resorts in accordance with our current business model;
·
concentrating on marketing to existing members, including sales of upgraded Vacation Intervals, additional week sales, and existing owner referral programs;
·
adding other assets and amenities to attract our customers by enhancing vacation experiences;
·
opening new off-site sales centers in major metropolitan areas; and
·
emphasizing our secondary products, such as biennial (alternate year) intervals, to broaden our potential market with a wider price range of products for first-time buyers.
Competitive Advantages
We believe our business affords us the following competitive advantages:
Convenient Getaway Locations. Our Getaway Resorts are located within a two-hour drive of a majority of our target customers' residences, which accommodates what we believe to be the growing demand for shorter, more frequent, close-to-home vacations. This proximity of our customer base to our resorts facilitates use of our Bonus Time program, allowing Silverleaf Owners to use vacant units, subject to availability and certain limitations. We believe we are the only timeshare operator that offers customers these expanded use benefits. Silverleaf Owners can also conveniently drive to and enjoy non-lodging resort amenities at our resorts year-round on a day use “country-club” type basis.
Substantial Internal Growth Capacity. At December 31, 2007, we had an inventory of 27,300 Vacation Intervals and a master plan to construct new units which will result in up to 94,952 additional Vacation Intervals at our Existing Resorts. Our master plan for construction of new units is contingent upon future sales at our Existing Resorts and the availability of financing, granting of governmental permits, and future land-planning and site-layout considerations.
In-House Operations. We have in-house marketing, sales, financing, development, and property management capabilities. While we utilize outside contractors to supplement internal resources, our internal capabilities provide greater control over all phases of our operations, help maintain operating standards, and reduce overall costs.
Lower Construction and Operating Costs. We have developed and generally employ standard architectural designs and operating procedures, which we believe significantly reduce construction and operating expenses. Standardization and integration also allow us to rapidly develop new inventory in response to demand. Weather permitting, new units at Existing Resorts can typically be constructed on an “as needed” basis within 180 to 270 days.
Centralized Property Management Supervision. We presently supervise the operation of all of our Existing Resorts (except for Orlando Breeze) on an integrated, centralized, and collective basis through our Management Agreement with Silverleaf Club with operating and maintenance costs paid from Silverleaf Owners' monthly dues. While our Orlando Breeze resort in Florida has its own separate Club (Orlando Breeze Resort Club), we also provide centralized supervision of its operations under the terms of a written agreement to ensure the quality of services provided to Orlando Breeze timeshare owners. We believe that consolidation of resort operations benefits Silverleaf Owners by providing a uniform level of service, accommodations, and amenities on a standardized, cost-effective basis. Integration also facilitates our internal exchange program and the Bonus Time program.
Experienced Management. Our senior management has extensive experience in the acquisition, development, marketing, sales, and operation of timeshare resorts. The senior officers have an average of eighteen years of experience in the timeshare industry.
Resorts Summary
The following tables set forth certain information regarding each of the Existing Resorts at December 31, 2007, unless otherwise indicated.
Existing Resorts
(a)
These totals do not reflect sales of upgraded Vacation Intervals to existing Silverleaf Owners. An “upgraded Vacation Interval” sale refers to an exchange of a lower priced interval for a higher priced interval in which the Silverleaf Owner is given credit for all principal payments previously made toward the purchase of the lower priced interval. For the year ended December 31, 2007, upgrade sales at the Existing Resorts were as follows:
The average sales price for the 9,988 upgraded Vacation Intervals sold was $8,735 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
(b)
Represents units included in our master plan. This plan is subject to change based upon various factors, including consumer demand, the availability of financing, grant of governmental land-use permits, and future land-planning and site layout considerations. The following chart reflects the status of certain planned units at December 31, 2007:
“Land-Use Process Pending” means that we have commenced the process which we believe is required under current law in order to obtain the necessary land-use authorizations from the applicable local governmental authority with jurisdiction, including submitting for approval any architectural drawings, preliminary plats, or other attendant items as may be required.
“Land-Use Process Complete” means either that (i) we believe that we have obtained all necessary land-use authorizations under current law from the applicable local governmental authority with jurisdiction, including the approval and filing of any required preliminary or final plat and the issuance of building permit(s), in each case to the extent applicable, or (ii) upon payment of any required filing or other fees, we believe that we will under current law obtain such necessary authorizations without further process.
(c)
These totals are net of intervals received from upgrading customers and from intervals received from cancellations.
(d)
Principal amenities available to Silverleaf Owners at each resort are indicated by the following symbols: B - boating; F - fishing; G - golf; H - horseback riding; M - miniature golf; S - swimming pool; and T - tennis.
(e)
Boating is available near the resort.
(f)
Includes three units which have not been finished-out for accommodations and which are currently used for other purposes.
(g)
Engineering, architectural, and construction estimates have not been completed, and we cannot be certain that we will develop these properties at the unit numbers currently projected.
Features Common to Existing Resorts
Getaway Resorts are primarily located in rustic areas offering Silverleaf Owners a quiet, relaxing vacation environment. Furthermore, the resorts offer different vacation activities, including golf, fishing, boating, swimming, horseback riding, tennis, and archery. Destination Resorts are located in or near areas with national tourist appeal. Features common to the Existing Resorts include the following:
Bonus Time Program. Silverleaf Club’s Bonus Time program offers Silverleaf Owners a benefit not typically enjoyed by other timeshare owners. In addition to the right to use a unit one week per year, the Bonus Time program allows all Silverleaf Owners, who are current on their dues and timeshare loan installment payments, to use vacant units for up to three nights at a time at any of our owned resorts. Sunday through Thursday night stays are currently without charge, while Friday through Saturday stays presently cost $49.95 per night payable to Silverleaf Club. The Bonus Time program is limited based on the availability of units. Availability is created when a Silverleaf Owner does not use his or her owned week. Silverleaf Owners who have utilized the resort less frequently are given priority to use the program and may only use an interval with an equal or lower rating than their owned Vacation Interval. We believe this program is important as many vacationers prefer shorter two to three day vacations. Owners of unused intervals that are utilized by the Bonus Time program are not compensated other than by their participation in the Bonus Time program.
Year-Round Use of Amenities. Even when not using the lodging facilities, Silverleaf Owners have unlimited year-round day usage of the amenities located at the Existing Resorts, such as boating, fishing, miniature golf, tennis, swimming, or hiking, for little or no additional cost. Certain amenities, however, such as golf, horseback riding, or watercraft rentals, may require a usage fee.
Exchange Privileges. Each Silverleaf Owner has certain exchange privileges through Silverleaf Club which may be used on an annual basis to (i) exchange an interval for a different interval (week) at the same resort so long as the desired interval is of an equal or lower rating; or (ii) exchange an interval for the same interval (week) of equal or lower rating at any other of our Existing Resorts. Silverleaf Owners of Getaway Resorts can only exchange for an interval in a Getaway Resort unless they own a “Presidents,” “Chairmans,” or “Ambassador” Vacation Interval. These exchange rights are a convenience we provide Silverleaf Owners and are conditioned upon availability of the desired interval or resort. Approximately 8,492 exchanges occurred in 2007. Silverleaf Owners pay an exchange fee of $75 to Silverleaf Club for each such internal exchange. In addition, Silverleaf Owners may join the exchange program administered by RCI for an annual fee of $89.
Deeded Ownership. We typically sell a Vacation Interval that entitles the owner to use a specific unit for a designated one-week interval each year. The Vacation Interval purchaser receives a recorded deed, which grants the purchaser a percentage interest in a specific unit for a designated week. We also sell a biennial (alternate year) Vacation Interval that allows the owner to use a unit for a one-week interval every other year with reduced dues.
Management Club. Each of the Existing Resorts has a Club for the benefit of the timeshare owners. At December 31, 2007, the Clubs (except for the club at Orlando Breeze) operate under Silverleaf Club to manage the Existing Resorts on a centralized and collective basis. We have contracted with Silverleaf Club to perform the supervisory and management functions granted by the Clubs. Costs of these operations are covered by monthly dues paid by timeshare owners to their respective Clubs together with income generated by the operation of certain amenities at each respective resort. Our destination resort in Florida, Orlando Breeze, has its own club, Orlando Breeze Resort Club, which operates independently of Silverleaf Club. However, we supervise the management and operation of Orlando Breeze Resort Club under the terms of a written agreement.
On-Site Security. Each of the Existing Resorts is patrolled by security personnel who are either employees of the various management clubs or employees of independent security service companies that have contracted with the Clubs.
