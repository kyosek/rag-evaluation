Item 2. Description of Properties -------------------------
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS ------------------------------
General - -------
Barnwell's oil and natural gas properties are located in Canada, principally in the Province of Alberta with the exception of the investment of $448,000 in oil wells in North Dakota and Louisiana. These property interests are principally held under governmental leases or licenses. Under the typical Canadian provincial governmental lease, Barnwell must perform exploratory operations and comply with certain other conditions. Lease terms vary with each province, but, in general, give Barnwell the right to remove oil, natural gas and related substances subject to payment of specified royalties on production.
Barnwell participates in exploratory and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on property in which it has an interest and evaluates proposals by third parties with regard to participation in such exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere. Exploratory and developmental operations on property in which Barnwell has an interest and third party proposals for exploratory and developmental operations on other property are evaluated by Barnwell's Calgary, Alberta staff. Barnwell also relies on independent consultants to aid in the evaluation of such exploration opportunities. In fiscal 1995, Barnwell participated in exploratory and developmental operations in the Canadian Province of Alberta and North Dakota, although Barnwell does not limit its consideration of exploratory and developmental operations to these areas.
Barnwell's producing natural gas properties are located principally in Alberta. The Province of Alberta determines its royalty share of natural gas by using a reference price which averages all natural gas sales in Alberta. In fiscal 1995, the weighted average royalty paid on natural gas from the Dunvegan Unit, Barnwell's principal oil and natural gas property, was reduced to 21% compared to 26% in fiscal 1994 due to a reduction in the royalty rate applied by the Government. This decrease in royalty rate was due to the approval by the Alberta Government of a change in the classification for royalty purposes of a portion of the Dunvegan natural gas. The weighted average royalty paid on all natural gas was approximately 18% in fiscal 1995 compared to 20% in fiscal 1994 primarily due to the change in classification of natural gas from the Dunvegan area.
In fiscal 1995, 96% of Barnwell's oil production was from properties located in Alberta. Oil royalty rates under government leases in Alberta are based on the selling price of oil. In fiscal 1995, the weighted average royalty paid on oil was approximately 14%. The remaining 4% of Barnwell's oil production came from properties located in North Dakota; the weighted average royalty paid on oil produced in North Dakota was 12.5% Additionally, the Company pays 5% of oil revenues as a severance tax on oil produced in North Dakota.
In fiscal 1995, the Company spent approximately $375,000 in fiscal 1995 for land acquisition and seismic costs in various areas of Alberta to be evaluated and developed subsequent to fiscal 1995.
Typically, unit sales of natural gas are higher in the winter than at other times due to demand for heating. Unit sales of oil are not subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Well Drilling Activities - ------------------------
During fiscal 1995, Barnwell participated in the drilling of 16 development wells and 14 exploratory wells, of which 15 are capable of production. The Company also acquired one natural gas and one oil well, and participated in the recompletion of six wells. The most significant drilling operations took place in the West Greene/Coastal areas of North Dakota and the Barrhead and Thornbury areas of Alberta.
In fiscal year 1995, the Company continued to participate in the development of oil reserves discovered in fiscal 1994 in the state of North Dakota. Four oil wells were drilled in this pool in 1995, two of which are capable of production and are producing. One successful exploratory well was drilled in a similar prospect. The Company now has four wells capable of producing from two petroleum reservoirs. The Company's working interests in these wells is 11.667%. The Company's portion of current production from these wells is approximately 37 barrels per day.
In fiscal 1995, the Company continued further development of a natural gas project in the Thornbury area. The Company participated in the drilling and flowline installation of two natural gas wells and the recompletion of one natural gas well. A total of 33 zones of production from 31 wells are now contributing to an average daily production of 11 MMCF ("MMCF" means 1,000,000 cubic feet and "MCF" means 1,000 cubic feet) per day. The Company's working interest in these wells varies between 8.4375% and 22.5%.
The Company participated in the drilling of four wells in the Barrhead area of Central Alberta in fiscal 1995. Two were completed as natural gas wells and two were dry and abandoned. Approximately $180,000 was spent in construction of a natural gas plant. The Company's working interests in these wells varies between 10.0% and 17.5%, with a 17.5% working interest in the Barrhead natural gas plant.
At September 30, 1995, the Company was participating in the drilling of two wells; one was subsequently completed as an oil well and the other was dry and abandoned.
The following table sets forth more detailed information with respect to the number of exploratory ("Exp.") and development ("Dev.") wells drilled and acquired for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 in which Barnwell participated:
The Dunvegan Unit, the Company's principal property located in Alberta, Canada, has 134 natural gas wells comprising a total of 192 producing well zones with a sustained capacity of the Unit estimated at 100,000 MCF per day, plus additional capacity due to the storage capacity program implemented in 1991. In fiscal 1995, the Company expended $365,000 in the continued development of the Dunvegan Unit by participating in the drilling of two natural gas wells, one of which is capable of production while the other was dry and abandoned. Further developmental drilling will be carried out, which is expected to maintain current production levels for the immediate future.
Oil and Natural Gas Production - ------------------------------
In fiscal 1995, approximately 49%, 40%, and 11% of the Company's oil and natural gas revenues were from the sale of natural gas, sale of oil (including liquids) and the royalty tax credit (see "Description of Properties - Oil and Natural Gas Operations - Taxation"), respectively.
Barnwell's natural gas production reached a Company record high in fiscal 1995 with an average net sales volume after royalties of 13,500 MCF per day, which represents an increase of 5% over fiscal 1994. This increase was primarily attributable to production from new areas. Dunvegan provided 46% of the Company's fiscal 1995 natural gas production.
In fiscal 1994, approximately 58%, 30% and 12% of the Company's oil and natural gas revenues were from the sale of natural gas, sale of oil (including liquids) and the royalty tax credit, respectively.
Barnwell's natural gas production in fiscal 1994 averaged net sales volume after royalties of 12,800 MCF per day, an increase of 4% over fiscal 1993. This increase was primarily attributable to production from new areas. Dunvegan provided 44% of the Company's fiscal 1994 natural gas production.
In fiscal 1995, oil sales averaged net production of 564 barrels per day, an increase of 13% over the 500 barrels per day average in fiscal 1994. New production from the North Dakota project contributed approximately 30 barrels per day. The Company's major oil producing properties are the Red Earth, Chauvin and Manyberries areas in Canada and the West Greene and Coastal areas in North Dakota.
In fiscal 1995, natural gas liquid sales averaged net production of 246 barrels per day, the same volume as in fiscal 1994. The Company's major natural gas liquids producing properties are the Dunvegan, Hillsdown and Pouce Coupe areas in Alberta.
The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell's net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of crude oil, natural gas, condensate and other natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. All of Barnwell's net production in fiscal 1995, other than 100 barrels of oil and 98,000 MCF of natural gas derived from the Province of Saskatchewan, 11,200 barrels of oil from the State of North Dakota and 200 barrels of oil from the State of Louisiana, was derived from the Province of Alberta. All dollar amounts in this table are in U.S. dollars.

Barnwell's leasehold interests in its undeveloped acreage, if not developed, expire over the next five fiscal years as follows: 7% expire during fiscal 1996; 6% expire during fiscal 1997; 11% expire during fiscal 1998; 15% expire during fiscal 1999; and 7% expire during fiscal 2000.
Barnwell's undeveloped acreage includes major concentrations in Alberta at Red Earth (5,977 net acres), Thornbury (2,541 net acres), Foley Lake (1,633 net acres) and Sutton (2,067 net acres).
Reserves - --------
The amounts set forth in the table below, prepared by Paddock Lindstrom and Associates, Ltd., Barnwell's independent reservoir analysts, summarize the estimated net quantities of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed reserves of crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 on all properties in which Barnwell has an interest. These reserves are before deductions for indebtedness secured by the properties and are based on constant dollars. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any other federal authority or agency since October 1, 1980.
(1) "Developed Acreage" includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. "Undeveloped Acreage" includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained in effect by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon.
(2) "Gross" refers to the total number of wells or acres in which Barnwell owns an interest, and "Net" refers to Barnwell's aggregate interest therein. For example, a 50% interest in a well represents 1 Gross Well, but .50 Net Well, and similarly, a 50% interest in a 320 acre lease represents 320 Gross Acres and 160 Net Acres. The gross wells and gross acreage figures include interests owned of record by Barnwell and, in addition, the portion owned by others.

As of September 30, 1995, all of Barnwell's proved developed producing and total proved developed reserves were located in the Province of Alberta, with the exception of 3,000 proved developed producing barrels of oil and 460,000 proved developed producing MCF of natural gas located in the Province of Saskatchewan, 40,000 proved developed producing MCF of natural gas and 12,000 proved developed producing barrels of oil located in the State of Louisiana and 47,000 proved developed producing barrels of oil located in the State of North Dakota.
During fiscal 1995, Barnwell's total net proved developed reserves decreased by 131,000 barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and by 5,104,000 MCF of natural gas. The decrease in oil, condensate and natural gas liquids reserves was the net result of (a) production during the year of 296,000 barrels; (b) the addition of 97,000 barrels from the drilling of productive oil wells; (c) the independent engineer's 101,000 barrel upward revision of the Company's oil reserves; and (d) the sale of reserves in place of 33,000 barrels. Barnwell's natural gas reserves decreased as a net result of (a) production during the year of 4,916,000 MCF; (b) the addition of 1,041,000 MCF from the drilling of productive wells; (c) the sale of reserves in place of 2,585,000 MCF; and (d) the independent engineer's 1,356,000 MCF upward revision of the Company's natural gas reserves.
Barnwell's working interest in the Dunvegan Unit accounted for approximately 56% of its total proven natural gas reserves at September 30, 1995 compared to approximately 51% of its proven natural gas reserves at September 30, 1994, and approximately 35% of proven oil and condensate reserves at September 30, 1995 compared to approximately 30% of proven oil and condensate reserves at September 30, 1994.
The following table sets out the Company's oil and natural gas reserves at September 30, 1995, by property name, based on information prepared by Paddock Lindstrom and Associates, Ltd., Barnwell's independent reservoir analysts. Gross reserves are before the deduction of royalties; net reserves are after the deduction of royalties net of the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit. This table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at the date of the projection. Oil, which includes natural gas liquids, is shown in thousands of barrels ("MBBLS") and natural gas is shown in millions of cubic feet ("MMCF").

Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas - --------------------------------
Barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and condensate production under short-term contracts between the operator of the property and marketers of oil. The price of oil is determined by negotiation between the parties.
In fiscal 1995, natural gas production from the Dunvegan Unit was responsible for approximately 46% of the Company's natural gas sales. In fiscal 1995, the Company had only one significant customer, ProGas Limited, which accounted for 15% of the Company's oil and natural gas sales.
In compliance with certain regulatory events and orders in the U.S. and Canada affecting the sale and delivery of Canadian natural gas supplies to the California market, the natural gas purchase, sales and transportation agreements, under which Barnwell's Dunvegan natural gas was previously sold to Alberta and Southern Gas Co., Ltd., were terminated, effective November 1993.
New marketing arrangements were made for the sale of Dunvegan natural gas for fiscal 1994 and future years. Essentially all of Barnwell's Dunvegan production and a significant portion of its natural gas production from other properties is sold to several aggregators and marketers under various short-term and long-term contracts, with the price of natural gas determined by negotiations between the parties.
Governmental Regulation - -----------------------
General -------
The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas, allowable rates of production and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province and state which periodically assign allowable rates of production. The Province of Alberta also regulates the volume of natural gas which may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal.
There is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the sale of Canadian oil or natural gas production. Canadian natural gas production destined for export is, as of November 1, 1988, priced by market forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by Canada's National Energy Board and the government of Canada.
The right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan is controlled by the Governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on the Company's operations. In addition to the foregoing, Barnwell's Canadian operations may be affected in the future, from time to time, by political developments in Canada and by Canadian Federal, provincial and local laws and regulations, such as restrictions on production and export, oil and natural gas allocation and rationing, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, modification or cancellation of contract rights, and environmental protection controls. Further, operations may also be affected by United States import fees and restrictions.
Different royalty rates are imposed by the producing provinces, the Government of Canada and private interests with respect to the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and liquids. In addition, some producing provinces receive additional revenue through the imposition of taxes on crude oil and natural gas owned by private interests within the province. Essentially, provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue, and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. The Province of Alberta announced a series of changes in the calculation of royalties, which became effective on January 1, 1993. The new calculation of royalties is more price-sensitive, reducing the royalty rates when prices are low and increasing them when prices are high. These changes included reduced royalties for new oil pools discovered after October 1, 1992. Effective January 1, 1994, the mechanics of the natural gas royalty calculation were simplified; the Company does not believe this simplification has had or will have a significant impact on the amount of net oil and natural gas revenues.
Canadian taxpayers are not permitted to deduct royalties, taxes, rentals and similar levies paid to the Federal or provincial governments in connection with oil and natural gas production in computing income for purposes of Canadian Federal income tax. However, they are allowed to deduct a "Resource Allowance" which is 25% of the taxpayer's "Resource Profits for the Year" (essentially, income from the production of oil, natural gas or minerals) in computing their taxable income. The resource properties located in the United States are freehold mineral interests leased under market conditions, subject to extraction and severance taxes imposed according to state regulations.
The Province of Alberta has a "Royalty Tax Rebate" in its Income Tax Act which eliminates the provincial share of income tax attributable to the inability to deduct such royalties, rentals and similar levies. In addition, the Alberta Income Tax Act provides for a royalty tax credit to taxpayers calculated as a percentage of the taxpayer's "Attributed Alberta Royalty Income" (being that portion of the royalties paid to the Province of Alberta which have been disallowed as a deduction or added back in computing income for tax purposes) subject to an annual limitation of the credit. In effect, this returns to the taxpayer a portion of the royalties paid to the Province of Alberta. For fiscal years 1994 and 1993 and for the first quarter of fiscal 1995 the royalty tax credit was determined according to the prevailing price of oil and varied from a high of 85% at prices below $15.00 a barrel to 73% at $20.00 a barrel and to a low of 25% at $30.00 a barrel or higher. The maximum credit is equal to the applicable percentage multiplied by the Crown Royalty Shelter, which amounted to $2,500,000 Canadian (referred to herein as "C") for fiscal 1994 and 1993 and for the first quarter of fiscal 1995.
The Province of Alberta stated that changes in the Royalty Tax Rebate would be announced three years in advance and that the royalty tax credit program would be continued to December 31, 1997. In 1994, the Province of Alberta reduced the above-mentioned royalty tax credit percentage from 85% to 75%, and reduced the above-mentioned Crown Royalty Shelter from C $2,500,000 to C $2,000,000, effective January 1, 1995. As a result of this change, the Company's royalty tax credit for fiscal 1995 was $230,000 lower than the amount received for fiscal 1994. The royalty tax credit program has been in effect in various forms since 1974 and the Company anticipates that it will be continued in some form for the foreseeable future. If the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit is not continued, it will have a material adverse effect on the Company. In 1995, the Province of Alberta made the royalty tax credit percentage increase or decrease based upon both natural gas and oil prices. Under this program, the total royalty tax credit the Company receives declines as oil and natural gas prices rise and increases as oil and natural gas prices decline. The Company estimates that these changes, which were effective with the beginning of Barnwell's second quarter of fiscal 1995, will result in an approximate reduction of $80,000 in net earnings for fiscal 1996 as compared to fiscal 1995.
Natural Gas Pricing -------------------
The price of natural gas is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers. Natural gas sold by the Company is generally sold under both long-term and short-term contracts with prices indexed to market prices and renegotiated annually.
Oil Pricing -----------
The price of oil is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers.
Competition - -----------
The majority of Barnwell's natural gas sales take place in Alberta, Canada and the Northern California area. Natural gas prices in Alberta are generally very competitive as there is a significant supply of natural gas with shut-in capacity. Northern California prices are also competitive and are influenced by competition from producers in the Southwestern United States (Texas, etc.). Barnwell's oil and natural gas liquids are sold in Alberta, North Dakota and Louisiana and are determined by the world price for oil.
The Company competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price, and on the ability to deliver product currently. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the exploration for new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor factor in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial and other resources.
CONTRACT DRILLING OPERATIONS - ----------------------------
Barnwell owns 100% of Water Resources International, Inc. ("WRI"). WRI conducts water well drilling, pump installation and pump maintenance activities in Hawaii, and has also drilled geothermal wells in Hawaii in previous years. WRI owns and operates four rotary drill rigs, owns a two acre storage and maintenance yard near Hilo, Hawaii, leases a three-quarter of an acre maintenance facility in Honolulu and a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and maintains drill and pump inventory. As of September 30, 1995, WRI employed 16 drilling, pump and administrative employees, none of whom are union members.
WRI is capable of drilling both shallow and deep water wells in Hawaii, and has drilled the deepest water well in the State. Additionally, WRI is contracted to install and repair water pumps after wells are completed. Pump installation and maintenance contracts are primarily obtained from municipal water utilities. The demand for WRI's services is dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii, which can currently be described as moderate. WRI markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price contracts and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with various local, state and Federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes.
The Company's contract drilling segment which operates in Hawaii is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Activity - --------
In fiscal 1995, WRI started six water well and four water well pump installation contracts and completed five water well and two pump installation contracts. All five of the completed water wells were started in the current fiscal year and one of the two completed water well pump installations was started in the prior year. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of such well drilling and pump installation jobs, representing 40% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 1995, have been pursuant to government contracts. At December 1, 1995, WRI had a backlog of four water well contracts, two of which were in progress as of September 30, 1995, and nine pump installation contracts, seven of which were in progress as of September 30, 1995. These thirteen contracts represent a backlog of contract drilling revenues of approximately $2,700,000 as of September 30, 1995.
Competition - -----------
WRI utilizes rotary drill rigs which have the capability of drilling wells faster than cable tool rigs. There are six other drilling contractors in the State of Hawaii which use cable tool and rotary drill rigs that are capable of drilling water wells in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with WRI for government and private contracts. Pricing is the Company's major method of competition; reliability of service is also a major factor.
LAND INVESTMENT OPERATIONS - --------------------------
In May 1984, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired a 50.1% interest in approximately 10,800 acres of leasehold property on the Kona coast of the Island of Hawaii. The Company's interest and the remaining leasehold interest in the property were contributed to a joint venture, Kaupulehu Developments, in which the Company has a 50.1% controlling interest.
The property is located in the North Kona District between the Pacific Ocean and Mamalahoa Highway. The western end of the property features extensive ocean frontage with shoreline lagoons formed by the interaction of the lava flows and the ocean. The original approximately 10,800 acre parcel was divided by more than two miles of the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and had approximately four miles of frontage on the Mamalahoa Highway along the eastern boundary of the property. The land area between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Pacific Ocean is approximately 2,800 acres in size and the land area between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Mamalahoa Highway ("the upland portion") is approximately 8,000 acres in size. Kaupulehu Developments obtained the rezoning of approximately 620 acres of such leasehold property to urban for both state and county purposes to allow for two hotel sites, two golf courses, several residential sites interspersed around and within the planned golf courses and one commercial site.
Kaupulehu Developments granted options to independent third parties to acquire the leasehold interest for the development of the hotel, commercial, golf course and residential sites, comprising the approximately 620 acre property, the approximately 2,180 acres zoned conservation adjoining the approximately 620 acre urban area and the approximately 8,000 acre upland portion.
In fiscal 1989 and 1990, options were exercised with respect to hotel and golf course sites, the commercial site and the approximately 8,000 acre upland portion.
In fiscal 1991, Kaupulehu Developments entered into no land transactions.
In fiscal 1992, Kaupulehu Developments entered into definitive agreements with Kaupulehu Makai Venture. Kaupulehu Makai Venture succeeded to all development rights and obligations previously held by other independent third parties. The managing general partner of Kaupulehu Makai Venture is an affiliated company of Kajima Corporation of Japan, one of the largest construction companies in Japan. There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Makai Venture or its predecessors and the Company. Kaupulehu Developments received cash consideration in partial payment for the residential sites in fiscal 1992. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain, net of minority interests, of $2,410,000.
In fiscal 1994, Kaupulehu Developments submitted a petition to the State Land Use Commission to reclassify approximately 1,000 acres of the approximate 2,180 acres zoned conservation. Kaupulehu Developments seeks to have the 1,000 acres rezoned to permit the development of golf courses and residential sites. Kaupulehu Developments, as part of the rezoning process, submitted to the State Land Use Commission an Environmental Impact Statement. In September 1994, the State Land Use Commission accepted the Environmental Impact Statement. In December 1994, the State Land Use Commission began the public hearing process of the rezoning petition; this process is currently ongoing.
Activity - --------
In fiscal 1995, there were no land transactions.
In April 1995, the option under which Kaupulehu Makai Venture could have acquired Kaupulehu Developments' leasehold interest in approximately 2,180 leasehold acres of conservation zoned property in North Kona, Hawaii expired, unexercised. Costs applicable to the rezoning of the approximately 1,000 acres of the aforementioned 2,180 acres of conservation zoned property incurred subsequent to April 1995 are capitalized. Such costs, inclusive of capitalized interest, amounted to $293,000 at September 30, 1995.
Kaupulehu Makai Venture has completed a significant amount of the construction of the first golf course, hotel and condominiums and related infrastructure in the 620 acre urban area. The golf course is essentially complete and is expected to open in early 1996. The hotel is expected to open in late 1996.
At September 30, 1995, the remaining real estate position (i.e. leasehold interests and related development rights) held by Kaupulehu Developments is comprised of the approximately 2,180 leasehold acres zoned conservation and development rights with respect to lands zoned residential in the adjacent 620 acre urban area. The residential lands are under option to Kaupulehu Makai Venture. This option, if exercised, entitles the Company to receive $16,157,000 in connection with its 50.1% interest in Kaupulehu Developments. The residential site option expires on April 30, 2007; however, this option will expire sooner unless 20% of the consideration is received on or before December 31, 1999 and 50% of the then remaining consideration is received on or before April 30, 2003. There is no assurance that this option or any portion thereof will be exercised.
Competition - -----------
The Company's land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal methods of competition are the location of the project and pricing. Kaupulehu Developments is a minor factor in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources.
For the past three years Hawaii's economy has been in a recession. While the current outlook is for moderate economic growth of 1% to 2%, the real estate market is not expected to experience a measurable improvement in the near term.
