MINERAL PROPERTIES
FISH LAKE VALLEY PROPERTY
Fish Lake Valley is a lithium enriched playa (also known as a salar, or salt pan), which is located in northern Esmeralda County in west central Nevada, and the property is roughly centered at 417050E 4195350N (NAD 27 CONUS). We currently hold twenty six, 80-acre Association Placer claims that cover approximately 2,080 acres (863 hectares). Lithium-enriched Tertiary-era Fish Lake formation rhyolitic tuffs or ash flow tuffs have accumulated in a valley or basinal environment. Over time interstitial formational waters in contact with these tuffs, have become enriched in lithium, boron and potassium which could possibly be amenable to extraction by evaporative methods. Our company allowed 56 claims to lapse on September 1, 2012, which covered the southern playa area. A further 14 claims were allowed to lapse on September 1, 2015.
The property was originally held under mining lease purchase agreement dated June 1, 2009, between Nevada Lithium Corporation, and Nevada Alaska Mining Co. Inc., Robert Craig, Barbara Craig, and Elizabeth Dickman. Nevada Lithium issued to the vendors $350,000 worth of common stock of our company in eight regular disbursements. All disbursements were made of stock worth a total of $350,000, and claim ownership was transferred to our company.
The geological setting at Fish Lake Valley is highly analogous to the salars of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, and more importantly Clayton Valley, where Albemarle has its Silver Peak lithium-brine operation. Access is excellent in Fish Lake Valley with all-weather gravel roads leading to the property from state highways 264, and 265, and maintained gravel roads ring the playa. Power is available approximately 10 miles from the property, and the village of Dyer is approximately 12 miles to the south, while the town of Tonopah, Nevada is approximately 50 miles to the east.
Our company completed a number of geochemical and geophysical studies on the property, and conducted a short drill program on the periphery of the playa in the fall of 2010. Near-surface brine sampling during the spring of 2011 outlined a boron/lithium/potassium anomaly on the northern portions of the northern playa, that is roughly 1.3 x 2 miles long, which has a smaller higher grade core where lithium mineralization ranges from 100 to 150 mg/L (average 122.5 mg/L), with boron ranging from 1,500 to 2,670 mg/L (average 2,219 mg/L), and potassium from 5,400 to 8,400 mg/L (average 7,030 mg/L). Wet conditions on the playa precluded drilling there in 2011, and for a good portion of 2012, however a window of opportunity presented itself in late fall 2012. In November/December 2012 we conducted a short direct push drill program on the northern end of the playa, wherein a total of 1,240.58 feet (378.09 meters) was drilled in 20 holes at 17 discrete sites, and an area of 3,356 feet (1,023 meters) by 2,776 feet (846 meters) was systematically explored by grid probing. The deepest hole was 81 feet (24.69 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 34 feet (10.36 meters). The average depth of the holes drilled during the program was 62 feet (18.90 meters). The program successfully demonstrated that lithium-boron-potassium-enriched brines exist to at least 62 feet (18.9 meters) depth in sandy or silty aquifers that vary from approximately three to ten feet (one to three meters) in thickness. Average lithium, boron and potassium contents of all samples are 47.05 mg/L, 992.7 mg/L, and 0.535% respectively, with lithium values ranging from 7.6 mg/L to 151.3 mg/L, boron ranging from 146 to 2,160.7 mg/L, and potassium ranging from 0.1 to 1.3%. The anomaly outlined by the program is 1,476 by 2,461 feet (450 meters by 750 meters), and is not fully delimited, as the area available for probing was restricted due to soft ground conditions to the east and to the south. A 50 mg/L lithium cutoff is used to define this anomaly and within this zone average lithium, boron and potassium contents are 90.97 mg/L, 1,532.92 mg/L, and 0.88% respectively. On September 3, 2013, we announced that drilling had commenced at Fish Lake Valley. Due to storms and wet conditions in the area which our company hoped to concentrate on, the playa was not passable, and so the program concentrated on larger step-out drilling well off the playa. This 11 hole, 1,025 foot program did prove that mineralization does not extend much, if at all, past the margins of the playa, as none of the fluids encountered in this program were particularly briny, and returned values of less than 5 mg/L lithium.
Our company is very pleased with the results here, and believe that the playa at Fish Lake Valley may be conducive to the formation of a "silver peak" style lithium brine deposit. Our company reviewed the results in regards to the overall geological interpretation of the lithium, boron and potassium bearing strata. The results confirm the presence of targeted mineralization and further evaluation programs will focus on determining the extent and depth of mineralization.
We have signed an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1032701 B.C. LTD., a private British Columbia company with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium brine property.
1032701 BC Ltd., may acquire an initial 80% undivided interest in the Fish Lake Valley property through the payment of an aggregate of US$300,000 in cash, completing a Going Public Transaction on or before May 6, 2016, and subject to the completion of the Going Public Transaction, arranging for the issuance of a total of 400,000 common shares in the capital of the Resulting Issuer as follows: (i) within five Business Days following the effective date,
* Pay $100,000 to our company and issue 200,000 common shares of the TSX-V listed public company.
* On or before the first anniversary of the signing of the Definitive Agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company. * On or before the second anniversary of the signing of the definitive agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000 common shares of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company.
The Optionee must make qualified exploration or development expenditures on the property of $200,000 before the first anniversary, an additional $300,000 before the second anniversary, an additional $600,000 prior to the third anniversary, and make all payments and perform all other acts to maintain the Property in good standing before fully earning their 80% interest. Additionally, terms will be negotiated for the Optionee to purchase our 20% interest in the property for $1,000,000, at which point the our interest would revert to a 2 1/2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Optionee may then elect at any time to purchase one half of our NSR for $1,000,000.
SAN EMIDIO PROPERTY
The San Emidio property, located in Washoe County in northwestern Nevada, was acquired through the staking of claims in September 2011. The twelve, 80-acre, Association Placer claims currently held here cover an area of approximately 960 acres (640 hectares). Ten claims in the southern portions of the original claim block that was staked in 2011 were allowed to lapse on September 1, 2012, and a further ten claims were then staked and recorded. These new claims are north of and contiguous to the surviving claims from our earlier block. The property is approximately 65 miles north-northeast of Reno, Nevada, and has excellent infrastructure. A further eight claims were allowed to lapse on September 01st 2015.
We developed this prospect during 2009, and 2010 through surface sampling, and the early reconnaissance sampling determined that anomalous values for lithium occur in the playa sediments over a good portion of the playa. This sampling appeared to indicate that the most prospective areas on the playa may be on the newly staked block proximal to the southern margin of the basin, where it is possible the structures that are responsible for the geothermal system here may also have influenced lithium deposition in sediments.
Our company conducted near-surface brine sampling in the spring of 2011, and a high resolution gravity geophysical survey in summer/fall 2011. Our company then permitted a 7 hole drilling program with the Bureau of Land Management in late fall 2011, and a direct push drill program was commenced in early February 2012. Drilling here delineated a narrow elongated shallow brine reservoir which is greater than 2.5 miles length, and which is adjacent to a basinal feature outlined by the earlier gravity survey. Two values of over 20 milligrams/liter lithium were obtained from two holes located centrally in this brine anomaly.
Most recently we drilled this prospect in late October 2012, further testing the area of the property in the vicinity where prior exploration by our company discovered elevated lithium levels in subsurface brines. During the 2012 program a total of 856 feet (260.89 meters) was drilled at 8 discrete sites. The deepest hole was 160 feet (48.76 meters), and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 90 feet (27.43 meters). The average depth of the seven hole program was 107 feet (32.61 meters). The program better defined a lithium-in-brine anomaly that was discovered in early 2012. This anomaly is approximately 0.6 miles (370 meters) wide at its widest point by more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) long. The peak value seen within the anomaly is 23.7 mg/l lithium, which is 10 to 20 times background levels outside the anomaly. Our company believes that, much like Fish Lake Valley, the playa at San Emidio may be conducive to the formation of a "Silver Peak" style lithium brine deposit, and the recent drilling indicates that the anomaly occurs at or near the intersection of several faults that may have provided the structural setting necessary for the formation of a lithium-in-brine deposit at depth.
Our company has compiled all data and amended our permit with the Bureau of Land Management to allow for the drilling of three reverse circulation drill holes to depths of 500 feet in order to test for lithium brine mineralization.
MOUNT HEIMDAL FLAKE GRAPHITE PROPERTY
On April 15, 2013, we entered into a mining option agreement with, Tom Lewis, a director and former officer of our company, wherein we had the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Mount Heimdal Flake Graphite property in the Slocan Mining Division of British Columbia, Canada.
The Mount Heimdal property is currently comprised of one mineral claim, which encompasses 1,386 acres (575 hectares) of highly metamorphosed rock. The property is roughly six miles (10 kms) south of Eagle Graphite's Black Crystal quarry, and is located within the same package of gneisses, graphite mineralized marbles, and calc-silicate gneisses. Data from BC Geological Survey assessment reports indicate that mineralization grading up to 4.8% graphitic carbon may be located on the property.
High purity graphite is presently the most widely used anode material for lithium ion battery technology, and typically greater than 10 times more graphite is used in comparison to lithium in lithium ion battery production. In addition to increased graphite consumption due to growth in lithium ion batteries sales, carbon fiber composites are increasingly being utilized in auto, and aircraft construction. Also, presently there is considerable research into graphene, a flake graphite product, and it is possible a myriad of new applications or discoveries will ensue as a direct result of this work.
Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, we were required to spend $15,000 in exploration on the property and complete an assessment report by November 30, 2013, and upon successful completion of the program and the report, our company was to earn a 100% interest in the claims, subject to a 1.5% net overriding royalty to the vendor from the proceeds of production.
Prospecting work was performed on the Mount Heimdal property in June/July 2013 and several mineralized zones were noted here, the best of which graded 3.72% flake graphite. Although the work was encouraging it was decided that our company would be best served presently by focusing on the BC Sugar property. Our company negotiated an agreement with Tom Lewis, a director and former officer of our company, with Tom Lewis as the vendor of Mount Heimdal, whereby Mr. Lewis assigned his 100% interest in the property for a 2% net smelter royalty on any proceeds from future production from the property. In addition Mr. Lewis holds title to both the Mount Heimdal, and BC Sugar properties, in trust, for our company and will transfer all interest at such time as our company creates a subsidiary that is eligible to hold title in mineral properties in British Columbia.
In August 2014, an exploration crew was mobilized to explore the Mount Heimdal flake graphite property. The program focused on flake graphite mineralization discovered on the property during the brief program undertaken in 2013, while exploring other areas of the property that were felt to also be prospective for hosting flake graphite mineralization. No further significant mineralization was found, and our company is considering options for this property moving forward.
BC SUGAR FLAKE GRAPHITE PROPERTY
On June 6, 2013, we entered into a mining claim sale agreement with Herb Hyder wherein Mr. Hyder agreed to sell to our company a 50.829 acre (20.57 hectare) claim located in the Cherryville area of British Columbia. As consideration for the purchase of the property, we issued 250,000 shares of our company's common stock to Mr. Hyder. In addition to the acquired claim, our company staked or acquired another 13 claims at various times over the subsequent months, to bring the total area held under tenure to approximately 19,816 acres (8,020 hectares). The flake graphite mineralization of interest here is hosted predominately in graphitic quartz/biotite, and lesser graphitic calc-silicate gneisses. The rocks in the general area of the BC Sugar prospect are similar to the host rocks in the area of the crystal graphite deposit 55 miles (90 kms) to the southeast, in the vicinity of our company's Mount Heimdal block of claims. Currently the Company holds 3 claims covering 6838 acres (2837 hectares).
The BC Sugar property is well placed in the Shushwap Metamorphic Complex, in a geological environment favorable for the formation of flake graphite deposits, and is in an area of excellent logistics, with a considerable network of logging roads within the project area. Additionally the town of Lumby is approximately
19 miles (30 kms) to the south of the property, while the City of Vernon is only 30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest of the western portions of the claim block.
We received final assays from the October 2013 prospecting and geological program at the BC Sugar property in December of 2013. That work increased the area known to be underlain by graphitic bearing gneisses, and further evaluations were made in the area of the Sugar Lake, Weather Station, and Taylor Creek showings. In the general vicinity of the Weather Station showing, a further 13 samples were taken, and hand trenching was performed at one of several outcrops in the area. In the trench a 5.2 meter interval returned an average of 3.14% graphitic carbon, all in an oxidized relatively friable gneissic host rock. Additionally a hydrothermal or vein type mineralized graphitic quartz boulder was discovered in the area which graded up to 4.19% graphitic carbon. The source of this boulder was not discovered during this program, but it is felt to be close to its point of origin. Samples representative of the mineralization encountered here were taken for petrographic study, which was received in late 2013. A brief assessment work program was performed in September 2014 to ensure all claims in the package were in good standing prior to the anticipated sale of this asset to Pathion. Recommendations were made by the consulting geologist who wrote the assessment report with respect to trenching, and eventually drilling the Weather Station showing. Our company submitted a Notice of Work to the BC Government in early May 2015 to enable our company to conduct a program of excavator trenching, sampling and geological mapping on the Weather Station showing. In May of 2015 we signed an agreement with KLM Geosciences LLC of Las Vegas to conduct a short Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey on the property in the Weather Station - Taylor Creek areas. The GPR survey as well as a GEM-2 electromagnetic (EM) survey took place in approximately mid-May 2015. The GPR survey did not provide useful data because of the moisture saturation in the shallow subsurface. The EM survey successfully generated an anomaly over known mineralization as well as extended the anomaly to the west under an area of cover consisting of glacial/fluvial till. Lithium Corporation is pleased with the results of the EM survey and is considering modifying our work plans to include additional work that builds on the results of this survey. In August of 2015 our Notice of Work for trenching was approved by the BC Government and in October we commenced work. A trench of 265.76 feet (81 meters) was excavated and graphitic gneiss was mapped and sampled. In all 23 samples were taken over the 69 m's of exposed mineralization that could be safely sampled. Sampling encountered 69 meters that averaged 1.997% graphitic carbon, that remains open to the north, and to the south. Within that interval there was a 30-meter section that averaged 2.73% graphitic carbon, and within that interval there was a 12-meter section that averaged 2.99% graphitic carbon. The best mineralization, and most friable material is proximal to a creek bed, and it appears that proximity to this gave rise to the deep weathering profile encountered here. Lithium Corporation is currently studying the results, and determining what steps to take for further exploration.
THE HUGHES CLAIMS
Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, LLC and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25% membership in a number of patented mining claims that spring from the once vast holdings of Howard Hughes. Our company's capital contribution paid to Summa, LLC was $125,000, of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services.
Our company participated in the formation of Summa, which holds 88 fee-title patented lode claims, which cover approximately 1,191.3 acres of prospective mineral lands. Our company has recently signed a joint operating agreement with the other participants to govern the conduct of Summa, and the development of the lands. Our company's director, Tom Lewis, has been named as a managing member of Summa.
The Hughes lands are situated in six discrete prospect areas in Nevada, the most notable of which being the Tonopah block in Nye County where Summa holds 56 claims that cover approximately 770 acres in the heart of the historic mining camp where over 1.8 million ounces of gold and 174 million ounces of silver were produced predominately in the early 1900's. The Hughes claims include a number of the prolific past producers in Tonopah, such as the Belmont, the Desert Queen, and the Midway mines. In addition there are also claims in the area of
the past producing Klondyke East mining district, which is to the south of Tonopah, and at the town of Belmont (not to be confused with the Belmont claim in Tonopah), Nevada, another notable silver producer from the 1800's, which is roughly 40 miles to the northeast of Tonopah.
Recently research has been conducted on the Hughes properties, focusing on the Tonopah area where reporting in the 1980's, indicate that over 2.175 million tons of mine dumps and mill tailings exist at surface on Summa's properties that contain in the order of 3.453 million ounces of silver, and 28,500 ounces of gold. In addition to this easily extractable surficial resource, other reports indicate that 300 - 500,000 tons of mineralized material is expected to remain at depth in old workings on Summa's properties, which is believed to contain an average 20 ounces silver and 0.02 ounces gold per ton. Also several partially tested exploration targets have been identified on Summa's Tonopah claims, where further work could potentially lead to a marked increase in known underground resources.
In the general area of our company's newest acquisition, West Kirkland Mining has recently announced that it has completed a $29.2 million dollar financing, the proceeds of which were used to purchase a 75% interest in Allied Nevada Gold Corporation's Tonopah properties. West Kirkland also has the option to purchase the remaining 25% interest by paying Allied Nevada a further $10 million dollars on or before October 23, 2016. West Kirkland has recently compiled an updated NI-43-101 resource on the Hasbrouck and Three Hills prospects which are roughly 5.5 and 2 miles, respectively, from Summa's Tonopah claim block and it is West Kirkland's intent to advance these properties to a pre-feasibility study and initiate mine permitting. The Nye County Recorder's office only recently recorded title in favor of Summa LLC., so we are only now beginning to determine how best to capitalize on this asset.
We are currently pursuing other properties which are believed to be prospective for hosting lithium or graphite mineralization, as well as evaluating opportunities brought to our company by third parties.
Additionally our company is looking to ramp up its generative program exploring for new deposits of next generation battery related materials.
ITEM 3.
