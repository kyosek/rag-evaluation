ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 for additional information pertaining to the Properties’ performance.
Malls
We owned a controlling interest in 65 Malls and non-controlling interests in 9 Malls as of December 31, 2016. The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and generally have strong competitive positions because they are the only, or the dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas. The Malls are generally anchored by two or more department stores and a wide variety of mall stores. Anchor tenants own or lease their stores and non-anchor stores lease their locations. Additional freestanding stores and restaurants that either own or lease their stores are typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.
We classify our regional Malls into three categories:
(1)
Stabilized Malls - Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years.
(2)
Non-stabilized Malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase. After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the Stabilized Mall category. The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2016. Fremaux Town Center, The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta were classified as Non-stabilized Malls as of December 31, 2015.
(3)
Excluded Malls - We exclude Malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded:
a.
Lender Malls - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the Property or convey the secured Property to the lender. As of December 31, 2016, Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center were classified as Lender Malls. Midland Mall was conveyed to the lender subsequent to December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, Gulf Coast Town Center and Triangle Town Center were classified as Lender Malls. Additionally, Triangle Town Place, an associated center adjacent to Triangle Town Center, was classified as a Lender Property as of December 31, 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, Triangle Town Center and Triangle Town Place were recategorized as Minority Interest Properties as described below. In the second quarter of 2016, the foreclosure of Phase I and II of Gulf Coast Town Center was complete. Lender Properties are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers.
b.
Repositioning Malls - Malls that are currently being repositioned or where we have determined that the current format of the Property no longer represents the best use of the Property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the Property. This may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the Property, we may determine that the Property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment. The steps taken to reposition these Properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these Properties. Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Repositioning Malls. As of December 31, 2016, Cary Towne Center and Hickory Point Mall were classified as Repositioning Malls. As of December 31, 2015, the Annex at Monroeville and CoolSprings Galleria were under significant redevelopment and Wausau Center was being considered for repositioning. Wausau Center was moved from Repositioning to the Lender Property category in the second quarter of 2016 when it was determined, after evaluating redevelopment options that an appropriate risk-adjusted return was not achievable and the Mall should be returned to the lender.
c.
Minority Interest Malls - Malls in which we have a 25% or less ownership interest. As of December 31, 2016, we had two Malls classified as Minority Interest Malls. Triangle Town Center and Triangle Town Place were reclassified from the Lender Property category in the first quarter of 2016 upon the sale of our 50% interest in the unconsolidated affiliate to a newly formed joint venture in which we have a 10% ownership interest. The
debt secured by these Properties was restructured in conjunction with the sale. Triangle Town Place was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also sold a 75% interest in River Ridge Mall to a new joint venture in the first quarter of 2016. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these unconsolidated affiliates.
We own the land underlying each Mall in fee simple interest, except for WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Brookfield Square, Meridian Mall, Stroud Mall, EastGate Mall and Wausau Center. We lease all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term ground leases.

(23)
Hickory Point Mall - T.J. Maxx is scheduled to open in 2017 in the former Steve & Barry's space.
Anchors
Anchors are an important factor in a Mall’s successful performance. However, we believe that the number of Anchor stores will reduce over time, providing us the opportunity to redevelop these spaces to attract new uses such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness centers and lifestyle retailers that engage consumers and encourage them to spend more time at our Malls. Mall Anchors are generally a department store or, increasingly, other large format retailers, whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer traffic and creating a desirable location for the Mall store tenants.
Anchors may own their stores and the land underneath, as well as the adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their stores. Rental rates for Anchor tenants are significantly lower than the rents charged to mall store tenants. Total rental revenues from Anchors account for 13.2% of the total revenues from our Malls in 2016. Each Anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement agreement with us covering items such as operating covenants, reciprocal easements, property operations, initial construction and future expansion.
During 2016, we added the following Anchors and Junior Anchors to the Malls, as listed below:
As of December 31, 2016, the Malls had a total of 262 Anchors, including two vacant Anchor locations, and excluding Anchors at our Excluded Malls and freestanding stores. The Mall Anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:
(1)
Of the 30 stores owned by JC Penney, 4 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(2)
Of the 36 stores owned by Sears, 5 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company purchased 5 of the owned Sears' locations for future redevelopment. These stores were then leased back to Sears.
(3)
Of the 38 stores owned by Dillard's, 3 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company.
(4)
Of the 23 stores owned by Macy's, 3 are subject to ground lease payments to the Company. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company purchased 4 of the owned Macy's locations for future redevelopment.

As of December 31, 2016, the Malls had a total of 123 Junior Anchors, including one vacant Junior Anchor space, and excluding Junior Anchors at our Excluded Malls. The Mall Junior Anchors and the amount of GLA leased or owned by each as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:

Mall Stores
The Malls have approximately 6,360 Mall stores. National and regional retail chains (excluding local franchises) lease approximately 83.8% of the occupied Mall store GLA. Although Mall stores occupy only 31.2% of the total Mall GLA (the remaining 68.8% is occupied by Anchors and Junior Anchors and a minor percentage is vacant), the Malls received 81.3% of their revenues from Mall stores for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Mall Lease Expirations
The following table summarizes the scheduled lease expirations for mall stores as of December 31, 2016:

We leased approximately 4.3 million square feet with average stabilized mall leasing spreads of 7.6%, including new lease spreads of 28% and renewal spreads of 1.2%. We expect to achieve similar results for leases expiring in 2017. Page 59 includes new and renewal leasing activity as of December 31, 2016 with commencement dates in 2016 and 2017.
Mall Tenant Occupancy Costs
Occupancy cost is a tenant’s total cost of occupying its space, divided by sales. Mall store sales represents total sales amounts received from reporting tenants with space of less than 10,000 square feet. The following table summarizes tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of total Mall store sales, excluding license agreements, for each of the past three fiscal years:

In certain cases, we own less than a 100% interest in the Malls. The information in this table is based on 100% of the applicable amounts and has not been adjusted for our ownership share.
(2)
Represents reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, marketing and certain capital expenditures.

Associated Centers
We owned a controlling interest in 20 Associated Centers and a non-controlling interest in three Associated Centers as of December 31, 2016.
Associated Centers are retail properties that are adjacent to a regional mall complex and include one or more Anchors, or big box retailers, along with smaller tenants. Anchor tenants typically include tenants such as T.J. Maxx, Target, Kohl’s and Bed Bath & Beyond. Associated Centers are managed by the staff at the Mall since it is adjacent to and usually benefits from the customers drawn to the Mall.

Community Centers
We owned a controlling interest in four Community Centers and a non-controlling interest in five Community Centers as of December 31, 2016. Community Centers typically have less development risk because of shorter development periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain higher occupancy levels and are more stable, they typically have slower rent growth because the anchor stores’ rents are typically fixed and are for longer terms.
Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, or value-priced stores that attract shoppers to each center’s small shops. The tenants at our Community Centers typically offer necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.

The interest rate will increase to 5.4075% on January 1, 2018 and thereafter require monthly principal payments of $225 and $300 in 2018 and 2019, respectively, in addition to interest. The loan has a one-year extension option, at our election, which is contingent on the mall meeting specified debt service and operational metrics.

The unconsolidated affiliate has an interest rate swap on a notional amount of $47,197, amortizing to $38,866 over the term of the swap, to effectively fix the interest rate on the variable-rate loan. Therefore, this amount is currently reflected as having a fixed rate. The swap terminates in June 2023.
(16)
Ambassador Town Center Infrastructure Improvements - The Operating Partnership owns less than 100% of the Property but guarantees 100% of the debt.
