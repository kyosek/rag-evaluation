ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Facilities
Our office in Dallas consists of 11,847 square feet of leased office space. The operating partnership owns a field office in Hooker, Oklahoma and leases part of an office in Amarillo, Texas.
Properties
Our Partnership owns two categories of properties, the Net Profits Interests and the Royalty Properties.
Net Profits Interests
We own net profits overriding royalty interests (referred to as the Net Profits Interests) in various properties owned by the operating partnership. All of the properties formerly owned by Dorchester Hugoton and various mineral, royalty and working interests formerly owned by Republic and Spinnaker were conveyed to the operating partnership subject to a Net Profits Interest upon our formation. We receive monthly payments equaling 96.97% of the net profits actually realized by the operating partnership from these properties in the preceding month. In the event costs exceed revenues in a given month for properties subject to a Net Profits Interest, no payment is made and any deficit is accumulated and carried over and reflected in the following month’s calculation of net profit.
Index to Financial Statements In accordance with our partnership agreement we have the continuing right to create additional Net Profits Interests by transferring properties to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a Net Profits Interest identical to the Net Profit Interests created upon our formation. One such interest was created in each of calendar years 2003, 2004 and 2005 by transferring various properties to the operating partnership subject to a Net Profit Interest. These interests were subsequently combined effective December 31, 2004 and 2005 and we refer to it as the 2003/2004/2005 NPI. As of December 31, 2005 cumulative costs and expenses, which include an interest equivalent, totaled $3,020,000 attributable to the 2003/2004/2005 NPI and exceeded cumulative revenues by $561,000, an amount which we refer to as the 2003/2004/2005 NPI deficit. Our financial statements do not reflect activity attributable to properties subject to Net Profits Interests that are in a deficit status. Consequently, revenues, expenses, production sales volumes and prices, and oil and gas reserves set forth herein do not reflect amounts attributable to the 2003/2004/2005 NPI properties, but information concerning acreage owned and drilling activity thereon do reflect amounts attributable to these properties. All such deficits are borne 100% by our General Partner until the deficit is extinguished. Thereafter, we receive the 96.97% Net Profits Interests attributable to the previously deficit property groups.
Acreage Summary
The following tables set forth as of December 31, 2005 information concerning properties owned by the operating partnership and subject to the Net Profits Interests. Acreage amounts listed under Leasehold reflect gross acres leased by the operating partnership and the working interest share (net acres) in those properties. Acreage amounts listed under Mineral reflect gross acres in which the operating partnership owns a mineral interest and the undivided mineral interest (net acres) in those properties. The operating partnership’s interest in these properties may be unleased, leased by others or a combination thereof. Acreage amounts may not add across due to overlapping ownership among categories.
The following table reflects the states in which the acreage amounts listed above are located.
The operating partnership owns working interests below the currently producing horizons in 47,360 gross/46,960 net acres in Texas County, Oklahoma. The operating partnership has from time to time farmed out its leasehold interests in portions of these lands, reserving an overriding royalty interest therein, and will consider additional exploration or development of these lands as circumstances warrant.
Drilling Activity
During 2005, the operating partnership participated as a working interest or unleased mineral interest owner in 49 wells located on lands subject to the Net Profits Interest. These wells were located in 15 counties in seven states. As of December 31, 2005, 20 of these wells had been completed as producing oil or natural gas wells, one was deemed to be a dry hole and 12 were in various stages of drilling or completion operations. In addition, four

wells that were drilling as of December 31, 2004 were completed as producing oil or natural gas wells during 2005. Selected new wells drilled in 2005 and the working and net revenue interests owned therein by the operating partnership are summarized in the following table:
(1) WI and NRI mean working interest and net revenue interest, respectively.
Costs Incurred
The following table sets forth information regarding 100% of the costs incurred on a cash basis by the operating partnership during the periods indicated in connection with the properties underlying the Net Profits Interests.
(1) Information prior to January 31, 2003 attributable to properties formerly owned by Republic and Spinnaker is excluded. We believe the exclusion of this information is immaterial.
(2) The years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 include $336,000, $875,000 and $1,086,000, respectively, attributable to the 2003/2004/2005 NPI.
Productive Well Summary
The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2005 the combined number of producing wells on the properties subject to the Net Profits Interests. Gross wells refer to wells in which a working interest is owned. Net wells are determined by multiplying gross wells by the working interest in those wells.
(1) Multiple well units operated by someone other than the operating partnership and in which we own Net Profits Interests are included as one gross well.
Index to Financial Statements Royalty Properties
We own Royalty Properties representing producing and nonproducing mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits and leasehold interests in properties located in 573 counties and parishes in 25 states. Acreage amounts listed herein represent our best estimates based on information provided to us as a royalty owner. Due to the significant number of individual deeds, leases and similar instruments involved in the acquisition and development of the Royalty Properties by us or our predecessors, acreage amounts are subject to change as new information becomes available. In addition, as a royalty owner, our access to information concerning activity and operations on the Royalty Properties is limited. Most of our producing properties are subject to old leases and other contracts pursuant to which we are not entitled to well information. Some of our newer leases provide for access to technical data and other information. We may have limited access to public data in some areas through third party subscription services. Consequently, the exact number of wells producing from, or drilling on the Royalty Properties is not determinable. The primary manner by which we will become aware of activity on the Royalty Properties is the receipt of division orders or other correspondence from operators or purchasers.
Acreage Summary
The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2005 a summary of our gross and net, where applicable, acres of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests, and a compilation of the number of counties and parishes and states in which these interests are located. The majority of our net mineral acres are unleased. Acreage amounts may not add across due to overlapping ownership among categories.
Our net interest in production from royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests is based on lease royalty and other third party contractual terms which vary from property to property. Consequently, net acreage ownership in these categories is not determinable. Our net interest in production from properties in which we own a royalty or overriding royalty interest may be affected by royalty terms negotiated by the mineral interest owners in such tracts and their lessees. Our interest in the majority of these properties is perpetual in nature. However, a minor portion of the properties are subject to terms and conditions pursuant to which a portion of our interest may terminate upon cessation of production.
The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2005 the combined summary of total gross and net (where applicable) acres of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty and leasehold interests in each of the states in which these interests are located.
Index to Financial Statements Leasing Activity
We received cash payments in the amount of $1,734,000 from various sources during 2005, including lease bonus attributable to 69 leases and nine pooling elections and extensions of four leases in lands located in 26 counties and parishes in five states. These leases reflected bonus payments ranging up to $800/acre and initial royalty terms ranging up to 30%. Many of these leases contain additional overriding royalty interests, and provisions for optional working interest participation in subsequent wells, back-in working interests after payout or escalating royalty terms. These cash payments are reflected in our financial statements in various categories including, but not limited to, lease bonus and other income.
We received cash payments in the amount of $1,168,000 from various sources during the fourth quarter of 2005, including lease bonus attributable to 27 leases and pooling elections of our interests in lands located in 14 counties and parishes in four states. These leases reflected bonus payments ranging up to $700/acre and initial royalty terms ranging up to 30%. These cash payments are reflected in our financial statements in various categories including, but not limited to, lease bonus and other income.
The following table sets forth a summary of leases and pooling elections consummated during 2003 through 2005.
Fifteen leases were granted for no bonus consideration in 2005 but which reflected primary terms of as little as six months and royalty terms ranging from 25% to 30%. Average bonus and royalty terms reflected above include these fifteen leases. Ten leases were granted in 2005 which included (in addition to royalty or bonus) an overriding royalty interest, back-in working interest or optional working interest participation. Average royalty terms reflected above do not reflect these additional interests. Amounts reflected above may differ from the financial statements which are presented on an accrual basis. Average Royalty and Bonus exclude amounts attributable to pooling elections. Other Land Revenue includes gas storage, shut-in and delay rental payments, coal royalty, surface use agreements, litigation judgments and settlement proceeds, proceeds of royalty payment audits and other sources. These cash payments are reflected in our financial statements in various categories including, but not limited to, lease bonus, and other income. Other Land Revenue does not include interest income and note principal payments which totaled $413,000 in 2005.
Index to Financial Statements Drilling Activity
We received division orders for, or otherwise identified 289 new wells completed on our Royalty Properties and Net Profits Interests in 66 counties and parishes in 13 states during 2005. We received division orders for, or otherwise identified 77 new wells completed on our Royalty Properties and Net Profits Interests in 35 counties and parishes in eight states during the fourth quarter of 2005. Selected new wells and the net revenue interest (NRI) owned therein by us are summarized in the following table.
Additional information concerning selected recent activity is summarized below:
T-Patch (Reklaw OSO) Field, Jim Hogg and Starr Counties, Texas-We own varying undivided mineral interests totaling 4,994/1,583 gross/net acres in three tracts in Jim Hogg and Starr Counties, Texas and which we leased to EOG Resources, Inc. (“EOG”) in 2004.
EOG has drilled and completed eight wells on one of these tracts (which we call the Southwest Texas Corp. tract) since August 2004. Initial production test rates from these wells as reported to the Texas Railroad Commission ranged up to 8,970 mcf and 184 barrels of oil per day. These wells produce natural gas and condensate from the Queen City “Reklaw” reservoir at approximately 9,000 feet and have exhibited significant declines from initial production rates. Total gas production from the Southwest Texas Corp. tract declined from a peak of 32,500 mcf per day from five wells in May, 2005 to 14,181 mcfd from seven wells in November. Based on available production data, management is unable to project whether these wells will exhibit hyperbolic or exponential decline profiles. These wells contributed significantly to the increase in royalty gas sales volumes and related cashflow during 2005. We expect volumes and cashflow attributable to these wells to continue to decline in 2006. We received $3,015,000 in cash receipts in 2005 attributable to production during November 2004 through October 2005 from these wells including $1,058,000 in the fourth quarter. We received $505,000 in January and February 2006 attributable to production during November and December 2005 from these wells. Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2005 reflect our 5.12% net revenue interest share of estimated gross remaining reserves of 12.8 bcf and 180,296 barrels attributable to these eight wells. These reserves reflect average gross ultimate reserves of 2.5 bcf and 42,700 barrels per well. No proved undeveloped reserves have been assigned to this property.
EOG has drilled one well and is drilling another on the second of these tracts (which we call the Guerra Mineral Trust tract). The Guerra Mineral Trust No. 1 well spud in January 2006 to a permitted total depth of 8,100 feet and is currently waiting on completion operations. The Guerra Mineral Trust No. 2 well spud in March 2006 to a permitted total depth of 8,000 feet and is currently drilling. We own a 10.2% net revenue interest in this tract.
EOG has not permitted a well to be drilled on the third tract leased in 2004. We own varying undivided mineral interests in eight tracts adjacent to or in the vicinity of this third tract totaling 3,254/1,306 gross/net mineral acres. On January 23, 2006, we circulated a Request For Proposals (RFP) to industry participants, soliciting expressions of interest to lease our interests in these eight tracts. We are currently negotiating an offer with one party. We can not project if, when or with whom we may elect to lease our interests in these lands.
Index to Financial Statements Jeffress (Vicksburg S) Field, Hidalgo County, Texas-We own varying undivided mineral interests in several thousand acres in the greater Jeffress Field area of western Hidalgo County, Texas. Jeffress and associated nearby fields produce gas and condensate from tight Vicksburg sandstone reservoirs at depths ranging from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet. El Paso Production and XTO Energy are the most active operators in this area. We leased our interest in approximately 417 acres to Dan A. Hughes Company (“Hughes”) in October 2005 for a 25% royalty. In addition, the operating partnership was granted a five percent overriding royalty interest in the first well which is convertible to a 25% working interest at payout. The operating partnership has the option to participate for a 25% working interest in all future wells drilled on the 417 acre tract or within a surrounding area comprising approximately 1,000 acres. In the event the operating partnership does not exercise this option it will receive a 5% override in wells drilled on the 417 acre tract. Each of these interests is proportionately reduced to our mineral interest, resulting in our ownership of a 6.25% net royalty interest and the operating partnership’s 1.3% net overriding royalty interest or 6.25% working interest.
Hughes drilled the Coates-Dorchester 1 well in November 2005 to a permitted total depth of 11,500 feet. As of December 31, 2005 the well was waiting on completion operations. The well was tested to sales on January 26, 2006 at rates of 3,263 mcf and 96 barrels per day and was flowing at rates of 4,093 mcf and 72 barrels per day on March 7, 2006. No proved reserves have been assigned to our 6.25% net revenue interest or the operating partnership’s 1.3% overriding royalty interest in this well. The overriding royalty interest, back-in working interest and optional working interest in future wells (if any) is part of the 2003/2004/2005 NPI.
Haley Field Area, Loving and Winkler Counties, Texas-We own varying undivided mineral and royalty interests in over 90 sections located in north central Loving and western Winkler counties, Texas and southeastern Lea County, New Mexico portions of the Delaware basin in the vicinity of the Haley Field. Operators active in this area include Anadarko, Browning Oil, Chesapeake Energy and Forest Oil. We leased our interests in 2004 and 2005 in 39 sections for a one-quarter royalty and bonuses ranging up to $700/acre. In addition, the operating partnership has the option to participate for a 10% working interest in wells drilled in 11 of these sections, which option is exercisable after the first well is drilled in each of these sections and in all subsequent wells. Each of these interests is proportionately reduced to our mineral interest in each tract. The optional working interest is part of the 2003/2004/2005 NPI.
As of December 31, 2005, no wells were permitted on these lands.
Fayetteville Shale Trend of Northern Arkansas-We own varying undivided mineral interests totaling 19,543/9,753 gross/net acres located in Cleburne, Conway, Faulkner, Pope, Van Buren and White Counties, Arkansas. These lands are unleased, perpetual mineral interests and are located in what is commonly referred to as the “Fayetteville Shale” trend of the Arkoma Basin. Southwestern Energy and Chesapeake Energy are the most active operators in the play. We have received numerous lease offers for our interests in this area, which offers we have declined to date in order to gather additional information.
On January 30, 2006, we circulated a Request For Proposals (RFP) to industry participants, which RFP solicited expressions of interest to lease our interests in this play. We are currently evaluating several offers. We can not project if, when or with whom we may elect to lease our interests in these lands.
Index to Financial Statements Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following table reflects the Partnership’s proved developed and total proved reserves, future net revenues and SEC PV-10 at December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The reserves and future net revenues are based on the reports of the independent petroleum engineering consulting firms of Calhoun, Blair & Associates as to the Net Profits Interests and Huddleston & Co., Inc. as to the Royalty Properties. Other than those filed with the SEC, our estimated proved reserves have not been filed with or included in any reports to any federal agency.
(1) Reserves, revenues and present values reflect 96.97% of the corresponding amounts assigned to the operating partnership’s interests in the properties underlying the Net Profits Interests.
(2) Total proved reserves include 218 mmcf, 583 mmcf, and 582 mmcf of proved undeveloped gas reserves attributable to the Royalty Properties at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(3) Total proved reserves include 2 mbbls, 2 mbbls, and 2 mbbls of proved undeveloped oil reserves attributable to the Royalty Properties at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(4) We do not reflect a federal income tax provision since our partners will include the income of our Partnership in their respective federal income tax returns.
Title to Properties
Our general partner believes we have satisfactory title to all of our assets. Record title to essentially all our assets has undergone the appropriate filings in the jurisdictions in which such assets are located. Title to property may be subject to encumbrances. Our general partner believes that none of such encumbrances should materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest in these properties or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
