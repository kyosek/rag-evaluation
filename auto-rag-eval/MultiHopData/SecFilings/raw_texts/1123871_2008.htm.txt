General Background
From our inception in August 2000 through 2004, we built our asset base and achieved growth primarily through property acquisitions. Beginning in 2005, while we have continued to grow through acquisition, we have shifted our focus to growth through development of our existing properties.
As of December 31, 2008, our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax PV10 value of approximately $651.6 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows of approximately $460.7 million, approximately 75% of which relate to our properties in Texas, approximately 20% of which relate to our properties located in New Mexico, approximately 4% relate to our properties in Oklahoma and less than 1% relate to our properties in Kansas. We spent approximately $475.9 million on acquisitions and capital projects during 2006, 2007 and 2008. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling. We will closely manage our capital expenditures to our cash flow. As commodity prices change we will consider the resulting impact on our cash flow and adjust our capital expenditures up or down accordingly. We have maintained a strong current cash position with no long-term debt; we will continue to seek acquisition opportunities that complement our core assets.
The following table summarizes our total net proved reserves, pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows as of December 31, 2008.
Proved Reserves
Our 65,646,034 Boe of proved reserves, which consist of approximately 85% oil and 15% natural gas, are summarized below as of December 31, 2008, on a net pre-tax PV10 value and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows basis. Our reserve estimates have not been filed with any Federal authority or agency (other than the SEC).
As of December 31, 2008, our Texas proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $473.6 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $340.3 million, our proved reserves in New Mexico had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $142.7 million and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $96.7 million, our proved reserves in Oklahoma had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $34.1 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $22.1 million and our proved reserves in Kansas had a net pre-tax PV10 value of $1.3 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of $1.6 million.
As of December 31, 2008, approximately 31% of the proved reserves have been classified as proved developed producing, or “PDP”. Proved developed non-producing, or “PDNP” reserves constitute approximately 7% and proved undeveloped, or “PUD”, reserves constitute approximately 62%, of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2008.
Total proved reserves had a net pre-tax PV10 value as of December 31, 2008 of approximately $651.6 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $460.7 million, 32.8% or $213.7 million and $152.9 million, respectively, of which is associated with the PDP reserves. An additional $57.0 million and $39.8 million, respectively, is associated with the PDNP reserves, or 8.7% of total proved reserves’ pre-tax PV10 value. The remaining $380.9 million and $269.0 million, respectively, was associated with PUD reserves.

Summary of Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
Significant New Mexico Operations
East Hobbs San Andres Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. In May, 2004 we acquired an 82.24% working interest and a 67.60% net revenue interest in this lease. The property has been in continuous production since that time. “Net revenue interest” is the owner’s percentage share of the monthly income realized from the sale of a well’s produced oil and gas. The net revenue interest is a lesser number as compared to the working interest, due to the mineral owner royalty and other overriding royalties on the well. The lease contains approximately 920 acres, all held by production, on which there are 31 producing wells. We believe the property can support 27 additional wells which are included in our estimate of PUD in this report. We believe the property also has additional potential through waterflooding. A waterflood operation is a method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil. The water from injection wells physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells. These estimates are included in our estimates of PUD potential.
Seven Rivers Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. In May, 2003 we acquired a 71.11% working interest and a 56.91% net revenue interest in this mature waterflood property. The property consists of 2,240 acres, all held by production. The property has 55 producing wells. We believe the property has remaining potential from waterflood expansion but no costs have been budgeted for this development for 2009.
Humphrey Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. We acquired a 100% working interest and a 75.08% net revenue interest in this mature waterflood in December, 2007. The property contains 16 producing wells and approximately 760 acres, all held by production. We believe the property can support activities to drill 22 additional PUD wells, which are included in our reserve estimates.
Langlie Mattix Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. We acquired a 100% working interest and a 75.09% net revenue interest in this mature waterflood property in December, 2007. The property has 16 producing wells on approximately 1,040 acres, all held by production. We believe the property can support activity to drill 24 additional PUD wells, which are included in our reserve estimates.
South Leonard Queen Unit - Lea County, New Mexico. We acquired a 100% working interest and a 75.09% net revenue interest in this mature waterflood in December, 2007. The property contains 7 producing wells on approximately 680 acres with all of the acreage being held by production. We believe the property can support activity to drill four additional PUD wells, which are included in our reserve estimates.
North Benson Queen Unit - Eddy County, New Mexico. We acquired a 100% working interest and a 69.44% net revenue interest in this mature waterflood property in October, 2003. The property has 27 producing wells and contains approximately 1,800 acres, all held by production. We have reactivated the waterflood by constructing a new water supply system, building new injection facilities, and returning previously idle water injection wells to service. We think the property can support workovers in existing wells to open additional zones and drilling 28 additional wells which are included as PUD in our reserve estimate.
Red Lake Unit - Eddy County, New Mexico. In October, 2007 we acquired a 100% working interest and an 80.56% net revenue interest in this property. The lease has 16 producing wells on approximately 1,090 acres, all held by production. We believe the property can support activity to drill three additional PUD wells, which are included in our reserve estimates.
Phillips Lea, Hale State, State 36 and Corbin 35 leases - Lea County, New Mexico. In June, 2008 we acquired a 100% working interest with net revenue interests ranging from 80.31% to 82.81% in these leases. The leases have 16 producing wells on approximately 800 acres, all held by production. We think the property can support workovers in existing wells to open new zones in existing wells and drilling 11 additional wells which are included as PUD in our reserve estimate.
Significant Texas Operations
Fuhrman Mascho leases - Andrews County, Texas. In December 2004 we acquired a 100% working interest and a 75% net revenue interest in these leases. Throughout 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 we acquired working and net revenue interests in additional producing leases and acquired additional undeveloped acreage in and around our Fuhrman Mascho leases. The working interests range from 20-100% and the net revenue interests range from 16-80%. In total, we now own 36,279 acres, with 24,760 acres developed and held by production and the remaining 11,479 acres being undeveloped. We believe the Fuhrman Mascho leases contain considerable remaining potential for San Andres zone PUD drilling. Our reserve estimate includes 499 PUD Grayburg-San Andres wells. The Fuhrman Mascho leases also contain potential for Yates zone gas development from workovers in existing wells and PUD locations. Our reserve estimates include potential development expenditures for 2009 and beyond.
Y6 lease - Fisher County, Texas. We acquired a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in this partially developed waterflood property in June, 2001. There are 15 producing wells on approximately 1,697 acres, which is held by production. We believe the property can support activity to drill four additional PUD wells, which are included in our reserve estimates.
Significant Oklahoma Operations
Ona Morrow Sand Unit - Cimarron and Texas Counties, Oklahoma. We acquired a 100% working interest and an 81.32% net revenue interest in this waterflood property in June, 2001. There are 13 producing wells on approximately 2,120 acres, which is held by production. We believe the property can support three additional PUD wells, which are included in our estimate of PUD.
Eva South Morrow Sand Unit - Texas County, Oklahoma. We purchased a 100% working interest and an 85.41% net revenue interest in this waterflood property in July, 2002. The lease has seven producing wells on approximately 489 acres, which is held by production. We believe this property can support two additional wells which are included in our estimate of PUD.
Midwell, Appleby, Smaltz, and Hanes Leases - Cimarron County, Oklahoma. We acquired a 100% working interest and an 80% net revenue interest in these leases in September, 2002. The leases contain 11 wells on approximately 2,280 acres, which is held by production. We believe the leases contain PUD potential from waterflood operations and six PUD wells, which are included in our estimate of PUD. We began implementing the waterflood operations during 2008 and will continue those efforts during 2009.
Acreage
The following table summarizes gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2008 by region (net acreage is our percentage ownership of gross acreage). Acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded.
Production History
The following table presents the historical information about our produced natural gas and oil volumes.
The average oil sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from oil sales by the volume of oil sold, in Bbl. The average gas sales price amounts above are calculated by dividing revenue from gas sales by the volume of gas sold, in Mcf. The total average sales price amounts are calculated by dividing total revenues by total volume sold, in Boe. The average production costs above are calculated by dividing production costs by total production in Boe.
Productive Wells
The following table presents our ownership at December 31, 2008, in productive oil and natural gas wells by region (a net well is our percentage ownership of a gross well).
Drilling Activity
During 2008 we completed the drilling of 233 wells. All but seven of these wells were drilled on our Fuhrman Mascho properties in Andrews County, Texas, five of which were Yates gas wells with the remainder being San Andres wells. Of the remaining wells drilled, three were on our East Hobbs San Andres Unit in Lea County, New Mexico and one each was drilled on our Y-6 lease in Fischer County, Texas, our Phillips Lea lease in Lea County, New Mexico, our Hale State lease in Lea County, New Mexico and our Homann lease in Gaines County, Texas.
Cost Information
We conduct our oil and natural gas activities entirely in the United States. As noted previously in the table appearing under “Production History”, our average production costs, per Boe, were $6.06 in 2006, $7.34 in 2007 and $7.63 in 2008 and our average production taxes, per BOE, were $3.29 in 2006, $3.61 in 2007 and $4.50 in 2008. These amounts are calculated by dividing our total production costs or total production taxes by our total volume sold, in Boe.
Costs incurred for property acquisition, exploration and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 are shown below.
(1) The amount shown for 2007 for acquisition of proved properties is net of proceeds received from the sale of our interest in the West San Andres property.
Reserve Quantity Information
Our estimates of proved reserves and related valuations were based on internal reports and audited by Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. (Kansas and Oklahoma Properties) and Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. (New Mexico and Texas Properties), independent petroleum engineers, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities.” The estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors.
Our oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States. A summary of the changes in quantities of proved (developed and undeveloped) oil and natural gas reserves is shown below.
Our proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the standardized measure as described below were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 69. Future cash inflows were computed by applying year-end prices to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in producing and developing the proved oil and natural gas reserves at year end, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of properties involved. Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences, tax credits and loss carryforwards relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10% annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value or the present value of our oil and natural gas properties.
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
The changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to the proved oil and natural gas reserves are shown below.
Management’s Business Strategy Related to Properties
Our goal is to increase stockholder value by investing in oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on capital employed. We plan to achieve this goal by exploiting and developing our existing oil and natural gas properties and pursuing acquisitions of additional properties. Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following:
Developing and Exploiting Existing Properties. We believe that there is significant value to be created by drilling the identified undeveloped opportunities on our properties. We own interests in a total of 47,606 gross (35,742 net) developed acres and operate essentially all of the net pre-tax PV10 value of our proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we owned interests in approximately 13,009 gross undeveloped acres (9,757 net). We believe that our current and future cash flow will enable us to undertake the exploitation of our properties through additional drilling activities. We will closely manage our capital expenditures to our cash flow. As commodity prices change we will consider the resulting impact on our cash flow and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly, be it up or down.
Pursuing Profitable Acquisitions. We have historically pursued acquisitions of properties that we believe to have exploitation and development potential comparable to our existing inventory of drilling locations. We have developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing core properties. We have an experienced team of management and engineering professionals who identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. While our emphasis in 2008 and beyond is anticipated to focus on the further development of our existing properties, we will continue to look for acquisition opportunities with existing cash flow from production and future development potential.
Controlling Costs through Efficient Operation of Existing Properties. We operate essentially 100% of the pre-tax PV10 value of our total proved reserves, which we believe enables us to better manage expenses, capital allocation and the decision-making processes related to our exploitation and exploration activities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our oil and gas production costs per Boe averaged $7.63, our oil and gas production taxes per Boe averaged $4.50 and general and administrative costs averaged $5.80 per Boe produced.
Other Properties and Commitments
Our principal executive offices are in a company owned building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This office building has approximately 16,000 square feet. Additionally, we own the building in Hobbs, New Mexico which serves as our primary field office. This office building has approximately 7,500 square feet. We also own an office building in Andrews, Texas for the operation of our wholly-owned subsidiary Arena Drilling Company. This office building has approximately 6,000 square feet. We believe the office space will be adequate for our current operations as well as allowing for continued growth.
