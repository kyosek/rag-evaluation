ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Republic of Poland
The Republic of Poland is located in central Europe, has a population of approximately 39 million people, and covers an area comparable in size to New Mexico. During 1989, Poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy. Since 1989, Poland has enacted comprehensive economic reform programs and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free-market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west, with most of its current international trade with the countries of the European Union and the United States. The economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post-communist era. The Polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable, free-market economy.
Since its transition to a market economy and a parliamentary democracy, Poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change. Poland has developed and is refining legal, tax, and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards. The Polish government has taken steps to harmonize Polish legislation with that of the European Union, which it joined in May of 2004.
Poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies to offset its lack of capital to further explore its oil and gas resources. In July 1995, Poland’s Council of Ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the Polish petroleum sector. So far under this plan, a refinery located in Plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the London and Warsaw stock exchanges. In September of 2005, POGC sold 15% of its stock in an initial public offering on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, raising a total of 2.7 billion Polish zlotys (approximately US$900 million).
Prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during 1989, the exploration and development of Poland’s oil and gas resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence, a centrally controlled economy, limited financial resources, and a lack of modern exploration technology. As a result of these and other factors, Poland is currently a net energy importer. Oil is imported primarily from countries of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, and gas is imported primarily from Russia.
Polish Properties
Legal Framework
General Usufruct and Concession Terms
All of our rights in Poland have been awarded to us or to POGC pursuant to the Geological and Mining Law, which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights. Under the Geological and Mining Law, the concession authority enters into mining usufruct (lease) agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in a designated area or to exploit the designated oil and/or gas field for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions. The holder of the mining usufruct covering exploration must also acquire an exploration concession by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities. The usufruct agreements include provisions that give the usufruct holder a claim for an extension of the usufruct (and the underlying concession), subject to having fulfilled all obligations under the usufruct and/or concession agreements.
Under current law, the concession authority requires that concessions and related usufructs be owned by a single entity, without recognizing any minority record ownership such as would reflect our interest in those areas in which we previously have been granted a minority ownership. As such, our ownership is subject to continued compliance with applicable law, the usufruct and concession terms, and solvency of POGC as the record owner.
The concession authority has granted us oil and gas exploration rights on the Block 287 and Wilga project areas, and has granted POGC oil and gas exploration rights on the Fences project areas. The agreements divide these areas into blocks, generally containing approximately 250,000 acres each. Concessions have been acquired for exploration in all areas that lie within existing usufructs. The exploration period begins after the date of the last concession signed under each respective usufruct. We believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date.
If commercially viable oil or gas is discovered, the concession owner, during the first two years of production, then applies for an exploitation concession, as provided by the usufructs, generally with a term of 25 to 30 years or as long as commercial production continues. Upon the grant of the exploitation concession, the concession owner may become obligated to pay a fee, to be negotiated, but expected to be less than 1% of the market value of the estimated recoverable reserves in place. The concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production, the amount of which will be set by the Council of Ministers, within a range established by legislation for the mineral being extracted. The royalty rate for high-methane gas is currently less than $0.07 per thousand cubic feet, or Mcf. This rate could be increased or decreased by the Council of Ministers to a rate between $0.02 and $0.10 per Mcf (the current statutory minimum and maximum royalty rates). Local governments will receive 60% of any royalties paid on production. The holder of the exploitation concession must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner and could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession.
Existing Project Areas
Fences Project Area
The Fences project area consists of six oil and gas exploration concessions controlled by POGC, including two that were obtained as a result of a public tender in 2007. Three producing fields (Radlin, Kleka, and Kaleje) lie within the concession boundary, but are excluded from the Fences concessions. The original four concessions have expiration dates ranging from July 2008 to September 2012. Remaining work commitments in the aggregate for the four original concessions include acquiring: 200 kilometers of 2-D seismic data, 180 sq. km. of 3-D seismic data, and drilling two wells. POGC has filed an extension for the concession expiring in 2008 which we expect to be granted. The exploration period for the two new concessions will start after they are granted in 2008. The total work commitment for the two concessions is outlined in two phases: Phase I - three years: 260 kilometers of 2-D seismic data; Phase II - three years: drilling two wells.
Block 287 Project Area
The Block 287 project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us. Several producing fields also lie within this concession’s boundaries, but are excluded from the Block 287 project area. The concession is for a period of six years ending in December 2009. Work commitments included acquiring 100 kilometers of new 2-D seismic data or drilling one well, which was satisfied by the drilling of the Drozdowice-1 well, and analysis and interpretation of existing well data. Beginning in the fourth year, there is a drilling requirement of a second well that will be satisfied by re-entering and producing the Grabowka gas field.
Wilga/Block 255 Project Area
The Wilga project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us that expires in August 2009. The remaining period carries a work commitment of trial production of the Wilga gas-condensate field and 165 kilometers of 2-D seismic data.
Northwest Project Area
The Northwest project area consists of seven blocks originally awarded in October 2006, and four additional blocks that were awarded as part of a public tender in 2007. The total work commitment for the original seven blocks was outlined in three phases: Phase I - one year: reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing data; Phase II - two years: acquiring 960 kilometers of new 2-D seismic data; Phase III - three years: drilling seven wells. As a result of our analysis of existing data during Phase I, we dropped two of the original seven blocks in 2007. In January 2008, we began the acquisition of 220 kilometers of 2-D seismic data in three of the remaining five blocks. For the four new blocks, the exploration period will start after the concessions are granted in 2008. The total work commitment for the four new blocks is outlined in two phases: Phase I - three years: 280 kilometers of 2-D seismic data; Phase II - three years: drilling four wells.
Project areas added in 2007
Lublin/Warsaw South Project Area
This project area is adjacent to Block 255 and consists of five single exploration concessions granted in June, July, and September of 2007 for a period of six years. The total work commitment for the five concessions is outlined in three phases: Phase I - one year: reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing data; Phase II - two years: acquiring 630 kilometers of new 2-D seismic data; Phase III - three years: drilling five wells.
Kutno Concession
The Kutno concession consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession granted in March 2007 for a period of six years. The total work commitment is outlined in three phases: Phase I - one and one half years: reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing data; Phase II - two years: drilling one well; Phase III - two and one half years: drilling one well.
As of December 31, 2007, all required usufruct/concession payments had been made for each of the above project areas. Usufruct/concession payments on new concessions obtained beginning in 2006 are payable in annual installments over a three-year period.

Production costs include lifting costs (electricity, fuel, water, disposal, repairs, maintenance, transportation, and similar items), and contract operator fees. Production costs do not include such items as general and administrative costs; depreciation, depletion and amortization; or Polish income taxes.
Poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan, commercial, industrial, and gas production areas, including significant portions of our acreage. Poland has a well-developed infrastructure of hard-surfaced roads and railways over which oil and/or light crude oil produced can be transported for sale. There are refineries in Gdansk and Plock in Poland and one in Germany near the western Polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in Poland. Should we choose to export any oil or gas we produce, we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval.
We are currently selling all of our oil and gas production in Poland to POGC or one of its affiliates. Gas is sold pursuant to long-term sales contracts, typically for the life of each well, which obligate POGC to purchase all gas produced. Individual oil sales are negotiated with POGC-affiliated entities and are not subject to sales contracts.
United States Properties
Producing Properties
In the United States, we currently produce oil in Montana and Nevada. All of our producing properties, except for the Rattlers Butte field (an exploratory discovery during 1997), were purchased during 1994. A summary of our average daily production, average working interest, and net revenue interest for our United States producing properties during 2007 follows:
In Montana, we operate the Cut Bank and Bears Den fields and have an interest in the Rattlers Butte field, which is operated by an industry partner. Production in the Cut Bank field, producing since the 1940s from an average depth of approximately 2,900 feet, is from a waterflood program with 120 producing oil wells, 29 active injection wells, and one active water supply well. The Bears Den field, under waterflood since 1990, is producing oil from five wells at a depth of approximately 2,430 feet, with one active water injection well. In the Rattlers Butte field, discovered during 1997, we own a 6.3% working interest in two oil wells producing at a depth of approximately 5,800 feet and one active water injection well.
In Nevada, we operate the Trap Springs and Munson Ranch fields and have an interest in the Bacon Flat field, which is operated by an industry partner. In the Trap Springs field, discovered in 1976, we produce oil from a depth of approximately 3,700 feet from one well. In the Munson Ranch field, discovered in 1988, we produce oil at an average depth of 3,800 feet from five wells. In the Bacon Flat field, discovered in 1981, we produce oil from one well at a depth of approximately 5,000 feet.
Production, Transportation and Marketing
The following table sets forth our average net daily oil production, average sales price and average production costs associated with our United States oil production during 2007, 2006, and 2005:
_______________
(1)
Production costs include lifting costs (electricity, fuel, water, disposal, repairs, maintenance, pumper, transportation, and similar items) and production taxes. Production costs do not include such items as general and administrative costs; depreciation, depletion and amortization; state income taxes, or federal income taxes.
We sell oil at posted field prices to one of several purchasers in each of our production areas. We sell all of our Montana production, which represents over 94% of our total oil sales, to CENEX, a regional refiner and marketer. Posted prices are generally competitive among crude oil purchasers. Our crude oil sales contracts may be terminated by either party upon 30 days’ notice.
Oilfield Services - Drilling Rig and Well-Servicing Equipment
In Montana, we perform, through our drilling subsidiary, FX Drilling Company, Inc., a variety of third-party contract oilfield services, including drilling, workovers, location work, cementing, and acidizing. We currently have a drilling rig capable of drilling to a vertical depth of 6,000 feet, a workover rig, two service rigs, cementing equipment, acidizing equipment, and other associated oilfield servicing equipment.
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Our proved oil and gas reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Operating costs, production taxes, and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information. Such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors. No price escalations were assumed, and no amounts were deducted for general overhead, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense. The proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on December 31, 2007, of $93.68 per Bbl of oil and $5.61 per Mcf of gas in Poland and $81.07 per Bbl for oil in the United States. The determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive, as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves, projecting future rates of production, and the timing and amount of development expenditures. The estimated present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of the future net cash flows, the Standardized Measure of Future Net Cash Flows (“SMOG”), or PV-10 Value, was determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 69, “Disclosure About Oil and Gas Activities,” and SEC guidelines. Our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change.
Estimates of our proved United States oil reserves were prepared by Larry Krause Consulting, an independent engineering firm in Billings, Montana. Estimates of our proved Polish gas reserves were prepared by RPS Energy, an independent engineering firm in the United Kingdom. No estimates of our proved reserves were filed with or included in any report to any other federal agency during 2007.
The following summary of proved reserve information as of December 31, 2007, represents discounted, after tax estimates net to us only, and should not be construed as exact:

Government Regulation
Poland
Our activities in Poland are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties, including the adoption of new laws, regulations, or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights; political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies; export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes; foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations; repatriation limitations; inflation; environmental regulations; and other matters. These operations in Poland are subject to the Geological and Mining Law dated as of September 4, 1994 (as amended), and the Protection and Management of the Environment Act dated as of January 31, 1980 (as amended), which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection. Agreements with the government of Poland respecting our areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection. Participants in oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities generally are required to: (1) adhere to good international petroleum industry practices, including practices relating to the protection of the environment; and (2) prepare and submit geological work plans, with specific attention to environmental matters, to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition, exploratory drilling, and field-wide development. Poland’s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the United States. We intend to conduct our operations in Poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and, as they continue to develop, Polish requirements.
United States
State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production
Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state, and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.
Our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations. States in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas, including provisions regarding deliverability. Such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir. Certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.
Environmental Regulations
The federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities, and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. These laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operating wells. We may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA ‘90. In addition, we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident. As with any owner of property, we are also subject to clean-up costs and liability for hazardous materials, asbestos, or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws, rules, and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation, storage, transfer, and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA, however, excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, gas, or geothermal energy.” Because of this exclusion, many of our operations are exempt from RCRA regulation. Nevertheless, we must comply with RCRA regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the RCRA exclusion.
The OPA ‘90 and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. OPA ‘90 establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into “waters of the United States.” While OPA ‘90 liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water, at least one district court has held that OPA ‘90 liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters.
Stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future, such as proposals made in Congress and at the state level from time to time, that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal, and clean-up requirements. The impact of any such changes, however, would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production.
Federal and Indian Leases
A substantial part of our producing properties in Montana consists of oil and gas leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management or by the Blackfeet Tribe under the supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Our activities on these properties must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry, including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing Indian nation. Our operations on Indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including, in some instances, the employment of tribal members. We believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations.
Safety and Health Regulations
We must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Currently, we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations. However, since such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations.
Title to Properties
We rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the Polish government in connection with our activities in Poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination. We regularly consult with our Polish legal counsel when doing business in Poland.
Nearly all of our United States working interests are held under leases from third parties. We typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations. We have obtained such title opinions or other third-party review on all of our producing properties, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Our United States properties are subject to typical burdens, including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes, but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties. Further, we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates. Title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling, as is standard practice in the industry.
Employees and Consultants
As of December 31, 2007, we had 40 employees, consisting of nine in Salt Lake City, Utah; 20 in Oilmont, Montana; one in Greenwich, Connecticut; three in Houston, Texas; and seven in Poland. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. We also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological, geophysical, and other professional services. Our executive officers and other management employees regularly travel to Poland to supervise activities conducted by our staff and others under contract on our behalf.
Offices and Facilities
Our corporate offices, located at 3006 Highland Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah, contain approximately 3,500 square feet and are rented at $3,400 per month under a month-to-month agreement. In Montana, we own a 16,160 square foot building located at the corner of Central and Main in Oilmont. We also have an office in Warsaw, Poland, located at Ul. Chalubinskiego 8, which we rent for approximately $4,300 per month.
