ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
GENERAL
The Company (through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership) owns 14 Office Properties encompassing an aggregate of approximately 2.0 million rentable square feet and 12 Industrial Properties encompassing an aggregate of approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet. Eleven of the 14 of the Office Properties as well as 11 of the 12 Industrial Properties are located in Southern California suburban submarkets (including a complex of three Office Properties located adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport, presently the nation's second largest air cargo port, and a complex of five Office Properties located adjacent to the Long Beach Municipal Airport). The Company also owns three Office Properties located adjacent to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in the State of Washington, and one Industrial Property located in Phoenix, Arizona. As of December 31, 1996, the Office Properties were approximately 79.6% leased to 130 tenants and the Industrial Properties were approximately 98.3% leased to 21 tenants. The Company (through its predecessor entities) has developed, managed and leased all but two of the 14 Office Properties and all but five of the 12 Industrial Properties. The Company believes that all of its Properties are well- maintained and, based on recent engineering reports, do not require significant capital improvements.
In addition to the Office and Industrial Properties, the Company has development rights with respect to approximately 24 acres of developable land (net of acreage required for streets), located in Southern California. The Company also has the option to purchase three office properties and 18 acres of undeveloped land currently beneficially owned and controlled by John B. Kilroy, Sr. and John B. Kilroy, Jr. All of these properties are managed by the Company.
In general, the Office Properties are leased to tenants on a full service basis, with the landlord obligated to pay the tenant's proportionate share of taxes, insurance and operating expenses up to the amount incurred during the tenant's first year of occupancy ("Base Year") or a negotiated amount approximating the tenant's pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses ("Expense Stop"). The tenant pays its pro rata share of increases in expenses above the Base Year or Expense Stop. All leases for the Industrial Properties are written on a triple net basis, with tenants paying their proportionate share of real estate taxes, operating costs and utility costs.
