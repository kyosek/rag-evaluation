Item 2. Properties
Our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico, Alabama and in Texas. The offshore fields are found in water depths ranging from less than ten feet up to 4,200 feet. The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically results in high production rates. The reservoirs in our onshore fields are generally characterized as having low porosity and permeability and require stimulation and artificial lift to produce. The following describes our ten largest fields as of December 31, 2011, based on quantities of proved reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis. At December 31, 2011, these fields accounted for approximately 84% of our proved reserves.
(1) Determined by the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the prices per Mcfe for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.
Index to Financial Statements Our Fields
On December 31, 2011 we had two fields of major significance (having proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis). The Spraberry field is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Ship Shoal 349 field is located on the conventional shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Below is a description of these fields.
Spraberry Field (Yellow Rose Properties).
The Spraberry field is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. W&T acquired a 100% working interest in approximately 21,900 net acres in connection with the acquisition of the Yellow Rose Properties in May 2011 and acquired approximately 9,500 net acres earlier in 2011. The Spraberry Field was discovered in 1935 and extends over several counties in West Texas comprising about 1.6 million acres. The field is 150 miles long and 75 miles wide, and it has undergone much change and expansion over the years, both aerially and vertically. The correlative interval is now over 3,500 feet thick and includes the Clearfork, Upper Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Dean, and Wolfcamp formations. These formations are correlative over the area but are lenticular in nature and vary in thickness, porosity, and permeability even over short distances. The general completion technique includes hydraulic fracturing and installation of sucker rod pumps. W&T is currently employing a three rig drilling program to continue developing the field.
From 2006 through 2011, 119 wells were drilled on acreage in which we currently have an ownership interest and 118 were successful, including 29 wells we drilled to target depth subsequent to our acquisition of the Yellow Rose Properties. Cumulative field production during this time was 2 MMBoe (11 Bcfe) from our wells. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in the Spraberry field were 28.1 MMBoe (168.5 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from the Spraberry field from the acquisition date of May 11, 2011 through December 31, 2011. As we have had limited history operating the Spraberry field, the amounts below may not be representative of future results.
(1) One thousand barrels of oil (“MBbl”).
(2) One thousand barrels of oil equivalent (“MBoe”).

(3) Barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”).
(4) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs.
Ship Shoal 349 Field (Mahogany). Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 30 MMBoe gross (179 Bcfe gross). This field is a sub-salt development with five productive horizons below salt at depths up to 17,000 feet. As of December 31, 2011, 24 wells have been drilled, of which 15 have been successful. In 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan. As a result, in 2011, we drilled one development well and one exploration well. In January 2012, the third well was spud as part of an ongoing drilling program. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 20.3 MMBoe (121.7 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years.
(1) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs.
The following is a description of the remainder of our top ten properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2011, of which five are located on the conventional shelf and three are located in the deepwater. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of our total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Viosca Knoll 783 Field. (Viosca Knoll 783 Lease (Tahoe) and Viosca Knoll 784 Lease (SE Tahoe)) The Viosca Knoll 783 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 140 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,500 to 1,700 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll blocks 783 and 784, with subsea tiebacks to two platforms in Main Pass 252. Shell discovered the Tahoe prospect in 1984 and the SE Tahoe prospect in 1996.
Index to Financial Statements
We acquired a 70% working interest in Tahoe lease and a 100% working interest in SE Tahoe lease from Shell in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 88 MMBoe gross (526 Bcfe gross). The Tahoe prospect is a supra-salt (above the salt layer) development with two productive horizons at depths ranging to 10,300 feet. The SE Tahoe prospect is also a supra-salt development with one productive horizon at a depth of 9,325 feet. As of December 31, 2011, 16 wells have been drilled at the Tahoe prospect, of which eight have been successful and one successful well has been drilled at the SE Tahoe prospect. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 260 Bbls of oil per day, 860 Bbls of NGLs per day and 18.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 4.3 MBoe per day (25.6 MMcfe per day).
Fairway Field (Fairway Properties). Fairway is comprised of Mobile Area blocks 113 (Alabama State Lease #0531) and 132 (Alabama State Lease #0532) and located in 25 feet of water, approximately 35 miles south of Mobile, Alabama. We acquired our 64.3% working interest, along with operatorship in the Fairway field, from Shell in August 2011. The field was discovered in 1985 with Well 113 #1 (now called JA). Development drilling began in 1990 and was completed in 1991 with the addition of four wells, each drilled from separate surface locations. The five producing wells came on line in late 1991. As of December 31, 2011, six wells have been drilled, all of which were successful. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 117 MMBoe gross (704 Bcfe gross). This field is a Norphlet sand dune trend development with one producing horizon at an approximate depth of 21,300 feet. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged seven Bbls of oil per day, 1,365 Bbls of NGLs per day and 14.6 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 3.8 MBoe per day (22.8 MMcfe per day).
Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2011, 42 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 34 were successful. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 46 MMBoe gross (275 Bcfe gross). In early June 2010, a third party pipeline that was used to transport production from the field was shutdown due to damage. A new line was installed and the production rerouted at the end of March 2011. During 2010 and 2011, additional wells were successfully drilled, recompleted or workovers were performed which increased production and added reserves. Production from the field resumed in April 2011 and is currently at a higher daily rate than before the pipeline shutdown. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 444 Bbls of oil per day, 425 Bbls of NGLs per day and 19.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 4.2 MBoe per day (25.2 MMcfe per day).
Mississippi Canyon 243 Field. (Matterhorn) Mississippi Canyon 243 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 2,552 feet of water. The field area covers Mississippi Canyon block 243, with a single production platform on Mississippi Canyon block 243. Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine discovered the field in 2002. We acquired a 100% working interest in the field from Total in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 21 MMBoe gross (124 Bcfe gross). This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 9,850 feet. As of December 31, 2011, 17 wells have been drilled, of which eight have been successful. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 3,150 Bbls of oil per day, 288 Bbls of NGLs per day and 11.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 5.3 MBoe per day (32.0 MMcfe per day).

which ten have been successful. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 153 Bbls of oil per day, 76 Bbls of NGLs per day and 5.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1.2 MBoe per day (7.3 MMcfe per day).
Main Pass 98 Field. Main Pass 98 field consists of Main Pass blocks 98 and 180. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 55 miles east of Venice in 91 feet of water. We acquired our 100% working interest in these blocks from NCX in 2009. The field produces from low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands located between two merging, generally south dipping faults. The productive interval is Middle Miocene Bigenerina Humblei. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately four MMBoe gross (21 Bcfe) gross. As of December 31, 2011, 11 wells have been drilled, of which seven have been successful. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 371 Bbls of oil per day, 113 Bbls of NGLs per day and 5.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1.4 MBoe per day (8.3 MMcfe per day).
Brazos A-133 Field. Brazos A-133 field is located 85 miles east of Corpus Christi, Texas in 200 feet of water. The field was discovered in 1978 by Cities Service Oil Company with production commencing in the same year. There are five active platforms, three of which are production platforms. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 144 MMBoe gross (861 Bcfe gross) from the Middle Miocene Tex W and Big Hum sections. The bulk of the production is from the Big Hum CM-7 sand, which is a 4-way closure downthrown to the Corsair Fault and bisected by antithetic faults. The top of the CM-7 sand is at a subsea depth of 12,000 feet. Since its discovery, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 17 were successful. We own a 25% working interest that was obtained through a transaction with Kerr-McGee. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged nine Bbls of oil per day and 6.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1.1 MBoe per day (6.4 MMcfe per day).
Main Pass 283 Field. Main Pass 283 field consists of Main Pass blocks 284, 279 and 283 and Viosca Knoll Block 734. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 75 miles east of Venice in 315 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 50% to 100%, in a transaction with ConocoPhillips. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Cristellaria I. Cumulative field production through 2011 is approximately 28 MMBoe gross (168 Bcfe gross). As of December 31, 2011, 18 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 14 were successful. During December 2011, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 738 Bbls of oil per day, 227 Bbls of NGLs and 4.7MMcf of natural gas per day, for total production of 1.7 MBoe per day (10.5 MMcfe per day).
Proved Reserves
Our estimated proved reserves totaled 116.9 MMBoe (701.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011. The mix by product was 44% oil, 15% NGLs and 41% natural gas determined using the conversion ratio noted below. The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price per Mcfe for natural gas, oil and NGLs may differ significantly from each other. Our proved reserves were estimated by NSAI, our independent petroleum consultant.
Index to Financial Statements Our proved reserves are summarized below. These reserve amounts are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies.
(1) In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2011 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2011. Prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials. For oil, the West Texas Intermediate posted price was used in the calculation and, after adjustments, a price of $97.36 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For NGLs, a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the oil realized price. Then, this ratio was applied to the oil price using SEC guidance. The NGLs price of $51.30 per Bbl was used in computing the amounts above. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was used in the calculation and the adjusted price of $4.11 per Mcf was used in computing the amounts above. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production, development costs and ARO are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
(2) Bcfe and MMBoe are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price per Mcfe for oil and NGLs may differ significantly from the price per Mcf for natural gas. Similarly, the price per Bbl for oil may differ significantly from the price per Bbl for NGLs.
(3) We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs and excludes ARO. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate and no inflation of current costs. Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO are financial measures prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures are valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
Index to Financial Statements The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in millions):
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves increased to 116.9 MMBoe (701.1 Bcfe) at December 31, 2011 from 80.9 MMBoe (485.4 Bcfe) at December 31, 2010, primarily as a result of acquisitions discussed in Item 1, Business, which added 39.0 MMBoe (234.1 Bcfe) estimated as of the date of acquisition. Estimated proved reserves also increased 5.3 MMBoe (32.0 Bcfe) due to extensions and discoveries resulting from our participation in the drilling of 19 successful exploratory wells (gross) and increases resulting from well completions, recompletions and workovers. In addition, reserves increased from revisions of previous estimates by 8.6 MMBoe (51.0 Bcfe). Partially offsetting these increases were declines associated with production of 16.9 MMBoe (101.5 Bcfe). See Financial Statements - Note 22 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2011 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 23 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 27 years. He has over 34 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 20 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis. Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering has served in that capacity since 2005, after having served as our Reservoir Engineering Manager since 2003 and has been with the Company since 1998. Prior to joining the Company, he served as a Reservoir and Facilities Engineer with Exxon and later as a Reservoir Engineer with Collarini Engineering, Inc. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Florida in 1977 and a Master of Science degree in Environmental Engineering from Tulane University in 1995.
Index to Financial Statements Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. In our December 31, 2011 reserve report prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, NGLs represented approximately 15% of our total proved reserves compared to 5% as of December 31, 2010. Due to the increase in the percentage for NGLs, we have reported NGLs separately from oil and have changed the presentation of prior periods for comparability. We convert Bbl to Mcfe using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil, condensate or NGLs. This conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency and the prices on a volume equivalent basis may differ substantially between each other.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2011, as estimated by our independent petroleum consultant, were 40.5 MMBoe (242.9 Bcfe). Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2011 were estimated at $471.4 million. As of December 31, 2010, our proved undeveloped reserves were 15.7 MMBoe (94.1 Bcfe).
Our proved undeveloped reserves by field as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
Index to Financial Statements During 2011, we drilled three development wells at our Main Pass 108 field, only one of which resulted in the reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. As shown in the table above, all of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with this field as of December 31, 2010 were either reclassified to proved developed or removed from our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2011.
During 2011, we drilled one development well and one exploration well at our Ship Shoal 349 (Mahogany) field. Also during the year, we had one well sand up that caused reserves previously classified as proved developed to be reclassified to proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we decided to accelerate production from another well, which resulted in the movement of reserves previously classified as proved non-producing reserves to proved undeveloped reserves. We are currently drilling the third well of a potentially six well drilling program at the Mahogany field that commenced in 2011 and is expected to continue through 2013. This program is expected to result in the reclassification of a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves in this field. Please see Our Fields above under this Item 2 for a description of our Mahogany field, which is our largest offshore field from a reserve standpoint.
The proved undeveloped reserves at our Mississippi Canyon 243 field and Viosca Knoll 823 fields were obtained through acquisitions completed in 2010 and development of both of these fields is expected to continue.
In May 2011, we acquired the Yellow Rose Properties, which contributed to a significant increase in proved undeveloped reserves between 2010 and 2011. Reserves for the Yellow Rose Properties as of December 31, 2011 consisted of 28.1 MMBoe (168.5 Bcfe), of which 19.4 MMBoe (116.1 Bcfe) was classified as proved undeveloped. See Business under Part I, Item 1, Our Fields in Item 2 above and Financial Statements - Note 2 - Acquisitions under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the Yellow Rose Properties. In the Yellow Rose Properties, we completed 27 development wells and three exploration wells from the acquisition date of May 11, 2011 to December 31, 2011 and plan on drilling approximately 46 development wells in 2012.
We believe that we will be able to develop all of the reserves classified as proved undeveloped at December 31, 2011 within five years from the date such reserves were recorded. Our capital budget for 2012 is up 37% from our 2011 capital budget, with 61% dedicated to development activities, split 63% offshore and 37% onshore. The capital allocated to our offshore development activities will assist us in converting the proved undeveloped reserves at the Mahogany field to proved developed producing reserves. The expected expenditures for offshore development represent a significant increase over both 2010 and 2011 expenditures.
Acreage
The following summarizes our leasehold at December 31, 2011. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 82% of our total net offshore acreage is developed and approximately 9% of our total net onshore acreage is developed. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects on the majority of our acreage.
Index to Financial Statements For the offshore undeveloped leasehold, none of our rights will expire in 2012, 33,740 net acres (36%) could expire in 2013, 26,841 net acres (29%) could expire in 2014, 26,503 net acres (29%) could expire in 2015, and 5,760 net acres (6%) could expire in 2016 and beyond. For the onshore undeveloped leasehold, our rights to approximately 143,531 net acres (91%) could expire in 2012, 9,839 net acres (6%) could expire in 2013, 3,777 net acres (3%) could expire in 2014, and five net acres could expire thereafter. Of the undeveloped onshore leasehold, there are 140,885 net acres that can be extended by drilling two additional wells in 2012 and further extended by additional operations or production in future years. In making decisions regarding drilling and operations activity for 2012, we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage.
Our net offshore acreage decreased 35,560 net acres (6%) from December 31, 2010 and our net onshore acreage increased 168,790 net acres from a minor ownership position as of December 31, 2010. The reduction in our net offshore acreage was attributable to certain offshore leases that terminated. This reduction was partially offset by the offshore property interests acquired in the Fairway Properties. The increase in our net onshore acreage is primarily attributable to the Yellow Rose Properties acquisition and leasehold interest acquired in East Texas.
Production
For the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, our net production averaged 278.2, 238.4 and 259.7 MMcfe per day, respectively. Production increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2011 and the resumption of operations in certain fields that had been shut down from June 2010 to March 2011 due to pipeline outages. Production decreased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the two pipeline outages and divestitures completed in 2009, partially offset by acquisitions completed in 2010.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil, NGLs and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three fiscal years.
Refer to the descriptions of our ten largest fields reported earlier in this Item 2, Properties, for historical information about our produced volumes from our Spraberry field and Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years, each of which have proved reserves exceeding 15% of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Selected Financial Data - Historical Reserve and Operating Information under Part II, Item 6 of this Form 10-K for additional historical operating data.
Index to Financial Statements Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2011 in our productive oil and natural gas wells. A net well is our percentage working interest of a gross well.
Offshore Wells
Onshore Wells
All Productive Wells
(1) Includes eight gross (5.0 net) oil wells and seven gross (6.2 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
Drilling Activity
As presented in the tables below, our drilling activity increased in 2011 compared to 2010. Our onshore drilling activity increased due to the acquisition of the Yellow Rose Properties and additional leasehold interests acquired in Texas.
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and equipment of $719.0 million included $437.2 million for acquisitions, an adjustment for funds received of $5.7 million related to a 2010 acquisition, $77.6 million for exploration activities, $179.7 million for development activities and $30.2 million for seismic, capitalized interest and other leasehold costs.
In managing and tracking our drilling activity, we use target depth as the criteria to determine when a well is reported as drilled and use this criteria internally, in the field descriptions reported above and in press releases. This differs from the SEC’s criteria of using completion to determine when a well is counted as drilled. Historically, the period between reaching target depth and completion has been relatively short for us. Using the completion criteria creates minor differences in reported wells drilled. For 2011, using target depth as the criteria, we had 54 total gross wells drilled. Using the SEC criteria of completion, we had 48 gross wells drilled. There was one well difference in 2010 and 2009 between the two criteria. The tables below are based on the SEC’s criteria of completion to determine successful wells drilled.
