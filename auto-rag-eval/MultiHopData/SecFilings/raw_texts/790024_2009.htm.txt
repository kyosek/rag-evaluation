Mining Licenses
Inner Mongolia Xiangzhen Mining Group Co Ltd. (Xiangzhen Mining) holds the mining licenses of the area between prospecting line 21 and 04 of Sumochaganaobao Fluorite Deposit. The mining license Number is 1500000820156, issued by the Bureau of Land and Resources in April 2008, Wulanchabu City, Inner Mongolia and expires in March 2011.
Previous exploration and development
In 1975, Geological Survey Brigade No.1 of Inner Mongolia conducted a 1/200,000 geological survey in this area and found Sumochaganaobao Fluorite deposit. The mineral resource was estimated at 1.716 million metric tons of fluorite at that time.
From 1981 to 1987, Geological Survey Brigade No.102 of Inner Mongolia conducted prospecting with continual general and detailed exploration, and completed the “Geological Report of Sumochaganaobao Fluorite Deposit of Siziwangqi, Inner Mongolia” in 1987.
In 1987, the property was mined by a state-owned company, which was later reorganized to become the Siziwangqi Northern Fluorite Ltd, Co in 1997. The mining right was then transferred to Xiangzhen Mining Group Co., Ltd from the Siziwangqi Northern Fluorite Ltd, Co.
Previous Mining Operation and Expansion
From 1987 to 2002, open-pit mining was conducted by a state-owned company of Siziwang Banner. The mining capacity was 8,000-20,000 tons per year and the mining depth reached 58m from elevation of 1,065m to 1,007m. In 1997, the mining right was transferred to Inner Mongolia Siziwangqi Northern Fluorite Ltd, Co.
Since 2002, the underground mining has been conducted by Xiangzhen Mining. Initially, the mining capacity was 80, 000 metric tons per year with a concentrator (about 45km southeast of the mine) with an annual processing capacity of 60,000 metric tons. In April 2006, the Company started an expansion. The new mining capacity designed is 300,000 metric tons per year and the treatment capacity is 200,000 metric tons per year from a concentrator located near the fluorite mine. At the end of 2007 when the expanding construction had basically been completed and commissioning started. The Company had invested USD$2,895,380 in underground expansion and USD$7,760,300 in the new concentrator.
Water and Power Supply
Before October 2007, a state power network was not built into the mining area, and power for production and living was supplied by diesel generators. Since October 2007, power has been supplied to the mine by the state power network.
Water supply for production and living is from three wells about one kilometer away from the mine.
Current Mining Operation
Inclined shaft development has been assumed. As a result, currently there are one main inclined shaft, one auxiliary inclined shaft and inclined shaft No.2.
Hoisting and transportation: Underground transportation is carried out by electric locomotives. After loading by rock loaders, ores are transported by the electric locomotive to a shaft station and then lifted to ground by the hoister and unloaded onto a storage platform where high grade lumps (CaF2>80%) are directly sold to consumers (steel plant) after manual classification and the remaining is sent to concentrator for further processing.
Ventilation: fresh air is blown in from the main inclined shaft, passes through the work area and is exhausted out from the auxiliary inclined shaft and inclined shaft No. 2.
Drainage system: water in each level flows into sumps of drifts and is pumped to a pond on a higher level on the ground for secondary use in production.
Mining Method: Short-hole shrinkage stopping method with the mining loss at 25% and dilution at 10% and comprehensive recovery rate of ore at 75%.

The processing recovery is 83%. Fluorite concentrate grade is over 96%. The main component of fluorite is CaF2, an important chemical that is used in steel making as a flux and in glass making as an additive. The concentrates are in high demand and demand is expected to increase in the future.
Geology of the Property
The Sumochaganaobao fluorite deposit is located in the Suniteyou Banner Fold Zone in late-Varican, Inner Mongolia Fold Belt. The main strata in the property are: late Paleozoic lower Permian System Xilimiao Formation (P1xl) with three sections: P1xl2-4, P1xl3, and P1xl4-1; Proterozoic Ailegemiao Formation and Jurassic Chagannoer group. The fluorite mineralized body and mineralization marble occurs in the lower of P1xl3 and on the top of P1xl2-4.
The mineralized body is bedded, which strikes 40°-60°, dips to 310°-330° at angle 21°-40°, exceptional with 47°. The distribution is stable and continual. The length of mineralized body is 1100 meters; the maximum dip length controlled at present is 1540 meters. The thickness is 0.52 meters to 22.48 meters averaged at 5.80 meters. The mineral is fluorite only, whose main composition is CaF2. The gangue minerals are: quartz, chlorite and sericite. By the contents of useful component, the mineralized body is divided to high grade mineralized material (rich ore), CaF2≥60%, and low grade mineralized material (lean ore), 20% ≤ CaF2≥ 60%.
Mineralized Materials
In March 2007, the Bureau of Land and Resource of Wulanchabu City commissioned the Land-resources Institute of Inner Mongolia to verify the mineralized materials in the Mining License area. The Institute submitted “the Verification Report of Resources/Reserve between Prospecting line 21 and 04, of Sumochaganaobao Fluorite Deposit in Siziwangqi, Inner Mongolia.” The “Consulting Center of the China Mining Association” had reviewed and assessed the verification report and recognized the mineralized material statement in the report, and the indicated mineralized materials were confirmed as 5.051 million metric tons of fluorite with the average grade of 57.58%. In 2009, we extracted a total amount of 47,900 metric tons of fluorite ore, which consumed 57,500 metric tons of the indicated mineralized materials. There are 4.83 million metric tons of retained mineralized materials.
Sampling, Analytical Procedures and Quality Control
The core recovery is over 85% for the drill holes. The samples were taken by splitting the core into halves, one half being the sample and the other half being stored in the core box. Sample length was usually 0.5 meters to 1.5 meters and core recovery is over 85%.
Trenching samples were collected along channels with widths of 10 centimeters and depths of 5 centimeters and in parallel along the walls of the pits. Each sample was 1 to 2 meters in length.
Samples are crushed by three jaw crushers to 0.9mm in size and then are split. About 500 grams of each sample is sent for pulverization and the rest are kept as coarse rejects. 100 grams of each pulp sample are sent to the lab for assaying and the rest are stored. Items of CaF2, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe2O3 and S are assayed in the lab.
Assaying of samples was completed in the laboratory of Geological Brigade No.102 of Inner Mongolia and checked by the Central Laboratory of Bureau of Geology of Inner Mongolia. Internal and external check samples were assayed: 95% of samples sent for internal checkup and 6.4% for external checkup. The qualification rate of the check samples was above 95%. The criteria of Barite, Fluorite and Boron Exploration were also adopted in sample assaying.
Products and Output:
The mine produces fluorite ores which are classified into two commodities, one being high grade fluorite lumps and the second being fluorite powders processed in concentrator. The following table lists the products and output and the average prices in past three years:
Table 2-3: The Output and Price of Products of 2007-2009, Xiangzhen Mining
Potential for Further Exploration
In June 2007, the Company hired the Third Geological Prospecting Institute of China Metallurgy Geological General Bureau to conduct supplementary prospecting. As result of it, Category of this fluorite mine is upgraded.
There is low possibly to find new ore bodies or extensions to existing ore bodies since the deposit is well defined and well understood geologically.

History of Operation
Qingshan Metal had been in operation for 3 years before it was acquired by the Company. The Mining Project was designed by the Inner Mongolia Metallurgy Design Institute, and the mining capacity designed was 60,000 metric tons per year. The actual mining capacity is 50,000 metric tons of ores per year, of which copper ores account for about 40,000 metric tons and the remaining pertains to 10,000 metric tons of zinc and lead ores.
Geology of the Property
Qingxing Copper Mine is located at west part of the Langshan-Baiyunebo geotectogene, north boundary of North China Platform. The main strata spread over the mine area are Zhaetaishan Formation member 2 (Pt2zh2) and member 3 (Pt2zh3).
The Zhaetaishan member 2 (Pt2zh21) consists of three sequences which are set forth below.
Upper Sequence (Pt2zh23): mineralized bodies occur in this sequence which is comprised of mica quartz schist, carbonaceous mica quartz schist and carbonaceous phyllitic quartz schist.
Middle Sequence (Pt2zh22): carbonaceous slate, carbonaceous phyllite, banded carbonaceous quartzite, bearing-carbon quartzite, dark quartzite and tremolite, diopsidite etc.
Lower Sequence (Pt2zh21): lower part consists of carbonaceous phyllite; carbonaceous slate inter-bedded calcareous chlorite schist, chlorite quartz schist and lens of crystal carbonate, followed by biotitic quartz schist, andalusite-mica schist and bearing-carbon mica quartz schist.
The Zhaetaishan member 3 (Pt2zh3) consists of lower sequence of quartz schist and upper sequence of middle-thick quartzite inter-bedded thin quartzite.
The strata occur as monocline which strikes southwest and dips to northwest at 30-89 ° . All faults were formed after the metallic mineralization that re-constructed the mineralized -bodies.
Mineralized bodies, strictly controlled by the stratum, are blind and covered by gossans. There are two known mineralization zones, mineralization zone 3# and mineralization zone 5#. Zone 3# is distributed in north of the property which is 500 meters long and 10-30 meters wide, within which the mineralized body No.1 Cu-1 and No.2 Zn-1, No.3 Zn-2 were defined. Zone 5# is distributed in middle-south of the property which is 850 meters in length and 10-40 meters in width, where mineralized body No.4 Cu-2, No.5 Zn-3 as well as No.6 Zn-4 were defined.
Main metallic minerals are comprised of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite and main gangue consists of quartz, calcite and chlorite.
Mining and Extraction technical conditions:
Mineralized body is inclined with the occurrence stratified and stratoid with small thickness but stable. It has simple conditions of hydrogeology and engineering geology with well stability of slake on top of mineralized body. In topography, incision is deep. It is available with good conditions of pit mining.
The Current Situation of the Mine
When the mine was acquired by the Company, the mining system already existed. Adit development system has been assumed.
Transportation: Underground transportation is carried out by electric locomotives. After they are loaded by rock loaders, ores are transported by the electric locomotive underground, and then lifted to ground by the hoister and unloaded onto a storage yard.
Ventilation: fresh air is blown in from sublevel adit, passes through the work area and is exhausted out from the special shaft of ventilation connected to ground.
Drainage system: Adit development has the conditions of underground water naturally discharged from waterway in adits.
Mining Method: Short-hole shrinkage stopping method with the mining loss at 25% and dilution at 15% and comprehensive recovery rate at 80%.

Power and Water Supply
There is a 10 KV power supply line for mining production. Water is supplied by a special water pipe line from the He Tao Plain about 5 kilometers to the south of the Mining Ares.
Mineralized Materials
In January 2007, Wulatehouqi Qingshan Non-ferrous Metals entrusted No.3 Geological Exploration Institute of China Metallurgy Geological Bureau to conduct the supplementary geological survey on the “Tanyaokou Multi-Metal Zinc-copper Mine”, between prospecting line 42-58. The final supplementary geological survey was reported in May 2007, which confirmed the mineralized materials and category within the mining area. As of December 31, 2009, the total retained indicated mineralized material is 1.81 million metric tons with the average grade at 0.6%. Our plan for 2009 was to carry out exploration and prepare for mining in the first half of the year, and start mining in the second half of the year and then supply ores to Qianzhen. Due to the decrease in the price of copper, Qingshan did not move on to mining in 2009.
Potential for Further Exploration
In the mining process, two mining tunnels in 1 ,390m level and in 1,350m level intercepted Cu-2 mineralized body which improves the control degree and has increased the resources of Cu-2 mineralized body from 0.0286 million metric tons to 1.3778 million metric tons. Our geological consultant believes that if further exploration is conducted in the future, more minerals could be defined. Drilling will upgrade some of the mineralized materials to Category C (332). Underground exploration (associated with mining operation) should upgrade the mineralized material categories, and explore the extension deeply. In 2009, 356 meters of drilling holes was completed in exploration.
Keyinbulake Cu-Zn Property in Development Stage (Xingzhen Mining)
Xingzhen Mining owns 100% of the Keyinbulake Multi-Metal Property. Before 2004 it was operated by Xinjiang Tianxiang New Tech Co. Ltd (“Tianxiang”) and Mr. Li Leyi together. On April 28, 2006 Xiangzhen Mining acquired 80% of the ownership, and on June 25, 2007 Xiangzhen acquired another 10% from Tianxiang. By December 31, 2007, Xiangzhen Mining owned 90% of Xingzhen Mining. The other 10% is owned by Xinjiang Tianxiang New Technology Development Co., Ltd (5%) and an individual shareholder (5%).
Location and Traffic
Keyinbulake Multi-Metal Property is located in Buerjin County, Aletai, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The coordinates are E 87º17′30″-87º9’30”, N 47º58′30” - 47º59′45”, and the area is in 3.59 km 2 . It is 65 kilometers west-north of Aletai city, and 60 kilometers east-north of Buerjin County, and 26 km east-north of Dulaiti town. With the highway from Aletai city to Dulaiti Town passing through the property, it is conveniently accessible. Figure 2-4 is the index map of the Keyinbulake Multi-Metal Property.

Previous Geological work:
In June 2006, the Company conducted geological explorations in the mining area by means of ground geophysical prospecting and drilling as well as underground Pitting exploration and drilling. At the end of 2007, ground drilling completed 5909 meters and underground exploration 4322 meters and underground drilling 7389 meters.
In 2009, IP sounding work in geological prospecting was carried out. The information of the mineral formation conditions and the genesis of ore bodies given by IP sounding shows that Keyinbulake Copper-Zinc Mine belongs to the submarine volcanogenic sediments. The analysis on the data of exploration shows that within the mineralized belt the ore bodies continue along with the strike and distribute in parallel and en echelon arrangement. The method of sounding indicates that the inclined deepening of the ore-bodies in this area is longer than the length of their strike prolongation. There are five high-polarization abnormal zones found through IP sounding methods and they coincide in space and positions with the known copper-zinc ore bodies controlled under current underground extraction, which confirms that Keyinbulake Copper-Zinc Mine exists with high potential of ore prospecting and the previous work greatly assists the Company to delimit the accurate target area for further verification.
Ore Processing:
In April 2007, the Company began to build a concentrator in the mining area with a daily processing capacity of 600 metric tons (200,000 metric ton/annually). Such a concentrator started to be put into a trial operation in May 2008.
The process of concentrator consists of two-stage closed crushing with one stage grindings, flotation of copper primary and zinc secondary, scavenging, two steps of dehydrating (thickening and filtrating). The final products are copper concentrates and zinc concentrates. The major equipment is as follows:
