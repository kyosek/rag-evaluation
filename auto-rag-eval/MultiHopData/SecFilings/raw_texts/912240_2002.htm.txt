The ALF and SNF Properties consist of four ALFs, eight SNFs and two senior resident apartment complexes. As of January 31, 2003, the MOB Properties were 97.5% leased to 426 tenants and the ALF and SNF Properties were 100% leased to operators or under contracts with management companies. The Company’s MOB tenants are primarily established medical practitioners representing a cross section of medical practices.
Description of the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties
MOB Properties
The Company, through its MOB operations, acquires, develops, manages and leases MOBs, a research and development building a parking facility and two retail facilities. Developing and managing MOBs differs from developing and managing conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of physicians and their patients. Because doctors now perform a variety of medical procedures in their offices, many MOBs have become sophisticated ambulatory centers that allow for outpatient surgery and procedures. In addition, MOBs generally have higher maintenance requirements in the public areas due to heavy foot traffic, many short appointments that increase demand on parking facilities, the use of sophisticated medical equipment requiring increased plumbing and electrical capacity and expanded environmental regulations that impose more stringent restrictions on the disposal of medical waste. The management of MOBs also generally requires experience in specialized tenant improvements and higher levels of responsiveness required by medical practitioners. Additional important management functions include the placement of tenants to accommodate increased space needs and managing the tenant mix at properties to facilitate referrals by practitioners with different specialties within the building. The Company stresses meeting these and other special demands of MOB tenants.
ALF and SNF Properties
The Company, as part of its overall strategy, acquires, develops and leases ALFs and SNFs. The Company typically leases its ALFs and SNFs to third party senior care operators. The operation of ALFs and SNFs requires a high level of experience and expertise due to the specific needs of the residents and the complex administrative functions surrounding the admission and care of residents and the administering of government programs. The operators of ALFs and SNFs must also maintain a positive relationship with local hospitals and other medical providers in order to attract new residents. The Company considers all of the above factors when leasing its facilities to third party operators or hiring managers to operate its facilities.
The health care industry is facing various challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure to reduce medical delivery costs. Substantially all of the Company’s tenants are in the medical profession and could be or have been adversely affected by the new Medicare prospective payment system, cost containment and other health care reform proposals. In the past two years, the Company has changed managers at two of its ALFs and six of its SNFs in response to financial difficulties encountered by the managers or dissatisfaction with the operating results of the managers. Any future proposals that limit access to medical care or reduce reimbursement for physicians’ services may also impact the ability of the Company’s tenants to pay rent. However, the Company believes that the aging population in the United States, combined with other recent trends in the health care industry, such as the performance of non-acute procedures outside of hospitals, could spur increased demand for space in full service MOBs that contain surgery centers and out-patient facilities, such as those owned by the Company.
The following tables set forth certain information regarding each of the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties as of January 31, 2003. All of the MOB Properties and ALF and SNF Properties are held in fee by the Company or, in the case of jointly-owned properties, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company. Except as noted below, the Company owns 100% of each property.

(“HNH”), a nonprofit corporation. Lenox Healthcare, Inc. (“Lenox”) managed the three facilities from October 1998 through December 1999. In November 1999, Lenox filed for bankruptcy protection. The Company immediately moved to replace Lenox as the manager of the nursing homes. In January 2000, the Company received the bankruptcy court’s permission to replace Lenox as the manager and a new management firm, a subsidiary of Roush & Associates (“Roush”), was immediately retained. Since acquiring the properties from HNH, HNH has held the licenses necessary to operate the facilities. In March 2000, the Company successfully transferred the licenses to G&L Massachusetts, LLC, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.

Leases
MOB Properties
As of January 31, 2003, the MOB Properties were approximately 97.5% leased. New leases and extensions are normally granted for a minimum of three to five years and provide for annual rent increases. Office tenants generally have gross leases whereby rents may be adjusted for a tenant’s proportionate share of any increases in the cost of operating the building. However, the Company has recently been leasing office space with provisions for the tenants to pay all utility costs directly. Most retail tenants have net leases and pay their share of all operating expenses including property taxes and insurance. The following is a lease expiration table setting forth the number, square feet and associated annual rent for those leases expiring in future years.
MOB Properties-Lease Expirations
The Company was successful in obtaining lease renewals, achieving a weighted average renewal rate of approximately 85.9% on MOB leases that expired during 2002. Although there can be no assurance that this renewal level will be maintained, the Company believes this high renewal rate is due in part to the tendency of medical practitioners to continue to practice in the same space over a number of years. Also, the Company’s tenants frequently invest large sums of money in equipment and fixtures for their offices. Furthermore, relocating a doctor’s office can be disruptive to the patients who are familiar with the doctor’s office location.
Senior Care Loans
Lending Operations
From 1995 through 1999, the Company was in the business of originating loans secured by healthcare properties. Since 1999, the Company has made no secured loans and has exited the business of originating loans. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had seven loans outstanding that total approximately $6.3 million before reserves of $4.5 million. The seven loans are described in the following paragraphs.
In October 1999, the Company provided $1.65 million of bridge financing for a $9.0 million apartment complex located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The borrower sold the apartment complex in December 1999 through a tax-exempt bond offering to NVHF Park Chase, LLC (“NVHF”), a not-for-profit company. As part of its loan repayment, the Company received approximately $380,000 in cash. For the remaining balance, the Company received $1.26 million in tax-exempt, subordinated B-bonds from the offering. The tax-exempt bonds are due in December 2029 and bear interest at 8.75% per annum. In addition, the Company received a 10-year, 10%, $560,000 unsecured note from NVHF Affiliates, LLC, the parent company of NVHF. The Company is also the guarantor on a $300,000 letter of credit in favor of NVHF Affiliates, LLC.
In December 1997, the Company funded $4.6 million into an escrow, to be loaned to Aspen Paso Robles, Inc. (“Aspen”) for the purchase of (i) a 59-bed nursing and rehabilitation center in Chico, California; (ii) a 38-bed SNF in Paso Robles, California; and (iii) a 57-bed intermediate care center in Beaumont, California. The loan closed on February 25, 1998 although the funds for the Beaumont facility remained in escrow until October 1998 at which time the Company secured the return of those funds and applied them to pay down the loan balance to $3.6 million. The borrower subsequently filed a Chapter 11 proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 1999, the remaining $3.6 million loan balance was in default and the two facilities securing the loan were closed. In March 2000, the Company obtained title to the two SNFs from the bankruptcy court. In May 2002, the Company sold the Paso Robles facility for $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding loan balance was fully reserved. The Company is currently pursuing legal action against the borrower and other parties involved in the transaction in order to recover the remaining outstanding balance.
In addition to the notes discussed above, the Company had six other loans outstanding at December 31, 2002, with an aggregate face value of $6.8 million, excluding approximately $0.4 million of additional accrued, unpaid interest. The following is a summary of the four other loans as of December 31, 2002:
•
$150,000 note secured by second deed of trust, interest payable semiannually at a rate of 10.0% per annum. This note is fully reserved and currently in default.
•
$104,000 unsecured promissory note due July 1, 2000, interest payable at 10.0% per annum. This note is fully reserved and currently in default.
•
$1,000,000 unsecured promissory note due September 1, 2000, interest payable at 10.0% per annum. This note is fully reserved and currently in default.
•
$290,000 unsecured promissory note due April 11, 2003, interest payable at 10.0% per annum.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had reserves of $4.5 million for doubtful notes receivable. Management believes that $4.5 million is appropriate in relation to the status of the loans in the Company’s portfolio as of March 31, 2003.
Notes Receivable from Stockholders
In addition to the seven loans discussed above, the Company also has two unsecured promissory notes totaling $5,240,000 due on October 31, 2011 with interest payable at 30-day LIBOR plus 7.5% per annum. The borrowers on these two notes are Daniel M. Gottlieb and Steven D. Lebowitz, the Company’s chief executive officer and president, respectively. These notes were issued in connection with the Company’s acquisition of its outstanding common stock on October 29, 2001. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from its $35 million loan from GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corp. to fund these notes. Messrs. Gottlieb & Lebowitz used these proceeds to fund a $3.5 million tender offer for the Company’s Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and repay $1.7 million of personal debt. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these notes.
GLN
GLN was formed with Nomura Asset Capital Corp. (“Nomura”) for the purpose of making short-term loans to third parties to purchase senior care facilities. As of December 31, 2002, GLN had no loans outstanding. In May 1997, GLN funded a secured loan of approximately $1.5 million to a limited partnership created to acquire a recreational vehicle (“RV”) park in Florida for approximately $1.2 million. This loan bore interest at a rate of approximately 9.0% per annum and matured on May 1, 1999. The loan provided for monthly payments of interest only. In January 2002, the borrower sold the property for approximately $1.8 million and repaid GLN in full. GLN distributed the net proceeds to Nomura and the Company and is in the process of dissolving.
Insurance
The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to the MOB Properties and certain ALF and SNF Properties. There are certain types of losses that may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable; moreover, there can be no assurance that policies maintained by the Company will be adequate in the event of a loss. The Company carries earthquake and flood insurance for coverage of losses up to $35 million on the MOB Properties and certain ALF and SNF Properties located in California and Arizona, which amount represents approximately 25% of the net book value of these properties. This coverage is subject to a 10% deductible up to the amount of insured loss. The ALF and SNF Properties located in Washington and Massachusetts do not carry earthquake or flood insurance. Thirty-one of the 39 properties directly or indirectly owned by the Company are located in Southern California, which has a history of seismic activity, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake that damaged the Holy Cross Medical Plaza property. Two ALF and SNF Properties owned by the Company are located in Phoenix, Arizona, in an area with a history of flood activity. Where the Company does not directly insure against casualty or liability, the Company requires the lessees or operators of its ALF and SNF Properties to maintain such insurance and name the Company and its subsidiaries as additional insured with full rights of a direct beneficiary in the event of loss. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in, and anticipated earnings and cash flow from, a property.
