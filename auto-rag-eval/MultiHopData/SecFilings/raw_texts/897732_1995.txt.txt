Item 2. Properties. - ------ ----------
GENERAL. Conrail Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania on February 12, 1993 and on July 1, 1993 became the holding company of Consolidated Rail Corporation. Consolidated Rail Corporation is Conrail Inc.'s only significant subsidiary and primary asset. Conrail Inc.'s common stock is listed on the New York and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges.
Consolidated Rail Corporation is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated on February 10, 1976 to acquire, pursuant to the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the rail properties of many of the railroads in the northeast and midwest region of the United States which had gone bankrupt during the early 1970's, the largest of which was the Penn Central Transportation Company ("Penn Central").
Reports on Form 10-K for years prior to 1993 were filed by Consolidated Rail Corporation, and historic data presented herein and therein reflect the results of Consolidated Rail Corporation for those time periods. Unless otherwise indicated, references to Conrail prior to July 1, 1993 denote Consolidated Rail Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to Conrail after July 1, 1993 denote Conrail Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
RAIL OPERATIONS. Conrail, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Consolidated Rail Corporation, provides freight transportation services within the northeast and midwest United States. Conrail interchanges freight with other United States and Canadian railroads for transport to destinations within and outside Conrail's service region. Conrail operates no significant line of business other than the freight railroad business and does not provide common carrier passenger or commuter train service.
Conrail serves a heavily industrial region that is marked by dense population centers which constitute a substantial market for consumer durable and non-durable goods, and a market for raw materials used in manufacturing and by electric utilities. Conrail's traffic levels and, as a result, its financial performance are substantially affected by its ability to compete with trucks and other railroads, the economic strength of the industries and metropolitan areas that produce and consume the freight Conrail hauls and the traffic generated by Conrail's connecting railroads. Conrail remains dependent on non-bulk traffic, which tends to generate higher revenues than bulk commodities, but also involves higher costs and is more vulnerable to truck competition.
THE SERVICE GROUP SYSTEM. Beginning in 1994, Conrail's Marketing and Sales Department and related segments of its Operating Department were organized into four service groups: CORE Service, Intermodal Service, Unit Train Service and Automotive Service. Petrochemicals and waste products,
food and agriculture products, forest and manufactured products, and metals are handled by the CORE Service Group. The Intermodal Service Group handles intermodal trailers and containers. The Unit Train Service Group handles coal and ore traffic. The Automotive Service Group handles automotive parts and finished vehicles. Each of these groups controls the integrated planning, pricing and operating functions that will enable them to tailor services, develop products and make capital investments directed toward the special requirements of their respective customers.
Revenues for the Service Groups for 1991 through 1995, together with total annual traffic volumes, are set forth in the following tables.

CORE Service Group. ------------------- In 1995, revenues and volume for this service group declined 1.9% and 5.1%, respectively, from 1994. All lines of business comprising the CORE Service Group experienced a greater decline in units than in revenue, as the result of initiatives in the second half of 1994 designed to selectively rationalize lower margin business and increase prices.
PETROCHEMICALS AND MINERALS: This commodity group consists of a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural and organic chemicals, plastic pellets, soda ash, construction minerals, petroleum products and waste. The majority of traffic is joint-line and the primary flows are between Louisiana and Texas, (as originating sources), and Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (as destination points). This commodity group's customer base and origin/destination pair mix are both large and diverse, with none occupying a dominant position in terms of Conrail's traffic volume or revenues. Conrail's traffic in this commodity group increased in 1992 and 1993, leveled off in 1994, and declined slightly in 1995, with revenue and volume down 3.1% and 4.6%, respectively. Revenues from petroleum and plastics products, which accounted for one-fourth of this group's volume in 1995, declined approximately 6% as the result of lower demand for plastics.
The largest component of this business is chemical traffic, accounting for approximately 47% of the revenue and 42% of the volume in 1995. This traffic includes chlorine, smaller volumes of other hazardous chemicals and non-hazardous substances which, if spilled or released into the atmosphere, could be dangerous and could result in significant liability to Conrail. Under catastrophic circumstances, such liability could exceed Conrail's $300 million in insurance coverage for such accidents. It is impossible to
eliminate the risk of such liability; however, Conrail has not experienced any significant liability as a result of an accident involving chlorine or any other such substance. Furthermore, Conrail has safety procedures designed to prevent the occurrence of such accidents, or limit their impact should they occur, and works in concert with chemical manufacturers to reduce the risks in transporting these commodities, subscribing to the policies and procedures defined under Responsible Care partnerships. Several incidents in 1995, including derailments and the December 22 collision involving Conrail trains at Effingham, Illinois, involved hazardous substances. The recovery procedures were safely executed and potential liability from the hazardous substances was mitigated.
Increasing regulation by federal, state and local governments of the transportation and handling of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and waste has increased the administrative burden and costs of transporting certain commodities in this group.
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE: This commodity group includes fresh and processed food products moving primarily in boxcars, and grain and grain products moving in covered hopper and tank cars. Conrail's revenue for this group increased in 1994, but declined in 1995, with food and agriculture revenue and units down 2.1% and 8.2%, respectively. The decline in volume occurred in both the food products and agriculture areas as the result of price increases targeted at low margin business. In addition, the large 1994 eastern grain harvest decreased demand for midwest feed grain shipments into Conrail's eastern service territory in 1995.
FOREST AND MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS: This commodity group includes paper and wood products moving in boxcars, certain lumber and related products moving on flatcars and general manufactured commodities moving in boxcars. These commodities generated $329 million in revenue in 1995. A volume decline of 3.9% was offset by price increases, which yielded a slight revenue increase of less than 1%. Price increases targeted at low-margin general manufactured products business was primarily responsible for the decline in volume.
METALS: This commodity group includes scrap ferrous products and semi- finished, finished and sheet steel. In 1994, this group had substantial increases in units and revenue, as the result of market share gains from trucks and higher levels of steel production reflecting increases in North American vehicle production. In 1995, revenue and units declined 2% and 4%, respectively, compared to 1994, primarily as the result of increased truck competition and selective price increases on lower margin business.
Intermodal Service Group. ------------------------- Conrail continues to be one of the rail industry's leaders in handling intermodal traffic, although volume and revenue declined 7.3% and 5.5%,
respectively, in 1995 from 1994's record levels. Conrail handled nearly 1.5 million units of intermodal traffic in 1995.
Conrail's intermodal traffic consists of three segments. The first segment is Conrail's parcel/package traffic, which principally involves shipments for the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service and less-than- truck-load companies. The U.S. Postal Service contracts for over 1,000 origin-destination points were rebid successfully for two years in 1995.
The second segment is domestic traffic, which includes a variety of commodities and customers. Traffic in this segment declined approximately 8.5% in 1995, primarily due to reduced traffic from intermodal marketing companies (or third party freight consolidators and brokers), reflecting slower economic growth in the Northeast and increased price competition from trucks. Traffic from major truckload companies continued to increase, as did traffic from Triple Crown Services Company, which is jointly owned by Conrail and Norfolk Southern Corporation.
International container traffic constitutes the third segment of Conrail's intermodal traffic. International container traffic chiefly involves goods produced in the Pacific Basin and shipped by rail from west coast ports to east coast markets. Conrail and its western railroad connections are able to participate in this traffic because they have established superior transit times compared with the all-water route through the Panama Canal. Conrail also participates in traffic moving through Atlantic ports for import and export trade with European and Mediterranean markets. Revenue from Conrail's international intermodal traffic decreased slightly (less than 1%) from 1994.
In 1995, Conrail completed its project to raise clearances through Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including those on Conrail's route from Harrisburg, PA to Hagerstown, MD where Conrail connects with the Norfolk Southern Corporation. The completion of this project will enable Conrail to provide more efficient double-stack service in these corridors.
Unit Train Service Group. ------------------------- In 1995, revenues for this service group increased by approximately 4.4%, despite a 5.4% decrease in traffic volume. This was primarily as the result of a greater than 10% increase in revenue per unit, due to the elimination of a large, but low revenue, short-haul coal move.
Utility coal traffic, which makes up the majority of Conrail's coal business, decreased 12.4% with a 3.7% decline in revenue in 1995. This decline in volume reflects a very mild winter, which reduced coal consumption by utilities. In addition, utilities began to maintain lower than usual stock piles in 1995, as they attempted to reduce costs in response to deregulation of their industry. Utility coal moves from mines located on and off Conrail's system to electric utilities located on Conrail. Annual traffic volumes fluctuate with the inventory practices of
the electric utilities, their use of alternative sources of energy and the weather. The utilities in Conrail's service territory increased their use of nuclear fuel in 1995 over 1994, but such use did not reach the near capacity levels of 1993.
The federal acid rain legislation enacted in October 1990, which requires electric utilities to significantly limit sulfur dioxide emissions from their generating plants by burning lower sulfur coal or installing emissions control devices, has reduced demand for the higher sulfur coal from mines on Conrail's system, particularly in central Pennsylvania. Phase one of the regulations was effective January 1, 1995. As the result of declining demand, in December 1994, Conrail sold its lines serving coal mines in central Pennsylvania. However, the decline in the volume of coal from mines located in central Pennsylvania is being offset, in part, by an increase in Conrail's handling of lower sulfur coal from sources on Conrail- owned lines on the former Monongahela Railway Company and in southern West Virginia.
Export, industrial/cogeneration and metallurgical coal represent the three remaining segments of Conrail's coal traffic, with export coal volumes being one-third greater than industrial/cogeneration volumes and more than twice as great as metallurgical coal volumes.
Export coal traffic volume increased 58% in 1995, after having increased 28% in 1994. Revenue in 1995 increased approximately 64%. In 1993 and 1992, this traffic had declined significantly from the record levels of 1991. The increase in 1995 resulted from the increased competitiveness on the world market of the low-cost, high BTU, mid-sulfur coal produced by mines served by Conrail's Monongahela lines.
Conrail's traffic volume and revenue for industrial/cogeneration coal increased 12% in 1995, primarily as the result of the initiation of service to two new cogeneration facilities. These facilities may be among the last congeneration facilities opened on Conrail, as deregulation of the utility industry has eliminated the utilities' economic incentives to support them.
Conrail's traffic volume and revenue from metallurgical coal continues to decline, having decreased 8.6% in 1995 after a decline of 10% in 1994. Revenue in 1995 was down approximately 13.4%. Except for a slight increase in 1993, this business has declined in each year since 1989, as the domestic steel industry continues to eliminate inefficient production capacity and as competition for the industry's remaining transportation requirements increases.
Conrail serves directly, or via short line switching carriers, many of the nation's largest active integrated steel production facilities. Although a significant portion of the active domestic steel industry is along the Cleveland-Chicago corridor on Conrail's system, the traditional domestic steel industry (using integrated steel production facilities) continues to eliminate inefficient production capacity, which in past years
has adversely affected the volume of raw materials for steel production handled by Conrail, and could continue to do so. In late 1995, Bethlehem Steel, one of Conrail's largest customers, closed its steel producing facility at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This, along with similar trends in the industry, reduced coke and iron ore volume by approximately 17%, with a corresponding 15% reduction in revenue, from 1994. Volume in this segment is expected to continue to decline in 1996.
Automotive Service Group. ------------------------- In 1995, Conrail's automotive parts and finished vehicles traffic suffered from the weak domestic economy and the 3% decrease in North American vehicle production from 1994. Despite this decrease in domestic production, finished vehicles volume increased 3%, while automotive parts volume decreased 2%. Finished vehicles revenue increased 1%, with auto parts revenue decreasing 5%. As a whole, 1995 volume for this group increased approximately 1%; however, revenues were down 1.6%. In terms of revenues, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler were among Conrail's five largest customers in 1995.
This commodity group, especially the automotive parts segment, is subject to vigorous truck competition. Nevertheless, Conrail was able to increase its automotive parts market share by offering new products and logistics services designed to compete with short-haul trucks. Conrail's vehicles traffic is subject to significant competition from other railroads.
During 1995, Conrail's automotive parts and finished vehicles traffic continued to be favorably affected by the strength of the yen against the U.S. dollar, which created incentives for foreign-based domestic manufacturers to shift additional production to the United States and to export domestically produced vehicles. Also in 1995, this group experienced an increase in automotive parts and vehicle traffic to and from Mexico as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
CERTAIN STATISTICS. The following tables provide various measurements relating to Conrail's rail operations from 1991 through 1995:

(2) Reportable train accidents for 1992 have been restated to include 6 incidents that occurred in 1992, but were reported in 1993.
COMPETITION. Conrail's rail operations face significant competition from trucks, from other railroads, and from the availability of the same or substitute goods produced at points not served by Conrail. The trucking industry is especially competitive in Conrail's service area because, on average, freight in this region is moved shorter distances than in the West, and the cost characteristics of the railroad and trucking industries generally make trucks more competitive over shorter distances.
Price and service competition from trucks, while present for all commodities, is especially evident in the movement of intermodal freight, auto parts, and finished steel. Competition from trucks has been increased by the passage of legislation removing certain barriers to entry into the trucking business and allowing the use of wider, longer, and heavier trailers and multiple trailer combinations. Larger trailers and multiple trailer combinations have substantially increased productivity in the trucking industry, and any future legislation permitting further increases in truck capacity could have a substantial adverse effect on the competitiveness of railroads.
CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation are Conrail's principal railroad competitors. Conrail is also subject to competition from smaller, regional railroads. The assets of the Delaware & Hudson Railway Company ("D&H"), a regional competitor of Conrail's, have been purchased by a subsidiary of CP Rail, a large Canadian railroad. CP Rail's use of D&H's former tracks, coupled with additional trackage rights it has obtained, has resulted in increased rail competition in Conrail's service area. Certain of Conrail's railroad competitors have become multi-modal transportation companies by purchasing previously independent water carriers or small shipment motor carriers, or both, and have thereby extended their operations into Conrail's service area. In addition, recent changes in rail products and technology have expanded the scope of rail service beyond the physical limitations of lines, which has resulted in increased railroad competition.
An important influence on Conrail's competitive position is regulation by the Federal government. Prior to 1980, regulation significantly inhibited the ability of railroads to respond to changing transportation markets. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 ("Staggers Act") substantially reduced the restrictions of regulation. In particular, railroads were given more opportunity to reduce costs and more freedom to adjust prices, which enabled them to compete more effectively and to adjust prices quickly to reflect competitive circumstances. Under the Staggers Act, the former Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC") deregulated a significant amount of railroad traffic, including intermodal and most boxcar traffic, finished vehicles and miscellaneous commodities moving in other types of equipment.
The Staggers Act further enhanced railroads' competitive options by permitting the use of railroad-shipper contracts for traffic still regulated, under which the parties can set the price, service standards and term for a special transportation movement. These contracts generally provide for prices lower than tariff rates and many do not guarantee that
any given amount of freight will be shipped during their term. As of December 31, 1995, Conrail was a party to 3,826 such contracts for regulated traffic, which Conrail estimates accounted for 36% of its line- haul revenues in 1995. Although some contracts have a term longer than one year, most contracts are for one year or less. The majority of Conrail's multi-year contracts are subject to cost-related adjustments that provide for flat percentage increases. The cost-based provisions in certain of these contracts are tied to indices formerly under the jurisdiction of the ICC. Action to adjust these indices for productivity gains by the railroads has had an adverse impact on Conrail's ability to recover costs under such contracts, which accounted for less than 3% of Conrail's line haul revenues in 1995.
Effective January 1, 1996, pursuant to the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the authority of the ICC to regulate railroads was transferred to the Department of Transportation ("DOT") to be administered by the Surface Transportation Board. The prior regulatory scheme remains substantially intact, with the following significant changes: (1) access to freight railroad tracks by rail operators (both freight and passenger) operating on behalf of local governmental authorities has been eased; (2) some types of abandonments may take appreciably longer; (3) tariffs and most contracts will no longer be filed (other mechanisms are required for advising customers of rates and rate changes); (4) minimum rate levels will no longer be regulated; and (5) DOT will not regulate railroad issuances of securities or assumptions of debt. Other changes will require development of new regulations and/or of a body of precedent before their impact can be fully assessed.
PROPERTY. Conrail directly holds no real property. The only significant property holdings are those of Consolidated Rail Corporation.
As of December 31, 1995, Consolidated Rail Corporation (excluding its subsidiaries) maintained 17,715 miles of track including track for crossovers, turnouts, second main, other main, passing and switch track, on its 10,701 mile route system. Of total route miles, 8,860 are owned, 100 are leased or operated under contract and 1,741 are operated under trackage rights, including approximately 300 miles operated pursuant to an easement over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. As of December 31, 1995, virtually all track over which at least 10 million gross tons moved annually (6,274 track miles) was heavy-weight rail of at least 127 pounds per yard, and 100% of such track had continuous welded rail. Continuous welded rail reduces track maintenance costs and, in general, permits trains to travel at higher speeds. As of December 31, 1995, Conrail had 9,493 miles of continuous welded rail on track it maintained.
As of December 31, 1995, all of the 4,972 track miles maintained for fast freight traffic had a maximum operating speed of 50 MPH or more, and 58% had a maximum operating speed of at least 60 MPH. As of December 31, 1995, approximately 96% of the track over which at least 10 million gross tons moved annually was governed by automatic signal systems. In all, as
of December 31, 1995, 7,656 miles of track were controlled by automatic signal systems.
Conrail is engaged in an ongoing process to identify certain under- utilized rail lines and other underperforming assets to avoid future capital costs and to improve its return on assets. Conrail recorded a $285 million charge in 1995 to cover the expected losses upon disposition of approximately 1,800 miles of lines and other assets not required to support Conrail's service. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. Previously, the expected losses upon disposition of similar assets were included in the 1991 special charge. See Note 5 to the Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The following table indicates the number of locomotives and freight cars owned (or subject to capitalized leases) and includes 21,948 freight cars used by Conrail under operating leases. These total figures are as of December 31, 1995, and include stored or surplus units, but exclude subsidiaries other than Consolidated Rail Corporation, which have an immaterial number of locomotives and freight cars:

(2) Freight cars which did not move during the seven days immediately preceding December 31, 1995 and which were available for loading. The number of surplus freight cars during 1995 fluctuated due to variations in traffic and fleet adjustments.
On December 31, 1995, the average age of Conrail's road locomotives, not including stored-serviceable units, was 14.8 years (or 10.5 years defining "road locomotive" as those with 3,000 horsepower and above). The average age of the total locomotive fleet was 15.2 years, and the average age of the total freight car fleet was 22.1 years.

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR. Including subsidiaries, Conrail's average number of employees for 1995 was 23,510. Consolidated Rail Corporation (excluding subsidiaries) averaged 22,631 employees in 1995, 86% of whom are represented by a total of 14 labor organizations and are covered by 22 separate collective bargaining agreements.
Conrail is currently engaged in collective bargaining with the labor organizations representing its union employees, which commenced on November 1, 1994. During 1995, CRC reached an agreement with approximately 300 of its employees represented by the Fraternal Order of Police. In addition, a tentative agreement was reached with approximately 4,000 of its employees represented by the United Transportation Union through negotiations carried on by the National Carriers' Committee, of which CRC is a member. The outcome of these various efforts cannot be predicted at this time. If the parties are unable to reach agreement through direct negotiation, either party may invoke the mediation services of the National Mediation Board;
there is no time limit on the mediation process. If the Mediation Board eventually concludes that its efforts to resolve the dispute will not be successful, it will proffer binding arbitration. If either side refuses to arbitrate, there is a 30-day "cooling-off" period during which the Board may make a finding that the dispute threatens "substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service." Such finding is then presented to the President of the United States who has the option of appointing an Emergency Board to investigate the dispute. If the President does not appoint an Emergency Board, the parties are free to resort to self help at the conclusion of the above-mentioned cooling-off period.
If the President does appoint an Emergency Board, it has 30 days to investigate the dispute and report its findings. The Emergency Board's findings are non-binding; although the parties must maintain the status quo for a period of 30 days following the Board's report, any party which rejects the Board's findings may thereafter resort to self help. In the event of a strike, Congress has the power to resolve the dispute by enacting legislation, including legislation imposing a labor contract in accordance with the findings of the Emergency Board.
Under a decision by the United States Supreme Court on April 28, 1987, rail unions have the right, under the Railway Labor Act and other federal laws, to engage in secondary picketing against any railroad. As a result, a labor dispute between one railroad and a union can cause a strike to spread to any other railroad, or to all other railroads, whether or not the union has a collective bargaining agreement or a dispute with such other railroads. There is also the potential that railroads may be subject to secondary picketing in the event of a strike in the airline industry, which, like the railroad industry, is subject to the Railway Labor Act.
Should Conrail or its subsidiaries be the subject of a strike or secondary picketing, Conrail's rail operations could be severely curtailed or stopped.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION. Conrail is subject to environmental, safety, and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, and its rail operations are also regulated by the DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), state Departments of Transportation and some state and local regulatory agencies.
The DOT has jurisdiction over, among other things, rates charged for certain traffic movements, service levels and freight car rents. It also has jurisdiction over the situations and terms under which one railroad may gain access to another railroad's traffic or facilities, extension or abandonment of rail lines, consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of rail common carriers and of other carriers by rail common carriers, and labor protection provisions in connection with the foregoing.
Under the Staggers Act, federal regulation of rates and services was reduced. The regulatory scheme, now administered by the Surface
Transportation Board, continues the ICC's prior deregulation of rates for intermodal traffic, most boxcar traffic and a series of miscellaneous commodities, including steel and automobiles. In addition, railroads are free to negotiate contracts with shippers setting rates, service standards and the terms for movements of other kinds of traffic. As a result, railroads have greater flexibility in adjusting rates and services to meet revenue needs and competitive conditions. For further discussion of the abolition of the ICC and the effect of the transfer of its regulatory authority to DOT, see "Competition."
The FRA has jurisdiction over safety and railroad equipment standards.
Conrail's rail operations are also subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In addition to being involved as a potentially responsible party at numerous Superfund sites (see Item 3
