ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have royalty interests and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage royalties, as well their respective reserves are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. There is more information available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have royalties, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The description of our principal royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Royalties on Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which royalties in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential royalty revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause Royal Gold to conclude that one or more of such royalties are no longer principal to our business. As of
June 30, 2011, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically) to be principal to our business.
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
We own a royalty on all gold produced from the sulfide portion of the Andacollo copper and gold deposit. The Andacollo royalty equals 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the deposit at the Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold, and 50% of the gold produced in excess of 910,000 payable ounces of gold. As of June 30, 2011, approximately 46,000 payable ounces of gold have been sold.
Andacollo is an open-pit copper mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by a subsidiary of Teck. Andacollo is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The provincial capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northeast of the Andacollo project by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curving to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
In April 2011, Teck announced that they will undertake an expansion study at Andacollo to examine the feasibility of adding an additional SAG mill, ball mill and other equipment aimed at increasing production. Teck estimates that adding additional equipment could increase annual production by 25%-50%.
Canadian Malartic (Quebec, Canada)
We own a 1.0% to 1.5% sliding-scale NSR royalty ($0.00 to $350.00 - 1.0%; above $350 - 1.5%) on the Canadian Malartic open-pit gold mine and milling operation located in Quebec, Canada, and owned by Osisko. The Canadian Malartic gold property is located in the Abitibi Gold Belt in Quebec, Canada, immediately south of the town of Malartic, Quebec, approximately 16 miles west of the town of Val d'Or. The northern extent of the Canadian Malartic property can be accessed directly from the Trans Canadian Highway 117.
Osisko announced that they reached commercial production at their Canadian Malartic mine on May 19, 2011. For the 30-day period ending June 17, 2011, the mill averaged 33,300 tonnes per day exceeding the 33,000 tonnes per day (60% of the 55,000 tonnes per day designed capacity) standard required to declare commercial production. Osisko achieved this milestone ahead of their August 2011 target.
Osisko also reported that production ramp-up is progressing well at the mill plant with an average throughput of 38,913 tonnes per day through mid June 2011. Recovery rates are currently higher than anticipated, mainly due to longer retention time in the leach circuit and a better-than-designed size fraction as the mill has not yet been brought up to full capacity. Osisko plans to continue to de-bug the operation as they focus on achieving the design capacity of 55,000 tonnes per day and optimizing the operating performance.
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a large open-pit and underground mine, utilizing mill and heap leach processing. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez is subject to the Pipeline, South Pipeline, Gap and Crossroads deposits and is operated by subsidiaries of Barrick.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)Reserve Claims ("GSR1"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the "Reserve Claims," which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR royalty rate on the Reserve Claims is tied to the gold price as shown in the table below and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation.
(b)GAS Claims ("GSR2"). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the "GAS Claims," which encompasses approximately 50% of the GAP deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR royalty rate on the GAS Claims, as shown in the table below, is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation.
(c)Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty ("GSR3"). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)Net Value Royalty ("NVR1"). This is a fixed 1.25% NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. The Company owns 31.6% of the 1.25% NVR (or 0.39%) while limited partners (including certain directors of the Company) in the partnership, which is consolidated in our financial statements, own the remaining portion of the 1.25% NVR. Our 0.39% portion of the NVR1 royalty does not cover the mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
The following shows the current sliding-scale GSR1 and GSR2 royalty rates under our royalty agreement with Cortez:
As the Company reported during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, production at Cortez decreased during the period as Barrick has turned its focus to production of Cortez Hills ore, which is not subject to the Company's royalty. The Company anticipates that Barrick will continue to focus on Cortez Hills and production at Pipeline will remain at decreased levels, as reflected in the calendar 2011 mine plan provided by Barrick.
Dolores (Chihuahua, Mexico)
We own a 3.25% NSR royalty on gold and a 2.0% NSR royalty on silver from the Dolores open-pit mine and heap leach operation located in Chihuahua, Mexico, and operated by Minefinders. The Dolores project is located approximately 155 miles west of the city of Chihuahua, Mexico. The property can be accessed by approximately 56 miles of recently upgraded access road from Yepachi, Chihuahua, to the mine site. Access to the property can also be achieved by light aircraft landing on a dirt strip located about five miles from the mine site.
Minefinders has reported that at Dolores they continue to sustain improved leach results on the Stage 2 pad. Minefinders has also stated that they are continuing to assess the addition of a milling operation at Dolores and the development of an underground resource. Minefinders has reiterated that they expect to achieve their calendar 2011 guidance of 65,000 to 70,000 ounces of gold and 3.3 million to 3.5 million ounces of silver.
Holt (Ontario, Canada)
We own a sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Holt portion of the Holloway-Holt mining project located in Ontario, Canada and owned 100% by St Andrew. The Holloway-Holt project straddles Ontario Provincial Highway 101 for approximately 25 miles beginning east of Matheson, Ontario, Canada and extending to the Quebec, Canada border. The sliding-scale NSR royalty rate on gold produced from the Holt portion of the mining project is calculated by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly average gold price. For example, at a quarterly average gold price of $1,500 per ounce, the effective royalty rate payable would be 19.5%.
In April 2011, St Andrew announced that the Holt mine achieved commercial production after operating for 90 days at an average throughput of between 450 to 500 tonnes per day. Production throughput is anticipated to increase from the initial rate of 500 tonnes per day to 1,000 tonnes per day
around the end of calendar 2011. In August 2011, St Andrew revised its calendar 2011 gold production estimate to between 23,000 and 26,000 ounces of gold, of which St Andrew expects approximately 13,000 to 16,000 ounces of gold to be produced during the second half of calendar 2011.
The Company began recognizing royalty revenue on the Holt royalty during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
Las Cruces (Andalucía, Spain)
We own a 1.5% NSR royalty on the Las Cruces copper mine and milling operation located in Andalucía, Spain and operated by Inmet. The Las Cruces mine is located in the Seville Province of southern Spain, about 12 miles northwest of the Provincial capital city of Seville. Access to the site is by well-maintained paved roads.
Inmet reported that production during the June 2011 quarter was adversely impacted by a planned 16-day maintenance outage at the Las Cruces mine. The outage was taken to install new components and modify equipment that will increase the underflow (solids) density of the grinding thickener to the design capacity of 80%. After the shutdown, the plant started-up and achieved record throughput above 80% of design and record weekly production of 1,340 tonnes of cathode copper. However, within two weeks of the start-up (early July 2011), a support structure of the new grinding thickener failed due to a faulty weld leading to a further seven day shutdown for repair.
Leeville (Nevada, USA)
We own a carried working interest, equal to a 1.8% NSR royalty, which covers the majority of the Leeville underground mine, in Eureka County, Nevada. Leeville is approximately 19 air miles northwest of Carlin, Nevada, and is operated by a subsidiary of Newmont. The property is accessed by driving north from Carlin on Nevada State Highway 766 for 19 miles and then on an improved gravel road for two miles.
Mulatos (Sonora, Mexico)
We own a 1.0% to 5.0% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Mulatos open-pit mine and heap leach operation in southeastern Sonora, Mexico. The Mulatos mine is located approximately 137 miles east of the city of Hermosillo and 186 miles south of the border with the United States and is operated by Alamos. Access to the mine from the city of Hermosillo can be made via private chartered flight or paved and gravel road.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based on the gold price as shown in the following table:
The Mulatos royalty is capped at 2.0 million gold ounces of production. As of June 30, 2011, approximately 732,000 cumulative ounces of gold have been produced.
Alamos reported that for the third consecutive month, crusher throughput improved and they expect to meet throughput of 15,000 tonnes per day throughout the remainder of calendar 2011.
Although production during the second quarter of calendar 2011 was impacted by extreme drought conditions and supplier issues, Alamos stated they expect to recover deferred production throughout the remainder of calendar 2011. Alamos also reported that construction is underway on a high-grade mill that could boost output by another 60,000 ounces per year. Production from this new gravity mill is expected to commence in calendar 2012.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by Goldcorp. The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large silver, gold, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. Access to the site is via either paved or cobbled roads west out of Concepcion del Oro nine miles to the town of Mazapil and then further approximately seven miles west from Mazapil.
Goldcorp reported that higher grades and recoveries of gold, silver, lead and zinc were offset by lower processing rates. Goldcorp expects these issues to be resolved by the end of calendar 2011. Goldcorp also reported that oxide gold production will be delayed in the second half of calendar 2011 due to restricted cyanide deliveries from supplier shortages.
Robinson Mine (Nevada, USA)
We own a 3.0% NSR royalty on all mineral production from the Robinson open-pit mine and mill operation operated by a subsidiary of Quadra. Access to the property is via Nevada State Highway 50, 6.5 miles west of Ely, Nevada, in White Pine County.
In July 2011, Quadra reported that the removal of mud from the bottom of the Ruth Pit was completed approximately four weeks ahead of schedule. As previously reported by Quadra, the production profile at Robinson is expected to increase in the second half of calendar 2011, benefiting from access to higher grade material at the bottom of the pit, as well as additional haulage capacity. Quadra reported that ore processed at the beginning of the third quarter of calendar 2011 contained significantly higher grade versus the second calendar quarter, and they expect grades to further improve in the fourth calendar quarter.
Voisey's Bay (Labrador, Canada)
We own an effective 2.7% NSR royalty on the Voisey's Bay nickel-copper-cobalt mine located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and operated by Vale. The Company owns 90% of a 3.0% NSR (or 2.7%) while a non-controlling interest owns the remainder. The Voisey's Bay project is located on the northeast coast of Labrador, on a peninsula bordered to the north by Anaktalak Bay and to the south by Voisey's Bay. The property is 560 miles north-northwest of St. John's, the capital of the Province. Access to the property is by helicopter, small aircraft or tracked vehicles during the winter. We have disputed the manner of calculation of our royalty payments. Please refer to Note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the dispute.
On January 31, 2011, Vale announced that a new five-year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the United Steel Workers Local 9508, representing mine and mill operations employees at Voisey's Bay, thus ending the strike that began August 1, 2009. Operations at Voisey's Bay have been returning to normalcy.
In June 2011, Vale provided an update concerning construction of its Long Harbour project-the hydrometallurgical facility that Vale is building in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The facility
will treat Voisey's Bay ore to produce 50,000 tonnes per year of nickel and associated copper and cobalt. At an estimated capital cost of $2.8 billion, the plant is scheduled for commissioning and start-up during calendar 2013. To-date, the project is about 40% complete with engineering completion at approximately 80% and construction at about 20%
Wolverine (Yukon Territory, Canada)
We own a 0.00% to 9.445% sliding-scale NSR royalty on all gold and silver produced from the Wolverine underground mine and milling operation located in Yukon Territory, Canada, and operated by Yukon Zinc. The Wolverine property is located 106 miles north-northwest of Watson Lake in south central Yukon Territory. Access to the property is provided by a 17 mile gravel road heading south and then northeast to the Robert Campbell Highway at a point approximately 120 miles north of Watson Lake.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty on all gold and silver is based on the silver price as shown in the following table:
Yukon Zinc reported that the start-up of the Wolverine project is complete. The processing plant is currently operating at 300 to 500 tonnes of concentrate per day. During pre-commissioning prior to the end of calendar 2010, about 3,300 tonnes of concentrate were produced. This concentrate was shipped during the first quarter of calendar 2011. Yukon Zinc expects to increase production to the design capacity of 1,700 tonnes per day of concentrate during calendar 2011 with commercial production levels of 60%-70% of design capacity expected to be realized in the third quarter of calendar 2011.
The Company began recognizing royalty revenue on the Wolverine royalty during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
Principal Royalties on Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal royalty interests on development stage properties (listed alphabetically). Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Mt. Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
We own the right to purchase 25% of the payable gold produced from the Mt. Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, and operated by Thompson Creek. The Mt. Milligan project is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mt. Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road.
Upon commencement of production at the Mt. Milligan project, RGLD Gold AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, will purchase 25% of payable gold with a cash payment equal to the lesser of $400 or the prevailing market price for each payable ounce of gold until 550,000 ounces have been
delivered to RGLD Gold AG, and the lesser of $450 or the prevailing market price for each additional ounce thereafter.
The Company, along with an independent engineering firm who is monitoring and confirming the Company's required participation in funding construction of the Mt. Milligan project, conducted a site visit to Mt. Milligan in July 2011. Some of the progress at Mt. Milligan includes the plant, shop and administration foundations earthworks, the concrete batch plant, and delivery of a significant portion of the necessary steel.
Thompson Creek announced that their current capital expenditures estimate to construct the Mt. Milligan mine is approximately C$1.3 billion (US$1.3 billion), of which approximately $208 million has been spent since inception of the project through June 30, 2011, and an additional $466 million has been committed since inception of the project. Thompson Creek is targeting a start-up at Mt. Milligan in calendar 2013 and expects to produce approximately 194,000 ounces of gold annually.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
As of June 30, 2011, we own a 0.78% to 5.23% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. The Company owns an additional royalty equivalent to 1.05% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick's operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interest is applicable to all gold production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million, (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) Royal Gold also increased its interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note: Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
In July 2011, Barrick announced a revised pre-production capital estimate of approximately $4.7-$5.0 billion for the Pascua-Lama project. The revised estimate represents an approximate 40% increase from Barrick's original estimate. Barrick also reported that expected annual gold production has increased 775,000 ounces to 800,000-850,000 ounces in the first full five years of operation.
Reserve Information
Table 1 below summarizes proven and probable reserves for gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc, lead and cobalt that have been reported to us by the operators of our royalty interests as of December 31, 2010. Properties are currently in production unless noted as development ("DEV") within the table. The exploration royalties we own do not contain proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2010. Please refer to pages 26-28 for the footnotes to Table 1.
Table 1
Proven and Probable Gold Reserves
As of December 31, 2010(1)
Proven and Probable Silver Reserves
As of December 31, 2010(1)
Proven and Probable Base Metal Reserves
As of December 31, 2010(1)
(1)Reserves have been reported by the operators as of December 31, 2010, with the exception of the following properties: Don Mario-August 2010; West Westonia, Southern Cross, South Laverton, Pine Cove, Mt. Goode, Inata, Gwalia, Balcooma and Avebury-June 2010; El Chanate and Mt. Milligan-October 2009; Caber and Canadian Malartic-December 2008; Schaft Creek-September 2008; Soledad Mountain-December 2007; Meekatharra (Yaloginda) and Meekatharra (Paddy's Flat)-September 2007.
(2)Gold reserves were calculated by the operators at the following per ounce prices: $1,300-Martha; A$1,350-Kundip; $1,200-El Limon and Dolores; A$1,250-South Laverton and West Westonia; $1,000-Inata, Bald Mountain, Cortez, Goldstrike, Holt, Kutcho Creek, Pascua Lama, Robinson and Williams; $983-Pine Cove; $950-Leeville, Marigold, Peñasquito, Twin Creeks and Wharf; A$1,000-Gwalia and Southern Cross; $900-Gold Hill and Taparko; $875-Mulatos; $870-El Toqui; $825-Canadian Malartic; $800-El Chanate, Don Mario and Andacollo; $690-Mt. Milligan; and $600-Soledad Mountain. Schaft Creek is at a $5.05 net smelter return cut-off grade (metal price assumptions used by the operator were $658 per ounce gold; $10.00 per ounce silver; and $1.93 per pound copper). Wolverine is at an $80/tonne net smelter return cut-off grade (metal price assumptions used by the operator were $400 per ounce gold and $7.00 per ounce silver). No gold price was reported for Meekatharra (Paddy's Flat), Meekatharra (Yaloginda), Avebury or Balcooma.
(3)Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Reserve" is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
"Proven (Measured) Reserves" are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established.
"Probable (Indicated) Reserves" are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
(4)Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by royalty operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code").
(5)The reserves reported are either estimates received by the various operators or are based on royalty documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)"Contained ounces" or "contained pounds" do not take into account recovery losses in processing the ore.
(7)By amendment dated June 2, 2011, but effective January 1, 2011, the royalty rate now ranges from 3.5% to 5.0%. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $375-3.5%; >$375 to $400-4.0%; >$400 to $425-4.5%; >$425 and higher-5.0%. All price points are stated in 1986 dollars and are subject to adjustment in accordance with a blended index comprised of labor, diesel fuel, industrial commodities and mining machinery.
(8)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): Below $210-0.40%; $210 to $229.99-0.50%; $230 to $249.99-0.75%; $250 to $269.99-1.30%; $270 to $309.99-2.25%; $310 to $329.99-2.60%; $330 to $349.00-3.00%; $350 to $369.99-3.75%; $390 to $409.99-4.0%; $410 to $429.99-4.25%; $430 to $449.99-4.50%; $450 to $469.99-4.75%; $470 and higher-5.00%.
(9)NVR1 and GSR3 reserves are subsets of the reserves and additional mineralized material covered by GSR1 and GSR2.
(10)Round Mountain, a joint venture between Kinross and Barrick, has the right, at any time, to purchase the royalty interest for $10.0 million less any royalty payments paid prior to the purchase option being exercised. The royalty is subject to a minimum royalty payment of $100,000 per year.
(11)The sliding-scale NSR royalty will pay 2.0% when the price of gold is above $350 per ounce and 1.0% when the price of gold falls to $350 per ounce or below.
(12)The 0.9% NSR applies to the MACE claims. The operator did not report reserves subject to the 0.9% NSR.
(13)The 2.0% NSR royalty interest covers the majority of six sections of land, containing a number of open pits, but does not cover the current mining in the Basalt/Antler area.
(14)The operators at Avebury, Relief Canyon and Bundarra did not provide a breakdown of proven and probable reserves.
(15)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to under $350-0.0%; $350 to under $400-0.5%; $400 to under $500-1.0%; $500 or higher-2.0%.
(16)NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $350-1.0%; above $350-1.5%.
(17)Refer to Note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on litigation associated with our Holt royalty.
(18)25% of payable gold with a fixed cost of $400 per ounce until 550,000 ounces are delivered to Royal Gold; $450 per ounce thereafter.
(19)Gold royalty rate is based on the price of silver per ounce. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of silver per ounce-royalty rate): Below $5.00-0.0%; $5.00 to $7.50-3.778%; >$7.50-9.445%.
(20)The NSR sliding-scale royalty is capped once payments of approximately $17 million have been received. As of June 30, 2011, payments of approximately $8.2 million have been recognized. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): less than $300-2.0%; $300 - $350-3.0%; greater than $350-4.0%.
(21)The Company's royalty is subject to a 2.0 million ounce cap on gold production. There have been approximately 732,000 ounces of cumulative production as of June 30, 2011. NSR sliding-scale schedule (price of gold per ounce-royalty rate): $0.00 to $299.99-1.0%; $300 to $324.99-1.50%; $325 to $349.99-2.0%; $350 to $374.99-3.0%; $375 to $399.99-4.0%; $400 or higher-5.0%.
(22)Operator reports reserves by material type. The sulfide material will be processed by milling. The oxide material will be processed by heap leaching.
(23)The royalty rate is 75% until 910,000 payable ounces of gold have been produced-50% thereafter. There have been approximately 46,000 cumulative payable ounces produced as of June 30, 2011.
(24)Royalty applies to all gold production from an area of interest in Chile. Only that portion of the reserves pertaining to our royalty interest in Chile is reflected here. Approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to the first 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project.
