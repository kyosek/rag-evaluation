Item 2. Properties
OVERVIEW
Office Property Portfolio
The supply of, and demand for, office space affect the performance of our office property portfolio. Macroeconomic conditions, such as current and expected economic trends, business and consumer confidence and employment levels, drive this demand.
Geographic Diversity
Our geographically diversified asset base makes it more likely that we will be able to generate sustainable cash flows throughout the various phases of economic cycles than if we were less diversified. The following table summarizes the major city focus and geographic distribution of our office property portfolio at December 31, 2001.
Our portfolio benefited from its position in CBD office buildings located in major markets, as leases in 2001 expired at an average net rent of approximately $12.05 per square foot ($11.91 per square foot on a pro rata basis) and were generally being signed at an average net rent per square foot of approximately $13.08 ($12.72 per square foot on a pro rata basis). At December 31, 2001, management's estimates of market rents were on average approximately 25% above in-place rents. In light of weakening market conditions, estimated average market rents were revised downward from $16.70 per square foot at December 31, 2000 to $16.00 per square foot at December 31, 2001. The average market rent for space in our buildings is weighted based on our owned area. In-place net rents and market net rents exclude straight-line rent adjustments.
Market vs. In-Place Rental Rates (At December 31, 2001) Average Average In-place Average Market Remaining Net Rent Net Rent Lease Term ------------ -------------- ------------ (dollars per square foot) (years) Core Markets Atlanta $ 12.50 $ 12.30 2.9 Chicago 13.10 16.50 6.2 Dallas 11.00 9.70 4.6 Houston 10.10 13.50 4.1 Los Angeles Area 14.10 14.00 5.7 New York Area 16.50 32.90 8.1 Washington, D.C.

Over the next several years, we plan to concentrate our capital on our core markets and to exit selectively from investments in our secondary markets in an orderly fashion. We expect principally to redeploy proceeds from sales into Class A office buildings in the CBDs of our core markets.
Lease Profile
For our office portfolio, market rents in 2001 were on average approximately 25% above our in-place rents. We expect these market conditions, combined with re-leasing of expiring space shown in the following lease expiration table, to contribute positively to our cash flows in 2002 and future years. Over the next five fiscal years, beginning in 2002, scheduled lease expirations in our office portfolio average approximately 11.5% annually, based on our occupied space at December 31, 2001. The data in the table are based on our owned/occupied area. Expiration net rents exclude straight-line rent adjustments.
Scheduled Annual Expirations of Office Leases (At December 31, 2001)
Over the last three years, we have leased 23.2 million square feet of new and renewal space. During 2001, we leased 8.0 million square feet as indicated in the following table (7.2 million square feet on a pro rata basis). Occupancy for the entire portfolio based on owned area increased to 94.3% at December 31, 2001 from 94.2% at December 31, 2000.

Tenant Diversity
Our diversified tenant base adds to the durability of our future cash flow. The following table summarizes the breadth and diversity of the approximately 2,700 tenants in the portfolio at December 31, 2001.
Industry % Owned Area --------------------------------------------------------------------- Banking/Securities Brokers 15% Legal Services 10% Computers/Communications 9% Oil & Gas 8% Insurance/Non-Bank Financial 8% Miscellaneous Business Services 7% Wholesalers/Retailers 6% Engineering/Architectural Services 4% Government 4% Health Services 3%
This large tenant base and strong position in key markets allows us to take advantage of economies of scale and drive internal growth in the areas of parking, telecommunications and antennas, specialty retail leasing, signage and branding opportunities, energy and national purchasing contracts.
Our 10 largest tenants accounted for approximately 17% of our POI excluding straight-line rent adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2001. No single tenant accounted for more than 4% of our POI. The following table sets forth information concerning our 10 largest tenants at December 31, 2001.
Top Ten Tenants by POI % POI % Owned Area --------------------------------------------------------------------- Prudential Securities 4% 3% Goldman Sachs 2% 1% GSA 2% 2% Enron Corp. 2% 2% Bank of America 2% 2% Fried, Frank, Harris 1% 1% Ernst & Young 1% 1% Bank One 1% 1% Entex 1% 1% Continental Airlines 1% 2% ----------------------------- Total Top Ten Tenants 17% 16% =============================
On December 2, 2001, a group of Enron Corporation companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. As indicated above, Enron is our fourth largest tenant contributing 2% of POI and occupying 793,000 square feet, primarily at the Allen Center in Houston, Texas. At December 31, 2001, Enron's average in-place net rents were approximately $9.30 per square foot, while current estimated market rents for the space are approximately $14 to $15 per square foot. At this time, we expect Enron will reject its leases with us. The impact on our property operating income will depend on how quickly we are able to re-lease this space.
Our Top Office Properties
The following table summarizes our top 10 properties based on contribution to our POI for the year ended December 31, 2001. All of the properties in the table are 100% owned unless otherwise indicated.
Top Ten Properties by POI Contribution % POI % Owned Area - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen Center Houston, TX 8% 8% One New York Plaza New York, NY 8% 6% Galleria Towers I, II & III Dallas, TX 4% 3% Newport Tower Jersey City, NJ 4% 3% Renaissance Tower Dallas, TX 3% 4% The Grace Building (50%) New York, NY 3% 2% Continental Center I Houston, TX 3% 3% Metropolitan Square St. Louis, MO 3% 3% 110 William Street New York, NY 2% 2% World Apparel Center (50%) New York, NY 2% 1% --------------------- Total Top Ten Properties 40% 35% =====================
Our top five office properties are Allen Center, One New York Plaza, Galleria Towers, Newport Tower and Renaissance Tower. POI for the year ended December 31, 2001 for our top five office properties totaled $153.6 million, or 27%, of our total U.S. office POI. A description of these five properties is provided below. For information on mortgage indebtedness encumbering these properties, see " - Description of Certain Indebtedness" in this Form 10-K.
o Allen Center. We acquired Allen Center, located in the central business district of Houston, Texas, in November 1996. For the year ended December 31, 2001, this property contributed 8% to our POI. The complex includes three towers ranging from 34 to 50 stories and comprising approximately 3.2 million square feet of leaseable space. Parking capacity for more than 5,000 cars is available within two parking garages, and additional surface parking is available on the 2.5 acre expansion site. In addition to the office buildings, we own a central plant that distributes chilled air and heated water throughout the complex and to other buildings in the area. Allen Center was 98.4% occupied at December 31, 2001. The largest tenants in the Allen Center are Amerada Hess Corporation with 10% of the total square footage, Equiva Services LLC with 6% and Devon Energy with 6%. Enron Corp has leases for 18% of the total square footage. As previously noted, pursuant to its Chapter 11 reorganization, we expect Enron to reject its leases on this property. The net book value per square foot at December 31, 2001 was $77.
o One New York Plaza. We acquired this premier lower Manhattan property in April 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2001, this property contributed 8% to our POI. Prudential Securities occupies approximately 56% of the total square footage of this 2.5 million-square-foot, 50-story tower. The building's other major tenants are Goldman Sachs with 23% of the total square footage and Fried Frank Harris with 12%. One New York Plaza was 99.6% occupied at December 31, 2001. There has been no disruption to services as a result of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. and related circumstances. The net book value per square foot at December 31, 2001 was $156.
o Galleria Towers. We acquired this suburban Dallas office property in January 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2001, this property contributed 4% to our POI. The complex consists of three buildings ranging from 24 to 26 stories and comprising 1.4 million square feet. Federal National Mortgage occupies 8% of the total square footage, Kinko's occupies 8% and Medical Care International occupies 5%. Galleria Towers was 95.4% occupied at December 31, 2001. The net book value per square foot at December 31, 2001 was $155.
o Newport Tower. We acquired this 37-story building in October 1997. For the year ended December 31, 2001, this property contributed 4% to our POI. Newport Tower is located in Jersey City, New Jersey, directly across the Hudson River from downtown Manhattan in an area that is considered a sub-market of the downtown Manhattan market. The property has approximately one million square feet of leaseable area. First Chicago Trust occupies approximately 23% of the total square footage, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. occupies 15% and Herzog Heine Geduld, Inc. occupies 11%. The building was 99.7% occupied at December 31, 2001. The net book value per square foot at December 31, 2001 was $143.
o Renaissance Tower. We acquired Renaissance Tower, a 56-story office tower located in Dallas, Texas, in December 1995. For the year ended December 31, 2001, this property contributed 3% to our POI. The property has 1.7 million square feet of leaseable area. Major tenants include Blockbuster Videos, Inc., with 15% of total square footage, Southwest Securities, Inc. with 13% and Transamerica Real Estate Tax, with 10%. The property was 88.4% occupied at December 31, 2001. The net book value per square foot at December 31, 2000 was $65.
Investment in Sears Tower
The Sears Tower, located in Chicago, Illinois, is a 110-story, 3.5 million-square-foot office building that was 93.9% occupied at December 31, 2001. Major tenants include Ernst & Young, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Latham & Watkins. The Sears Tower and associated assets are currently owned in a trust for the benefit of an affiliate of Sears, Roebuck and Co.
On December 3, 1997, we purchased a subordinated mortgage together with an option to purchase the Sears Tower for a total of $70 million and became the residual beneficiary of the trust that owns the Sears Tower. In addition, we assumed responsibility for property management and leasing services.
Our mortgage is subordinate to an existing non-recourse participating first mortgage plus accrued interest and certain obligations. The first mortgage has a principal plus accrued interest balance of $778.9 million at December 31, 2001. The first mortgage is currently serviced only to the extent of available cash flows from the building. Beginning in 2002, minimum interest payments are required under the first mortgage. The minimum interest payment for 2002 is $37.5 million and it increases to $51.9 million for each of 2003 and 2004. The maturity date for the first mortgage is July 2005. In order to retire all amounts secured by the first mortgage, including the lender's participating interest in cash flow, the lender must receive an amount sufficient to provide it with an internal rate of return of 8.6858% on amounts advanced by it. Based on projected cash flows for the Sears Tower, the amount required to provide this required internal rate of return and fully retire the first mortgage at maturity in July 2005 would be approximately $800 million.
Our subordinated mortgage, which matures in July 2010, has a principal plus accrued interest balance of approximately $363.1 million at December 31, 2001, and also has participation rights on available cash flow.
The trust that owns the Sears Tower has a scheduled termination date of January 1, 2003. A General Agreement dated November 7, 1994 by and among Sears, a subsidiary of Sears, the holder of the first mortgage on the Sears Tower and certain of our indirect subsidiaries, including Partner Tower, L.P., or PTLP, sets forth Sears's
right to acquire title to the Sears Tower and our subsidiary's option to purchase the building under various circumstances. Pursuant to the General Agreement, at any time prior to 2003, Sears has the right to acquire title to the Sears Tower from the trust in exchange for readily marketable securities having a value equal to the amount, if any, by which the appraised value of the building exceeds the amount of all indebtedness secured by the building.
If Sears acquired the building pursuant to its right of substitution, the trust would immediately terminate and any marketable securities transferred by Sears to the trust would be distributed to our subsidiary, PTLP, as the residual beneficiary. Sears would hold title to the building subject to all indebtedness, including our subordinated mortgage, and subject to our rights under the option. PTLP's option to purchase the building would be exercisable between January 2003 and July 2005 at a price of approximately $950 million plus 40% of the amount by which the appraised value of the building exceeded $1,063 million. If PTLP purchased the Sears Tower under the option, the building would be acquired subject to all outstanding indebtedness secured by it, and the amount of this indebtedness would be credited against the purchase price.
If Sears did not exercise its right of substitution, the Sears Tower and the other assets of the trust would be distributed on the scheduled termination date to PTLP as the residual beneficiary and we would assume the participating first mortgage.
For managing and leasing the Sears Tower, we currently earn fees that are funded from pre-debt service cash flows from the building.
Office Development Properties
One Alliance Center in Buckhead, Georgia, a strong sub-market in Atlanta was recently completed in October 2001. This $100 million, 560,000-square-foot building is the first phase of a four-building complex and at December 31, 2001 was 47% occupied and 75% leased. Major tenants include Security First, Towers Perrin and BBDO South. The remaining three phases of the complex, potentially totaling 1.2 million square feet of office space, would be developed only after substantial pre-leasing is completed.
In addition, we have 5.3 million square feet of office development potential in key U.S. markets, assuming receipt of all necessary permits, licenses and approvals. This office development potential includes approximately 2.8 million square feet adjacent to four of our office buildings in Houston and Dallas and a 600,000-square-foot development site in Rosslyn, Virginia. We will pursue these projects only when customer need is evident and market conditions warrant.
Retail/Entertainment Properties
We are completing the stabilization of three destination-oriented retail/entertainment centers.
o Hollywood & Highland in Los Angeles, California, is a 645,000-square-foot, $380 million complex, net of $100 million of municipal financing and contributions. We also developed a $160 million, 640-room hotel as part of the complex. The complex opened on November 8, 2001. The hotel opened on December 26, 2001. The retail portion of the project was 72% occupied and 88% leased at December 31, 2001.
o Construction is complete at Paseo Colorado, a 565,000-square-foot, $110 million (net of $25 million of municipal contributions) mixed-use re-development in Pasadena, California. The project opened on September 28, 2001 and was 84% occupied and 93% leased at December 31, 2001.
o Desert Passage in Las Vegas, Nevada, a 475,000-square-foot, $290 million retail/entertainment complex within the Aladdin Hotel and Casino complex, opened in August 2000. The project was 74% occupied and 78% leased at December 31, 2001. On March 31, 2001, the Desert Passage project partnership was restructured to facilitate a sale, resulting in our having control over project operations and its disposition, with the minority partner participating only in project distributions, primarily those arising upon disposition of the project.
Our net book value for these properties at December 31, 2001, was approximately $650 million, on a pro rata ownership basis. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded an allowance for loss related to these properties of $234 million. Of this amount $217 million related to the Hollywood & Highland complex and $17 million related to Desert Passage. This allowance for loss reflects the negative impact of the September 2001 terrorist attacks on tourism, upon which Hollywood & Highland and Desert Passage depend for a significant portion of their visitors. In addition, Desert Passage was impacted by the September 2001 filing of a Chapter 11 reorganization for the Aladdin Hotel and Casino, which is adjacent to Desert Passage and upon which Desert Passage further depends for a significant portion of its visitors.
Consistent with our strategy to focus on the core U.S. office business, we have decided to divest our non-core retail/entertainment assets. Our plan calls for an orderly disposition over the next several years that will allow us to achieve stabilized income in order to realize maximum value upon disposition. Net proceeds will be redeployed into Class A office buildings in the CBDs of our core markets or used to repay debt.
DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
We have negotiated a three-year, $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. In December 2001, $200 million of the facility was committed and closed with a group of four banks. The remaining $150 million of the facility has been syndicated to a group of seven banks and closed in early January 2002. The credit facility is available for our general corporate purposes, including dividends and distributions to our stockholders, subject to certain restrictions on our making any such dividends or distributions. Interest will be calculated periodically on the borrowings outstanding under the facility on a variable rate basis using a spread over LIBOR. The spread will be dependent on our total leverage, or, if we obtain an investment-grade credit rating from two rating agencies, on our credit rating. In addition, we must pay to the lenders a fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility.
The amount of the credit facility available to be borrowed at any time is determined by the unencumbered properties that we, or our subsidiaries that guarantee the credit facility, own and that satisfy certain conditions of eligible properties. The amount currently eligible to be borrowed is $314 million. These conditions are not uncommon for credit facilities of this nature. At December 31, 2001, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.
We are subject to covenants customary for credit facilities of this nature, including financial covenants, restrictions on other indebtedness, restriction on encumbrances of properties that we use in determining our borrowing capacity, and certain customary investment restrictions. Our financial covenants include a restriction on dividends or distributions of more than 90% of our funds from operations. If we are in default in respect of our obligations under the credit facility, dividends shall be limited to the amount necessary to maintain REIT status.
TrizecHahn Office Properties Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates
In May 2001, we refinanced $1.16 billion of existing long-term debt through the private placement issuance by a special-purpose vehicle created by one of our subsidiaries of $1.44 billion of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. The certificates are backed by mortgages that secure non-recourse loans on 28 of our office properties and have maturities of five, seven and 10 years. At December 31, 2001, the weighted average interest rate on this debt was 4.9%, and it replaced existing debt at 7.1%.
One New York Plaza Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates
In May 1999, we entered into a non-recourse acquisition loan in the amount of $245.9 million to fund a portion of the purchase price for One New York Plaza. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on the property, bears an interest rate of 7.27% and matures in May 2006. Subsequently, the loan was securitized through the private issuance of $245.9 million of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. The certificates are backed by the non-recourse mortgage loan on the property.
Desert Passage Credit Facility
In May 1998, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a group of banks to finance the construction of Desert Passage. The loan facility is in the total amount of $194 million, of which $178.0 million had been drawn as at December 31, 2001. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property and is also guaranteed by certain of our other subsidiaries. Interest is calculated periodically on a variable rate basis using a spread over LIBOR. The loan matures in May 2003, but may be extended up to May 2005 subject to meeting certain conditions.
Hollywood & Highland Credit Facility
In May 1999, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a group of banks to finance the construction of the retail and entertainment component of the Hollywood & Highland project. The total loan facility is in the amount of $150 million, of which $106.8 million had been drawn as at December 31, 2001. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property and is also guaranteed by TrizecHahn Holdings Ltd., TrizecHahn Office Properties Ltd. and us. We expect that, prior to the time of the corporate reorganization, TrizecHahn Holdings Ltd. and TrizecHahn Office Properties Ltd. will be released under their respective guarantees. Interest is calculated periodically on a variable rate basis using a spread over LIBOR. The loan matures in May 2002, but may be converted to a term loan maturing May 2004 subject to meeting certain conditions.
Hollywood Hotel Credit Facility
In April 2000, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a group of banks to finance the construction of the Hollywood Hotel, of which we currently own 84.5%. The total loan facility is in the amount of $98 million, of which $65.6 million had been drawn as of December 31, 2001 at our pro rata share. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property and is also guaranteed by TrizecHahn Office Properties Ltd. We expect that, prior to the time of the corporate reorganization, we will substitute our company for TrizecHahn Office Properties Ltd. under its guarantee. Interest is calculated periodically on a variable rate basis using a spread over LIBOR. The loan matures in April 2003, but may be extended up to April 2005 subject to meeting certain conditions.
Paseo Colorado Credit Facility
In June 2000, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a group of banks to finance the construction of the Paseo Colorado development. The total loan facility is in the amount of $88 million, of which $58.9 million had been drawn as of December 31, 2001.
