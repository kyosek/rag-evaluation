WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender entered into that certain Third Amended Loan Agreement dated as of December 18, 1995 (the "Third Amendment") pursuant to which, among other things, Borrower and Lender increased the amount set forth in subclause (i) of the first Recital paragraph herein from $15,000,000 to $30,000,000 (the Original Loan Agreement, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Loan Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender desire to further amend the Loan Agreement as herein set forth.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, Borrower and Lender do hereby agree as follows:
1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Fourth Amendment but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.
2. Other Documents. Concurrent herewith Borrower is amending or causing to be amended the Note. All references in the Loan Agreement to the "Note" are hereafter deemed to be references to the Note as amended concurrent herewith by the Second Amendment to Note, and as the same may hereafter be renewed, restated, replaced, extended or amended from time to time.
3. Loan Conversion Date. The definition of "LOAN CONVERSION DATE" set forth in the "DEFINITIONS" section of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following substituted therefor:
"LOAN CONVERSION DATE. May 31, 1997, or earlier as provided in Paragraph D of Article I hereof."
4. Loan Maturity Date. The definition of "LOAN MATURITY DATE" set forth in the "DEFINITIONS" section of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following substituted therefor:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Banyan Strategic Realty Trust as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of income and expenses, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Banyan Strategic Realty Trust at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 1996
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Banyan Strategic Realty Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, pursuant to a Declaration of Trust filed March 14, 1986 under the name VMS Strategic Land Trust.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled Partnerships. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investment in Real Estate Ventures are accounted for on the equity method.
B. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related loans using the level yield method.
C. INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Investment securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value, as determined by quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Statement of Shareholders' Equity. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. The basis of investment securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts using the level yield method.
D. INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE
In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" ("FAS 121"), under which the Trust would be required to recognize impairment losses for its properties when indicators of impairment are present and a property's expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property's carrying amount. The Trust adopted FAS 121 effective January 1, 1995 with no effect on the accompanying 1995 consolidated financial statements. During the quarter ended December 31, 1996, the venture owning the H Street Assemblage property recorded a valuation allowance of $6,000,000, of which the Trust's share is $3,180,000. See Note 7, Investment in Real Estate Venture, for further details.
E. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Interest income is accrued when earned. The accrual of interest is discontinued when the borrower acknowledges its inability to make payments or when payments become contractually delinquent ninety days or more, unless the loan is in the process of collection. Once a loan has been placed in a non-accrual status, all cash received is applied against the outstanding loan balance until such time as the borrower has demonstrated an ability to make payments under the terms of the then current loan agreement. That portion of accrued interest income which the Trust considers to be unlikely of collection is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and expenses in the provision for losses on loans, notes and interest receivable. However, the Trust intends to pursue collection of all amounts contractually due from the borrowers.
BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
F. MORTGAGE LOANS RECEIVABLE
Mortgage loans receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is presented at net carrying value, which represents the outstanding principal less unamortized purchased mortgage loan discounts plus any associated unamortized deferred loan costs. Unamortized purchased mortgage loan discounts and associated deferred loan costs are amortized over the term of the loan using the level yield method.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 114 and 118 ("FAS 114/118"), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan". The adoption of FAS 114/118 by the Trust effective January 1, 1995 has not had any impact on the carrying value of the Trust's mortgage loans or financial statements as of December 31, 1995.
G. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Trust adopted in 1995 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 ("FAS 107"), "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," which requires entities to disclose the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate. Value is defined in FAS 107 as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Trust believes the carrying amount of its financial instruments approximates fair value at December 31, 1996 and 1995, based upon (i) fixed rates on mortgage loans payable are comparable to rates currently offered in the market, (ii) the variable rates on the line of credit and bonds payable and (iii) the relatively short maturity of the Trust's cash equivalents. The Trust has no other financial instruments.
H. INCOME TAXES
For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Trust continued to be treated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under Internal Revenue Code Sections 856-860. In order to qualify, the Trust was required to distribute at least 95% of its taxable income to shareholders and meet asset and income tests as well as certain other requirements.
As of December 31, 1996, Investment in Real Estate and Investment in Real Estate Ventures has a gross and net basis, respectively, of $107,182,182 and $12,313,038, respectively, for income tax purposes. Additionally, investment in liquidating trust with a tax basis of $840,100 has not been accorded any value for financial reporting purposes.
As of December 31, 1996, the Trust has a net operating loss carry- forward of approximately $11,498,000 which will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2008.
I. CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Trust considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
J. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
K. RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the previously reported 1995 and 1994 consolidated financial statements in order to provide comparability with the 1996 consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications have not changed the 1995 or 1994 results.
2. MORTGAGE LOANS RECEIVABLE
Karfad Associates (the "Borrower"), which was indebted to the Trust pursuant to the Karfad loan in the original principal amount of $5,849,266 (the "Loan"), failed to make the required interest payments due on the first of each month from January through May of 1996 resulting in a foreclosure and a direct action against the guarantors. On May 17, 1996, the Trust entered into a Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") and two loan sale agreements with the Borrower and a party affiliated with the Borrower pursuant to which the Karfad Loan, as well as four related loans to parties affiliated with the Borrower (collectively the "Loan Portfolio"), were to be sold at an amount equal to the Trust's December 31, 1995 carrying value for the Loan Portfolio totalling approximately $5,440,000. On June 28 and July 31, 1996, the Trust completed the sale of the Loan Portfolio. In addition, the Borrower made all interest payments due pursuant to the terms of the original remaining four loans in the Loan Portfolio and the Loan from January 1, 1996 through the date of sale in the amount of approximately $407,000. As a result of the Agreement, the Trust terminated the recognition of income from the amortization of the Loan's purchase discount effective January 1, 1996. As of July 31, 1996, the Trust has no further interest in the Loan Portfolio.

(a) The loan contains a prepayment penalty which is based on a formula to provide yield maintenance protection to the lender.
(b) The loan contains a prepayment penalty of 5% of the outstanding principal loan balance in year one, decreasing by 1% thereafter through the loan's maturity date.
(c) On December 14, 1994, a limited partnership consisting of the Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary and an unrelated third party, which holds title to the Colonial Courts property, completed a $5,500,000 tax-exempt bond financing in connection with the Colonial Courts property. The bond was collateralized by a $5,624,315 letter of credit issued by American National Bank and Trust Company ("original LOC") as a draw against the Trust's line of credit (see Note 3(h) below for further details). The bond has a thirty year term and requires monthly payments of interest only based upon the weekly low floater tax exempt bond rate. The weekly low floater bond rate as of December 31, 1996 equaled 3.83%.
On April 15, 1996, the partnership replaced the original LOC with an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $5,624,315 issued by Citizens National Bank of Evansville ("Replacement LOC"). The bonds are also secured by a first mortgage on the Colonial Courts property. The Replacement LOC is confirmed by an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit in the amount of $5,624,315 provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis ("FHLB"). The Replacement LOC and the FHLB letter of credit have a term of five years with an option for an additional five year term. The annual fee for the Replacement LOC is equal to one percent (1%) of the letter of credit amount or $56,243. The annual fee for the FHLB letter of credit is approximately $2,800. In consideration of its assistance in obtaining the Replacement LOC and in accordance with the Trust's obligations under the partnership agreement, the Trust increased the limited partnership interest of PHC General Partnership ("PHC") in the BSRT Colonial Courts Limited Partnership from 10% to 25%. The PHC ownership percentage change became effective May 1, 1996 for financial reporting purposes.

(e) On March 13, 1996, the Trust executed a nonrecourse first mortgage loan collateralized by the Florida, Power and Light office building. The loan contains a prepayment penalty which is based on a formula to provide yield maintenance protection to the Lender.
The Trust, at its discretion, has the right to adjust the interest rate ("Adjusted Interest Rate") on the loan on April 1, 2001. The Adjusted Interest Rate is computed based at a rate of 300 basis points over the two- year U.S. Treasury rate as of December 18, 2000.
(f) On July 15, 1996, BSRT Woodcrest Office Park Limited Partnership , a limited partnership among a subsidiary of the Trust, as general partner, and Mr. Daniel Smith and the Trust as limited partners, executed a nonrecourse first mortgage loan collateralized by the Woodcrest Office Park property. The loan contains a prepayment penalty of 7% of the outstanding principal balance in year one, decreasing by 1% thereafter through the loan's maturity date.
(g) On November 19, 1996, the Trust acquired a 100% leasehold interest in the property located at 6901 Riverport Drive (the"Riverport Property") located in Louisville, Kentucky. The Trust utilized $200,000 of cash reserves for the acquisition and assumed a lease obligation. The reminder of the acquisition price was provided for by a draw upon the Trust's line of credit. The property is encumbered by tax-exempt Industrial Revenue Bond financing with an outstanding principal balance in the amount of $5,700,000 issued by Jefferson County, Kentucky. The lease assumed requires monthly payment of variable rate interest which is due the first of each month and annual principal payments in the amount of $300,000 which are due and payable each December 1 to and including December 1, 2014, the maturity date. Under the terms of the lease, the lease payments are equal to the required principal and interest payments on the bonds. An irrevocable letter of credit was issued as additional collateral for the bond financing which matures in December 1999. The bank issuing the letter of credit has a secured interest in the property. The annual fee for the letter of credit is equal to 1.5% of the letter of credit amount or $90,343. The variable interest rate on the bonds as of December 1996 was 3.8%.
(h) On December 13, 1994, the Trust executed a Mortgage Loan Commitment (the "Original Line") with American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago ("ANB") in the amount of $15,000,000. The Original Line was a revolving line of credit with an initial term of two years. The Original Line also provided for a one year extension subsequent to the initial two year term with a balloon payment of principal required upon maturity, December 14, 1997. During the initial term of the Original Line and any extension, the Trust was required to pay interest only at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% or Prime plus .25% at the election of the Trust which currently equals approximately 7.6% to 8.5% per annum. A letter of credit fee of one percent of the amount of the then outstanding Letter of Credit balance was required to be paid quarterly. Mortgages on certain of the Trust's properties and its mortgage loans receivable served as collateral for the Original Line.
BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
On December 15, 1995, the Trust and ANB entered into an agreement modifying the Original Line by increasing the amount the Trust could borrow from $15,000,000 to $30,000,000 (the "Modified Line"). The Trust provided the Bank additional collateral consisting of mortgages on certain properties as well as pledges of the Trust's subsidiaries stock or partnership interest in the entities owning said properties. The Trust also paid a loan fee upon execution of the Modified Line in the amount of $75,000, or .5% of the increase in the Original Line. All other terms, as provided for under the Original Line, remain unchanged. In addition, the Trust is required to pay the Bank an unused facility fee of.5% per annum multiplied by the average portion of the Modified Line that is undrawn from time-to-time.
As of December 31, 1995, the Trust had utilized approximately $25,724,000 of the $30,000,000 available under the Modified Line. On March 13 and July 15, 1996, the Trust used the proceeds for mortgage loans collateralized by the Florida Power and Light and Woodcrest Office Park properties, to pay down the revolving line of credit in the amounts of $6,200,000 and $7,000,000, respectively. In addition, on April 15, 1996, the Trust replaced a $5,624,315 letter of credit previously issued by ANB which had been collateralized by the Modified Line with an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount by Citizen's National Bank of Evansville (See Note 3(a) above for details). The Trust borrowed $1,000,000 under the Modified Line for the acquisition of the Midwest Office Park property in April 1996. (See Note 5, Investment in Real Estate, for further details.) On June 28 and July 31, 1996, the Trust sold its interest in the Karfad loan portfolio (See Note 2, Mortgage Loans Receivable, for further details). On August 1, 1996, the Trust used a portion of the Karfad loan portfolio net sales proceeds to pay down $3,900,000 of the Modified Line. On November 19, 1996, the Trust borrowed $4,400,000 under the Modified Line for the acquisition of the leasehold interest in the Riverport Property. (See Note 5, Investment in Real Estate, for further details.) As a result of the above transactions, as of December 31, 1996, the Trust had an outstanding balance of $8,400,000 of the $30,000,000 available under the Modified Line.
4. GROUND LEASE
On July 28, 1995, BSRT/M&J Northlake Limited Partnership, a joint venture between a subsidiary of the Trust and M&J Wilkow Retail Ltd., acquired a leasehold interest in a shopping center in Atlanta, Georgia pursuant to a ground lease with a remaining term of sixty-two years. The ground lease requires annual lease payments of $600,000 or $50,000 per month through October 4, 2007 plus 7% of total annual gross rental income commencing when gross rental income exceeds $2,000,000 from the operations of the Northlake Property.

7. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE
H STREET ASSEMBLAGE
On December 11, 1990, the Trust acquired title to the property known as the Victor Building located in Washington D.C. pursuant to an agreement with Banyan Strategic Land Fund II ("BSLFII"). On June 5, 1992, the Trust and BSLFII formed a joint venture (the "Venture") to pursue development rights. The Trust has a 53% interest in the Venture while BSLFII has the remaining 47%. This property consists of 17,000 square feet of undeveloped land in downtown Washington, D.C. plus an approximately 55,900 square foot office building. The entire property is zoned for office development.
The Venture has completed and obtained the zoning, entitlement and historic preservation for the development of an approximately 330,000 square foot commercial office building on the H Street Assemblage. In December 1994, based on the current market conditions in Washington, D.C., the Venture determined that it would be in its best interest to initiate marketing efforts to sell the property rather than assume the risk associated with the development of the property, thereby necessitating a $5,500,000 valuation allowance. The Trust's share, $2,915,000, is included in the loss from operations of real estate ventures in the Trust's 1994 Statement of Income and Expenses.
On March 20, 1997, the Venture sold approximately 3,500 square feet of the Venture's land to the United States General Services Administration ("GSA") for a purchase price of $1,680,000. GSA also paid the Venture $150,000 as reimbursement of expenses that the Venture incurred in anticipation of this transaction. The Venture received net sales proceeds of approximately $1,829,000, of which approximately $969,000 is the Trust's share. The Trust recognized no gain or loss on the sale. The Venture obtained all required approvals from various government agencies for the modifications necessary to the existing approved design for the proposed building on the Venture's remaining property that had been necessitated by this sale.
BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
During the quarter ended December 31, 1996, the Venture recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of $6,000,000 as a result of the above mentioned agreement with GSA and a sales contract with an unaffiliated third party to purchase the H Street Assemblage. The Trust's share, $3,180,000, is included in the loss from operations of real estate ventures in the Trust's 1996 Statement of Income and Expenses. The Venture's carrying value for the property after the write down is based on the anticipated cumulative sales proceeds pursuant to the sales contract and the agreement with GSA. Pursuant to the sales contract, the Venture has agreed to sell the land remaining after the GSA sale for $9,000,000 subject to a due diligence period of 120 days for the buyer. The reduction in the carrying value of $6,000,000 reflects the carrying costs and closing costs the Venture anticipates to incur in order to complete the aforementioned transactions. [To Be Updated]
Summary financial information for the H Street Assemblage as of December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 is as follows:

8. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Administrative costs, primarily salaries and general and administrative expenses are incurred on the Trust's behalf by Banyan Management Corp. ("BMC"). These costs are allocated to the Trust and other entities to which BMC provides administrative services based upon the actual number of hours spent by BMC personnel on matters related to that particular entity in relation to the total number of BMC personnel hours. The Trust's allocable share of costs for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 aggregated $1,275,374, $1,443,434 and $1,185,409, respectively. As one of its administrative services, BMC serves as the paying agent for general and administrative costs of the Trust. As part of providing this payment service, BMC maintains a bank account on behalf of the Trust. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Trust had a net payable due to BMC of $2,845 and $176,527, respectively. The net payable is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Trust's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
9. DISTRIBUTIONS PAID AND PAYABLE
It has been the Trust's policy to distribute to its shareholders an amount equal to at least 95% of taxable income. A portion of the distributions paid during the subsequent year may be allocable to taxable income earned in the prior year. Of the $4,191,406 of 1996 distributions paid, $2,841,813 represents ordinary income and $1,349,593 represents a return of capital.

11. RECOVERY OF LOSSES ON LOANS, NOTES, INTEREST RECEIVABLE
The Trust has received cash of $58,658, $562,337 and $347,557 during 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, related to its interest in a liquidating trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors (including the Trust) of VMS Realty Partners and its affiliates ("VMS"), former affiliates of the Trust. The Trust has recorded $16,569, $164,958 and $57,226, respectively, of these amounts as recovery of losses on mortgage loans, notes and interest receivable in its consolidated statement of income and expenses. The remainder of $729,799 was paid to the Class Action Settlement Fund representing the Trust's share of amounts due under the terms of the previously settled VMS securities litigation.
On January 25, 1994, the Trust received net proceeds of $134,986 as a recovery of payments previously made into an escrow established as part of the 1992 Class Action Settlement of the VMS securities litigation. The escrow was established to provide trustees of the Trust with monies to fund the cost of any litigation in which they might be named as defendants following settlement of the class action. Subsequently, the trustees released the proceeds from the escrow and the Trust purchased an insurance policy to cover the officers and trustees.
12. CUMULATIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
Pursuant to the amended employment agreement of the Trust's president, Leonard G. Levine, at December 31, 1997, or upon termination of Mr. Levine's employment by the Trust, whichever is earlier, ("the Computation Date") the annual incentive compensation earned on the performance of the Trust's assets acquired subsequent to January 1, 1993 will be computed on a cumulative basis covering the period January 1, 1993 through the Computation Date (the "Cumulative Incentive Compensation"). This cumulative calculation will also include all unrealized profits and gains on the Trust's real estate assets. As of December 31, 1996, the Trust has recorded $650,000 as its estimate of Cumulative Incentive Earnings with respect to the unrealized profits and gains on the Trust's assets. If a disagreement in value exists between Mr. Levine and the Trustees in computing unrealized profits and gains, a mutually agreed upon appraiser will be retained to appraise the properties with the result binding on both parties. If the Cumulative Incentive Compensation is less than the aggregate amount of incentive compensation previously paid to Mr. Levine, all or a portion of any Award Shares (defined below) previously issued to Mr. Levine will be forfeited by Mr. Levine and cancelled by the Trust. For these purposes, the Award Shares will be valued at the average price at which the shares were valued when issued to Mr. Levine. If the Cumulative Incentive Compensation is greater than the amounts previously paid to Mr. Levine, the difference will be paid to Mr. Levine in Cumulative Incentive Award Shares (defined below) by the Trust within seventy five days after the Computation Date.
13. AWARD SHARES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING
On April 9, 1997, the Board of Trustees approved a modification to the employment agreement of the Trust's president, Leonard G. Levine. Prior to the modification, all incentive amounts earned by Mr. Levine subsequent to January 1, 1993 were paid 80% in cash in the year following the period for which the incentive was earned and 20% in shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ("Award Shares"). Under the terms of the approved modification, Mr. Levine will also receive shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ("Additional Award Shares") for the 80% of his incentive compensation for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 that would otherwise have been paid in cash. In 1997, Mr. Levine will be issued 19,127 Award Shares representing 20% of his 1996 incentive earnings and 76,509 Additional Award
BANYAN STRATEGIC REALTY TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
Shares representing 80% of the 1996 Incentive Earnings that would have been paid in cash. At the end of his contract, December 31, 1997, he will further receive shares of beneficial interest of the Trust for all cumulative incentive earnings ("Cumulative Incentive Award Shares"). The issue price for Cumulative Incentive Award Shares will be $3.75 per share, the closing price of the Trust's shares on March 19, 1997. (See Note 12 above for details.)
Effective April 22, 1996, the Trust issued 1,833 Award Shares to Mr. Levine, valued at $4.20 per share or $7,700, representing 20% of Mr. Levine's 1995 incentive compensation. All incentive amounts are due Mr. Levine on or before March 15, of the year following the period for which the incentive is earned. The Award Shares, but not Additional Award Shares and Cumulative Incentive Award Shares, are restricted as to transfer and held in escrow by the Trust, pending satisfaction of the vesting requirements, for the benefit of Mr. Levine until the earlier of: (i) December 31, 1997; (ii) the termination of Mr. Levine's employment by the Trust without just cause; or (iii) the permanent disability or death of Mr. Levine. The issue price of any Award Shares and Additional Award Shares is based upon the average closing price of the Trust's shares for the five business days ended prior to December 31 of the year in question. Pursuant to the aforementioned April 9, 1997 modification to Mr. Levine's employment agreement, all Award Shares and Additional Award Shares issued to Mr. Levine are included in the total shares outstanding of the Trust when calculating Net Income Per Share of Beneficial Interest Based on Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding. Only Award Shares issued to Mr. Levine will be forfeited by Mr. Levine if he fails to be employed by the Trust on December 31, 1997, unless such failure is due to death or permanent disability or termination without just cause. Mr. Levine is entitled to receive his share (represented by the Award Shares, Additional Award Shares and Cumulative Incentive Award Shares) of any cash distributions paid by the Trust in consideration of outstanding shares.
14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
PHOENIX BUSINESS PARK
On January 15, 1997, the Trust acquired a 100% ownership interest in a three building office/industrial complex known as Phoenix Business Park located in northeast Atlanta, Georgia, for a purchase price of approximately $5,432,000 including liabilities assumed at acquisition. The three buildings contain approximately 110,600 square feet of gross leasable area. The Phoenix Business Park property was constructed in 1979 and was 100% occupied with 13 tenants upon acquisition. The Trust utilized $100,000 of cash reserves for the acquisition with the remaining balance provided for by a draw on the Trust's line of credit.
HALLMARK VILLAGE APARTMENTS
On September 28, 1993, BSRT Hallmark Village Limited Partnership, ("BHVLP"), a limited partnership consisting of the Trust, a subsidiary of the Trust and HVA General Partnership, acquired the Hallmark Village Apartments for a purchase price, including liabilities at acquisition, of approximately $6 million.
