ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company's principal office space is located at 1301 Avenue M, Cisco, Texas 76437. The office space is for corporate identification, mailing, and courier purposes and costs us approximately $3,200 a year to an affiliate. This $3,200 has been recorded as an expense and contributed capital in the financials.
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Company's overriding royalties total 488,040 net royalty acres under 13,679,838 gross surface acres in thirteen concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins. In addition the Company also owns 3,118 net royalty acres under 672,040 gross acres in four concessions located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership and size of each concession.
The Eromanga Basin encompasses the southwestern portion of the State of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australia's main onshore producing oil and gas basin.
The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Company's overrides are in a prime location since the majority of the Company's interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
On the 14,351,878 gross surface acres where ACOR holds overriding royalty interests, there are giant anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic highs, all of which indicate possibilities of oil and gas reserves. In addition, about $27 million worth of seismic information has been completed and is available on the areas.
During 2010 the Company received revenues from five of its overriding royalty interests - ATP 267, ATP 299, ATP 560, PEL 111, PEL 115 and VicP54, and one of its working interests - PEL 100. A successful gas well was completed on ATP 543 in 1996; however, after completion of a gas pipeline, gas began to be marketed in August 1999, but the pipeline reduced the gas price and the well was shut in. No gas sales were made during 2010 on ATP 543.
The Company has overriding royalty interests in four Permits in the Gippsland Basin, VIC/P45, 54 and 59. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964.
In addition to Company's large overriding royalty position it also has working interests in four concessions, which are all located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin. See the table for Working Interest

The following is a summary of the Company's Australian properties divided into four areas:\ 1) Gippsland Basin - Victoria, 2) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia, and 3) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland;
BASS STRAIT OF THE GIPPSLAND BASIN
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in four oil and gas concessions located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin:
VIC/P45
VIC/P45 is an offshore concession covering 214,896 gross acres under which the Company holds a 7.5% of 1% of gross production. This concession is located in the most prolific oil-producing basin in Australia, approximately 1.5 miles east of the Kingfish Oil Field in the southern Gippsland Basin in the Bass Straits. The Kingfish Oil Field, the largest oil field in Australia, has produced over one billion barrels of oil since its discovery. Apache drilled two unsuccessful wells (Megamouth #1 and Coelacanth #1) on VIC/P45 prior to 2010 and other prospective leads of interest caused Apache to apply for new exploration terms. Apache, the Operator, was granted a six year work program requiring geo-technical studies and review of the remaining leads with the permit with an aim of developing a drilling prospect.
VIC/P54
VIC/P54 is an offshore concession covering 155,676 gross acres under which the Company holds a 5% of 1% of gross production. Interpretation of the reprocessed seismic data focused on the maturing of the Longtom West exploration target. A five-year permit renewal was accepted during 2010. In October 2010, Nexus recommenced production of hydrocarbons from the Longtom wells. Re-conciliation of the reservoir pressure behavior with field mapping is ongoing coupled with further data on the undeveloped 400 sands on Longtom-3, with the results anticipated during the first half of 2011. This will be used as the basis for a review of the full field development plan as the Longtom region has been an area of focus for 3D seismic re-interpretation with encouraging results.
A review of the Longtom discoveries is important to see the magnitude of these wells. The Longtom-3 was drilled and completed during the summer of 2006. Two production tests were conducted on the well:
The first test produced gas from the 400 sand at 23MMscf/d. The results from this test confirm the flow potential of the 400 sand reservoir in the Longtom field, addressing a major concern leading up to the drilling of the Longtom-3 well. A flow was not achieved in the second test of Longtom-2 (conducted over the 400 sand). Nexus has interpreted this test as having failed due to down-hole mechanical problems.
The second test, over the 100, 200 and 300 sand intervals in the horizontal hole section exceeded expectations producing an estimated 77MMcf/d when bypassing the test separator and 59MMcf/d when flowing through the test separator (the separator's flow capacity). Sampling during the test recorded expected levels of carbon dioxide (less than 1%) and less than one part per million hydrogen sulphide.
In addition, the second test indicated that the condensate yield is higher in the 100 sands than in the sands above it, which will provide an economic boost to the project.
The Longtom-4 development well was drilled during the summer of 2008. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.
A 12" pipeline was constructed to the Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009. Revenues from gas sales for the Company begin in 2010. During 2010 the Longtom Field was shut in due to mercury levels exceeding gas plant standards. A processing plant was installed to remove the excess mercury and production from the Longtom Field resumed in November 2010.
VIC/P59
VIC/P59 consists of 301,468 gross acres and is located offshore in the Gippsland Basin under which the Company holds 1,206 net royalty acres representing a 1/20th of 1% overriding royalty interest. VIC/P59 is adjoined by the Blackback Oil Field with estimated reserves of 80,000,000 barrels of oil. Apache drilled three wells in 2008 on VIC/P59. No significant activity was reported during 2010 on VIC/P59.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - SOUTH AUSTRALIA
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in five oil and gas concessions and holds working interests in three oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in South Australia:
PEL 88
ACOR owns a 3/10ths of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 88, which covers 816,436 gross acres. Three prospects have been identified on PEL 88, Acacia, Casuarina and Lancier. The potential recoverable reserves of each of these prospects are 15,000,000 barrels of oil in the Acacia, 18,000,000 barrels of oil in the Casuarina and 48,000,000 barrels of oil in the Lancier. No assurance can be made that these prospects will be drilled.
PEL 100
ACOR holds a 1% working interest in the Cleansweep #1, which was drilled in the 2008 fiscal year and was completed as a Birkhead formation producer. The well tested 444 barrels of oil on a drill stem test. The Cleansweep well is estimated to have the potential of 4.8 million barrels of recoverable oil in place. Recent seismic mapping has confirmed that Angelica #1 drilled in 1998 was drilled off structure. A more detailed review of the existing seismic identified a four-way drape structure of Eromanga Basin sediments over a basement horst bald of Permian strata. A detailed 3D seismic program is planned to ensure that Angelica #2 tests the crest of this structure; however, this program has been delayed due to flooding in the area. The Angelica 3D seismic survey is proposed to cover 302 square kilometers and is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011.
PEL 111
ACOR owns a 1/10th of 1% overriding royalty interest under PEL 111, which covers 290,101 gross acres. Mapping of PEL 111 seismic data coupled with the reprocessing of existing seismic data identified 20 leads and prospects for potential oil and gas in the Birkhead, Hutton, Tirrawarra and Patchawarra formations. The Warhawk #1 was drilled in 2008 and was cased and suspended as a future producer. During 2009 three wells (Snatcher 1, 2 & 3) were drilled and completed as producers in the Birkhead channel sands. The Snatcher #1 well tested 218 barrels of oil per day.
The Snatcher #1 began producing on December 20, 2009 with both the Snatcher wells 2 & 3 coming on line during the first quarter of 2010; however, they were shut in due to flooding and are expected to remain shut in until the summer of 2011. The severe flooding caused major road and access problems.
Plans to drill Liberator #1 during the summer of 2010, which is located approximately 700 meters northwest of Snatcher #3, has been delayed due to flooding in the area.
The operator states that Angelica #2 has been nominated to be the first prospect to be drilled in 2012.
PEL 112 & 444
Holloman Energy, the operator of PEL 112 & PEL 444, has identified 38 leads on PEL 112. The Company owns a 13.83% working interest under both PEL 112 & PEL 444 and is 100% fully carried for its 13.83% working interest in the next two wells drilled on either PEL. The Company will be obligated to pay its proportionate part on any exploration costs thereafter. PEL 112 and PEL 444 comprise approximately 1.125 million gross acres and are both located within Australia's most prolific onshore oil and gas-producing basin, the Cooper/Eromanga Basin.
Holloman joined other Cooper Basin exploration companies in an aggressive program to regain access to their properties through the complete construction of upgraded roads and a bridge to provide vehicle access to field and exploration operations on the western flank of the Cooper Basin where PEL 112 is located. Holloman intends to pursue negotiations to piggyback PEL 112 work area clearance and seismic acquisition on Beach Petroleum's upcoming activity.
PEL 115
This permit covers 65,730 gross acres under which ACOR holds an overriding royalty interest of 10% of 1% of gross production. PEL 115 is located in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia. The Mirage-1 well completed in July 2005 initially flowed clean oil at a rate of 372 barrels of oil per day on a 1/2 inch choke. Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet.
The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of 3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately 20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the northeast. Such an area has the potential of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir.
In the southern part of PEL 115 the interpretation of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra and Thunderbolt). During 2009 the Fury #1 and Airacobra #1 were drilled and completed as producers. Based on the analysis of the wire line log data and sidewall cores and similarity of the Murta oil column in Fury-1 to those seen in the producing Mirage Oil Field, 5 kilometers to the southwest, Fury-1 has been completed for production with 7 inch production casing run to 6,446 feet.
Flooding during 2010 prevented the Fury-1 from being placed into production. The flooding also severely impacted the production from the Mirage and Ventura fields.
COOPER/EROMANGA BASIN - QUEENSLAND
The Company holds overriding royalty interests in eight oil and gas concessions and holds working interests in one oil and gas concession located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland. The following is a report on each of the Company's interests in Queensland:
ATP 267
The Company owns an overriding royalty interest of 17.15% of 1% in ATP 267, which covers approximately 220,800 acres. ATP 267 has 25 producing wells in six oil fields known as the Kihee, Koora, Nockatunga, Winna, Maxwell, Dikera, Thungo and Murhero fields. The Company received revenues from its overriding royalty ownership in these wells during 2010. No new wells were drilled during 2010 on this concession due to flooding in the area.
ATP 299
The Company owns a .0575% of 1% ORRI under ATP-299 and its Petroleum Licenses which covers 441,600 gross acres and currently has 104 completed wells under which ACOR receives overriding royalties. The Tintaburra Block is reported to contain approximately 84 million barrels of proved plus probable oil in place. ATP 299 has 104 producing wells in 25 oil fields. The Company received revenues from its overriding royalty ownership in these wells during 2009. Two new wells were drilled in 2009 on ATP 299, Ipundu #16 and Ipundu North #13 both of which were cased and suspended as future oil producers. Flooding prevented any further drilling in 2010 on ATP 299.
ATP 560
ATP 560 covers 625,600 acres under which the Company holds a 25% of 1% override. The Utopia Oil Field is situated in ATP 560P in the Eromanga Basin in southwest Queensland, approximately 150 km north east of the Jackson Oilfield and 50 km south of the Kenmore Oilfield. The Utopia field is a broad low-relief structure, with a maximum relief of approximately 10 m. The field produces from the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation and is the largest known Murta pool in the Queensland Eromanga Basin. The oil pool is at an approximate depth of 1020 m. The most recent technical review of Utopia undertaken in June 2004 determined the field could contain up to 2.86 million barrels of recoverable oil.
During 2010 two wells were drilled on ATP 560, Ubute-1 and Utopia-10. The Ubute-1 was plugged and abandoned and the Utopia-10 was cased and suspended as a producer with completion planned when accessible following the repairs from the severe flooding.
Utopia-11H, a horizontal development well, is also planned for 2011. Reservoir modeling suggests that a horizontal well will substantially increase the oil production in comparison to an unstimulated vertical well. The production results of Utopia-11H and the fracture stimulated Utopia-10 will determine the optimum well design to develop the substantial remaining reserves in the Utopia Field. Also planned in 2011 is 100 square kilometers of 3D seismic during the first half of the year. The timing for both the drilling of the Utopia-11H and the seismic program are subject to accessibility following the damage caused by the severe flood.
ATP 582
ATP-582 is located in Queensland Australia in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. The permit area covers approximately 6,716,000 gross acres. ATP 582 lies within the Georgina Basin, which covers most of the central-eastern part of the Northern Territory and is considered one of the most prospective undeveloped onshore petroleum provinces in Northern Territory and Queensland. Although the Georgina Basin has not had a discovery today, the Cambrian Thorntonia-Arthur Creek succession of the Georgina Basin possess all of the required elements necessary for petroleum generation, migration and entrapment. Of particular interest in the Georgina Basin and on ATP 582 is the presence of the Arthur Shale, which has similar characteristics to the Brakken Shale of Western Canada and North Dakota that has produced more than 10 TCF of gas and 1 Billion barrels of oil.
The improvement in multi high-pressure fracing technology over the past 10 years has made low permeable shale very economic to produce both oil and gas and has been widely used in North America to unlock unconventional reservoirs in shale bearing hydrocarbons. This technology has not been utilized in the Georgina Basin; however, on the adjoining concession to the east in the Northern Territory plans are to drill two horizontal wells into the Arthur Creek Shale utilizing the current high pressure multiple stage fracing on this formation. ATP 582 is well positioned with 1,000,000 acres on the northern most part known to have the presence of the Arthur Creek Shale in place.
The adjoining concession to the west of ATP 582 operated by Baraka Petroleum Limited plans a four well program and if successful plans to expand to a 20 well exploration drilling program.
In addition to the Arthur Shale opportunity, ACOR management has identified two prospects on ATP-582 from the 850 miles of seismic data, owned by ACOR. ATP 582 is up dip of the approximately $1 billion dollar annual production from the Santos-Exxon producing block and is along strike with many new discovery wells that have sustained daily production of 1,000 - 3,000 barrels of oil per day. The two prospects that have been identified are:
The Samphire prospect covers approximately 3,800 acres and exhibits approximately 110 feet of closure. It is possible that a good potential exists for a 10-15 million barrel field, with a possible potential of approximately 40 million barrels.
The Samphire West covers around 4,700 acres. If the Samphire prospect proves to be productive, a number of additional field discoveries may result from leads in the Southern part of ATP-582. Both prospects are a series of sandstone (clastic) reservoirs of pinch-outs and structural traps that have formed on the flank of the local high.
On September 26th, 2006 the Company entered into a Joint Venture arrangement where the partner will operate the concession, pay to obtain Native Title clearance, shoot a new seismic grid survey over the leads identified by ACOR management from old seismic data to confirm good drillable targets with plans to drill a well to earn a 50% working interest under ATP 582 (ACOR will be carried for 50% WI). No exploration work can begin until native title has been cleared.
ITEM 3.
