Item 2. Properties
Comstock Lode Project
Current Project
Location, Access, and Title to the Property
Comstock owns or leases the following mineral exploration projects: The Comstock Mine Project that consists of 5 major resource areas for gold and silver exploration and/or production entitled the Lucerne, Dayton, Spring Valley, Northern and Occidental Resource Areas. The Company also owns or leases the Spring Valley and Gold Canyon Placers Project and the Como Project.
The Comstock Mine Project is located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada. The property is physically situated just south of Virginia City, Nevada. Paved state routes from Reno, Carson City, and Virginia City provide access to the property. The Comstock Mine Project has been the focus of our exploration efforts since 2007, and has been the subject of two National Instruments 43-101 technical reports published in May and August, 2010.
The Spring Valley and Gold Canyon Placers Project (South Comstock) is located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 1.5 miles south of Silver City, Nevada. The placer project is adjacent to our Comstock Mine Project. We have performed geological reconnaissance and limited sampling on this property.
The Como Project is located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles east of Carson City. The Company performed geological reconnaissance on this property, but has not drilled or collected any samples.
Comstock Mine Project
Our property rights to the mineral estate of the Comstock Mine Project consist of several mineral leases, with numerous unpatented and patented mineral claims, and fee ownership of real property. The Company’s holdings consist of approximately 6,099 acres of active mining claims in the Comstock district. The acreage is comprised of 99 acres of patented claims and parcels (private lands) and 5,100 acres of unpatented claims administered by the BLM.
Facilities Area
The Company’s headquarters, mine operations and heap leach processing facility occupy a 40-acre site in Storey County, Nevada, at 1200 American Flat Road, approximately three miles south of Virginia City and 30 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada. The property was included in the acquisition of Plum Mining by the Company in November 2003.
Petrini
On February 17, 2009 we purchased 4.79 acres in the Comstock District for $130,000. $40,000 was paid in cash and the balance of $90,000 was financed through a first deed of trust. The note had interest only payments for two years and accrued interest at 16% per annum. The note was paid in full on January 27, 2011. No royalties are associated with this property.
Obester
On October 15, 2009, we secured long-term control of eleven patented mining claims in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, through a purchase agreement with the Obester Group. This property includes five patented claims in the Lucerne / Billie the Kid area, representing the focus of our recent drilling program. This property also includes six claims in the Occidental area, which provide a target for future exploration. The purchase supersedes a mining lease with Claire Obester, dated January 1, 1997, and a mining lease with Claire Obester, Jim Obester, Alan Obester, and Julian Smith dated May 1, 2008.
The total price to be paid to the Obester Group is $1,650,000. A down payment of $250,000 was accepted, with the balance to be paid in quarterly payments of $250,000 with an interest rate of 6%. These payments were current as of December 31, 2010. The Obester Group will receive a net smelter royalty (NSR) of 1% of all future mineral production from the property. The Occidental area claims also are subject to a 2% NSR to Summa Corp, a previous owner of the property. The property is also subject to a 0.90% NSR to Precious Royalties, LLC. The note was paid off at a 3% discount January 6, 2011.
Donovan
On July 20, 2010, we acquired seven patented mining claims totaling 48 acres, surface rights to two additional patented mining claims totaling 15 acres, 12 unpatented lode claims, and 15 acre-feet of water rights, all located in Storey County, Nevada, from the estate of Michael Donovan. The purchase supersedes a mining lease with Donovan Silver Hills, LLC, dated September 1, 1999. The purchase price was $1,025,000, with an initial payment of $300,000. We financed the remaining $725,000 with an installment note bearing 6% interest, requiring 60 monthly payments of $6,178 and a final payment of then unpaid principal and interest. The former owners of the parcel will retain a 1.5% NSR on all future mineral production from these claims.
Unpatented Claims
The Comstock Mine Project also includes 212 unpatented Lode mining claims in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, which were staked by the Company or its predecessors. The adjacent Spring Valley and Gold Canyon Placers Project consists of 25 unpatented Placer mining claims in Lyon County, which were staked by the Company or its predecessors. All of the mining claims are located on federal lands administered by the BLM.
Fred Garrett - Lease
On April 1, 2008, we entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with Fred Garrett et al, covering one patented claim located in Storey, Nevada. The lease remains in effect as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are being conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor of $250 per month or a 3% NSR, whichever is greater. We are responsible for the payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
James Obester Lease
On August 1, 2008, we entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with James Obester, covering ten unpatented claims located in Storey County. The lease remains in effect as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity of more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor amounting to $200 per month for the first two years and later increasing to $300 per month for the following three years, and then increasing to $500 per month thereafter. In addition, a NSR royalty percentage is applicable. The royalty percentage is a 2% NSR when gold is $900 or less per ounce and 3% NSR when gold is greater than $900 per ounce. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
Michael & Kathryn S. Dondero - Lease/Purchase
On November 1, 2008, we entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with Michael & Kathryn S. Dondero covering seven patented claims located in Lyon County. The lease remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis, without a lapse of activity for more than 180 days. We pay a royalty to the lessor amounting to the greater of $1,000 per month or a 3% NSR. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims. Furthermore, we also have an option to purchase the land and related patents for $900,000, which reduces the royalty to 1%. All drill commitments have been completed.
Railroad & Gold - Lease
On October 1, 2009, we entered into a mineral exploration and mining lease agreement with Railroad and Gold, LLC covering nine patented mining claims and sixteen unpatented mining claims in Storey County. The lease also includes rights for nine town lots and a rural parcel in American Flats. The lease is for an initial term of 15 years, but remains in effect for as long as exploration, development, mining, or processing operations are conducted on a continuous basis. We made an initial payment of $25,000 for the lease. The Company will make annual advance minimum royalty payments, starting with $30,000 on the first anniversary, and increasing by $5,000 each year. We pay a royalty to the lessor at the rate of 4% NSR, which will be reduced by the sum of previously paid advance minimum royalties. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
New Daney - Lease
On June 2, 2010, we entered into a Mineral Exploration and Mining Lease agreement with New Daney Company, Inc. covering seven unpatented lode claims. These claims are located in Lyon County and are contiguous with the company’s Spring Valley mineral holdings. All production from the property is subject to a royalty of 3% NSR. Once permits have been obtained to put the property into production, lease payments will be treated as advance royalties, which will be credited against the royalty.
Golden Goose - Exploration License with Option to Purchase
On July 1, 2010, the Company acquired an exploration license with the purchase option to acquire 4 patented lode claims totaling 95 acres known as the “Dayton.” These mineral claims are contiguous with our Spring Valley mineral holdings and the property has mineralized material inventories calculated by our predecessors. The purchase price is $3,000,000 plus a 3% NSR. In addition, the NSR will be reduced by 75% until the Company receives credit through the reduction of NSR for the $3,000,000 purchase price. The agreement calls for a $500,000 upfront payment and the seller will finance $2,500,000 with a 0% interest seller’s note. The note will be payable in 20 equal quarterly installments of $125,000. Comstock and Golden Goose extended the option period on this contract to September of 2011.
Ida Consolidated - Exploration License with Option to Purchase
On August 1, 2010 the Company acquired an exclusive 180-day exploration license with an option to purchase one patented lode claim known as the Metropolitan and two unpatented lode claims. These claims adjoin the “Dayton” claims where we secured an option to acquire 4 patented lode claims on July 1, 2010. The agreement allows us to purchase these mineral claims for $100,000 plus a 2% net smelter return at any point during the option period. We completed the purchase in January of 2011.
Renegade Mineral Holdings - Lease
On October 14, 2010, we acquired 26 unpatented lode-mining claims along the southern extension of the Occidental Lode structure in Storey County, Nevada. The historic Occidental Lode, also referred to as the Brunswick Lode, is located 1.5 miles due east of and sub-parallel to the veins of the main Comstock Lode. These claims adjoin and extend the Company’s previous holdings of six patented and six unpatented claims, significantly expanding the Company’s position on the Occidental Lode. The Lease has an initial term of 3 years and, in the event we determine that exploration results warrant further development, then the term can be extended initially for two additional six-year terms and then continuously thereafter as long as the Company is producing on property adjacent to or in the vicinity of these new claims. The agreement includes a 3% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty from production with the gold price capped at $2,000 per ounce. We are also responsible for payment and filing of annual maintenance fees, if any, and taxes for these claims.
Northern Comstock Minerals - Joint Venture
On October 20, 2010, the Company entered into an operating agreement to form Northern Comstock LLC (“Northern Comstock”) with Mr. Winfield, a shareholder of the Company, and an entity controlled by Mr. Winfield, DWC Resources, Inc. (“DWC”). As part of the operating agreement, the Company obtained the exclusive rights of production and exploration on certain property formerly owned by DWC in Storey County, Nevada (the “DWC Property”) and two parcels leased by Mr. John Winfield in Storey County, Nevada from the Sutro Tunnel Company (the “Sutro Property”) and Virginia City Ventures (the “VCV Property”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement for Northern Comstock, DWC contributed the DWC Property to Northern Comstock and John Winfield contributed his rights under the Sutro Property and the VCV Property to Northern Comstock. The Company contributed 862.5 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and will contribute its services in the area of mine exploration, development and production to Northern Comstock. The terms of the Operating Agreement provide that on each anniversary of the Operating Agreement, up to and including the thirty-ninth (39th) anniversary, the Company will make additional capital contributions in the amount of $862,500, in the form of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or cash (upon request of Northern Comstock, which request for cash can be denied by the Company in certain circumstances). Under certain circumstances, the additional capital contributions can be accelerated. The Company had previously entered into letters of intent with respect to the DWC Property and Sutro Property on August 13, 2008, the terms of which were expressly superseded by the Operating Agreement.
The Operating Agreement further provides the Company with the exclusive rights of development, production, mining and exploration on the respective properties and requires the Company to make certain expenditures toward that end. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, all cash flows from the bullion or other minerals recovered from the ore mined out of the ground but untreated and minerals produced from the milling or reduction of ore to a higher grade produced from the DWC Property, Sutro Property or VCV Property, as applicable, or finished products produced from any such property, will be distributed to the Company.
Mineral production from the DWC-contributed property is subject to a royalty on a sliding scale. At gold prices over $750 per ounce, production of the first 500,000 ounces is subject to a 3% NSR. Production over 500,000 ounces is subject to a 6% NSR. Mineral production from the DWC-contributed property is also subject to a 1% NSR payable to Mr. Art Wilson.
Mineral production on the Sutro property is subject to a royalty on a sliding scale to John Winfield. At gold prices over $250 per ounce, production of the first 500,000 ounces is subject to a 1% NSR. Production over 500,000 ounces is subject to a 2% NSR. A separate royalty of 5% NSR is also payable to the Sutro Tunnel Company on all production from the property. Mineral production from the VCV property is subject to a 5% NSR.
Silvermex (formerly known as Genco/Rule) - Exploration License with Option to Purchase
On November 1, 2010, the Company acquired an exclusive 180-day exploration license, with an option to purchase, for eight patented lode-mining claims and six unpatented lode-mining claims on the Oest and Comet lodes, west of Silver City, Nevada. The agreement allows Comstock to purchase this property at any time during the option period for a total price of $275,000, with $225,000 carried with 0% interest, in ten quarterly payments of $22,500. The agreement includes a 2.5% NSR royalty from production. The property is also subject to a 10% NSR to a prior owner, which can be bought-out for a one-time fee of $100,000, which can be deducted from the first $100,000 of NSR to Silvermex.

Present Condition of Property and Work Performed
We have completed extensive geological mapping, sampling, and drilling on a portion of the Comstock Mine Project property, in order to characterize the mineralized material. We have performed preliminary metallurgical testing, mine planning, and economic analysis, and have produced internal reports of our mineralized material inventory. However, we have not established reserves that meet the requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7. Therefore, any activity we perform on the property is considered exploratory in nature. Part of our exploration included operating a test mine. The purpose of the test mine was to determine our capital and operating costs, metallurgical recoveries, and other mining factors, and determine if we could make a profit over and above our capital and operating costs.
Description of Equipment and other Infrastructure Facilities
We own a mine office building and shop building, a Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant, an agglomerator, crusher, screen, water truck, generators, dozers, cement silo with a screw feeder, and conveyors. The Merrill-Crowe gold precipitation plant and the mineral processing equipment are less than five years old.
Geology, Structure and Mineralization
Gold and silver mineralization in the project area is highly dependent on geologic structural ground preparation over millions of years, as it is throughout the Comstock Mining District. The heavily-faulted, volcanic-hosted setting of the Plum Mine area is favorable with respect to the natural conditions under which gold and silver mineralization occurs.
Mineralization in the Hartford Complex area is hosted by the northwest striking Silver City fault zone and is enhanced in volume and grade where intersected by cross-cutting east-west and northeast striking structures. Detailed geologic studies by our geologic staff have identified four sub-parallel northwest striking faults within the Silver City fault zone. The spacing between these faults is about 150 feet, while thicknesses of mineralization along individual faults range from 40 to 120 feet.
Mineralization within the project drill area is more gold enriched with silver to gold ratios of approximately 10:1. This compares to ratios of silver to gold of 100:1 over the historic Comstock bonanzas. Drilling has outlined gold and silver mineralization over a strike distance of nearly one mile, with in-fill drilling on 50 to 70 foot centers over .6 of a mile. Mineralization is open-ended to the north and south along strike and down-dip to the east.
Future Exploration Potential
The Comstock Mining district is a well-known, historic mining district, with over 150 years of production history. We have access to extensive reports and maps on various properties in the district, but to-date, we have only conducted detailed geologic exploration on approximately 2% of our 6,099 acre land position. We are conducting an ongoing exploration program to locate and test surface mineral targets as well as deep underground bonanza targets by using historic compilation, geological mapping, geochemical and geophysical investigations and drilling.
The Como Project
We own a 100% interest in eight unpatented lode-mining claims, covering an area of approximately 168 acres in Lyon County, Nevada, that comprise the Como Project. The Company conducted a geological reconnaissance in this area, but has not conducted any drilling or sampling programs on this property.
