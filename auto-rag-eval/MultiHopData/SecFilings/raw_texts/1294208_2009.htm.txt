Item 2 “Properties” for information concerning our wells.
Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP a monthly well supervision fee of $313 per well, as outlined in our drilling and operating agreement. This well supervision fee covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production, delivery and sale of natural gas and oil, such as:
•
well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;
•
reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and
•
preparation of reports for us and government agencies.
The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services and materials and a reasonable charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2009, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.
Markets and Competition. The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our natural gas production. Our natural gas is sold as discussed in Item 2 “Properties.” During 2009 and 2008, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production.
While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry. See Item 2 “Properties” regarding the marketing of our natural gas and oil.
Governmental Regulation. The energy industry in general is heavily regulated by federal and state authorities, including regulation of production, environmental quality and pollution control. The intent of federal and state regulations generally is to prevent waste, protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir and control contamination of the environment. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in substantial fines and other penalties. The following discussion of the regulation of the United States of America energy industry is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and environmental orders to which our operations may be subject.
Regulation of oil and gas producing activities. State regulatory agencies where a producing natural gas well is located provide a comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme for oil and gas operations such as ours including supervising the production activities and the transportation of natural gas sold in intrastate markets. Our oil and gas operations in Pennsylvania are regulated by the Department of Environmental Resources, Division of Oil and Gas, and our oil and gas operations in Tennessee are regulated by the Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation, and the Division of Geology, and our oil and gas operations in West Virginia are regulated by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources.
Among other things, these regulations involve:
•
new well permit and well registration requirements, procedures and fees;
•
minimum well spacing requirements;
•
restriction on well locations and underground gas storage;
•
certain well site restoration, groundwater protection and safety measures;
•
landowner notification requirements;
•
certain bonding or other security measures;
•
various reporting requirements;
•
well plugging standards and procedures; and
•
broad enforcement powers;
Environmental and Safety Regulation. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, and other federal and state laws relating to the environment, owners and operators of wells producing natural gas or oil can be liable for fines, penalties and clean-up costs for pollution caused by the wells. Moreover, the owners or operators’ liability can extend to pollution costs from situations that occurred prior to their acquisition of the assets. State public utility regulators have either adopted federal standards or promulgated their own safety requirements consistent with the federal regulations.
We believe we have complied in all material respects with applicable federal and state regulations and do not expect that these regulations will have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our producing activities must also comply with various federal, state and local laws not mentioned, including those covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

ITEM 2.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
Drilling Activity. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not drill any wells nor do we expect to do so in future years.
Summary of Producing Wells. The table below presents the number of our producing gross and net wells at December 31, 2009, in which we have a working interest. All wells are located in the Appalachian Basin.
Production. The following table presents the quantities of natural gas and oil we produced (net to our interest), our average sales price, and our average production (lifting) cost per equivalent unit of production for the period indicated.
(1)
“Mcf” represents one thousand cubic feet of natural gas. “Mcfe” represents a thousand cubic feet equivalent. Oil production is converted to mcfe at the rate of six mcf per barrel (“bbl”).
(2)
Lifting costs include labor to operate the wells and related equipment, repairs and maintenance, materials and supplies, property taxes, insurance and gathering charges.
(3)
Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.
(4)
Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $366,500 and $361,400 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The derivative gains are included in other comprehensive (loss) income and resulted from prior period impairment charges.
(5)
Average oil prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $3,600 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The derivative gains are included in other comprehensive (loss) income and resulted from prior period impairment charges.
Natural Gas and Oil Reserve Information. In December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures by adopting amendments to Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X and Items 201, 801, and 802 of Regulation S-K effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. These new disclosure requirements are referred to as “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” and include provisions that:
•
Introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations.
•
Report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end pricing. This should maximize the comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing date.
•
Permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. Current rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves.
•
Update and revise reserve definitions to reflect changes in the oil and gas industry and new technologies. New updated definitions include “by geographic area” and “reasonable certainty.”
•
Permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.
•
Require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company’s overall reserve estimation process. Additionally, disclosures are required related to internal controls over reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of a company’s reserves preparer or auditor based on Society of Petroleum Engineers’ criteria.
We have complied with these disclosure requirements for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The following tables summarize information regarding our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves as of the dates indicated. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by an analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The estimated reserves include reserves attributable to our direct ownership interests in oil and gas properties. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we based our estimates of proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted average price of the first-day-of-the-month price for each calendar month 2009 and then applied any basis and British Thermal Units (“btu”) differentials specifically applicable to each oil and gas property based on location and pricing details. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we based our estimates of proved reserves using the natural gas and oil prices as of December 31, 2008 of the respective year. The following table summarizes the natural gas and oil prices used in the estimation of proved reserves:
Reserve estimates are imprecise and may change as additional information becomes available. Furthermore, estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are projections based on engineering data. There are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data as well as the projection of future rates of production. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The preparation of our natural gas and oil reserve estimates were completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of input data delivered to our third-party reserve specialist, as well as a multi-functional management review. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we retained Wright & Company, a third-party, independent petroleum engineering firm, to prepare a report of proved reserves. The reserves report included a detailed review of our properties. Wright & Company’s evaluation was based on more than 35 years of experience in the estimation of and evaluation of petroleum reserves, specified economic parameters, operating conditions, and government regulations applicable as of December 31, 2009. The Wright & Company report, including the qualifications of the chief technical person responsible for the report, was prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of this estimate. Future prices received from the sale of natural gas and oil may be different from those estimated by our independent petroleum engineering firm in preparing their reports. The amounts and timing of future operating costs may also differ from those used. Accordingly, the reserves set forth in the following tables ultimately may not be produced and the proved undeveloped reserves may not be developed within the periods anticipated. You should not construe the estimated PV-10 and standardized measure values as representative of the current or future fair market value of our proved natural gas and oil properties. PV-10 and standardized measure values are based upon projected cash inflows, which do not provide for changes in natural gas and oil prices or for the escalation of expenses. The meaningfulness of these estimates depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based.
We evaluate natural gas reserves at constant temperature and pressure. A change in either of these factors can affect the measurement of natural gas reserves. We deducted when applicable, operating costs, development costs and production-related and ad valorem taxes in arriving at the estimated future cash flows. The following table presents our reserve information for the previous two years. We base the estimates on operating methods and conditions prevailing as of the dates indicated:
(1)
“Proved reserves” generally refers to the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Reservoirs are considered proved if economic production is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The area of a reservoir considered proved includes: that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water contacts, if any; and the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data.
(2)
“Proved developed oil and gas reserves” generally refers to reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
(3)
The present value of estimated future net cash flows is calculated by discounting estimated future net cash flows by 10% annually.
(4)
Please see Regulation S-X rule 4-10 for complete definitions of each reserve category.
(5)
This value per $25,000 unit is determined by following the methodology used for determining our proved reserves using the data discussed above. However, this value does not necessarily reflect the fair market value of a unit, and each unit is illiquid. Also, the value of a unit for purposes of presentment of the unit to our MGP for purchase is different, because it is calculated under a formula set forth in the partnership agreement.
We have not filed any estimates of our oil and gas reserves with, nor were such estimates included in any reports to, any Federal or foreign governmental agency other than the SEC within the 12 months before the date of this filing.
Title to Properties. We believe that we hold good and indefeasible title to our properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the natural gas industry, subject to exceptions stated in the opinions of counsel employed by us in the various areas in which we conduct our activities. We do not believe that these exceptions detract substantially from our use of any property. As is customary in the natural gas industry, our MGP conducts only a perfunctory title examination at the time it acquires a property. Before our MGP commences drilling operations, it conducts an extensive title examination and performs curative work on defects that it deems significant. Our MGP has obtained title examinations for substantially all of our producing properties. No single property represents a material portion of our holdings.
Our properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the natural gas industry. Our properties are also subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements, taxes, development obligations under natural gas and oil leases, farm-out arrangements and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with our use of our properties.
Acreage. The table below presents, by state, the estimated acres of developed oil and gas acreage in which we had an interest at December 31, 2009. There was no undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2009.
(1)
A “gross” acre is an acre in which we own a working interest.
(2)
A “net” acre represents the actual working interest we own in one gross acre divided by one hundred. For example, a 50% working interest in an acre is one gross acre, but a .50 net acre.
Delivery Commitments. Atlas Energy markets our natural gas which is principally located in the Fayette County, PA area, primarily to Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and to third-party natural gas purchasers or marketers.
The pricing arrangements with Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and other third-party gas purchasers or marketers are tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange Commissions or NYMEX spot market price. The total price received for our gas is a combination of the monthly NYMEX spot price plus a basis adjustment. For example, the NYMEX spot price is the base price and there is an additional premium paid because of the location of the gas (the Appalachian Basin) in relation to the gas market, which is referred to as the “basis.”
Pricing for natural gas and oil has been volatile and uncertain for many years. The agreements with Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and the other third-party gas purchasers or marketers also permit Atlas Energy and its affiliates to implement gas forward sales transactions through those companies. Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and the other third-party purchasers or marketers also use NYMEX based financial instruments to hedge their pricing exposure and make price-hedging opportunities available to Atlas Energy, which then makes those arrangements available to us and its other partnerships. The price paid by Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and any other third-party purchasers for certain volumes of natural gas sold under these hedge agreements may be significantly different from the underlying monthly spot market price. Also, Atlas Energy’s hedges may include purchases of regulated NYMEX futures and options contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified counterparties. The futures contracts employed by Atlas Energy are commitments to purchase or sell natural gas at future dates and generally cover one-month periods for up to six years in the future. The overall portion of our natural gas and oil portfolio that is hedged changes from time to time.
To assure that all financial instruments will be used solely for hedging price risks, and not for speculative purposes, Atlas Energy has established a committee to assure that all financial trading is done in compliance with Atlas Energy’s hedging policies and procedures. Atlas Energy does not intend to contract for positions that it cannot offset with actual production.
We are not required to provide any fixed and determinable quantities of gas under any agreement other than with Colonial Energy, Inc., Conoco Phillips Company, D & L Energy, Inc. and the other third-party gas purchasers or marketers.
The MGP is not aware of any legal proceedings filed against us.
Affiliates of the MGP and their subsidiaries are party to various routine legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of their collective business. The MGP management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the MGP’s financial condition or results of operations.
None.
