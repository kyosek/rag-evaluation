ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties on which we hold stream or royalty interests, except for our interest in the Peak Gold JV, and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of certain properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage streams and royalties, as well their respective reserves, are summarized in Table 1 “Operators’ Estimated Proven and Probable Gold Reserves” below within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The Company manages its business under two reportable segments, consisting of the acquisition and management of stream interests and the acquisition and management of royalty interests. The description of our principal streams and royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, stream or royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our stream and royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing stage properties.
Principal Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues to determine which stream and royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues from producing properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, technical reports, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such stream and royalty interests are no longer principal to our business. Currently, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically by stream and royalty interest) to be principal to our business.
Stream Interests
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 100% of the gold produced from the Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered, and 50% thereafter. The cash purchase price equals 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 193,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
Andacollo is an open-pit mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (“CMCA”), a 90% owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”). The Andacollo mine is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo mine by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Stream deliveries from Andacollo were approximately 51,900 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 51,700 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Teck indicated that they expect grades to continue to gradually decline towards reserve grades in calendar 2019 and future years. Teck continues to study and implement projects that could increase production, including the installation of a sizer to better manage harder ores at depth and increase mill throughput.
Mount Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 35% of the payable gold and 18.75% of the payable copper produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by an indirect subsidiary of Centerra Gold Inc. (“Centerra”). The cash purchase price for gold is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price when purchased. The cash purchase price for copper is 15% of the spot price.
Mount Milligan is an open-pit mine and is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mount Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Gold stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 68,500 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 78,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Copper stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 9.1 million pounds of copper during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 10.4 million pounds during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease during the current period reflects the shutdown and lower mill production at Mount Milligan in the March 2018 quarter, which was the result of lower than expected fresh reclaim water volumes in the tailings storage facility that Mount Milligan uses for mill processing operations. Due to the timing of shipments and deliveries of gold and copper, the impact of the shutdown was reflected in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Centerra reported that weather conditions around the Mount Milligan mine, and elsewhere in British Columbia, continue to be exceptionally hot and dry, which has affected precipitation levels as well as water flows, and that water captured from the calendar 2019 spring melt runoff was less than anticipated. Centerra reported that it continues to explore for additional groundwater sources but estimates that if additional sources are not available, and/or dry weather conditions persist in the second half of calendar 2019, it may need to take steps to manage production in the first calendar quarter of 2020 to conserve water resources until the calendar 2020 spring melt.
Despite the dry conditions, Centerra reaffirmed Mount Milligan’s production guidance for the full 2019 calendar year, consisting of 155,000 to 175,000 ounces of payable gold production and 65 to 75 million pounds of payable copper production, and reported that it is continuing to work on a long-term plan to supply water to Mount Milligan after November 2021 and for the remaining mine life.
Pueblo Viejo (Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 7.5% of Barrick’s interest in the gold produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% thereafter. The cash purchase price for gold is 30% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% thereafter. RGLD Gold also owns the right to purchase 75% of Barrick’s interest in the silver produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine, subject to a fixed silver recovery of 70%, until 50 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.5% thereafter. The cash purchase price for silver is 30% of the spot price of silver per ounce delivered until 23.1 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% thereafter. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 181,000 gold ounces and 6.2 million silver ounces have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
The Pueblo Viejo mine is located in the province of Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic, approximately 60 miles northwest of Santo Domingo, and is owned by a joint venture in which Barrick holds a 60% interest and is responsible for operations, and in which Newmont Goldcorp Corporation (“Newmont Goldcorp”) holds a 40% interest. Pueblo Viejo is accessed from Santo Domingo by traveling northwest on Autopista Duarte, Highway #1, approximately 48 miles to Piedra Blanca and proceeding east for approximately 14 miles on Highway #17 to the gatehouse for Pueblo Viejo. Both Highway #1 and Highway #17 are paved.
Gold stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 41,200 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 45,400 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Silver stream deliveries were approximately 2.0 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 1.9 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In calendar 2019, Barrick expects production at Pueblo Viejo to be in line with calendar 2018 production levels, driven by increased throughput and recoveries, offset by declining ore grades.
Barrick indicated that scoping studies and pilot project work are supportive of a plant expansion at the Pueblo Viejo mine that could increase throughput by roughly 50% to 12 million tonnes per year, allowing the mine to maintain average annual gold production of approximately 800,000 ounces after calendar 2022. To achieve this, Barrick is evaluating a flotation concentrator followed by ultra-fine grinding and tank oxidation of the concentrate. Barrick reported that testing to-date indicates that tank oxidation is preferable to the pad pre-oxidation process previously considered. Barrick expects to complete prefeasibility studies for the plant expansion and additional tailings capacity by the end of calendar 2019. According to Barrick, the project has potential to convert roughly seven million ounces of mineralized material to proven and probable reserves.
On May 14, 2018, Barrick reported it signed a 10-year natural gas supply contract with AES Andres DR, S.A. in the Dominican Republic that will enable the conversion of the Quisqueya I power generation facility from heavy fuel oil to natural gas. Barrick anticipates converting the facility from heavy fuel oil to natural gas will reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and power costs at Pueblo Viejo.
Rainy River (Ontario, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 6.50% of the gold produced from the Rainy River project until 230,000 gold ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% thereafter; and 60% of the silver produced from the Rainy River project until 3.1 million silver ounces have been delivered, and 30% thereafter. The cash purchase price for the gold and silver ounces is 25% of the spot price per ounce of gold or silver at the time of delivery. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 24,000 ounces of gold and approximately 235,000 ounces of silver have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
The Rainy River mine is centered within Richardson Township in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and is operated by New Gold Inc. (“New Gold”). The mine is approximately 40 miles northwest of Fort Frances, approximately 100 miles south of Kenora and approximately 260 miles west of Thunder Bay. The mine is easily accessible by a network of secondary all-weather roads that branch off the well-maintained Trans-Canada Highways 11 and 71.
Gold stream deliveries from Rainy River were approximately 16,800 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 6,800 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Silver stream deliveries were approximately 148,800 ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 85,900 ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase resulted from the continued optimization of operations at Rainy River.
On May 1, 2019, New Gold announced that a buildup of excess water in the Tailings Management Area (“TMA”) from snowmelt caused a temporary suspension of milling operations at Rainy River on April 24, 2019. Mining and crushing operations continued and ore was stockpiled during the suspension. On May 6, 2019, New Gold announced that milling operations at Rainy River were restarted on May 3, 2019. New Gold reported the water level in the TMA was lowered to a desirable operational level and pumping into the water management pond continued.
New Gold reported mill throughput for the June 2019 quarter averaged 21,117 tonnes per day and Rainy River averaged a record 24,230 tonnes per day in June 2019, surpassing the target of 24,000 tonnes per day. New Gold expects milled grades to be lower in the second half of calendar 2019 as mining operations shift from Phase 1 to Phase 2 due to the depletion of Phase 1 ore. New Gold also reported a 93% average gold recovery for the June 2019 quarter, a significant improvement over prior quarterly performance. Also during the June 2019 quarter, New Gold advanced a comprehensive mine optimization study that includes the review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios with the overall objective of improving the return on investment over the life of mine by reducing open pit waste, overall underground
development, and sustaining capital. New Gold expects to complete an updated life of mine plan in the December 2019 quarter.
New Gold expects that full year calendar 2019 production will meet annual guidance of between 250,000 and 275,000 gold equivalent ounces.
Wassa (Western Region, Ghana)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 10.50% of the gold produced from the Wassa, Prestea and Bogoso mines, operated by Golden Star, until an aggregate 240,000 ounces from Wassa, Prestea and Bogoso have been delivered. A significant amount of the gold deliveries under the 10.50% gold stream are expected from the Wassa mine. Once the delivery threshold is met, the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5% for the remaining term of the transaction. The cash purchase price for gold is 20% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered until the threshold is met, and 30% thereafter. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 90,000 aggregate gold ounces have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
The Wassa mine and oxide ore mill are located near the village of Akyempim in the Wassa East District, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 50 miles north of Cape Coast and 93 miles west of the capital Accra. The main access to the site is from the east, via the Cape Coast to Twifo-Praso road, then over the combined road-rail bridge on the Pra River. There is also an access road from Takoradi in the south via Mpohor. An airport at Takoradi is capable of handling jet aircraft and is serviced by several commercial flights each day.
Stream deliveries from Wassa were approximately 16,600 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 14,500 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase resulted from the ramp up at Wassa underground as Golden Star transitioned from the lower grade open pit to an underground-only mining operation. Golden Star’s reported objective at Wassa underground is to increase the average production rate from approximately 3,500 tonnes per day in calendar 2019 to approximately 4,000 tonnes per day by mid-calendar 2020.
On July 15, 2019, Golden Star announced that drilling at Wassa underground intersected significant gold mineralization 200 meters down plunge to the south of the previously-identified mineralized material and has extended the strike of this underground ore body over 1.7 kilometers, which remains open to the south. Golden Star expects drilling to focus on conversion of mineralized material to reserves at Wassa.
Golden Star reported that the mining rate at Wassa during the first half of calendar 2019 at 3,500 tonnes per day was in line with their expectations and indicated potential to improve production further during the second half of calendar 2019, but cautioned grades are likely to be lower than planned and below the overall reserve grade. As a result, Golden Star expects production in the second half of calendar 2019 to be lower than the first half of calendar 2019 and therefore, lowered their production guidance for calendar 2019 from between 170,000 and 180,000 ounces of gold to between 150,000 and 160,000 ounces of gold.
Royalty Interests
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a series of large open-pit and underground mines, utilizing mill, roast and heap leach processing, which are operated by Nevada Gold Mines LLC (“NGM”), a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Goldcorp with respect to their Nevada operations. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits, part of the Gap pit and the Crossroads deposit.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)
Reserve Claims (“GSR1”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the “Reserve Claims,” which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits.
The GSR1 royalty rate is tied to the price of gold and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR1 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(b)
GAS Claims (“GSR2”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the “GAS Claims,” which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR2 royalty rate is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR2 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(c)
Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty (“GSR3”). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except certain claims that comprise a portion of the Crossroads deposit.
(d)
Net Value Royalty (“NVR1”) and Net Value Royalty (Crossroads) (“NVR1C”). The NVR1 royalty is a fixed royalty of 4.91% NVR that covers the area of the GAS Claims, excluding the majority of the Crossroads deposit. The NVR1C royalty, which covers the majority of the Crossroads deposit, is a fixed royalty of 4.52% NVR.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
Production attributable to our royalty interest at Cortez increased approximately 24% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase was a result of production ramping up at the Crossroads deposit, which is subject to our NVR1C, GSR2 and portions of our NVR1 and GSR3 royalty interests. Initial ore production at Crossroads was realized during calendar 2018. In calendar 2019, NGM expects Crossroads expansion stripping to transition to production phase stripping.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Newmont Goldcorp. The Peñasquito mine is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The mine, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Gold, silver, lead and zinc production attributable to our royalty interest at Peñasquito decreased approximately 58%, 21%, 4% and 38%, respectively, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
On April 29, 2019, Newmont Goldcorp reported a temporary suspension of operations at Peñasquito due to a blockade by a trucking contractor and certain community leaders. Newmont Goldcorp subsequently reported on June 17, 2019 that dialogue with the blockade leaders had started, operations were beginning, and concentrate shipments from the mine and deliveries to the mine resumed. Newmont Goldcorp reported that operations ramped back up in June 2019 and concentrate inventory levels are now back to normal. This suspension resulted in significantly lower sales from Peñasquito during the June quarter as we recognized $1.1 million in royalty revenue at Peñasquito compared to $5.4 million in the prior year June quarter.
Newmont Goldcorp expects that grades for gold, silver and lead will improve during the last half of calendar 2019, zinc grades will remain unchanged, and production from Peñasquito will be 165,000 ounces of gold, 25 million ounces of silver, 180 million pounds of lead, and 245 million pounds of zinc for the period April 18 through December 31, 2019.

No gold price was reported for Balcooma, Jaguar Nickel, Kutcho Creek or Wembley Durack.
3.
Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Reserve” is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. “Proven (Measured) Reserves” are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size,
shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established. “Probable (Indicated) Reserves” are reserves for which the quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
4.
Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
5.
The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on information provided to Royal Gold or are derived from publicly available information from the operators of the various properties including National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
