Item 2. Description of Property
The following description of the GREKA properties at December 31, 2002 includes all discussions of prior operations of all of GREKA's properties and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
GREKA's Properties as of December 31, 2002
GREKA owned interests in approximately 1,200 wells at December 31, 2002.
The majority of these wells are concentrated in central California. At December 31, 2002, California (heavy oil) was the primary and focused area of GREKA's exploitation and development activities. GREKA's evaluation of international exploration and exploitation project is in China. The Company continuously evaluates the profitability of its oil, gas and related activities and, as part of its strategic business plan, intends to divest unprofitable leases or areas of operations that are not consistent with its business strategy.
Exploitation and Development Activities
The following is a brief discussion of significant developments in California in the Company's recent exploitation and development activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries:
Approximately 99% of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2002 (28.2 MMBOE) were located in four regions in California. Daily production from these regions averaged 3,300 BOE (gross) for the year ended December 31, 2002, representing 99% of GREKA's total production. GREKA operates all of its wells in these California regions. The remaining 1% of GREKA's proved reserves at December 31, 2002 is allocated to domestic producing properties in which GREKA has an interest located in four states other than California.
GREKA seeks to acquire domestic and international producing properties where it can significantly increase reserves through development or exploitation activities and control costs by serving as operator. GREKA believes that its substantial experience and established relationships in the oil and gas industry enable it to identify, evaluate and acquire high potential properties on favorable terms. As the market for acquisitions has become more competitive in recent years, GREKA has taken the initiative in creating acquisition opportunities, particularly with respect to adjacent properties, by directly soliciting fee owners, as well as working and royalty interest holders, who have not placed their properties on the market.
GREKA's 2003 discretionary capital expenditure budget for properties is dependent upon the price for which its products are sold and upon the ability of GREKA to obtain external financing. Subject to these variables and based on the current asset base, we expect our cash flow and credit facilities to fund approximately $15 million in 2003 for capital expenditure. (See Item 1 - "Description of Business, Financing & Debt Restructuring Activities") The Company's 2003 capex program is designed to facilitate organic production increases from the integrated operations. Capex projects identified for 2003, namely workovers, redrills, recompletions, side-tracks, and various facility enhancements, are scheduled throughout the year.
Exploration Activities
GREKA further plans to expand its existing reserve base by developing high potential exploration prospects in known productive regions. GREKA believes these activities complement its traditional development and exploitation activities. In pursuing these exploration opportunities, GREKA may use advanced technologies, including 3-D seismic and satellite imaging. In addition, GREKA may seek to limit its direct financial exposure in exploration projects by entering into strategic partnerships that shift the drilling related financial risks to partners while providing the Company with an upside upon a successful event. At December 31, 2002, GREKA had exploration plays in two primary areas: California and China.
The following is a brief discussion of significant developments in the Company's recent exploration activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries:
Coalinga Nose Exploration Prospect, Fresno County, California. GREKA has leases and contractual rights covering approximately 9,000 acres of land in the region of the prolific Coalinga oil field in the San Joaquin Valley of California. GREKA participated in a 16 square mile 3-D seismic survey covering this area and has interpreted the survey. Nineteen anomalies have been identified in the prospect area, covering five potentially productive zones, ranging in depth from 6,500 to 12,000 feet. GREKA has an 89% working interest below and a 9% working interest above the Gatchell formation in the Leda Prospect, Pleasant Valley, and Cotton Gin Prospects. Since December 31, 2002, GREKA re-evaluated the potential productive zones within the field and identified the most prospective areas. The Company intends to reduce its acreage in the field to these identified areas.
Coalbed Methane Exploration Prospect, Jiangxi, Shanxi and Anhui Provinces, China. In January 2003, GREKA's wholly-owned subsidiaries signed at the Great Hall of the People in China four Production Sharing Contracts PSCs with CUCBM for the exploitation of CBM resources in the Shanxi and Anhui Provinces. Considering the previously signed PSC for the Fengcheng Block in the Jiangxi Province, GREKA is now party to and operator under five, 30-year PSCs for CBM exploitation in China within two development and three exploration blocks. The combined total contract area is approximately 6,600 square kilometers (1.7 million acres) with average coalbed thickness of 16.5 feet and potential reserves of 34.5 Tcf, as estimated by CUCBM. Greka has a 60% working interest in all PSC's other than the Fengcheng Block in which it has a 49% working interest. The remaining working interest is owned by CUCBM.
Oil and Gas Producing Properties
The following table summarizes GREKA's estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2002. The following table includes both proved developed (producing and non-producing) and proved undeveloped reserves. Approximately 51% of the total reserves reflected in the following table are proved undeveloped. There can be no assurance that the timing of drilling, reworking and other operations, volumes, prices and costs employed by Netherland Sewell & Associates and/or Ryder-Scott Company Petroleum Consultants, independent petroleum engineers, will prove accurate. Since December 31, 2002, oil and gas prices have generally increased. At such date, the price of WTI crude oil as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $29.39 per Bbl and the comparable price for March 17, 2003 was $34.93. Quotations for the comparable periods for natural gas were $4.84 per Mcf and $5.51 per Mcf, respectively. The proved developed and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserve figures are estimates based on reserve reports prepared by GREKA's independent petroleum engineers Netherland Sewell & Associates and Ryder-Scott Company Petroleum Consultants. The estimation of reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly with respect to new discoveries. Estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially, depending, in part, on the assumptions made, and may be subject to material adjustment. Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves comprise a substantial portion of GREKA's reserves and, by definition, had not been developed at the time of the engineering estimate. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data as well as engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production or price changes subsequent to the date of the estimate may result in changes to such estimates. The estimates of future net revenues in this report reflect oil and gas prices and production costs as of the date of estimation, without escalation, except where changes in prices were fixed under existing contracts. There can be no assurance that such prices will be realized or that the estimated production volumes will be produced during the periods specified in such reports. The estimated reserves and future net revenues may be subject to material downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. A material decrease in estimated reserves or future net revenues could have a material adverse effect on GREKA and its operations.

The following is a brief discussion of our oil and gas operations in our major fields located in California at December 31, 2002:
Central Coast Fields. One of GREKA's subsidiaries operates seven fields in the Central Coast area of California. These fields provide equity crude oil for GREKA's wholly owned asphalt refinery. The fields are Cat Canyon, Casmalia, Gato Ridge, Santa Maria Valley, Zaca, Clark Avenue and Los Flores which collectively have an average working interest of 100% in 179 active wells producing 2,364 BOEPD (gross). These fields represent 38% of GREKA's total proved reserves.
North Belridge Field. The North Belridge Field is located in Kern County, California. One of GREKA's subsidiaries is the operator and owns 100% working interest in 42 wells on three leases covering 270 contiguous acres. The wells produce from two formations-- light oil from the Diatomite zone and heavy oil from the Tulare formation. Production is about 300 BOEPD, and this field represents 8% of GREKA's total proved reserves.
Rincon Field. One of GREKA's subsidiaries operates the Rincon Field which is located in the Central Coast of California and covers approximately 1,700 mineral acres, including a 1-acre island connected to land by a 2,700' causeway containing the gas and oil pipelines and facilitating vehicular access. GREKA has a 100% working interest in 16 active wells producing approximately 371 BOEPD. This field represents 40% of the Company's total reserve value.
Richfield East Dome Unit. The Richfield East Dome Unit is a mature waterflood (one method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into an oil reservoir for the purpose of washing the oil out of the reservoir rock into the bore of a producing well) in Orange County, California, operated by one of GREKA's subsidiaries and producing approximately 615 BOPD from 94 active wells. The field in which GREKA's working interest is 99%, represents 12% of the Company's total reserve value. Waterflood operations were initiated in 1974 by Texaco. Field facilities are in sufficiently satisfactory condition to service the waterflood operation through the remaining life of the field.
Oil and Gas Reserves
Our proved reserves and the estimated present value of future revenues from proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties in this document have been estimated by our independent petroleum engineers. In 2000, 2001 and 2002, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. prepared reports on GREKA's reserves in the United States (except in the Rincon Field, California), and in 2002 Ryder-Scott Company Petroleum Consultants prepared reports on GREKA's reserves in the Rincon Field, California. The estimates of these independent petroleum engineers were based upon review of production histories and other geological, economic, ownership and engineering data provided by GREKA. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, GREKA's estimates of future net revenues from GREKA's proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of year end and are held constant throughout the life of the properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of gas contracts, the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalation. Future gross revenues at December 31, 2002 reflect weighted average prices of $23.07 per BOE compared to $14.53 per BOE and $26.93 per BOE as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The following tables present total estimated proved developed producing, proved developed non-producing and proved undeveloped reserve volumes as of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the estimated present value of future net revenues ("PV-10") (based on current prices and costs at the respective year's end, using a discount factor of 10 percent per annum). As used herein, the term "proved undeveloped reserves" are those which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage is limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. We do not include estimates for proved undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir. There can be no assurance that these estimates are accurate predictions of reserves or of future net revenues from oil and gas reserves or their present value. The prices received for oil and gas have generally increased since the preparation of the 2002 year end engineering estimates.

Estimates of proved reserves may vary from year to year reflecting changes in the price of oil and gas and results of drilling activities during the intervening period. Reserves previously classified as proved undeveloped may be completely removed from the proved reserves classification in a subsequent year as a consequence of negative results from additional drilling or product price declines which make such undeveloped reserves non-economic to develop. Conversely, successful development and/or increases in product prices may result in additions to proved undeveloped reserves.

As used herein, the terms "proved oil and gas reserves," "proved developed oil and gas reserves," and "proved undeveloped reserves" have the meanings defined by the SEC as set forth in the Table of Contents to this document. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating the sizes of underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserve reports of other engineers might differ from the reports contained herein. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Future prices received for the sale of oil and gas may be different from those used in preparing these reports. The amounts and timing of future operating and development costs may also differ from those used. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
The following table summarizes sales volume, sales price and production cost information for GREKA's net oil and gas production for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002.

Drilling Activity
With respect to GREKA's participation in the drilling of exploratory and development wells for each of the three years in the three year period ended December 31, 2002, there has been no drilling activity except as set forth in the following table:
Year Ended December 31, --------------------------------------------------------- 2000 2001 2002 ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- Gross(1) Net(2) Gross(1) Net(2) Gross(1) Net(2) -------- ------ -------- ------ -------- ------ United States: Development Wells Oil 5 5 1 1 -- -- Gas -- -- 1 1 -- -- Dry (3) 1 1 -- -- -- --
- ---------- (1) A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned.
(2) A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interest in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
(3) A dry hole is an exploratory or development well that is not a producing well.
Productive Oil and Gas Wells
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2002, relating to the number of productive oil and gas wells (producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells that are shut in) in which GREKA through its subsidiaries owned a working interest in the United States:

2000 21,070 16,180 11,201 8,025
- ---------- (1) Developed acreage is acreage assigned to productive wells.
Title to Properties
Many of GREKA's subsidiaries' oil and gas properties are held in the form of mineral leases, licenses, reservations, concession agreements and similar agreements. In general, these agreements do not convey a fee simple title to GREKA, but rather, depending upon the jurisdiction in which the pertinent property is situated, create lesser interests, varying from a profit a prendre to a determinable interest in the minerals. In some jurisdictions, notably non-U.S. jurisdictions, GREKA's subsidiaries' interest is only a contractual relationship and bestows no interest in the oil or gas in place. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. Title investigations are generally completed, however, before commencement of drilling operations or the acquisition of producing properties. GREKA believes that its methods of investigating title to, and acquisition of, its oil and gas properties are consistent with practices customary in the industry and that it has satisfactory title to the leases covering its proved reserves. Because most of GREKA's oil and gas leases require continuous production beyond the primary term, it is always possible that a cessation of producing or operating activities could result in the loss of a lease. Assignments of interest to and/or from GREKA'S subsidiaries may not be publicly recorded.
From time to time, substantially all of GREKA's properties, including its stock in its subsidiaries, are hypothecated to secure GREKA's current and future indebtedness. GREKA's subsidiaries' working interest in properties may be subject to lienholders by non-payment. In the event of GREKA's non-payment or untimely payment of its obligations, GREKA expects liens to be filed against its assets and to be subject to lawsuits. Oil and gas leases in which GREKA'S subsidiaries have an interest may be deficient, require ratifications and be subject to action by GREKA subsidiaries.
Average Sales Price and Production Cost
The following table sets forth information concerning average per unit sales price and production cost for GREKA's oil and gas production for the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31, ------------------------ 2000 2001 2002 ------ ------ ------ Average sales price per BOE $22.14 $19.51 $21.89 Average production cost per BOE $ 5.51 $ 7.87 $ 4.90
Asphalt Refinery
GREKA owns an asphalt refinery in Santa Barbara County, California through a wholly owned subsidiary. The refinery is a fully self-contained plant with steam generation, mechanical shops, control rooms, office, laboratory, emulsion plant and related facilities, and is staffed with a total of 17 operating, maintenance, laboratory and administrative personnel.
Real Estate Activities
GREKA'S subsidiaries from time to time purchased real estate in conjunction with their acquisition of oil and gas and refining properties in California and plan to continue this practice. At December 31, 2002, the Company owned through its subsidiaries approximately 3,300 acres in Santa Barbara County, California. GREKA has used a portion of its real estate holdings for leased agricultural purposes. GREKA plans to retain some of these real estate holdings for asset appreciation which may include developmental activities at a future date.
Offices
GREKA leases approximately 1,000 square feet of office space at 630 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1501, New York, New York, for its executive offices through September 30, 2004. GREKA's other offices are located in Santa Maria, California; and Beijing, China. In July 2002, due to the planned divestiture of related assets, GREKA closed its Houston, Texas office.
