Anchor tenants are defined as any tenant occupying 10,000 or more square feet. We use the tenant's trade name, which may
be different than the legal entity named on the lease.
(b)
We continue to receive rent from tenants who have vacated but are still obligated under their lease terms. These tenants

(a)
We receive rent from tenants who have vacated but are still obligated under their lease terms, which results in economic occupancy ranging from 69% to 100% at December 31, 2007, for each of these centers.
(b)
In connection with the purchase of several investment properties, we, from time to time, receive payments under master lease agreements covering space vacant at the time of acquisition. The payments will be made to us for a period ranging from one to two years from the date of acquisition of the property or until the vacant space is leased and tenants begin paying rent. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") require us to treat these payments as a reduction to the purchase price of the investment properties upon receipt of the payment, rather than as rental income. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had one investment property, Ravinia Plaza, located in Orland Park, Illinois subject to master lease agreements.
