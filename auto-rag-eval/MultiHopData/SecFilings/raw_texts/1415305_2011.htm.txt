Mineral Properties
Lida Valley Claims, Esmeralda County, NV (“Lithium Property”)
Claims
On December 24, 2009, we entered into a purchase agreement with GeoXplor Corp. Under the agreement, we have been granted an exclusive exploration license in regards to claims located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, for Lithium and Lithium Carbonate exploration (the "Lithium Agreement"). Pursuant to the Lithium Agreement, upon the completion of the required payments and work commitments, GeoXplor shall transfer title to the properties to our company and shall retain a 3% royalty, on which we shall have the option to purchase 2%, for $1,000,000 each 1%.
Our required payments and work commitments are as follows:
(1)
make cash payments of $490,500 over a four year period, of which initial payments of $190,000 have been made as of July 31, 2011, and remaining payments are as follows
o
$100,000 on the 2nd year anniversary of 15 December 2011;
o
$100,000 on the 3rd year anniversary of 15 December 2012;
o
$100,000 on the 4th year anniversary of 15 December 2013;
Of the $190,000 paid to date, $75,000 was paid via the issuance of 179,426 shares of the Company.
(2)

o
$350,000 before the 3rd year anniversary of 15 December 2012;
o
$400,000 before the 4th year anniversary of 15 December 2013;
As of July 31, 2011, $230,511 had been expended. In August 2011, a further $10,125 was expended, leaving $9,364 to be expended prior to 15 December 2011.
The claim block contains 76-180 acre unpatented Placer claims and 8-80 acre placer claims, situated in Esmeralda Country, Nevada, comprising a surface area of 12,800 acres (“Lithium Property”). The NMC numbers are 1012555 through 1012557, and 1012477 through 1012554. Certain non-material claims (18 claims) have not been renewed in 2011, as they are intersected by a roadway, and are not believed to be relevant to the exploration and, ultimately, processing process. This will be further reviewed upon additional exploration work being completed.
Location and Access
The Lithium Property is located in South Western Nevada, approximately 150 miles north of Las Vegas and within 15 miles of the Montezuma peak. The project area has excellent infrastructure including a network of roads, railroads and cellular telephone coverage.
Regional & Property Geology
Lida Valley is one of a group of inter-mountain basins in west-central Nevada and is surrounded by Cuprite Hills to the Northwest, Stonewall Mountains to the East and Slate Ridge to the Southwest. It has a playa floor of about 12 square miles that receives surface drainage from an area of about 60 square miles. The playa floor contains erosion remnants of Lithium-rich rhyolite tuff and is surrounded by alluvial fan slopes of the mountain ranges. Altitudes range from 4,630 feet on the playa floor to 7,000 feet on the Stonewall Ridge.
The tertiary volcanic rocks are considered to be involved in the origin of the Lithium deposits in south-central Nevada. The volcanism that created the volcanic rocks also provided the heat energy and hydrothermal activity required to mobilize the Lithium from volcanic glass and other relatively unstable minerals. The Tertiary rhyolites from the Montezuma Range and surrounding mountain ranges are considered to be the most lithium rich rhyolites in the world, (MacDonald et. Al; 1992) Transport of the Lithium would require a hydrothermal fluid, surface water or meteoric groundwater. Evaporation concentrated the Lithium in the brine to economic grades which are considered to be in the 100 to 300 ppm range. The Lithium rich water would also alter the playa sediments to form Lithium-rich clays and Lithium rich inclusions in halite.
Exploration
In March of 2010, the Company commissioned a gravity survey on the Lithium Property, total cost of $85,287, undertaken by Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc. of Prescott, Arizona, which report was completed in June 2010. The gravity survey was conducted for lithium brine exploration over claims Lithium Property. The purpose of the survey was to map depth to bedrock or thickness of sediments, map any geologic structures that may be significant to the occurrence of lithium brine, and provide information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys.
Interpretation of the modeled gravity data indicates several areas with increased bedrock depths or lower bedrock elevations. These areas may be conducive for concentration of lithium-bearing brines, but the presence, dip and continuity of aquifer beds plus the detailed mapping of any structures both within the sedimentary section and bedrock should be determined through high resolution geophysical means prior to drilling.
In order to further detail on the above gravity survey, a 2nd gravity survey was commissioned for a cost of $22,000, which was completed in August 2010.
Based on the positive indicators found from the two gravity survey reports, two geophysical approaches were recommended in areas selected from the gravity surveys: 1) controlled-source audiomagnetotellurics / magnetotellurics (CSAMT/MT) surveys, and 2) reflection seismic surveys. It was recommended that the CSAMT/MT surveys be conducted because they will determine if conductive zones, possibly indicative of lithium-bearing brines, are present and continuous. Additionally these surveys may help define aquifer dip.
Based on the above recommendation, the Company engaged GeoXplor, in association with Hasbrouck Geophysics, Inc., to undertake the CSAMT/MT surveys. The work was completed and a report provided to the Company in February 2011, for a total cost of $112,500. As with the previous two geophysical surveys conducted, the results were positive, and include having identified areas of potential lithium brine deposits. The mapping indicated a geologic stratigraphy and structure relative to the occurrence of lithium brine, and identified conductors that are thought to be
representative of lithium-bearing brine, thus providing information for the selection and design of additional geophysical surveys or the identification of drilling locations.
Collectively, the three reports show several clear targets for further exploratory investigations. Drilling targets in both the southern end of the Property and in the northern area of the playa have been located based on the identification of several areas showing areas of low resistivity. The complete reports from Hasbrouck Geophysics from all exploration stages on the Property are currently available at the Company’s website, www.firstlibertypower.com.
Based on these results, in May 2010, the Company determined that the best and most efficient approach is to bypass seismic surveys, and proceed directly to a 3 - 5 hole drilling program, and therefore requested a work program estimate from GeoXplor, which has now been presented to the Company in October 2011. The drill program, estimated at 3000m total, will target areas of significant Lithium brine potential identified by the Company's exploration program (i.e., areas marked by gravity lows and low resistivity) through certain initial holes followed by the remaining holes depending on first results. By penetrating the formations comprising the basin fill in the Lithium Property, the drill results will allow the Company to identify the concentration, if any, of Lithium and other constituents in the groundwater in these target zones. GeoXplor Corp., who will perform the drilling, estimates that each hole will require one week's time, with a budgeted cost of $343,000.
The Company is required to undertake a total of approximately $750,000 worth of work on the Lithium Property prior to December 2013. The next steps for exploration, over the next year, are expected to be the drill program as indicated above. If the results are positive for the drill program, we will base our next phase exploration program on those results, though we would expect additional drilling to be involved.
As of July 31, 2011 and to date, the exploration work undertaken has provided continued positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are as of yet no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Lithium Property in order to determine if a commercially viable reserve does exist.
At present, the Company does not have sufficient funds for the planned drill program, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock. While initial arrangements have been made to accomplish the raising of additional funds, and the Company expects to be able to raise the required funds for the next phases of the exploration program, our success in doing so cannot be assured.
Uravan Claims, San Juan Country, Utah (“Van-Ur Property”)
Claims
On December 24, 2009, we entered into a purchase agreements with GeoXplor Corp. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive exploration license in regards to claim located in San Juan County, Utah, for Vanadium and Uranium exploration (the "Van-Ur Agreement"). Pursuant to the Van-Ur Agreement, upon the completion of the required payments and work commitments, GeoXplor would transfer title to the properties to our company and would retain a 3% royalty, on which we had the option to purchase 2%, for $1,000,000 for each 1%. The claim block contains 66 vanadium-uranium mineral lode claims, situated in San Juan County, Utah, comprising a surface area of 12,800 acres (“Uravan Property”).
We completed initial payments under the Van-Ur Agreement, including $80,000 cash and the issuance of 250,000 shares, and incurred approximately $20,000 in exploration/maintenance costs. In December 2010, GeoXplor agreed to a 60 day extension to December 15, 2010 payment due under the agreement. Prior to the expiry of this extension, on February 3, 2011, we entered into and closed a property acquisition agreement with New America Energy Corp. (“New America”) and GeoXplor Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, we granted an option, as well as exploration rights, to the Uravan Property, and we received the following payments and consideration from New America:
·
$10,000 on the execution of the agreement; $33,333 within 120 days of the execution of the agreement; $33,333 within 240 days of the execution of the agreement; and $33,334 within 360 days of the execution of the agreement;
·
500,000 shares of New America common stock; and
·
A 0.5% net smelter royalty on all net revenue derived from production from the Uravan Property.
If New America is unable to make any of the ongoing share issuances or payments under the agreements with GeoXplor and the Company, the property rights would revert to the Company who would be responsible for any remaining payments to GeoXplor which are as follows:
·
$50,000 on February 28, 2011; $50,000 on May 31, 2011; $100,000 on the 1st year anniversary of the agreement; $100,000 on the 2nd year anniversary of the agreement; $100,000 on the 3rd year anniversary of the agreement; and $100,000 on the 4th year anniversary of the agreement;
·
250,000 shares of common stock on or before the date one year from the date of the agreement; 250,000 shares of common stock on or before the date two years from the date of the agreement; and 250,000 shares of common stock on or before the date three years from the date of the agreement; and
·
A 2.5% net smelter royalty on all net revenue derived from production from the Uravan Property.
Pursuant to the terms of the Van-Ur Agreement, New America made cash payments in the amount of $10,000, and issued 500,000 shares of common stock to the Company and made cash payments in the amount of $50,000 and issued 500,000 shares of common stock to GeoXplor.
The payment of $33,333 due to the Company on June 3, 2011 and the payment of $50,000 due to GeoXplor on May 31, 2011 pursuant to the Van-Ur Agreement were not paid as due. The parties to the agreement verbally agreed to extend the payment due dates by 120 days and on August 1, 2011, with an effective date of May 31, 2011, the parties executed an extension agreement. Under the terms of the extension agreement, during the 120 extension period commencing from May 31, 2011, GeoXplor has the right to solicit and accept offers by other parties on the property, in which case the Van-Ur Agreement will be terminated and neither New America nor the Company will have any further rights or interest in the Uravan property. At any time prior to the expiration of the 120 day term either NECA or the Company could pay the required payments to GeoXplor. Should neither NECA nor the Company pay the required payments under the agreement then the property will revert to GeoXplor unless further extended.
The extension agreement was lapsed on September 30, 2011, with neither New America nor the Company making additional payments; therefore the claims have fully reverted back to GeoXplor Corp. We are considering entering into new negotiations with GeoXplor with respect to the claims, but have not yet done so.
Details on the Uravan Property are below for reference, while the Company undertakes to make a final determination on whether to proceed with the re-acquisition of the Uravan Property.
Location and Access
The Uravan Property is located in the northeast corner of San Juan County approximately 40 miles southeast of Moab, Utah. The area is sparsely populated with a small village of La Sal, Utah, about 10 miles west of the claim block. Utah Highway 46, an all-weather paved road provides access to the southern region of the mineral claims. A network of forests roads, drill access roads and jeep trails make most of the claim block accessible year round.
The climate of San Juan County is semi-arid with minor precipitation. The average annual precipitation is 12.83 inches with an average snowfall of 44.5 inches. The snowfalls during November to May occasionally reach 15 inches or more. The Uravan Property is located in the high desert ecosystem with erosional landscape exposing the sandstone formations. Deep canyons with canyon walls composed of alternating erosion-resistant benches and highly erodible slopes, and broad flat benches are the predominant landscape features. Vegetation consists of greasewood, salt bush, rabbit bush with willows and cottonwood in the drainage area.
Regional & Property Geology
The Uravan Mineral claims are located within the Colorado Plateau near the Utah-Colorado border. The Colorado Plateau is a broad area of regional uplift consisting mainly of flat-lying Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. The strata is gently folded and faulted by uplift, intrusion and collapse of plastic evaporite formations on the east and by intrusion of laccolithic complexes now composing the La Sal Mountains on the west.
The uranium-vanadium deposits in the La Sal quadrangle occur in the uppermost sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The ore bearing sandstone range in thickness from a few feet to 100 feet. The sandstone is a medium to fine grained quartzose interbedded with siltstone and mudstone. Near the uranium-vanadium mineralization, the sandstone is white, light gray or light brown, and the siltstone and mudstone are usually light green or gray green.
The uranium-vanadium deposits mined in the nearby producing mines occur in the uppermost sandstone beds within the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation. This unit is commonly called the ore-bearing sandstone or third rim in reference to its position above the Entrada Sandstone.
The ore-bearing sandstone is composed of a single broad lens of cross-laminated sandstone ranging from 0 to 30 feet in thickness. In other areas it is composed of overlapping sandstone lenses which have a combined thickness of 30 to 100 feet. The cross-laminated sandstone appears to have been deposited in a flood-plain environment. Scour and fill bedding consisting of cross-bedded sandstone lenses truncated by and direct contact with other truncated lenses separated by thin discontinuous mudstone lenses or mudstone conglomerate. Fragments of fossil wood are abundant in the scour and fill beds and occur either along the bedding planes or in pot like masses called “trash pockets”.
Exploration
A radon survey was completed on the Uravan Mineral Claims during September, 2009. The theory of radon soil surveys is based on the element radon which is a radioactive daughter product of uranium decay. Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium, a product of uranium and thorium decay in rocks and soils. Theoretically, radon-222 concentrations in soil should be directly related to the uranium content of the minerals in the soil and rocks. Radon is a daughter product of uranium-238 and a non-reactive, highly mobile gas that migrates away from the site of its uranium parent by diffusion and advection along joints, faults, and intergranular permeable pathways.
The magnitude of a radon anomaly associated with a parent concentration of uranium will be due to the size and grade of the parent body. Dispersion and dilution along the pathways to the surface increase the size of the radon footprint but also reduce the magnitude. The location of the anomaly relative to the uranium body will be strongly influenced by the orientation of the pathways to the surface.
The radon survey uses a system that measures the radon by utilizing an ion chamber with a electrically charged Teflon, called an electret, located inside an electrically conducting plastic chamber of known air volume. The electrets serve as a source of high voltage needed for the chamber to operate as an ion chamber. It also serves as a sensor for the measurement of ionization in air. The ions produced inside the sensitive volume of the chamber are collected by the electrets causing a depletion of charge.
The measurement of the depleted charge during the exposure period is a measure of integrated ionization during the measurement period. The electrets charge is read before and after the exposure using a specially built non-contact electret voltage reader.
The Uravan mineral claims radon survey consisted of 101 readings with a minimum reading of 0.35 and a maximum reading of 27.75. The median reading was 6.75 with a midrange of 14.05. The grid results were then contoured and presented in the attached report. Proposed drill locations have also been located and presented on the following map.
The preliminary radon survey data indicates an anomalous east-west radiometric trend. The size of the anomalies appears to be similar to the size of the high grade vanadium-uranium beds mined from the Firefly, Gray Daun and Vanadium Queen Mine. A detailed radon survey would define drill targets and thereby, delineate tonnage and grade within the Uravan Claim Block.
Data compiled from mining activity and regional studies indicates ground considered favorable for Vanadium-Uranium mineralization has the following features:
•
Sandstone beds over 30 feet in thickness with a light brown to light gray color with a medium to fine grain size.
•
The sandstone contains carbonaceous material and a gray or grayish-green mudstone.
•
The beds contain mudstone as a film, pebbles or seams.
•
The sandstone is overlain by gray, greenish-gray or green mudstone
The next steps for exploration, together with estimated costs, are as follows:
·
The Vanadium-Uranium Channel in the La Sal area has produced ore from the uppermost sandstone unit of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The deposits occur in lenticular channel type sandstone beds that are over 30 feet in thickness. Therefore, it is recommended that a detailed geological mapping program over the Uravan claim block be completed with emphasis on the delineation of sandstone beds that have a light brown, white, or light gray color with a thickness over 30 feet. Special attention should be given to areas that have a green or gray mudstone overlying the sandstone beds.
o
Projected Costs $25,000.00
·
Based on the preliminary radon survey data, recommendations are made to complete a detail radon survey with 50 meter line spacing and 50 meter station intervals. This would define areas of anomalous radon readings and combined with the geological mapping program would create drill targets to define the continuation of the Vanadium Queen-Firefly vanadium/uranium channel.
o
Projected Costs $75,000.00
·
Historical data and preliminary radon survey data indicate a 10,000 ft drill program would be required to define the grade and tonnage of the Vanadium Queen-Firefly channel that is projected to extend under the Uravan Mineral Claims. The estimated costs for the drill program are:
o
Rehab of Access and Drill Roads $10,000.00
o
Rotary Drilling (10,000 ft @ $15.00/ft) $150,000.00
o
Radiometric Logging of Drill Holes (10,000 ft @ $1.50/ft) $15,000.00
o
Chemical analysis of Drill Samples $20,000.00
o
Geological Supervision and Report Compilation $25,000.00
o
Total: $220,000
As of July 31, 2011, the exploration conducted to date has provided positive indications that additional exploration is warranted, but there are no known or proven reserves, and substantial additional exploration work must be undertaken on the Van-Ur Property.
The Company does not presently have sufficient funds to undertake a re-acquisition of the Uravan Property, nor for the planned exploration program that would be required, and would need to raise additional capital either through obtaining additional loans, or through the sale of its common stock.
