ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
Our stabilized portfolio of operating properties was comprised of the following properties at December 31, 2020:
_______________________
(1)Represents physical and economic occupancy.
(2)Includes stabilized life science and retail space.
Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently committed for construction, under construction or in the tenant improvement phase, undeveloped land and real estate assets held for sale. We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define properties in the tenant improvement phase as office and life science properties that we are developing or redeveloping where the project has reached cold shell condition and is ready for tenant improvements, which may require additional major base building construction before being placed in service. Projects in the tenant improvement phase are added to our stabilized portfolio once the project reaches the earlier of 95% occupancy or one year from the date of the cessation of major base building construction activities. Costs capitalized to construction in progress for development and redevelopment properties are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and deferred leasing costs on our consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property as the projects or phases of projects are placed in service.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we added four development projects to our stabilized portfolio consisting of 750,370 square feet of office in San Francisco, California, 361,388 square feet of office space in Hollywood, California, 95,871 square feet of retail space and 608 residential units in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2020, the following properties were excluded from our stabilized portfolio. We did not have any redevelopment properties or properties held for sale at December 31, 2020.
________________________
(1)Estimated rentable square feet upon completion.
(2)In addition to the estimated office and life science rentable square feet noted above, development projects under construction also include 193 residential units.
Our stabilized portfolio also excludes our future development pipeline, which as of December 31, 2020, was comprised of five future development sites, representing approximately 61 gross acres of undeveloped land.
As of December 31, 2020, all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of eight stabilized office properties, one development project in the tenant improvement phase and one future development project located in the state of Washington. All of our properties and development projects are 100% owned, excluding four office properties owned by three consolidated property partnerships.
We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership. All our properties are held in fee, except for the fourteen office buildings that are held subject to five long-term ground leases for the land (see Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our ground lease obligations).
In general, the office properties are leased to tenants on a full service gross, modified gross or triple net basis. Under a full service gross lease, we are obligated to pay the tenant’s proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating expenses up to the amount incurred during the tenant’s first year of occupancy (“Base Year”). The tenant pays its pro-rata share of increases in expenses above the Base Year. A modified gross lease is similar to a full service gross lease, except tenants are obligated to pay their proportionate share of certain operating expenses, usually electricity, directly to the service provider. In addition, some office properties, primarily in the Greater Seattle region and certain properties in certain submarkets in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles, are leased to tenants on a triple net basis, pursuant to which the tenants pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, operating costs and utility costs.
We believe that all of our properties are well maintained and do not require significant capital improvements. As of December 31, 2020, we managed all of our office properties through internal property managers.
