Mid-Continent Region. Since 1973 St. Mary has been active in the Mid-Continent region, where operations are managed by our 32-person Tulsa, Oklahoma office. We have ongoing exploration and development programs in the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of Oklahoma and Texas. The Mid-Continent region accounted for 30% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, or
148.7 BCFE, 84% of which were proved developed and 95% of which were natural gas. We participated in drilling 50 gross wells in this region in 2002, including 26 wells operated by us, 88% of which were completed as producers.
St. Mary's development and exploration budget in the Mid-Continent region for 2003 totals $45.0 million. We plan to operate 36 drilling wells in the Mid-Continent region during 2003 and to utilize three to four drilling rigs throughout the year. Our 2003 budget also reflects participation in an additional 10 to 30 wells to be operated by other entities.
Anadarko Basin. Our long history of operations and proprietary geologic knowledge enables us to sustain economic development and exploration programs despite periods of adverse industry conditions. We are applying state of the art technology in hydraulic fracturing and innovative well completion techniques to accelerate production and associated cash flow from the region's tight gas reservoirs. We also continue to benefit from the continuing consolidation of operators in the basin as we pursue attractive opportunities to acquire properties.
Approximately 55% of the drilling activities for 2003 will be focused on low-to-medium-risk development in the Cromwell, Granite Wash, Osborne, Red Fork and Spiro formations. In addition, approximately 45% of our 2003 Mid-Continent capital budget is allocated to deeper, higher-potential wells in the Morrow and Atoka formations at the NE Mayfield Field in Oklahoma and in various other fields within the Morrow and Springer formations at depths up to 22,000 feet.
Carrier Prospect. Within its inventory of higher-risk higher-potential exploration prospects, St. Mary holds an aggregate 42% working interest in 5,700 acres in Leon County, Texas. Our Carrier Prospect acreage relates to a platform reef prospect located near the industry's prolific Cotton Valley pinnacle reef discovery and targets potentially larger platform reefs that we believe developed in the deeper waters of the basin during the Jurassic period. We plan to seek industry participation for an initial test well in 2003.
Arkoma Basin. In February 2002 we expanded our Arkoma Basin holdings with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and an 89-mile gas gathering system from Merchant Resources #1 L.P. of Houston, Texas for $7.5 million. The properties include undrilled locations and are expected to complement our existing properties in the area. In 2002, we spud 11 wells in this area with an 82% success rate. The primary producing formations in this area include the Booch, Hartshorne, Wapanucka and the Cromwell. Our average working interest for these wells is 91%, and we anticipate drilling at least ten gross wells in this area in 2002. Initial production rates from the wells have varied from approximately 500 Mcf per day to 1,250 Mcf per day. Since the Merchant acquisition we have increased production in this area from two MMcf per day to nearly eight MMcf per day.
Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico Region. St. Mary's presence in south Louisiana dates to the early 1900's when our founders acquired a franchise property in St. Mary Parish on the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. These 24,900 acres of fee lands yielded $2.9 million of gross oil and gas royalty revenue in 2002. Our onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico presence increased significantly in 1999 with the acquisition of King Ranch Energy. This acquisition included 260,000 gross undeveloped acres (81,000 net acres) and a large 3-D seismic database. The Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region accounted for 8% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, or 39.9 BCFE, 95% of which were proved developed and 94% of which were natural gas.
St. Mary's diverse activities in the onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico are managed by our 13-person regional office in Lafayette, Louisiana and include ongoing development and exploitation programs in multiple basins onshore south Louisiana as well as several offshore shallow-water Gulf of Mexico blocks. Advanced 3-D seismic imaging and interpretation techniques and extensive subsurface geological interpretations are revitalizing exploration and development activities in the Miocene trend along the Gulf Coast. Our exploration and development budget in the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico region for 2003 is $17.0 million.
The Judge Digby Field is the largest field acquired in the King Ranch Energy acquisition and is located outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana in Point Coupee Parish. We have interests ranging from 10% to 20% in eleven wells that are producing a total of 180 MMcf per day on a gross basis as of February 2003. This ultra deep field produces from multiple Tuscaloosa reservoirs between 19,000 and 24,000 feet. The wells are characterized by high producing rates such as the Parlange #11 completed in 2000 at an initial rate of 92,000 Mcf per day. We believe this well had the highest initial production rate for a well ever completed onshore Louisiana. New drilling in this field is continuing with the completion of the J. Wuertele #3 in August 2002 with producing rates up to 60,000 Mcf per day. The Majors #4 was drilled to 22,962 feet and completed in December 2002 in the C-3 and C-4 Tuscaloosa sands producing at initial rates up to 36,000 Mcf per day. Two new wells and two sidetrack wells are planned for 2003 along with several recompletions in this multi-pay geologically complex field.
In December 2002 we acquired additional interests in the High Island Field where we drilled the successful Miami Corp T-1 well in 2001. This well is currently producing 8,500 Mcf per day and we plan to drill an offset well in 2003.
Fee Lands. St. Mary owns 24,900 acres of fee lands and associated mineral rights in St. Mary Parish located approximately 85 miles southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. Since the initial discovery on our fee lands in 1938, our cumulative oil and gas revenues, primarily landowner's royalties, from the Bayou Sale, Horseshoe Bayou and Belle Isle fields have exceeded $235 million. We currently lease 9,945 acres and have granted a seismic option to Seismic Exchange, Inc. on the remaining 14,969 acres. The survey is underway and will cover the entire fee properties. SEI estimates the acquisition of the data to be completed by mid-October. Under the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to receive a copy of the processed data and have been granted the right to utilize the data for our purpose or for purposes of showing the data to current lessees and prospective lessees. Upon completion of the processing of the survey data, we are hopeful this will encourage development drilling by our lessees, facilitate the origination of new prospects and stimulate exploration interest in deeper, untested horizons. Our principal operators on the fee properties are BP Amoco, Cabot and Amerada Hess
ArkLaTex Region. St. Mary's operations in the ArkLaTex region are managed by our 18-person office in Shreveport, Louisiana. The ArkLaTex region accounted for 11% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, or 55.6 BCFE, 75% of which were proved developed and 85% of which were natural gas. In 1992, we acquired oil and gas properties and rights to over 6,000 square miles of proprietary 2-D seismic data in the region. Much of the Shreveport office's successful exploration and development programs have derived from niche acquisitions completed since 1992 totaling $23.2 million. These acquisitions have provided access to strategic holdings of undeveloped acreage and proprietary packages of geologic and seismic data, resulting in an active program of additional development and exploration.
Our holdings in the ArkLaTex region are comprised of interests in approximately 701 producing gross wells, including 117 wells operated by us; interests in leases totaling approximately 77,158 gross acres; and mineral
servitudes totaling approximately 14,600 gross acres. Activities in the ArkLaTex region during 2002 focused on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields as well as final development of several important field discoveries made by our geoscientists since 1994. We completed two acquisitions totaling $4.9 million for primarily undeveloped properties in the Huxley Field, part of the James Lime Horizontal Trend. Our initial well, the USA N No. 2-H was completed in early 2003 at a rate of 3,800 Mcf per day. We have six additional wells planned in the Huxley Field in 2003.
In 2003 we will continue to focus on the search for new opportunities and potential analog fields in which to apply our proprietary geologic models and production techniques. We anticipate participating in 35 gross wells in the ArkLaTex region and are the operator of properties representing approximately 85% of our 2003 ArkLaTex region capital expenditures budget.
Rocky Mountain Region. Nance Petroleum Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Mary, has conducted operations in the Williston Basin in eastern Montana and western North Dakota on our behalf since 1991, initially under a joint venture arrangement and subsequently as a wholly owned subsidiary. This area has expanded into the Green River Basin with properties acquired from Choctaw and Flying J and the Powder River Basin with our coal-bed methane pilot project and additional properties acquired from Flying J in 2003. The Rocky Mountain region accounted for 41% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, or 200.1 BCFE, 96% of which were proved developed and 82% of which were oil.
Our office in Billings, Montana includes a 35-person staff. A significant portion of the exploration and development in the Rocky Mountain Region is based on the interpretation of 3-D seismic data. We have successfully used 3-D seismic imaging to delineate structure and porosity development in the Red River formation. Since 1991 we have successfully completed 34 out of 38 gross wells drilled and operated. Our prospect inventory continues to expand as results from current activity lead to additional areas to conduct 3-D seismic surveys. Ten additional 3-D surveys are planned for 2003.
St. Mary spent $17 million on exploration and development in the Williston Basin in 2002. In December 2002 we completed a $69.5 million acquisition of Williston Basin properties from Burlington Resources. These properties currently produce approximately 3,100 barrels of oil and 3,300 Mcf of gas per day. Our 2003 Rocky Mountain Region exploration and development capital budget is $33.0 million. We plan to drill seventeen operated wells with working interests ranging from 48% to 100%. We are the operator of properties representing approximately 86% of our Rocky Mountain Region capital budget in 2003.
In January 2003 St. Mary issued 3,380,818 shares of its restricted common stock valued at $71.6 million to acquire Rocky Mountain properties from Flying J Oil & Gas Inc. and Big West Oil & Gas Inc. This acquisition included properties located in the Williston, Powder River and Green River Basins with 66.9 BCFE of proved reserves and production of approximately 2,100 barrels of oil and 8,200 Mcf of gas per day. We also received a net amount of $2.8 million in cash for normal purchase price adjustments. In addition, St. Mary made a non-recourse loan to Flying J and Big West of $71.6 million at LIBOR plus 2% for up to a 39-month period, which is secured by a pledge of the shares of St. Mary stock issued to Flying J and Big West. The loan was funded through borrowings under our bank credit facility.
Permian Basin Region. The Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of eastern New Mexico and western Texas and is one of the major producing basins in the United States. The basin includes hundreds of oil fields
undergoing secondary and enhanced oil recovery projects. 3-D seismic imaging of existing fields and advanced secondary recovery programs are substantially increasing oil recoveries in the Permian Basin. Our holdings in the Permian Basin resulted from a series of niche property acquisitions since 1995, which total $22.1 million. We believe that our Permian Basin operations provide us with a solid base of long-lived oil reserves, promising longer-term exploration and development prospects and the potential for secondary recovery projects. The Permian Basin region accounted for 9.5% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, or 46.6 BCFE, of which 73% were proved developed and 73% were oil.
St. Mary participated in drilling 15 gross wells in 2002 with an 80% success rate. The East Shugart Delaware Unit waterflood project was initiated in 2000 with a 5-well pilot project. Production flattened out in 2002 and the initial response from the water injection is anticipated in 2003. We are hopeful the East Shugart waterflood will be an analog to our successful Parkway Delaware Unit waterflood that increased production from 325 Bbl per day in 1996 when the property was acquired to 1,200 Bbl per day in 2002.
Our Permian Basin capital budget for 2002 is $12.0 million. In addition to drilling four injection wells in the East Shugart Delaware waterflood, two wells are planned at our Samboca prospect, six in-fill wells are planned at Ft. Chadbourne and three wells in the Parkway and HJSA fields.
Other Areas. We have acquired leases covering 145,000 gross acres in which we own an average 90% working interest in the Hanging Woman Basin of Montana and Wyoming for prospective coalbed methane development. We have drilled an 18-well pilot program and are evaluating its results. We are also currently investigating permitting and environmental issues related to these prospects. We will be unable to determine the future potential of these prospects until we have completed the evaluation of our pilot program and have resolved all such permitting and environmental issues. An environmental public interest group has filed a lawsuit against the federal Bureau of Land Management seeking to cancel certain federal leases related to coalbed methane development in Montana, which could affect 48,000 of our 145,000 gross leased acres. We will monitor this lawsuit as part of our investigation of environmental issues related to these prospects. See "Legal Proceedings" for a discussion of this lawsuit.
On April 26, 2002, the Interior Board of Land Appeals of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order that reversed a decision by the Bureau of Land Management dismissing a protest by the Wyoming Outdoor Council and Powder River Basin Resource Council of the offer for sale in February 2000 of three oil and gas leases in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The Board held that the BLM determination to allow the offer for sale of the three particular leases did not comply with environmental laws since the environmental analysis used by the BLM in making that determination did not contain a discussion of the unique potential impacts associated with coalbed methane extraction and development or consider reasonable alternatives relevant to a pre-leasing environmental analysis. On October 15, 2002, the Board refused to reconsider this lease holding. The order addressed only three particular leases covering approximately 2,600 acres that are not included in our Hanging Woman Basin project. However, we cannot assure you that other leases, including issued leases that we hold in the Hanging Woman Basin, will not be challenged on a similar basis.
Coalbed methane production is similar to our traditional natural gas production as to the physical producing facilities and the product produced. However, the subsurface mechanisms that allow the gas to move to the wellbore and the producing characteristics of coalbed methane wells are very different from traditional natural gas production. Unlike conventional gas wells, which
require a porous and permeable reservoir, hydrocarbon migration and a natural structural and/or stratigraphic trap, the coalbed methane gas is trapped in the molecular structure of the coal itself until released by pressure changes resulting from the removal of in situ water. Frequently, coalbeds are partly or completely saturated with water. As the water is removed, internal pressures on the coal are decreased, allowing the gas to desorb from the coal and flow to the wellbore. Unlike traditional gas wells, new coalbed methane wells often produce water for several months and then, as the water production decreases, natural gas production increases as the coal seams de-water.
Coalbed methane gas production in the Hanging Woman Basin requires state permits for the use of well-site pits and evaporation ponds for the disposal of produced water. However, groundwater produced from the coal seams can generally be discharged into arroyos, surface waters, well-site pits and evaporation ponds without a permit if it does not exceed surface discharge permit levels, and if it meets state and federal primary drinking water standards. All of these disposal options require an extensive third-party water sampling and laboratory analysis program to ensure compliance with state permit standards. Where water of lesser quality is involved or the wells produce water in excess of the applicable volumetric permit limits, additional disposal wells would have to be drilled to re-inject the produced water back into deep underground rock formations.
Duchesne Deep. In 2002 we acquired over 12,000 acres in the Uinta Basin of Utah to drill a basin centered gas test in the Mesaverde formation at depths up to 16,000 feet. Using current technology and our experience drilling and completing tight gas sand formations, our objective is to economically produce gas from the tight Mesaverde sand. The first well was spud in September 2002 and reached total depth in early 2003. The well will undergo extensive testing and if successful, $4.8 million is budgeted in 2003 for additional acreage and to drill two additional wells.
Acquisitions
In December 2002 we completed a $69.5 million acquisition of Williston Basin properties from Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company LP. Other acquisitions in 2002 totaled $18.2 million including the $7.5 million acquisition of Arkoma Basin, Oklahoma properties from Merchant Resources LP and the $4.9 Huxley Field acquisition in east Texas. In November 2001, we completed a $40.5 million acquisition from Choctaw II Oil & Gas, Ltd. of oil and gas properties located in our Williston Basin core area and the Green River Basin in Wyoming. During the last five years we have completed over $232 million of acquisitions. For 2003 we have budgeted $90.0 million for property acquisitions. However, we have the financial capacity to commit substantially greater resources to purchases should additional opportunities be identified. In January 2003 we closed a $68.8 million acquisition of Rocky Mountain properties from Flying J Oil & Gas Inc. and Big West Oil & Gas Inc., after purchase price adjustments. This acquisition included 66.9 BCFE of proved reserves located in the Williston, Powder River and Green River Basins. In January 2003 we also closed a $5.2 million acquisition of interests in our Ft. Chadbourne field in west Texas.
Reserves
The following table presents summary information with respect to the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, as prepared by both Ryder Scott Company, independent petroleum engineers, and us. For the periods presented, Ryder Scott Company evaluated properties representing approximately 80% of our
total PV-10 value while we evaluated the remainder. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves owned by St. Mary. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated, but prices include the effects of hedging contracts. You should read the following table along with the sections entitled "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Information concerning our reserves and future net revenue estimates is uncertain".
As of December 31, -------------------------------- 2002 2001 2000 ---- ---- ---- Proved Reserves Data: Oil (MBbls) 36,119 23,669 20,950 Gas (MMcf) 274,172 241,231 225,975 MMCFE 490,887 383,247 351,673 PV-10 value (in thousands) (1) $ 824,808 $ 363,795 $ 1,153,663 Proved Developed Reserves 88% 86% 87% Production Replacement 306% 166% 168% Reserve Life (years) (2) 8.9 7.1 6.7 ------------------
(1) PV-10 value as of December 31, 2002, was calculated using prices in effect at December 31, 2002, of $31.20 per barrel of oil (NYMEX) and $4.74 per MMBtu of gas (Gulf Coast spot price). Both of these prices were then adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials. These prices were 57% and 79% higher, respectively, than prices used to calculate PV-10 value as of December 31, 2001. The PV-10 value includes a deficit totaling $23,398,000 attributable to price hedging contracts. (2) Reserve life represents the estimated proved reserves at the dates indicated divided by actual production for the preceding 12-month period.

Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2002, we had interests in 1,256 gross (558 net) productive oil wells and 1,457 gross (334 net) productive gas wells. Productive wells are either producing wells or wells capable of commercial production although currently shut in. One or more completions in the same wellbore are counted as one well. A well is categorized under state reporting regulations as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of gas to oil produced when it first commenced production, and such designation may not be indicative of current production.
