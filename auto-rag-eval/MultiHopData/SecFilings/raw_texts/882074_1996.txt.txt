Amoco Acquisition
On August 26, 1996 the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Amoco Production Company to acquire Amoco's interest in 13 offshore blocks comprising six fields in the Gulf of Mexico ("Amoco Properties"). The acquisition closed October 8, 1996. The purchase price for the assets acquired in this transaction was $40,400,000, paid by the issuance of 2,000,000 Common Shares, at $4.20 per share, and by payment to Amoco of $32,000,000 in cash.
In addition to the interests acquired, the Company purchased a 33.3% interest in a 12.67 mile 12" pipeline connecting East Breaks Block 160 platform to the High Island Offshore System ("HIOS"), a natural gas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and a 33.3% interest in a 17.47 mile 10" pipeline connecting the East Breaks Block 160 platform to the High Island Pipeline System ("HIPS"), a crude oil pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico. HIOS and HIPS are the primary natural gas and crude oil pipeline systems in that part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The East Breaks Block 160 platform also serves a subsea well owned by Mobil Oil Corporation in East Breaks Block 117. Under agreements with Mobil the owners of the East Breaks Block 160 platform share in certain fees paid by Mobil.
The following table lists the field names, block numbers, working interests, net revenue interests and number of wells of the properties.

Average net production from these fields during 1996 was 11.5 MMcf of gas per day and 583 barrels of oil per day and cash flow net to the interests was $11,200,000. Management believes that these fields have potential for substantial reserve and production increases. Three of the fields have proprietary 3-D seismic.
East Breaks 160 Field
This field consists of two blocks, East Breaks 160 and 161. The water depth ranges from 900' to 1,100'. The Company owns a 33.3% working interest with a 27.8% net revenue interest. Unocal Corporation is the operator. East Breaks 160 field produces from an anticlinal ridge with 12 productive horizons. A proprietary 3-D survey was shot and processed in 1990. Net proved reserves are estimated to be 9.7 Bcf and 1,131 MBO. The GA-2 and HB-2 reservoirs account for most of the reserves. Additional income is derived from processing fees from the Mobil Oil Corporation recent discovery in adjacent Block 117. This subsea well is tied back to the East Breaks 160 platform. Management believes there are numerous reservoirs in the field which have not been adequately evaluated with wells. Additional wells on Blocks 160 and 161 and in adjacent blocks are under consideration by Unocal Corporation.
High Island A-302 Field
High Island Block A-302 is in approximately 200' of water. The Company owns a 33.3% working interest with a 27.8% net revenue interest. Unocal Corporation is the operator. Production is from four producing
horizons on a faulted anticlinal structure. A speculative 3-D survey was shot in 1991 and processed in 1992. One well is producing, with one well scheduled to be recompleted in 1997. Management believes additional reserves should be recoverable from two sands in an area which seismic data shows to be undrained by the existing wells.
High Island A-309 Field
High Island A-309 field consists of two blocks, High Island A-309 and A-310, in approximately 200' of water. The Company owns a 45% working interest in Block A-309 and a 55% working interest in Block A-310. Coastal Oil and Gas Corporation is the operator. Production is from three faulted anticlines with 18 productive horizons. Proprietary 3-D seismic data has been reprocessed. Net Proved Reserves are estimated to be 4.0 Bcf. Numerous additional wells and recompletions are planned for 1997 through 1999.
High Island A-330 Field
The field consists of three blocks, High Island A-330, High Island A-349 and West Cameron 613. The field is located in 280' of water. The Company owns a 12% working interest with a 10% net revenue interest. Costal Oil and Gas Corporation is the operator. Three wells have been recompleted in 1996. This field produces from a faulted anticline with 24 productive horizons. The Company has 2-D seismic on this field, but a 3-D seismic survey was recently shot. Management believes that significant upside potential was delineated by the 3-D seismic. A well in West Cameron Block 613 has been proposed by the operator for 1997 to offset a field operated by Shell offshore in Block A-350 and other wells and recompletions are under consideration.
High Island A-474 Field
This field consists of three full blocks in the High Island Area, A-474, A-489, A-499, and part of Block A- 475. The water depth is 250' to 285 and Phillips Petroleum Company ("Phillips") is the operator. The Company owns a 12% working interest with a 10% net revenue interest in Blocks A-474 and A-489, a 13.1% working interest with a 10.9% net revenue interest in Block A-499, and a 12% working interest with a 9% net revenue interest in Block A-475. There are 23 productive horizons in this faulted anticline. A proprietary 3-D seismic was shot in 1991 and processed in 1993. Net Proved Reserves are 1.2 Bcf and 199 MBO.
West Cameron 180 Field
This field consists of a single block, West Cameron 144, in 40' of water. Texaco is the operator. The Company owns a 12.5% working interest with a 10.4% net revenue interest. The producing feature is a north- plunging faulted anticline that underlies West Cameron Blocks 173 and 180. There are three productive horizons.
West Delta Properties
These properties consist of 13,565 acres in Blocks 52 through 56 and Block 58 in the West Delta Area, offshore Louisiana. The properties have 36 wells, five of which were recently drilled. The West Delta Properties were acquired from Conoco, Inc., Atlantic Richfield Company (now Vastar Resources, Inc.), OXY USA, Inc. and Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. in May 1991. During 1995 the properties had net production averaging approximately 20,643 Mcf of natural gas per day and 264 barrels of oil and condensate per day. During 1996 production was substantially diminished by the explosion and fire.
The Company has a 87.5% net revenue interest in the field, subject to a 5% net profits interest on the shallower reservoirs in favor of the Companys' former lenders and a 4.166% overriding royalty interest on the deeper reservoirs in favor of Conoco and OXY. In 1994 the Company spent $6,900,000 on drilling four wells and the recompletion of eight wells on these properties. The Company is the operator and generally owns 100% of the working interest in these wells. Presently, the wells produce from depths ranging from 1,200 feet to 12,500 feet. Because of the existing surface structures and production equipment, management believes that additional wells can be added on the properties with lower completion costs.
The Company has agreed to farmout the deep rights in West Delta Blocks 53 through 56 to Flores & Rucks, Inc., which has agreed to fund a new 3-D seismic survey. The Company retains all presently producing reservoirs. Management believes this farmout will bring about an evaluation of any deep reservoir potential and allow the Company to further evaluate the presently producing reservoirs using the new 3-D seismic. The Company will have the option of retaining a 12 1/2% overriding royalty interest or participating up to 50% as a working interest owner in any wells drilled by Flores & Rucks, Inc.
During 1994 the Company farmed out the deep rights (below 11,300 feet) to an 1,875 acre parcel in Block 58 to Energy Development Corporation which drilled a successful well to 16,500 feet. Production commenced in April, 1995. The Company retained a 12 1/2% overriding royalty interest in that acreage that converts to a 15% overriding royalty interest at Payout. The well has produced as much as 21,000 Mcf per day and 1,500 barrels of condensate per day. Energy Development Corporation was subsequently acquired by Samedan Oil Corporation.
The Company generated a prospect in the northern portion of West Delta Block 58 using 3-D seismic, which it farmed out to Tana Oil & Gas Corporation in 1996. Tana drilled a successful well to 12,800 feet which encountered 85 feet of net pay and produces in excess of 15,000 Mcf per day. The Company retained a 5.833% overriding royalty interest in the farmout, convertible to a 25% working interest at payout.
The main production facility on the West Delta Properties is a four platform complex designated as Tank Battery #3. There are four ancillary platforms in the eastern portion of the properties connected to Tank Battery #3. Three wells are on one of these platforms. In the western portion there is one production platform designated as Platform "D" in Block 58, with three wells. The remaining 30 wells are located on satellite structures connected to Tank Battery #3 or one of its ancillary platforms. Eight wells produce oil and natural gas. The remaining wells produce only natural gas.
The Company has recently replaced the pipeline connecting "D" Platform in Block 58 with Tank Battery # 3 in Block 54 with two new 6" pipelines.
In connection with the acquisition of the West Delta offshore properties the Company provides the sellers with a $4,100,000 plugging and abandonment bond collateralized in part with a bank escrow account.
Zapata Properties
On July 12th, 1995, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Zapata Exploration Company ("Zapata") to acquire all of Zapata's offshore oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. The properties consist of East Breaks Blocks 109 and 110, East Cameron Block 359, Eugene Island Block 372, South Timbalier Block 185 and West Cameron Block 538, totaling 31,134 gross acres. The transaction was closed July 26, 1995. The Company took over as operator of the East Breaks and West Cameron properties effective at closing. The East Cameron property is operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. The Eugene Island
property is operated by Unocal Corporation and the South Timbalier property is operated by Louisiana Land & Exploration Company. Proved net reserves at December 31, 1996 were 168,000 Bbls of oil and 8.5 Bcf of natural gas. During 1996, the properties produced 49,275 barrels of oil and 3.5 Bcf of natural gas, net to the Company's interest.
In addition to the mineral interests acquired, the Company purchased a 100% interest in a 31 mile natural gas pipeline connecting the Company's East Breaks 110 platform to the High Island Offshore System and a 22 mile oil pipeline which connects the East Breaks 110 platform with the High Island Pipeline System. HIOS and HIPS are the primary natural gas and crude oil systems in that part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The Company's East Breaks 110 platform has significant excess capacity for both crude oil and natural gas. Prior to the acquisition of the properties, Zapata had entered into a Facilities Sharing Agreement with AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc. ("AGIP") to operate and process for AGIP's subsea wells in Blocks 112 and 157. Under the Agreement AGIP will pay certain fees to the Company and split the cost of operating the East Breaks 110 platform with the Company, based upon each company's proportion of production. A portion, not to exceed $6,000,000, of the monies earned pursuant to this Agreement are being paid to Zapata as part of the acquisition of the properties.
The purchase price for the assets acquired in the transaction was $2,748,000 in cash and the obligation to pay a production payment to Zapata based upon future production. The production payment is based upon production from the East Breaks 109 Field after production of 12 Bcfe gross (10 Bcfe net) measured from October 1, 1994. The Company will pay to Zapata $.4167 per Mcfe on the next 27 Bcfe of gross production, if that much is produced. Payments to Zapata on this production payment are to be made by the Company when it is paid for the oil or gas. The Company's oil and gas reserves are calculated net of this production payment.
Bayou Sorrel Field
As of December 27, 1995 the Company acquired from Shell Western E & P, Inc. all of its interest in the Bayou Sorrel Field in Iberville Parish, Louisiana. The purchase price of the field and a related receivable of $600,000 was $10,455,000 in cash, including a $205,000 brokers' fee.
Effective September 1, 1996 the Company sold the Bayou Sorrel Field to National Energy Group, Inc. for $11,000,000. The Company received $9,000,000 in cash and 477,612 shares of National Energy Group, Inc. common stock, which were valued at $2,000,000 as of the November 26, 1996, the closing date. These shares are restricted securities and are not freely tradeable. The Company has demand registration rights and has made such a demand. The Company retained a 3% overriding royalty interest in the deep rights of the field at depths below 11,000 feet.

Title to Oil and Gas Properties
In the case of acquired properties title opinions are obtained for the more significant properties. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations a thorough drillsite title examination is conducted and curative work performed with respect to significant defects.
Undeveloped Acreage and Unproved Properties
The Company does not hold interest in a significant amount of Undeveloped Acreage to which no Proved Reserves have been assigned. However, the Company retained a 3% overriding royalty interest in depths below 11,000 feet when it sold the Bayou Sorrel Field, and no reserves have been attributed to these depths.
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On October 8,1996, the Company closed its acquisition of interests in thirteen offshore blocks comprising six fields in the Gulf of Mexico from Amoco Production Company. The purchase price for the assets acquired in this transaction was $40,400,000, paid by the issuance of 2,000,000 Common Shares and by payment to Amoco of $32,000,000 in cash. Concurrently with this transaction the Company entered into a new Bank Facility with First Union National Bank of North Carolina and Banque Paribas under which its reducing revolving loan was increased to $40,000,000, with an initial borrowing base (credit limit) of $35,000,000. In addition to that facility, the Company borrowed $17,000,000 pursuant to the 1996 Tranche A Convertible Subordinated Notes and the 1996 Tranche B Bridge Loan Subordinated Notes.
On July 26, 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the offshore oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico owned by Zapata Exploration Company, the "Zapata Properties." The purchase price for the Zapata properties and a related receivable of $174,000 ($84,000 at December 31, 1995) was $2,748,000 in cash and an obligation to pay a production payment to Zapata based on future production. See "Properties - Zapata Properties."
Effective September 1, 1996, the Company sold the Bayou Sorrel Field to National Energy Group, Inc. for a sales price of $11,000,000, consisting of $9,000,000 in cash and 477,612 shares of National Energy Group, Inc. common stock, which were valued at $2,000,000 as of the closing date. The field was purchased by the Company on December 27, 1995 from Shell Western E & P, Inc. for $10,500,000, which included a $204,000 broker's fee and a related receivable of $600,000.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (OPERATIONS) For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995
1. Basis of Presentation
1996:
The Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Income (Operations) for the year ended December 31, 1996 presents the combined effects of the acquisition of the Amoco Properties, which closed on October 8, 1996 and the sale of the Bayou Sorrel Field, effective September 1, 1996 as if these transactions had been consummated on January 1, 1995. The results of the Amoco Properties are included in the Company's 1996 results of operations after the acquisition date, October 8, 1996. The pro forma revenues, expenses and adjustments for the Amoco Properties are only for the period of January 1 to October 7, 1996.
Included in 1996 is the issuance of 2,000,000 Common Shares to Amoco Production Company. These shares are included in the Company's 1996 actual weighted average shares from October 8 to December 31, the 1,540,000 is the weighted average number of shares from January 1 to October 7.
The 1996 pro forma total weighted average shares outstanding of 14,282,000 is based on the actual weighted average number of 12,742,000 and the 2,000,000 Common Shares issued to Amoco Production Company weighted for the period of January 1 to October 7, or 1,540,000.
1995:
The Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Income (Operations) for the year ended December 31, 1995 presents the combined effects of the acquisition of the Amoco Properties, which closed on October 8, 1996, and the Zapata Properties, closed on July 26, 1995, as if the acquisitions had been consummated on January 1, 1995.
Because the Bayou Sorrel Field was purchased on December 27, 1995, there was no activity included in the Company's results of operations in 1995, and therefore, no pro forma elimination adjustments are necessary for 1995.
The results of the Zapata Properties are included in the Company's 1995 results of operations after the acquisition date, July 26, 1995. The pro forma revenues, expenses and adjustments for the Zapata Properties are only for the period of January 1 to July 25, 1995.
The 1995 pro forma total weighted average shares outstanding of 13,505,000 is based on the actual weighted average number of 11,505,000 and the 2,000,000 Common Shares issued to Amoco Production Company, weighted for the entire year.
1996 & 1995:
There are no pro forma adjustments for General and Administrative expenses as the Company anticipates no increases in this category based on the nature of the assets acquired.
The shares issuable upon conversion of the 1996 Tranche A Convertible Subordinated Notes, a part of the financing of the Amoco acquisition, are not considered common stock equivalents and are not included
in the weighted average shares outstanding calculation for either period.
2. Amoco and Zapata Properties Pro Forma Adjustments
Additional lease operating expenses of $110,000 in 1996 and $314,000 in 1995 represent the estimated additional insurance costs of owning the Amoco Properties and the Zapata Properties. These amounts are estimated using the Company's current insurance rates for owning the properties acquired or similar properties.
Additional depletion and depreciation expense of $6,974,000 in 1996 and $12,408,000 in 1995 represents the estimated depletion and depreciation for assets acquired in the respective acquisitions assuming the purchase prices and proved reserve amounts were identical to those that existed at the time of the actual acquisitions.
Additional interest expense of $1,630,000 in 1996 and $2,901,000 in 1995 represents the increased borrowings at January 1, 1995. The purchase price assumed for each acquisition is the same as at the actual date of acquisition. It is assumed that cash on hand at the beginning of 1995 was used for the acquisitions, with the balance of any cash required being funded with the Company's Bank Facility and the 1996 Subordinated Notes, using the rates in effect at the time of the acquisition for the Bank Facility and 12% for the 1996 Subordinated Notes, also the same rate received at the time of the acquisition. These assumptions would have required the Company to borrow $32,000,000 for the cash portion of the Amoco Acquisition, $17,000,000 under the 1996 Subordinated Notes at 12% and $15,000,000 under the Company's Bank Facility, with an assumed interest rate of 7.25%, the actual weighted average rate the Company incurred at the time of the acquisition.
3. Bayou Sorrel Pro Forma Adjustments
The adjustments with respect to the sale of the Bayou Sorrel Field represent the revenues and expenses of the Field from January 1 to August 31, 1996. Interest expense is reduced to reflect the elimination of the financing for the acquisition, closed on December 28, 1995. The reduction in interest expense is based on the Company's pro forma elimination of the debt associated with the purchase of the Bayou Sorrel Field.
