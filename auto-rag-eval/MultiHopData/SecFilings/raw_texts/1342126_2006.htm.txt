Since 2000, we have leased our interests in Hudson to Hudson Leaseco LLC, an entity in which we owned a 0.1% membership interest, under a 35-year lease. The remaining 99.9% membership interest was owned by Chevron TCI, Inc. The lease to Hudson Leaseco allowed for the pass-through of tax credits to Chevron TCI, which used the tax credits on a current basis. In September 2006, the Company purchased 99.99% (as calculated in accordance with the purchase agreement and the operating agreement between the parties) of Chevron TCI’s interest and intends to acquire the remaining .01% in 2007. Because we receive the majority of the cash flow under the lease, Hudson Leaseco is consolidated for accounting purposes.

The Hotel. The hotel’s eleven-story tower houses 647 spacious hotel rooms, including 583 guest rooms and 63 suites and one 4,500 square foot “mega suite.” The guest rooms and deluxe suites average approximately 500 square feet in size, which is larger than the size of the average Las Vegas hotel room.

The rooms also include special amenities such as 42-inch plasma screen televisions with high speed internet access, stereo systems and French doors that open to the outdoors. A full-service concierge and 24-hour room service are available to all guests of the hotel.
The Casino. The innovative, distinctive style of the 30,000 square-foot circular casino is a major attraction for both Las Vegas visitors and local residents. The casino is designed with an innovative circular layout around the elevated Center Bar, which allows the casino’s patrons to see and be seen from nearly every area of the casino as well as play Blackjack at 3 gaming tables in the bar. Rock music is played continuously to provide the casino with an energetic and entertaining, club-like atmosphere.
The casino houses 92 table games including 67 Blackjack, 7 Craps, 6 Roulette, 1 Caribbean Stud Poker, 1 Mini-Baccarat, 1 Big Baccarat, 1 War, 3 Three Card Poker, 2 Bonus Texas Holdem, 1 Big 6 and 1 Pai-Gow Poker, 548 slot and video machines, an approximate 1,200 square-foot race and sports book as well as the 2,000 square-foot Center Bar. Some of the casino’s gaming chips are themed to coincide with current concerts and the casino also offers patrons other attractions, such as cutting edge slot technology, proprietary slot graphics, distinctive slot signage, guitar-neck-shaped levers on certain slot machines and piano-like roulette tables complete with keyboards.
The casino, and all gaming related activities of Hard Rock, is operated by Golden Gaming under a definitive lease agreement.
Retail. The hotel’s retail operations consist of the Retail Store, a 3,600 square-foot retail shop. Visitors may purchase shirts, hats, pins, golf bags, children’s clothing, stationary, leather jackets, collectible pin sets, sundry items and a variety of other merchandise displaying the popular “Hard Rock Hotel” and “HRH” logos from the Retail Store, through the web site and from a sundry store located in the resort. Additionally, the retail store carries a wide variety of designer clothing.
Body English. The Body English nightclub has approximately 8,500 square-foot facility, with an 1,100 person capacity, featuring two rooms on two levels, including a sunken dance floor, three bars and state-of-the-art lighting and sound equipment featuring popular and innovative DJs in from all around the country to provide the proper entertainment to attract our target clientele.
Banquet Facility. The hotel’s 6,000 square-foot conference center and entertainment area has capacity for 390 persons. The state-of-the-art facility is located adjacent to the Beach Club area and can accommodate one large event/group and has the capability of being separated into three distinct 2,000 square-foot areas.
The Joint. As a live music venue with capacity for 2,050 persons, The Joint successfully draws audiences from Las Vegas visitors and from the local Las Vegas population. The Joint has become a premier venue in Las Vegas for live popular music, especially due to its relatively small capacity and intimate atmosphere.
The Beach Club. The Beach Club features a 300-foot long, sand bottomed pool with a water slide, a water fall, a running stream and underwater rock music. The Beach Club also features beaches with white sand imported from Monterey, California, rock outcroppings and whirlpools. In addition, the Beach Club features swim-up blackjack, a Beach Club bar and grill, 37 Tahitian-style private cabanas, and a removable dance floor that extends from one of the beach areas, providing the perfect party space amid thousands of tons of imported sand. The private cabanas include water misters, a refrigerator, a safe, a television and, for an additional fee, an on-site massage service.
Food and Beverage. The hotel offers its patrons a selection of high-quality food and beverages at multiple price points. The food and beverage operations include five restaurants (AJ’s Steakhouse, Pink Taco, Simon Kitchen and Bar, Mr. Lucky’s, and Nobu), three bars in the casino (the Las Vegas Lounge, Sports Deluxe and Center Bar), three bars in The Joint, a bar at the Beach Club and catering service for corporate events, conventions, banquets and parties. AJ’s Steakhouse, with seating capacity for approximately 100 persons, is reminiscent of classic steakhouses that reigned in 60’s Las Vegas, with an open kitchen, and serves prime Chicago stockyard beef. Pink Taco, with seating capacity of approximately 150 persons, is a hip authentic Mexican eatery with seasonal outside dining. Simon Kitchen and Bar, a hip restaurant with seating capacity for approximately 180 persons designed by Yabu Pushelberg, serves the upscale world cuisine of celebrity chef Kerry Simon. Mr. Lucky’s, a 24-hour restaurant with seating capacity for approximately 200 persons, specializes in high-quality, moderately priced American cuisine. Nobu, with seating capacity of approximately 120 persons, is a ground breaking temple of Japanese cuisine with Latin American influences created by Master Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and owned and operated independently of the hotel.
Both the 1,800 square-foot Las Vegas Lounge and the 1,963 square-foot Center Bar have become popular with both Las Vegas tourists and local residents who we believe are attracted to the hotel’s entertainment and vibrant, energetic atmosphere. As a result, these bars frequently reach their service capacity on weekends, holidays and when special events and concerts are held in The Joint or at the Beach Club. In addition, The Joint and the Beach Club offer their customers a limited selection of menu items and beverages.
The Rock Spa. The state-of-the-art health club and spa facilities feature amenities such as treadmills, stair-masters, stationary bicycles, CYBEX machines, a variety of free-weights, steam rooms, showers, massage, facial and other personal services.
Adjacent Development Land Parcel. The adjacent 23-acre land parcel, including a 544 unit apartment complex currently situated on the parcel, will be held for further development.
Expansion. We plan to undertake a large-scale renovation and expansion project for the Hard Rock. The expansion project is expected to result in the addition of approximately 950 guest rooms, including an all-suite 15-story tower with upgraded amenities, approximately 35,000 square feet of casino space, and approximately 60,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. In addition, the project includes the expansion of the Hard Rock’s award-winning pool, several prominent new food and beverage outlets, a new Joint live entertainment venue, 30,000 square feet of new retail space, as well as a new spa and health club. The expansion, will add approximately 550 guest rooms in a new tower to be constructed on the existing property site, and will use eight acres of the acquired adjacent 23-acre land parcel to build a new suite tower with an additional 400 rooms. The project, which is scheduled to begin in 2007, is expected to be fully completed before the end of 2009.
Renovations to the existing property will begin in early 2007, with upgrades to existing suites, restaurants and bars, retail shops, and common areas, and a new ultra lounge and poker room. As part of the renovation, the Hard Rock’s existing suites and common areas will be renovated to revitalize the property and bring it up to the Company’s brand standard. These renovations are scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2008, with certain elements to be completed earlier.
The Company and DLJMB are currently evaluating several options for the remainder of the 23-acre land parcel.
Mondrian South Beach
On August 8, 2006, the Company entered into a 50/50 joint venture (the “South Beach Venture”) with an affiliate of Hudson Capital. The South Beach Venture acquired an apartment building located on Biscayne Bay in South Beach Miami. The apartment building will be converted into a hotel operated under the Company’s Mondrian brand and is expected to open during early 2008.
The 16-story property will be renovated to create a distinctive lodging, dining and nightlife experience, and is expected to include numerous other hotel amenities, such as a pool, spa, event and meeting space. The property fronts Biscayne Bay and offers spectacular views of the downtown Miami skyline, the Atlantic Ocean and South Beach. The hotel will have approximately 342 units comprised of studios, one and two-bedroom units, and five penthouse suites. In addition, given the property’s location, Mondrian South Beach will offer a vast array of waterfront services, including private VIP boat slips for sailing and yachting and recreational activities for its guests.
The South Beach Venture is also in the process of selling some or all of the new luxury units as condominiums, subject to market conditions. It is anticipated that unit buyers will have the opportunity to place their units into a rental program. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We have recently invested, and may continue to invest in the future, in select non-hotel properties, such as condominium and other residual projects, and this strategy may not yield the returns we expect, may result in disruptions to our business or shared management resources.”
The Company will operate Mondrian South Beach under a long-term incentive management contract.
