ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
ARI’s principal offices are located at 1800 Valley View Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75234 and are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for ARI’s present operations.
Details of ARI’s and its subsidiaries’ real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios at December 31, 2005, are set forth in SCHEDULES III and IV, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.” The discussions set forth below under the headings “Real Estate” and “Mortgage Loans” provide certain summary information concerning ARI’s real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolios.
At December 31, 2005, no single asset accounted for 10.0% or more of total assets. At December 31, 2005, 82.7% of ARI’s assets consisted of real estate, and 6.1% consisted of notes and interest receivable. The remaining 11.2% of ARI’s assets were cash, cash equivalents, marketable equity securities, restaurant equipment, investments in equity investees, goodwill and other intangibles, and other assets. The percentage of assets invested in any one category is subject to change and no assurance can be given that the composition of ARI’s assets in the future will approximate the percentages listed above.
ARI’s real estate is geographically diverse with concentrations in the Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest regions. At December 31, 2005, ARI’s real estate was located in all geographic regions of the continental United States, other than the Northeast region, as shown more specifically in the table under “Real Estate” below. ARI also holds mortgage notes receivable secured by real estate located in the Southwest, Pacific, and Midwest regions of the continental United States. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for a detailed description of ARI’s notes receivable portfolio.
Real Estate
At December 31, 2005, 83.7% of ARI’s assets were invested in real estate and the equity securities of IORI and other equity investees. ARI invests in real estate located throughout the continental United States, either on a leveraged or non-leveraged basis. ARI’s real estate portfolio consists of properties held for investment, properties held for sale, investments in partnerships, and investments in equity investees.
Types of Real Estate Investments. ARI’s real estate consists of apartments, commercial properties (office buildings, industrial warehouses, shopping centers, and a merchandise mart), hotels, and improved and unimproved land. In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age, and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values, and physical condition are among the factors considered. Properties may be purchased subject to debt, or existing debt may be assumed and properties may be mortgaged, pledged or otherwise collateralized to obtain financing. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
Although ARI has typically invested in developed real estate, it may also invest in new construction or development either directly or in partnership with unaffiliated parties or affiliates (subject to approval by the
Index to Financial Statements
Board of Directors). To the extent that it invests in construction and development projects, such as the apartments described below, ARI is subject to business risks, which include cost overruns and construction delays, associated with higher risk projects.
At December 31, 2005, ARI had the following properties under construction.
In 2005, ARI completed the 70 unit Blue Lake Villas II in Waxahachie, Texas, the 272 unit Bluffs at Vista Ridge in Lewisville, Texas, the 232 unit Bridges on Kinsey in Tyler, Texas, the 208 unit Dakota Arms in Lubbock, Texas, the 240 unit Lake Forest in Houston, Texas, the 220 unit Wildflower Villas in Temple, Texas, the 398 unit Kingsland Ranch Apartments in Houston, Texas, the 240 unit Stonebridge at City Park Apartments in Houston, Texas, and the 240 unit Vistas of Vance Jackson in San Antonio, Texas.
In the opinion of management, the properties owned by ARI are adequately covered by insurance.
The Company’s three office buildings in downtown New Orleans suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Management is presently working with the Company’s insurance carriers to finalize all related claims. Most of the necessary repairs to the Amoco and 1010 Common Buildings have either been made or scheduled. At year-end, the Company had received approximately $8.7 million from its insurance carriers principally as partial reimbursement for Katrina-related lost rents. At the same time, the Company had spent $1.7 million to stabilize and initiate repairs to the buildings. At December 31, 2005, the Amoco Building and the 1010 Common Building were open for business on a limited-access basis. The 225 Baronne Building, however, is closed until the assessment of damages can be fully completed. We believe our insurance coverage is adequate to fully cover the cost of repairs and lost rents, less our normal property and wind deductibles.
Two of our apartment communities (Island Bay and Marina Landing) in Galveston, Texas and one property (Harper’s Ferry) in Lafayette, Louisiana suffered damage from Hurricane Rita. Most of the repairs have either been completed or scheduled. Our insurance policies will cover the costs of the required repairs, excluding normal property and wind deductibles.
The following table sets forth the percentages, by property type and geographic region, of owned real estate (excluding 92 parcels of improved and unimproved land, a hotel in Wroclaw, Poland, and a single-family residence, described below) at December 31, 2005.
The foregoing table is based solely on the number of apartment units, amount of commercial square footage, and number of hotel rooms owned, and does not reflect the value of ARI’s investment in each region. See
Index to Financial Statements

Index to Financial Statements
Index to Financial Statements Partnership Properties. ARI accounts for partnership properties using the equity method. ARI had no property information for properties owned by partnerships.
In December 2004, ARI sold to an unrelated investment group a 95% partnership interest in Garden Centura, L.P. that owns the 410,901 sq. ft. Centura Tower office building located in Farmers Branch, Texas. ARI retained a non-controlling 1% general partner and 4% limited partner interest in Garden Centura, L.P. ARI accounts for its investment in this partnership on the equity method.
Mortgage Loans
In addition to real estate, a portion of ARI’s assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, secured by income-producing real estate, unimproved land and partnership interests. Management expects the percentage of ARI’s assets invested in mortgage loans will decline, as ARI will no longer seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, ARI may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or it may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes currently in the portfolio. Mortgage notes receivable consist primarily of first mortgage loans.
Types of Properties Subject to Mortgages. The types of properties securing mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2005, consisted of four commercial buildings, unimproved land and partnership interests. The type of properties subject to mortgages in which ARI invests may be altered without a vote of stockholders.
Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2005, the obligors on $44.5 million or 54.0% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio were affiliates of ARI. Also at that date, $11.5 million or 14.0% of the mortgage notes receivable portfolio was non-performing.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the outstanding mortgage loan balance at December 31, 2005), by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as collateral for ARI’s mortgage notes receivable. Excluded are $61.8 million of mortgage notes that are secured by unimproved land and other security, or are unsecured. See SCHEDULE IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. “CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for additional details of ARI’s mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in the mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 2005 is as follows:
First Mortgage Loans. These loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan at or prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments, moderate or negative amortization of principal, or all interest and a “balloon” principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, it is ARI’s general policy to require that the borrower provide a title policy or an acceptable legal opinion of title as to the validity and the priority of ARI’s mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders. ARI may grant participations in first mortgage loans that it originates to other lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes first mortgage loans funded in 2005, as well as events during 2005 that affected previously funded mortgage loans.

In October 2004, ARI sold the In The Pines apartments to a third party and provided $1.0 million of the purchase price as seller financing in the form of two notes. The first note bore interest at 7.0% per annum, required monthly interest only payments, and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note
Index to Financial Statements
an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance. In the event of a default, the note is also secured by membership rights in the purchaser’s entity. The second note was unsecured, bore interest at 8.5% per annum, required monthly interest only payments, and matured in January 2005. The Purchaser extended this note to March 2005 by paying 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance as an extension fee and then extended the note an additional 30 days to April 2005 by paying an extension fee of 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance. Both loans were extended to October 2005 with the payment to ARI of a 2.0% extension fee. Both loans were paid in full, including unpaid interest, in October 2005.
In March 2005, ARI entered into an agreement to advance a third party $3.2 million for development costs relating to single family residential lots in Austin, Texas. These advances are secured by membership interests in the borrower and a second lien on 1,092 acres of undeveloped land. The secured note bears interest at 10%, requires semi-annual interest payments, and matures in March 2008. In September 2005, the total amount authorized under this advance was increased to $5.0 million. As of March 31, 2006, ARI had advanced $4.0 million to the borrower. ARI also guaranteed, with full recourse to ARI, an $18 million bank loan for the borrower which is secured by a first lien on the 1,092 acres of undeveloped land. In June 2005, ARI purchased the subsidiary of a related party for $4.1 million that holds two notes receivable from this third party totaling $3.0 and $1.0 million, respectively. These notes are secured by approximately 142 acres of undeveloped land and membership interests in the borrowers. The secured notes bear interest at 12.0%, have an interest reserve for payments that is added to the principal balance on a monthly basis, and matured in June 2005. Both loans were extended to September 2005 and upon maturity, both loan balances were paid under the advance referred to at the beginning of this paragraph.
In July 2003, ARI advanced $2.3 million to the Class A Limited Partners of TCI Countryside, L.P. of which ARI is the general partner. This loan bears interest at 7.25% and matures in January 2007. ARI also agreed to advance $1.1 million to the Class A Limited Partners by advancing $105,000 in July 2003 and every year thereafter for ten years. This loan bears interest at 7.25% and matures in July 2012. Interest due to ARI will be deducted from the quarterly return owed by ARI to the Class A Limited Partners, eliminating the quarterly payments. In October 2005, ARI agreed to settle the remaining obligations under this loan by paying a lump sum of $425,000, making the total advanced $740,000. After January 2007, ARI may redeem the Class A Limited Partners interests in exchange for cancellation of both notes.
In September 2005, ARI sold 10 acres of unimproved land to a third party for $1.5 million and provided $1.1 million of the purchase price as seller financing. The secured note bore interest at 10%, required monthly interest only payments, and matured in September 2008. In December 2005, ARI sold this note to a financial institution for full face value less closing costs, plus accrued interest. ARI and other related parties have also guaranteed the full payment of the note balances, including any outstanding interest and costs incurred by the financial institution.
In December 2005, ARI sold 27.192 acres and 3.73 acres to a third party for $10.1 million and $1.4 million, and provided $7.6 million and $1.0 million of seller financing, respectively. Both notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, require monthly interest only payments, and mature in December 2008. In January 2006, ARI sold both notes to a financial institution for full face value less closing costs, plus accrued interest. The financial institution has a Put Option that would require ARI to purchase both notes back under the following conditions: (1) failure to construct agreed upon roads on the property by December 2006; (2) there occurs any event of default by the buyer; (3) certain escrow deposits for the road completion are not sufficient to cover the cost of the road construction; (4) any amendment, modification or assignment of certain development and escrow agreements between ARI and the buyer; and (5) failure of ARI to deliver certain documents to the financial institution within a timely manner. ARI and other related parties have also guaranteed the full payment of the note balances, including any outstanding interest and costs incurred by the financial institution.
In December 2004, ARI sold the Centura Tower office building to a partnership and retained a 1% non-controlling general partner interest and a 4% limited partner interest. ARI has certain obligations to fund the
Index to Financial Statements
partnership for rent abatements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other cash shortfalls. $4.1 million of these obligations were escrowed by ARI with the lender at loan closing. Through December 31, 2005, ARI has funded $4.7 million of these obligations, with $4.1 million recorded as an investment in the partnership and the remainder of $603,000 in the form of a note receivable from the partnership. This note has no maturity date, requires no payments, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum. The note will be paid out of excess cash flow or from sales proceeds, but only after certain partner preferred returns are paid.
In August 2001, ARI agreed to fund up to $5.6 million secured by a second lien on an office building in Dallas, Texas. The note receivable bore interest at a variable rate (then 9.0% per annum), required monthly interest only payments and originally matured in January 2003. As of March 2004, ARI had funded a total of $4.3 million. On January 22, 2003, ARI agreed to extend the maturity date until May 1, 2003. The collateral used to secure ARI’s second lien was seized by the first lien holder. On March 11, 2004, ARI agreed to accept an assignment of claims in litigation as additional security for the note. In December 2004, ARI agreed to a Modification Agreement with the borrower, which was effective November 1, 2003. As of the modified effective date, accrued interest of $582,000 was added to the principal balance of the note, the interest rate fixed at 9.0% per annum and all principal and interest is due November 2005. ARI also received Pledge and Security Agreements in various partnership interests belonging to the borrower and received various Assignments of Proceeds from sales in certain entities owned by the borrower. ARI reduced accrued interest and principal by $1.5 million from the receipt of notes receivable assigned to ARI by borrower and by $605,000 from cash received. ARI also received $1.4 million in January 2005 that was applied to accrued interest and principal effective December 30, 2004. As a result of the modification, ARI recognized a reduction of $1.4 million for loan loss expense in 2004. In December 2005, ARI advanced $2.5 million under this note to the borrower.
In March 2002, ARI sold the 174,513 Sq. Ft. Hartford Office Building in Dallas, Texas, for $4.0 million, providing $4.0 million in seller financing as well as an additional $1.4 million line of credit for leasehold improvements all in the form of a first lien mortgage note. The note bears interest at a variable interest rate, currently 8.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments and matures in March 2007. As of March 2006, ARI has funded $896,000 of the $1.4 million line of credit. ARI determined during the third quarter of 2005 that it would classify this note as non-performing due to the lack of debt payments received and the probability that no debt payments would be received in the future. Effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, ARI no longer accrues interest on this note. The loan is not considered impaired due to management’s opinion that the fair value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the current loan balance and accrued interest at March 2006.
In July 2002, ARI entered into an agreement to fund up to $300,000 under a revolving line of credit secured by 100% interest in a partnership of the borrower. The line of credit bears interest at 12.0% per annum, requires monthly interest only payments, and matured in June 2005. This loan was extended to June 2006 in the second quarter of 2005 and was subsequently modified in the fourth quarter of 2005. This second modification extends the loan maturity to October 2007 and limits any advances under the line of credit to $25,000 per month. As of March 2006, the borrower had $211,000 of available credit under the credit limit.
In September 1999, in conjunction with the sale of two apartments in Austin, Texas, $2.1 million in purchase money financing was provided, secured by limited partnership interests in two limited partnerships owned by the buyer. In March 2000, the borrower made a $1.1 million payment. The borrower executed a replacement promissory note for the remaining note balance of $1.0 million, which was unsecured, non-interest bearing and matured in April 2003. In 2004, ARI initiated legal action to collect the note. In August 2005, a settlement agreement was reached. The note will be replaced with a new promissory note, also non-interest bearing, which is secured by a $1.5 million Agreed Judgment. The note calls for 36 monthly payments beginning in January 2006, with a balloon payment of $460,000 due in January 2009. ARI will continue to classify this note as non-performing even though payments have been received in 2006.
In February 2003, ARI sold an 89.3 acre tract of its Katrina land parcel for $8.5 million, paying $410,000 after payment of closing costs and debt pay down and providing purchase money financing of $5.6 million. The
Index to Financial Statements
note bears interest at 8.0% per annum and matures three years after the recording of the Deed of Trust. Interest was to begin accruing after improvements to the site were completed by ARI. The costs to ARI to complete the improvements, estimated to be $2.5 million, were accrued in 2002. By 2005, a portion of the improvements had been completed and the remaining accrual at December 31, 2005 is $1.2 million. At March 2006, negotiations with the buyer to settle the obligations are underway. The remaining improvements are not expected to be completed before the settlement. The note is classified as non-performing at December 31, 2005.
In November 2003, ARI purchased a note receivable from an unrelated party for $1.4 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. The note was secured by a first lien Deed of Trust on 13.0 acres of undeveloped land in Harris County, bore interest at the default rate of 18.0%, and matured in May 2003. In May 2005, ARI obtained title to the property via a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure. See NOTE 2. “REAL ESTATE.”
In December 2002, ARI sold a 238.0 acre tract of its Desert Wells land parcel for $23.8 million, receiving $321,000 after payment of closing costs and debt paydown and providing purchase money financing of $21.4 million. The first lien financing of $17.8 million bore interest at 8.0% per annum, matured in December 2004 and required payments beginning in March 2003. In March 2003, the note was sold to an unrelated party for $17.1 million plus accrued and unpaid interest. The buyer of the note has limited recourse against a 53 acre parcel of ARI’s Katrina land, in event of default by the borrower. ARI recognized a previously deferred gain of $15.0 million upon completion of the sale of the note. The second lien financing of $3.6 million bore interest at 8.0% per annum and matured on March 31, 2003. All principal and interest were due at maturity. In February 2005, the note was exchanged for 23.0 acres of land in Palm Desert, California. See NOTE 2. “REAL ESTATE.”
Related Parties. In March 2001, ARI funded $13.6 million of a $15.0 million unsecured line of credit to One Realco. At that time, a wholly-owned subsidiary of One Realco owned approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of ARI’s common stock. The line of credit bore interest at 12.0% per annum. All principal and interest were due at maturity in February 2002. The line of credit was guaranteed by BCM. In June 2001, $810,000 in principal and interest was collected. In December 2001, $825,000 in principal and interest was collected. In February 2002, the line of credit was increased to $18.0 million, accrued but unpaid interest of $217,000 was added to the principal, and the maturity date was extended to February 2004. In March 2002, ARI funded an additional $1.8 million, increasing the outstanding principal balance to $15.5 million.

Investments in Real Estate Companies `
Real estate entities. ARI’s investment in real estate entities includes, through its ownership of 82.2% of the common stock of TCI, the equity securities of a publicly traded real estate company, IORI, and interests in real estate joint venture partnerships.
The Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million to acquire, in open market purchases, shares of IORI, excluding private purchase transactions which were separately authorized. Through December 31, 2005, ARI had expended an aggregate of $10.0 million to acquire shares of IORI, in open market purchases, in accordance with these authorizations. As of December 31, 2005, ARI and its subsidiaries, other than TCI, owned no shares of common stock of IORI, but TCI continued to own 345,728 IORI shares (approximately 24.9% of the outstanding IORI shares). ARI may make additional investments in the equity securities of IORI to the extent its liquidity permits.
The following summary description of IORI is based on information publicly reported by IORI in its Form 10-K Annual Report to the Commission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
Pertinent information regarding ARI’s investment in the equity securities of the IORI at December 31, 2005, is summarized below (dollars in thousands):
IORI owns real estate, some of which has been held for many years. Because of depreciation, IORI may earn substantial amounts in periods in which it sells real estate and may incur losses in periods in which it does not. ARI’s reported income or loss attributable to IORI may differ materially from ARI’s share of IORI’s cash flow.
ARI owns an approximate 20.4% interest (through TCI’s ownership of IORI shares) in IORI, a publicly held real estate investment company. At December 31, 2005, IORI had total assets of $99.1 million and owned six apartments, one office building, one shopping center, one industrial warehouse, and one parcel of unimproved land, all within the State of Texas. IORI did not sell any properties during 2005. Since IORI recognized no gains on the sale of property during 2005, ARI had no equity share on property sales. In 2004, IORI sold two office buildings, two office buildings and a parcel of unimproved land for a total of $24.5 million, receiving net cash of $4.8 million after paying off $15.8 million in mortgage debt and the payment of various closing costs. IORI recognized gains of $5.5 million on the sales of which ARI’s equity share was $1.3 million. Based on the ownership percentage of ARI’s investment in IORI and IORI’s market value, ARI’s investment in IORI has a market value of approximately $6.5 million at December 31, 2005. The carrying value of this investment is approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2005.
ARI received no dividends from IORI in 2005.
