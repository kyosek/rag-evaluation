ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2010, we had 167 properties containing approximately 13.7 million rentable square feet of life science laboratory space. Our operating properties were approximately 94.3% leased as of December 31, 2010. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science industry tenants. These improvements typically are generic to life science industry tenants rather than being specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of life science industry tenants. Generic infrastructure improvements to our life science properties typically include:
· reinforced concrete floors;
· upgraded roof loading capacity;
· increased floor to ceiling heights;
· heavy-duty HVAC systems;
· enhanced environmental control technology;
· significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
· laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2010, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, except for 21 properties that accounted for approximately 18% of the total rentable square footage of our properties. Of the 21 properties, we held four properties in the San Francisco Bay market, 13 properties in the Greater Boston market, one property in the New York City submarket, one property in the Southeast market, and two properties in the Suburban Washington, D.C. market pursuant to ground leasehold interests. See further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
In addition, as of December 31, 2010, our asset base contained approximately 1.2 million developable square feet in Canada and New York City which we held pursuant to ground leasehold interests and two land parcels aggregating approximately 547,000 rentable square feet in China which we held pursuant to land usage rights.
As of December 31, 2010, we had 453 leases with a total of 373 tenants, and 73 of our 167 properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant building leases typically have initial terms of ten to 20 years. As of December 31, 2010:
· approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;
· approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and
· approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing), which we believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the properties are reusable generic life science laboratory improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.
Location of properties
The locations of our properties are diversified among a number of life science cluster submarkets. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2010, the total rentable square footage, annualized base rent, and encumbrances of our properties in each of our existing markets (dollars in thousands):
(1) Annualized base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2010 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP). Represents annualized base rent related to our operating rentable square feet.
(2) Certain properties are pledged as security under our secured notes payable as of December 31, 2010. See Schedule III - Consolidated Financial Statement Schedule of Rental Properties and Accumulated Depreciation of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for additional information on our properties, including encumbered properties.

Value-added projects
A key component of our business model includes our value-added redevelopment and development programs. These programs are focused on providing high-quality, generic and reusable life science laboratory space to meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of clients in the life science industry. Upon completion, each value-added project is expected to generate significant revenues and cash flows. Our redevelopment and development projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to life science entities which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, and higher rental income and returns. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into generic life science laboratory space, including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy space or visa versa. Development projects consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable life science laboratory facilities. We anticipate execution of new active development projects for aboveground vertical construction of new laboratory space generally only with significant pre-leasing. Preconstruction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities prior to commencement of vertical construction of aboveground shell and core improvements. Our objective also includes the advancement of preconstruction efforts to reduce the time to deliver projects to prospective tenants. Projects in Asia represent primarily development opportunities and projects in China and India focused on life science laboratory space for our current client tenants and other life science relationship entities. Our redevelopment, development, preconstruction, and certain real estate in Asia are classified as construction in progress. We are required to capitalize interest and other direct project costs during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. Capitalization of interest and other direct project costs cease after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Additionally, should activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use cease, interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to these assets would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease and the asset is ready for its intended use, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net or land held for future development.
Land held for future development includes certain land parcels with improvements to the land, including, grading, piles, foundations, and other land improvements. Our objective is to advance efforts to reduce the time to deliver projects to prospective tenants. Since all efforts have been advanced to appropriate stages and no further preconstruction activities are ongoing, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other direct costs related to these assets are expensed as incurred. Future redevelopment projects represent properties containing non-laboratory uses (office, industrial, or warehouse) that will in the future undergo conversion to life science laboratory space through redevelopment.
A key strategy for our value-added projects includes generation of significant cash flows through the ground-up development or redevelopment of life science properties and the lease or sale of land parcels.
The following table summarizes the components of our total value-added square footage as of December 31, 2010:
(1)
The two largest projects included in preconstruction consisted of our 1.9 million developable square feet at Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square in East Cambridge, Massachusetts and our 410,000 developable square foot site for our second tower at Alexandria Center™ for Life Science - New York City.
(2)
Represents 827,000 and 2.4 million developable square feet in Canada and India, respectively.
(3)
Amounts exclude 3.1 million developable square feet related to a parcel supporting the future ground-up development of approximately 442,000 rentable square feet in New York City related to an option under our ground lease, land parcels supporting ground-up development of 636,000 rentable square feet in Edinburgh, Scotland that we have a long-term right to purchase, and an option to increase our land use rights by up to approximately 2.0 million additional developable square feet in China.
Redevelopment
A key component of our business model is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or shell space, or newly acquired properties into generic life science laboratory space, including the conversion of single-tenancy space to multi-tenancy space or multi-tenancy space to single-tenancy space, that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target life science cluster markets. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 755,463 rentable square feet undergoing redevelopment at 12 projects. In addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2010, our asset base contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to life science laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.5 million rentable square feet.
The following table summarizes total rentable square footage undergoing redevelopment as of December 31, 2010:
(1)
The operating portion of the properties aggregating 896,982 rentable square feet, including vacancy aggregating approximately 31,000 rentable square feet, is included in rental properties, net and occupancy statistics for our operating properties.
(2)
The leased percentages represent the percentages of redevelopment rentable square feet and exclude both the occupied and vacant rentable square feet related to the operating portion of each building.
(3)
Represents redevelopment projects with projected total investment greater than the average total investment for our redevelopment project. The higher total investment is primarily due to the contiguousness of a project to Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square (part of the assemblage) as well as another mid-rise building and its structure.
(4)
Represents historical office building acquired with parcel included in overall Alexandria Center™ at Kendall Square. Remaining rentable square feet undergoing conversion from office space to laboratory space.
(5)
Represents a former single tenant building undergoing redevelopment. Although the building may accommodate multi-tenancy, we are projecting single tenancy for this project.
As of December 31, 2010, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $145 per rentable square foot, or $110 million in aggregate, for the 755,463 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to life science laboratory space through redevelopment. Our final costs for these projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction and infrastructure requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations, and the amount of costs funded by each tenant.
Development
Another key component of our business model is ground-up development. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns. Our ground-up development projects focus on investment in generic and reusable infrastructure, rather than tenant specific improvements. As of December 31, 2010, we had five parcels of land undergoing ground-up development in the United States approximating 475,818 rentable square feet of life science laboratory space as summarized in the table below.
As of December 31, 2010, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $146 per rentable square foot, or $70 million in aggregate for the 475,818 rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development. Our final costs for these projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction and infrastructure requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations, and the amount of costs funded by each tenant. Future ground-up development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high-quality and/or creditworthy entities.
Our business model also includes ground-up development projects outside of the United States. We have the ability to develop up to 636,000 rentable square feet in Edinburgh, Scotland. We have a right to purchase the land for this development over the next 13 years. We have a development site in Toronto, Canada for the ground-up development of a multi-story building aggregating 763,000 rentable square feet. This parcel is subject to a 99-year ground lease. We also have development parcels in Asia. One development parcel is located in South China where a two-building project aggregating 275,000 rentable square feet is under construction. The second development parcel is located in North China where a two-building project aggregating 272,000 rentable square feet is under construction. Additionally, we have approximately 426,000 rentable square feet undergoing construction in India. We estimate that construction costs in 2011 related to properties located outside of the United States in 2011 will range between $55 million to $65 million. Our final costs for these projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations, and the amount of costs funded by each tenant.
