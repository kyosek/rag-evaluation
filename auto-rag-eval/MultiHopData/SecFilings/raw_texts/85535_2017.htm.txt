ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, except for our interest in the Peak Gold JV, and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage streams and royalties, as well their respective reserves, are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The Company manages its business under two reportable segments, consisting of the acquisition and management of stream interests and the acquisition and management of royalty interests. The description of our principal streams and royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, stream or royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our stream and royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing and development stage properties.
Principal Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which stream and royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such stream and royalty interests are
			
		
			
		
no longer principal to our business. Currently, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically by stream and royalty interest) to be principal to our business.
Stream Interests
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 100% of the gold produced from the Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered, 50% thereafter. The cash purchase price equals 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 90,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
Andacollo is an open-pit mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (“CMCA”), a 90% owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”). The Andacollo mine is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo mine by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Stream deliveries from Andacollo were approximately 47,900 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, compared to approximately 41,700 ounces for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Teck has indicated that they expect
			
		
			
		
grades to continue to gradually decline in calendar 2017 and future years, which will be largely offset by planned throughput improvements in the mill. Teck expects production in calendar 2017 to be similar to calendar 2016.
Mount Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
As discussed in further detail in Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2017 Business Developments, RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 35% of the payable gold and 18.75% of the payable copper produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by an indirect subsidiary of Centerra. The cash purchase price for gold is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price when purchased. The cash purchase price for copper is 15% of the spot price.
The Mount Milligan project is an open-pit mine and is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mount Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Gold stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 96,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, compared to approximately 111,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the gold stream rate from 52.25% to 35%, which change is further discussed in Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2017 Business Developments.
Copper stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 1,165 tonnes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Copper stream deliveries began during our June 2017 quarter.
The secondary crusher is now fully operational and a part of the comminution circuit. Centerra continues to evaluate the mine and mill to increase recovery and improve throughput. They also undertook an operational review process with subject matter experts within their organization who identified several value adding projects. When these value added projects are implemented, Centerra expects to improve recoveries, throughput and unit cost performance by the end of calendar 2017.
Pueblo Viejo (Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 7.5% of Barrick’s interest in the gold produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% thereafter. The cash purchase price for gold is 30% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered thereafter. RGLD Gold also owns the right to purchase 75% of Barrick’s interest in the silver produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine, subject to a minimum silver recovery of 70%, until 50 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.5% thereafter. The cash purchase price for silver is 30% of the spot price of silver per ounce delivered until 23.1 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price of silver per ounce delivered thereafter.
The Pueblo Viejo mine is located in the province of Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic, approximately 60 miles northwest of Santo Domingo, and is owned by a joint venture in which Barrick holds a 60% interest and is responsible for operations, and in which Goldcorp holds a 40% interest. Pueblo Viejo is accessed from Santo Domingo by traveling northwest on Autopista Duarte, Highway #1, approximately 48 miles to Piedra Blanca and proceeding east for approximately 14 miles on Highway #17 to the gatehouse for Pueblo Viejo. Both Highway #1 and Highway #17 are paved.
Gold stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 52,600 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, compared to approximately 42,200 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, Barrick reported higher throughput due to fewer planned autoclave shutdowns for maintenance compared to the prior calendar year. Barrick further reported recovery rates have improved due to a change in ore type with a reduction of organic carbon content when compared to the prior calendar year.
			
		
			
		
Silver stream deliveries were approximately 1.8 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, compared to approximately 532,600 ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Silver stream deliveries to RGLD Gold began during the March 31, 2016, quarter.
Barrick reiterated their Pueblo Viejo production guidance for calendar 2017 of between 625,000 ounces and 650,000 ounces of gold. Barrick does not provide silver guidance.
Wassa and Prestea (Western Region, Ghana)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 9.25% of the gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea projects, operated by Golden Star, until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2017 or (ii) the date at which the Wassa and Prestea underground projects achieve commercial production. At that point, the stream percentage will increase to 10.5% of gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea mines until an aggregate 240,000 ounces have been delivered. Once the applicable delivery threshold is met, the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5% for the remaining term of the transaction.
The Wassa open pit mine and oxide ore mill are located near the village of Akyempim in the Wassa East District, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 50 miles north of Cape Coast and 93 miles west of the capital Accra. The main access to the site is from the east, via the Cape Coast to Twifo-Praso road, then over the combined road-rail bridge on the Pra River. There is also an access road from Takoradi in the south via Mpohor. An airport at Takoradi is capable of handling jet aircraft and is serviced by several commercial flights each day.
Prestea is currently an open pit operation producing oxide ore located in the Ashanti gold district in the central eastern section of the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 6 miles south of the town of Bogoso. Access to the property is by commercial air carrier to Accra and then by vehicle on a paved and gravel road.
Stream deliveries from Wassa and Prestea were approximately 19,900 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, compared to approximately 21,400 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
On January 6, 2017, Golden Star announced commercial production at Wassa underground was achieved effective as of January 1, 2017 and that gold production from the Wassa underground operation is anticipated to continue ramping up during calendar 2017. Golden Star further reported on August 2, 2017, the Prestea underground project, currently in development, is expected to achieve commercial production in the December 2017 quarter. Prestea underground project is expected to produce between 25,000 and 30,000 ounces during calendar 2017.
Royalty Interests
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a series of large open-pit and underground mines, utilizing mill and heap leach processing, which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits, part of the Gap pit and the Crossroads deposit.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)
Reserve Claims (“GSR1”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the “Reserve Claims,” which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR1 royalty rate is tied to the price of gold and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR1 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(b)
GAS Claims (“GSR2”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the “GAS Claims,” which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR2 royalty rate is tied to the gold price, without
			
		
			
		
indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR2 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(c)
Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty (“GSR3”). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)
Net Value Royalty (“NVR1”). This is a fixed NVR on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit. Refer to Item 1, Business, Fiscal 2017 Business Developments, for further detail on the recent acquisition of additional interests in the NVR1. With this acquisition, Royal Gold’s interests at Cortez Crossroads now comprise a 4.52% NVR and a 5% sliding-scale GSR royalty at current gold prices. Royal Gold’s interests on production from the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits as well as portions of the Gap deposit now comprise a 4.91% NVR and a 5.71% GSR royalty at current gold prices.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
Production attributable to our royalty interest at Cortez decreased approximately 13% during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, which was in-line with the mine plan. Waste stripping at Crossroads, which is subject to our NVR1 royalty interest, restarted in October 2016 and is currently ongoing. Production from Crossroads is expected to begin in calendar 2018.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”). The Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Gold, silver, lead and zinc production attributable to our royalty interest at Peñasquito decreased approximately 5%, 3%, 7% and 5%, respectively, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
Goldcorp expects mine grade to decline in the second half of calendar 2017, consistent with their earlier expectations. Starting late in the December 2017 quarter and through calendar 2018, Goldcorp expects to feed the mill a higher proportion of lower grade ore and stockpiled material. The feed will then revert back to higher grade ore in calendar 2019 when the Phase 6 stripping program exposes higher grade ore in the Peñasco pit.
Goldcorp announced the Pyrite Leach Project achieved construction progress of 14% and engineering progress of 94% at the end of the June 2017 quarter. Major procurement activities are nearing completion, material and equipment is arriving on-site and major works contractors have mobilized to site. Earthworks activities are complete, concrete works are underway, and mechanical installation work commenced and is ramping-up.
Goldcorp also announced the Carbon Pre-flotation Project ("CPP") is being constructed, which will allow Peñasquito to process ore which was previously considered uneconomic, including significant amounts already in stockpiles. CPP earthworks are substantially complete and the concrete works are underway. The mechanical works contractor is mobilizing and will ramp up during the September 2017 quarter. Goldcorp stated the project remains on budget and on schedule.
			
		
			
		
Principal Development Stage Properties
The following is a description of our principal development stage properties (listed in alphabetical order). Reserves for our development stage properties are summarized below in Table 1 as part of this Item 2, Properties.
Pascua-Lama Project (Region III, Chile)
We own a 0.78% to 5.45% sliding-scale NSR royalty on the Pascua-Lama project, which straddles the border between Argentina and Chile, and is being developed by Barrick. The Company owns an additional royalty equivalent to 1.09% of proceeds from copper produced from the Chilean portion of the project, net of allowable deductions, sold on or after January 1, 2017. The Pascua-Lama project is located within 7 miles of Barrick’s operating Veladero mine. Access to the project is from the city of Vallenar, Region III, Chile, via secondary roads C-485 to Alto del Carmen, Chile, and C-489 from Alto del Carmen to El Corral, Chile.
Our royalty interests are applicable to all gold and copper production from the portion of the Pascua-Lama project lying on the Chilean side of the border. In addition, our interest at Pascua-Lama contains certain contingent rights and obligations. Specifically, (i) if gold prices exceed $600 per ounce for any six month period during the first 36 months of commercial production from the project, the Company would make a one-time payment of $8.4 million; (ii) approximately 20% of the royalty is limited to 14.0 million ounces of gold produced from the project, while 24% of the royalty can be extended beyond 14.0 million ounces of gold produced for a one-time payment of $4.4 million; and (iii) we can also increase our interest in two one-time payments from $0.5 million to $1.5 million, which are payable by Barrick upon the achievement of certain production thresholds at Pascua-Lama.
The sliding-scale NSR royalty is based upon the gold price as shown in the following table:
Note: Royalty rate is interpolated between the upper and lower endpoints.
Pascua-Lama is one of the world’s largest gold deposits with approximately 11.7 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves subject our royalty interest, approximately 420.7 million pounds of copper contained within the gold reserves, and an expected mine life of 25 years. Barrick expects Pascua-Lama to produce an average of 800,000 to 850,000 ounces of gold during its first full five years of operation, which is based on the current open-pit mining plan.
In calendar 2017, Barrick anticipates expenditures of approximately $175 to $195 million for the project, primarily related to prefeasibility studies, water management and monitoring activities as part of the project's temporary suspension plan. A decision to restart development of the project will depend on improved economics and more certainty regarding legal and permitting matters.
Barrick completed evaluation work in calendar 2016, which indicated that a modest, scalable starter project at Lama-the Argentinian portion of the Pascua-Lama project-using underground mining methods may represent the best option to begin a phased development plan for Pascua-Lama. If successful, cash flow from Lama could be used to fund additional development on both sides of the border over time. Barrick stated they initiated a prefeasibility study to evaluate the construction of an underground mine at Lama, on the Argentinean side of the Pascua-Lama project. Optimization work in Chile remains underway.
			
		
			
		
On April 6, 2017, Barrick announced a strategic cooperation agreement with Shandong Gold Mining Co., Ltd (“Shandong Gold”). As a next step, Barrick and Shandong Gold will jointly explore the potential development of Pascua-Lama, and will evaluate additional investment opportunities.
Rainy River (Ontario, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 6.50% of the gold produced from the Rainy River project until 230,000 gold ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% thereafter; and 60% of the silver produced from the Rainy River project until 3.1 million silver ounces have been delivered, and 30% thereafter. The cash purchase price for the gold and silver ounces is 25% of the spot price per ounce of gold or silver at the time of delivery.
The Rainy River project is centered within Richardson Township in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and is being developed by New Gold Inc. (“New Gold”). The project is approximately 40 miles northwest of Fort Frances, approximately 100 miles south of Kenora and approximately 260 miles west of Thunder Bay. The project site is easily accessible by a network of secondary all-weather roads that branch off the well-maintained Trans-Canada Highways 11 and 71.
New Gold reported development activities at the Rainy River project continue to advance and the project is scheduled to transition from construction to operation during the September 2017 quarter. The mining rate during the June 2017 quarter averaged approximately 115,000 tonnes per day, in-line with New Gold’s updated plan announced on January 30, 2017, with the mining rate averaging approximately 125,000 tonnes per day in the month of June 2017. Commissioning of the primary crusher and conveyor system is complete, with the first crush completed on May 11, 2017, as planned. The tailings management area corridor pipeline was completed on June 15, 2017, with the first water moved to and from the water management pond on June 20, 2017. Installation of the mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation in processing facilities is approximately 97% complete. Commissioning of the ball mill and SAG mill has started and is scheduled to be completed in August 2017. Commissioning of the refining portion of the process circuit has commenced with dry and wet commissioning of the full circuit also scheduled for August 2017. All key site overhead power lines, construction of the tailings pipeline corridor and have been completed. Overall earthworks are over 85% complete and are tracking in-line with New Gold’s updated plan.
New Gold continues to work towards obtaining an amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations under the Fisheries Act (a Canadian federal statute), which is required to close two small creeks and deposit tailings. Such amendment is now expected to be received in the fourth calendar quarter of 2017. New Gold presently is constructing a starter tailings cell, located within the broader tailings management area that does not require a Schedule 2 amendment. This will allow New Gold to commence operations prior to completion of the Schedule 2 amendment. Based on its location and scale, the starter cell would provide capacity for approximately six months of tailings. In addition, New Gold has finalized the engineering design to construct the creek closures using sheet pile at the center of the portion of the dam which will cover the creeks. The purpose of this approach is both to reduce the construction time after receipt of the Schedule 2 amendment, and most importantly, to be able to complete the work regardless of weather conditions. New Gold has met with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (“MNRF”) to review the design and has also filed its application for the required permit amendment in support of the design. It is expected that the Ontario MNRF will complete its review of the application during the third quarter of calendar 2017.

3.
Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Reserve” is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. “Proven (Measured) Reserves” are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established. “Probable (Indicated) Reserves” are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
4.
Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
5.
The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly-available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Royal Gold did not prepare reserve or feasibility studies and does not have the ability to independently confirm any reserve information presented. Accordingly,
			
		
			
		
Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
