Types of Real Estate Investments.

In selecting real estate for investment, the location, age and type of property, gross rents, lease terms, financial and business standing of tenants, operating expenses, fixed charges, land values and physical condition are among the factors considered. TCI may acquire properties subject to or assume existing debt and may mortgage, pledge or otherwise obtain financing for its properties. The Board of Directors may alter the types of and criteria for selecting new real estate investments and for obtaining financing without a vote of stockholders.
TCI typically invests in developed real estate. However, TCI has recently invested in apartment development and construction. To the extent that TCI continues to invest in development and construction projects, it will be subject to business risks, such as cost overruns and construction delays, associated with such higher risk projects.

TCI received a distribution of $1.5 million of the net cash. Tri-City recognized a gain of $2.3 million on the sale of which TCI's equity share was $1.4 million. In 1999, TCI received $272,000 in operating distributions from the partnership. See ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS-- Related Party Transactions."
Mortgage Loans
In addition to investments in real estate, a portion of TCI's assets are invested in mortgage notes receivable, principally secured by real estate. Management expects that the percentage of TCI's assets invested in mortgage loans will decline, as it has determined that in 2000 TCI will not seek to fund or acquire new mortgage loans. However, it may originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of property sales. Management intends to service and hold for investment the mortgage notes in TCI's portfolio. TCI's mortgage notes receivable consist of first, wraparound and junior mortgage loans.
Types of Mortgage Activity. TCI has originated its own mortgage loans, as well as acquired existing mortgage notes either directly from builders, developers or property owners, or through mortgage banking firms, commercial banks or other qualified brokers. BCM, in its capacity as a mortgage servicer, services TCI's mortgage notes. TCI's investment policy is described in ITEM 1. "BUSINESS--Business Plan and Investment Policy."
Types of Properties Securing Mortgage Notes. The properties securing TCI's mortgage notes receivable portfolio at December 31, 1999, consisted of an apartment, two office buildings, a hotel, a mobile home park, unimproved land and a developed residential lot. The Board of Directors may alter the types of properties securing or collateralizing mortgage loans in which TCI invests without a vote of stockholders. TCI's Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on transactions with related parties, as discussed in ITEM 13. "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS."
At December 31, 1999, TCI's mortgage notes receivable portfolio included seven mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $3.6 million secured by income-producing real estate located in the Midwest and Southwest regions of the continental United States and two loans with an aggregate principal balance of $8.5 million secured by collateral other than income- producing real estate. At December 31, 1999, 2% of TCI's assets were invested in notes and interest receivable.
The following table sets forth the percentages (based on the mortgage note principal balance) by property type and geographic region, of the income producing properties that serve as collateral for TCI's mortgage notes
receivable at December 31, 1999. See Schedule IV to the Consolidated Financial Statements included at ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" for further details of TCI's mortgage notes receivable portfolio.
A summary of the activity in TCI's mortgage notes receivable portfolio during 1999 is as follows:
During 1999, $33,000 was collected in full payment of four mortgage notes and $4,000 in principal payments were received.
At December 31, 1999, 1% of TCI's assets were invested in mortgage notes secured by non-income-producing real estate, comprised of a first mortgage note secured by a residential lot in Greensboro, North Carolina and a first mortgage note secured by 253 acres of unimproved land in McKinney, Texas.
First Mortgage Loans. TCI invests in first mortgage notes, with short, medium or long-term maturities. First mortgage loans generally provide for level periodic payments of principal and interest sufficient to substantially repay the loan prior to maturity, but may involve interest-only payments or moderate amortization of principal and a "balloon" principal payment at maturity. With respect to first mortgage loans, the borrower is required to provide a mortgagee's title policy or an acceptable legal title opinion as to the validity and the priority of the mortgage lien over all other obligations, except liens arising from unpaid property taxes and other exceptions normally allowed by first mortgage lenders in the relevant area. TCI may grant participations in first mortgage loans that it originates to other lenders.
The following discussion briefly describes the first mortgage loans that TCI originated as well as events that affected previously funded first mortgage loans during 1999.
In March 1999, TCI accepted $33,000 as the early discounted payoff of four mortgage notes receivable with a combined principal balance of $55,000 and secured by undeveloped residential lots in Greensboro, North Carolina. No loss was incurred in excess of the reserve previously established.
In June 1999, three mortgage notes receivable with an aggregate principal balance of $196,000 were written off as uncollectible. No loss was incurred in excess of the reserve previously established.
As discussed in "Real Estate" above, in December 1999, TCI provided $1.2 million of purchase money financing in conjunction with the sale of the Town and Country Office Building in Houston, Texas. The note receivable bears interest at 8.5% per annum, requires monthly payments of interest only and matures in December 2000.
Also as discussed in "Real Estate" above, in December 1999, TCI provided $8.5 million of purchase money financing in conjunction with the sale of 253 acres of unimproved land in McKinney and Collin County, Texas. The note receivable bears interest at 8.5% per annum, required a $1.0 million principal paydown in February 2000, which was received, requires payment of accrued interest in June 2000 and a payment of all principal and accrued interest at maturity in September 2000.
Junior Mortgage Loans. TCI may invest in junior mortgage loans, which are secured by mortgages that are subordinate to one or more prior liens either on the fee or a leasehold interest in real estate. Recourse on such loans ordinarily includes the real estate on which the loan is made, other collateral and personal guarantees by the borrower. The Board of Directors restricts investment in junior mortgage loans, excluding wraparound mortgage loans, to not more than 10% of TCI's assets. At December 31, 1999, less than 1% of TCI's assets were invested in junior mortgage loans.
The following discussion briefly describes the events that affected previously funded junior mortgage loans during 1999.
In August 1998, a mortgage note receivable with a principal balance of $2.0 million and a carrying value of $207,000 and secured by a second lien on a shut-down hotel in Lake Charles, Louisiana became delinquent. To protect its interest, TCI purchased the first lien mortgage for $149,000. Foreclosure proceedings were commenced and title to the property was received in February 2000. No loss was incurred on foreclosure, as the estimated fair market value of the property, less estimated costs of sale, exceeds the carrying value of the mortgage notes receivable.
Loans Secured by Collateral Other than Real Estate. In June 1992, TCI received ten notes secured by collateral other than real estate in satisfaction of a $622,000 obligation. In June 1999, the remaining five notes, with a combined principal balance of $374,000, were written off as uncollectible. No loss was incurred in excess of the reserve previously established.
Partnership mortgage loans. TCI owns a 60% general partner interest and IORI owns a 40% general partner interest in Nakash Income Associates ("NIA"), which owns a wraparound mortgage note receivable secured by a building occupied by a Wal-Mart in Maulden, Missouri. TCI received no distributions from NIA in 1999 and advanced $4,000 to the partnership.
