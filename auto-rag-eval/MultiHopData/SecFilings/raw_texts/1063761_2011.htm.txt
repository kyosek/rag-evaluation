Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 242.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 153.9 million square feet. A total estimated retail sale at the properties in 2011 was approximately $65 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 151 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.4 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,500 occupied stores, including approximately 692 anchors, which are predominately national retailers. For comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls in the Mills portfolio from the information on our other regional malls.
Premium Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 58 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Palm Springs, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
The Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.2 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The Mills regional malls typically range in size from 800,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 66 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 950,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 15 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 700,000 square feet of GLA, are considered non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation and amortization.
As of December 31, 2011, approximately 94.8% of the owned GLA in regional malls and Premium Outlets and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 95.0% of the owned GLA for The Mills and 88.6% of owned GLA for the Mills regional malls was leased, and approximately 93.4% of owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.
We hold a 100% interest in 219 of our properties, effectively control 20 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 87 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 324 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.
The following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls and Premium Outlets, The Mills, the Mills regional malls and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2011.

We also hold real estate interests in eight operating joint venture properties in Japan, two operating joint venture properties in South Korea, one operating joint venture property in Mexico, and one operating joint venture property in Malaysia.

Land
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 550 acres of land held in the United States for future development.
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency
Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, excluding new developments and expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 299 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 26% reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties and reflects an annual value of over $32 million in avoided operating costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 210,000 metric tons CO2e.
In 2011, we were awarded NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for the seventh year in a row, and NAREIT's Leader in the Light Long Term Achievement Award. We are the only company to have achieved the Leader in the Light distinction every single year since NAREIT launched the program in 2005. We were included in the 2011 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index published by the Carbon Disclosure Project. We scored 96 points out of 100 for transparency in environmental-impact reporting and were the only REIT to earn a place on the index.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other indebtedness encumbering our properties, and the properties held by our domestic and international joint venture arrangements, and also our unsecured corporate debt.
