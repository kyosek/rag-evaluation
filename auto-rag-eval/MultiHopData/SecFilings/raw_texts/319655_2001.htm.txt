Item 2. Properties
The 75% net overriding royalty conveyed to the Trust was carved out the Underlying Properties, which consist of Southland Royalty’s (now BROG’s) working interests and royalty interests in properties situated in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico. References below to “gross” wells and acres are to the interests of all persons owning interests therein, while references to “net” are to the interests of BROG (from which the Royalty was carved) in such wells and acres.
Unless otherwise indicated, the following information in Item 2 is based upon data and information furnished to the Trustee by BROG.
Producing Acreage, Wells and Drilling
The Underlying Properties consist of working interests and royalty interests in 151,900 gross (119,000 net) producing acres in San Juan, Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties of northwestern New Mexico. Based upon information received from the Trust’s independent petroleum engineers, the Trust properties contain 3,305 gross (976 net) economic wells, including dual completions. Production from conventional gas wells is primarily from the Pictured Cliffs, Mesaverde and Dakota formations. During 1988, Southland Royalty began development of coal seam reserves in the Fruitland Coal formation. For additional information concerning coal seam gas, the “Description of the Properties” section of the Trust’s Annual Report to security holders for the year ended December 31, 2001, is herein incorporated by reference.
The Royalty conveyed to the Trust is limited to the base of the Dakota formation, which is currently the deepest significant producing formation under acreage affected by the Royalty. Rights to production, if any, from deeper formations are retained by BROG.
BROG revised its 2001 capital budget estimate for the Underlying Properties upward from $30.2 million to $38.8 million. BROG’s capital plan for the Underlying Properties for 2001 estimated 406 projects, including the drilling of 49 new wells operated by BROG. In 2001, BROG actually participated in 663 projects, including 61 new wells operated by BROG. BROG informed the Trust that the upward revision was due to the fact that service costs had been expected to increase approximately 10% in 2001 as compared to the prior year. However, BROG indicates that as a result of higher commodity prices in 2001 and a resulting increased demand for equipment and services, some costs actually increased in 2001 by as much as 40%. In addition, the Bureau of Land Management has undertaken an environmental impact study of the entire San Juan Basin such that new drilling activity located more than 300 feet from an existing road now requires an additional level of regulatory approval on a well-by-well basis. More regulatory approvals to drill were obtained in 2001 than expected, which resulted in an increase in drilling activity.
The aggregate capital expenditures reported by BROG in calculating distributable income for 2001 include approximately $9,250,000 attributable to the capital budgets for 1999 and 2000. This occurs because projects within a given year’s budget may extend into subsequent years, with capital expenditures attributable to those projects used in calculating distributable income to the Trust in those subsequent years. Further, BROG’s accounting period for capital expenditures runs through November 30 of each calendar year, such that capital expenditures incurred in December of each year are actually accounted for as part of the following year’s capital expenditures. Also, for wells not operated by BROG, BROG’s share of capital expenditures may not actually be paid by it until the year or years after those expenses were incurred by the operator. Capital expenditures of approximately $27 million for 2001 budgeted projects were used in calculating distributable income in calendar year 2001, and approximately $7 million in capital expenditures have been used in calculating distributions for the first two months of 2002. Therefore, an additional approximately $4.8 million in capital expenditures for 2001 projects remains to be spent.
During 2001, in calculating the net proceeds to the Trust, BROG deducted approximately $33 million of capital expenditures for projects, including drilling and completion of 92 gross (36.33 net) conventional wells, recompletion of 33 gross (18.18 net) conventional wells, 13 gross (2.85 net) miscellaneous capital projects, 3 gross (2.34 net) restimulations, 56 gross (8.40 net) conventional payadds, 10 gross (1.52 net) coal seam wells, 4 gross (1.61 net) coal seam well recompletions, 1 gross (.88 net) coal seam payadd, 6 gross (.04 net) coal seam recavitations and facilities maintenance. There were 100 gross (32.47 net) new conventional wells, 31 gross (13.47 net) conventional well recompletions, 2 gross (.87 net) miscellaneous conventional capital projects, 9 gross (3.17 net) conventional payadds, 15 gross (1.09 net) conventional restimulations, 12 gross (5.36 net) coal seam wells, 7 gross (4.11 net) coal seam recompletions, 2 gross (.02 net) coal seam restimulations and six gross (.29 net) miscellaneous coal seam capital projects in progress as of December 31, 2001.
During 2000, in calculating the net proceeds to the Trust, BROG deducted approximately $25.6 million of capital expenditures for projects, including drilling and completion of 45 gross (25.45 net) conventional wells, recompletion of 15 gross (6.80 net) conventional wells, 12 gross (6.75 net) coal seam wells, 4 gross (.17 net) coal seam well recompletions, 41 gross (.24 net) coal seam recavitations, and facilities maintenance.
There were 124 gross (36.15 net) new conventional wells, 59 gross (21.37 net) conventional well recompletions, 10 gross (2.14 net) coal seam wells, 12 gross (1.64 net) coal seam recompletions, and 4 gross (.03 net) coal seam recavitations in progress as of December 31, 2000.
BROG has informed the Trust that it has reduced its projections for capital expenditures for the Underlying Properties for 2002 from an estimated $17.1 million to an estimated $12.4 million. BROG anticipates the drilling of 43 new wells to be operated by BROG and 26 wells to be operated by third parties. Of the new BROG operated wells, 36 are projected to be conventional wells completed to the Pictured Cliffs, Mesaverde, and/or Dakota formations, and the remaining seven are projected as coal seam gas wells to be completed in the Fruitland Coal formation. BROG projects approximately $9.6 million to be spent on the new wells, and $2.8 million to be expended in working over existing wells and in the maintenance and improvement of production facilities.
In February 2002, BROG informed the Trust that the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division had approved plans for 80-acre infill drilling of the Dakota formation in the San Juan Basin. Eighty-acre spacing has been permitted in the Mesaverde formation since 1997. The Mesaverde formation was originally developed in the 1950’s on 320-acre spacing, with infill drilling initiated in the early 1970’s on 160-acre spacing. In 1994, BROG undertook an extensive study of the Mesaverde formation. Results indicated that downspaced drilling (infill drilling) on 80-acre spacing could significantly increase recoverable gas reserves in this reservoir. A pilot program began in 1997 and was expanded in 1998 to include two additional areas.
BROG has previously informed the Trust that increases in its capital program, particularly in 2000 and 2001, were designed to offset the natural decline in production from the Underlying Properties. BROG has reported favorable results in this effort in that natural gas production for calendar year 2001 averaged approximately 121 MMcf per day, as compared to average production of approximately 116 MMcf per day for calendar 2000 and 113 MMcf per day for calendar 1999.
BROG indicates its budget for 2002 reflects continued, significant development of properties in which the Trust’s net overriding royalty interest is relatively high, as well as a sustained focus on conventional formations, including infill drilling to the Mesaverde and Dakota formations, development of the Fruitland Coal formation and multiple formation completions.
Oil and Gas Production
The Trust recognizes production during the month in which the related distribution is received. Production of oil and gas and related average sales prices attributable to the Royalty for the three years ended December 31, 2001 were as follows:
Pricing Information
Gas produced in the San Juan Basin is sold in both interstate and intrastate commerce. Reference is made to “Regulation” for information as to federal regulation of prices of oil and natural gas. Gas production from the properties from which the Royalty was carved totaled 42,960,149 Mcf during 2001.
On September 4, 1996, the Trustee announced a settlement of litigation filed by the Trustee against BROG and Southland Royalty Company. In the settlement, agreement was reached, among other things,
regarding marketing arrangements for the sale of those gas, oil and natural gas liquids products which are subject to the Royalty (the “Trust” gas, oil and/or natural gas liquids) as follows:
	(i) BROG agreed that, except for a 	pre-existing contract which has since expired, all subsequent 	contracts for the sale of Trust gas would require the written 	approval of an independent gas marketing consultant acceptable 	to the Trust; 	
	(ii) BROG will continue to market the Trust 	oil and natural gas liquids but will make payments to the Trust 	based on actual proceeds from such sales. BROG will no longer 	use posted prices as the basis for calculating proceeds to the 	Trust nor make a deduction for marketing fees associated with 	sales of oil or natural gas liquids products; and 	
	(iii) The independent marketer of the Trust 	gas is entitled to use of BROG’s current gas 	transportation, gathering, processing and treating agreements 	with third parties, at least through the remainder of their 	primary terms. 	
See Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements of the Trust’s Annual Report to securityholders for the year ended December 31, 2001 for further discussion of this settlement and its impact on the Trust.
BROG entered into a contract dated November 10, 1999, as amended, for the sale of all volumes of Trust gas to Duke Energy and Marketing, L.L.C. (“Duke”). That contract, as amended, provides for delivery of gas at various delivery points over a period commencing January 1, 2000 and ending March 31, 2002 and provides for the sale of Trust gas at prices which fluctuate in accordance with published indices for gas sold in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. BROG has distributed requests for proposal to 27 potential bidders with a view toward selecting one or more contracts for the sale of Trust gas for the period commencing April 1, 2002, through March 31, 2004.
Confidentiality agreements with purchasers of gas produced from the Underlying Properties prohibit public disclosure of certain terms and conditions of gas sales contracts with those entities, including specific pricing terms, gas receipt points, etc. Such disclosure could compromise the ability to compete effectively in the marketplace for the sale of gas produced from the Underlying Properties.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The following are definitions adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are applicable to terms used within this Item:
	“Estimated future net revenues” are 	computed by applying current prices of oil and gas (with 	consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by 	contractual arrangements and allowed by federal regulation) to 	estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of 	the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated 	future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in 	developing and producing the proved reserves, and assuming 	continuation of existing economic conditions. “Estimated 	future net revenues” are sometimes referred to in this 	Form 10-K as “estimated future net cash flows.” 	
	“Present value of estimated future net 	revenues” is computed using the estimated future net 	revenues (as defined above) and a discount rate of 10%. 	
	“Proved reserves” are those estimated 	quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, 	which, upon analysis of geological and engineering data, appear 	with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from 	known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and 	operating conditions. 	
	“Proved developed reserves” are those 	proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through 	existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. 	
	“Proved undeveloped reserves” are those 	proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new 	wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a 	relatively major expenditure is required. 	
The independent petroleum engineers’ reports as to the proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. The following table presents a reconciliation of proved reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 2001 (in thousands):
Estimated quantities of proved developed reserves of crude oil and natural gas as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows (in thousands):
Generally, the calculation of oil and gas reserves takes into account a comparison of the value of the oil or gas to the cost of producing those minerals, in an attempt to cause minerals in the ground to be included in reserve estimates only to the extent that the anticipated costs of production will be exceeded by the anticipated sales revenue. Accordingly, an increase in sales price and/or a decrease in production cost can itself result in an increase in estimated reserves and declining prices and/or increasing costs can result in reserves reported at less than the physical volumes actually thought to exist. The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires supplemental disclosures for oil and gas producers based on a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities. Under this disclosure, future cash inflows are estimated by applying year-end prices of oil and gas relating to the enterprise’s proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes are only considered to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is achieved by using a discount rate of 10% a year to reflect the timing of future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.
Estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are by their nature imprecise. Estimates of future net revenue attributable to proved reserves are sensitive to the unpredictable prices of oil and gas and other variables. Accordingly, under the allocation method used to derive the Trust’s quantity of proved reserves, changes in prices will result in changes in quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues.
The 2001, 2000 and 1999 changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to future royalty income from proved reserves discounted at 10% are as follows (in thousands):
Reserve quantities and revenues shown in the tables above for the Royalty were estimated from projections of reserves and revenues attributable to the combined BROG and Trust interests. Reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty were derived from estimates by allocating to the Royalty a portion of the total net reserve quantities of the interests, based upon gross revenue less production taxes. Because the reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty are estimated using an allocation of the reserves, any changes in prices or costs will result in changes in the estimated reserve quantities allocated to the Royalty. Therefore, the reserve quantities estimated will vary if different future price and cost assumptions occur. The future net cash flows were determined without regard to future federal income tax credits available to production from coal seam wells.
December average prices of $1.96 per Mcf of conventional gas, $1.42 per Mcf of coal seam gas and $15.79 per Bbl of oil were used at December 31, 2001, in determining future net revenue. The downward revision in reserve quantities for 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to significantly lower oil and gas prices in December 2001 as compared to December 2000.
December average prices of $6.18 per Mcf of conventional gas, $4.03 per Mcf of coal seam gas and $24.67 per Bbl of oil were used at December 31, 2000, in determining future net revenue. The upward revision in reserve quantities for 2000 as compared to 1999 was primarily due to significantly higher gas prices in December 2000.
December average prices of $2.39 per Mcf of conventional gas, $1.49 per Mcf of coal seam gas and $22.30 per Bbl of oil were used at December 31, 1999, in determining future net revenue.
The following presents estimated future net revenues and present value of estimated future net revenues attributable to the Royalty for each of the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in thousands except amounts per Unit):
Proved reserve quantities are estimates based on information available at the time of preparation and such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of those reserves may be substantially different from the above estimates. Moreover, the present values shown above should not be considered as the market values of such oil and gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to acquire equivalent reserves. A market value determination would include many additional factors.
Regulation
Many aspects of the production, pricing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas are regulated by federal and state agencies. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on affected members of the industry.
Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Natural gas and oil operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations that regulate the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled and unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum allowable production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of natural gas and oil that BROG can produce and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which BROG can drill.
Federal Natural Gas 	Regulation
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce, historically, have been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and its predecessor. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future.
Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and FERC from 1985 to the present that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation, and sales. In addition, FERC continues to promulgate revisions to various aspects of the rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation of the natural gas industry.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts. The Trust cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective, or their effect, if any, on the Trust. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued over the last decade by FERC and Congress will continue.
The ability to transport and sell oil and natural gas are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines.
Section 29 Tax Credit
The Trust began receiving royalty income from coal seam gas wells in 1989. Under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, coal seam gas production from wells drilled prior to January 1, 1993 (including certain wells recompleted in coal seams formations thereafter), generally qualifies for the federal income tax credit for producing non-conventional fuels if such production and the sale thereof occurs before January 1, 2003. For 2000, this tax credit was $1.06 per MMBtu. For 2001, the amount of the credit will be determined by the Treasury Department no later than April 1, 2002, and, based on historical trends, is expected to
approximate (within a 2-3% range) the 2000 credit. To benefit from the credit, each Unit holder must determine from the tax information he receives from the Trust his pro rata share of qualifying production of the Trust, based upon the number of Units owned during each month of the year, and the amount of available credit per MMbtu for the year, and then apply the tax credit against his own income tax liability, but such credit may not reduce his regular tax liability (after the foreign tax credit and certain other nonrefundable credits) below his tentative minimum tax. Section 29 also provides that any amount of Section 29 credit disallowed for the tax year solely because of this limitation will increase his credit for prior year minimum tax liability, which may be carried forward indefinitely as a credit against the taxpayer’s regular tax liability, subject, however, to the limitations described in the preceding sentence. There is no provision for the carryback or carryforward of the Section 29 credit in any other circumstances.
BROG provides the Trustee with certain Section 29 tax credit information, including coal seam volumes produced from Trust Properties. In 1999, the Tenth Circuit Court upheld the position of the IRS and the Tax Court that nonconventional fuel such as coal seam gas does not qualify for the Section 29 credit unless the producer received a formal certification from FERC. FERC’s certification authority expired effective January 1, 1993. However, on July 14, 2000, FERC issued a final ruling amending its regulations to reinstate certain regulations involving well category determinations for all wells and tight formation areas that could qualify for the Section 29 tax credit. BROG has informed the Trustee that it will seek certification of all qualified wells.
Other Regulation
The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including, but not limited to, environmental protection, occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity.
Item 3.
