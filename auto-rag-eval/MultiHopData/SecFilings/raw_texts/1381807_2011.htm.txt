Shanxi Wealth obtained the respective mining licenses regarding the bauxite mine (license No.140000512847) and limestone mine (license No.140000631218) in January 2006, and accordingly, has become the registered concessionaire of the two said mines since then. In addition, as specified on the respective mining licenses, the duration for the mining rights regarding the limestone mine and bauxite mine to which Guizhou Yufeng is entitled are from September 2005 until September 2023 and from October 2005 until October 2020 respectively. As far as Shanxi Wealth is concerned, Shanxi Wealth, based on its mining licenses, is entitled to enjoy the mining rights regarding the bauxite mine from January 2006 until January 2020 and the limestone mine from January 2006 until January 2025 respectively. In accordance with the Measures for Registration Administration of Mineral Resources Exploitation, if there is a need to continue mining minerals on the expiration of the period of validity of the mining license, the mining concessionaire shall complete the procedures for extension of registration with the registration authority 30 days prior to the expiration of the period of validity of the mining license.
Pursuant to the revised PRC Mineral Resources Law, effective on January 1, 1997 and the Implementation Rules of the PRC Resources Law, effective on March 26, 1994, all mineral resources shall be owned by the PRC government. The State ownership of the mineral resources, either near the earth's surface or underground, shall not change with the ownership of the land or the right to the use of the land to which the mineral resources are attached. Accordingly, the PRC government adopts a license system for the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources. Under the PRC laws and regulations, "exploration right" means the right to explore the mineral resources within the scope provided by the exploration license which is legally obtained and the units or individuals that have obtained the exploration licenses are called exploration licensees, while "exploitation right" or “mining right” means the right to exploit the mineral resources and own the products within the scope provided by the exploitation license which is legally obtained and the units or individuals that have obtained the exploitation licenses are called concessionaires. Any concessionaires are granted the rights to conduct the mining activities within the term and the exploitation area prescribed by the mining license; sell the mineral products by themselves, except for those minerals which the PRC State Council has prescribed for a unified purchase by the designated units only; construct within the mine area production and living facilities; obtain in accordance with law the right to use the land required for the production; and other rights provided by laws and regulations. The concessionaires shall fulfill the obligations of conducting mine construction or mining within the term approved; conducting efficient protection, rational mining and comprehensive utilization of the mineral resources; paying the resources tax and the mineral resources compensation fees pursuant to law; complying with the State laws and regulations regarding the labor safety for production, water and soil conservancy, land recovery and environmental protection; and accepting the supervision and administration from both the competent departments in charge of geology and mineral resources and the other relevant competent departments, and filling out and presenting the mineral resources forms and mineral resources development and utilization statistics reports according to the relevant provisions.
Pursuant to the Measures for Control of Transfer of Exploration Rights or Mining Rights, promulgated by the State Council and effective on February 12, 1998, a mining concessionaire is entitled to apply with the competent examining and approving authority regarding transferring its mining rights to a transferee under the transfer contract executed thereby. After receipt of the application, the examining and approving authority will make a decision of approval or disapproval within 40 days as of the date of receipt of the application for transfer, and notify the transferor and the transferee. If the transfer is approved, the transferor and the transferee are required to go through the formalities for registration modification with the original licensing authority within 60 days as of the date of receipt of the approval notice of transfer. The transferee will obtain the mining license and become an exploration licensee or a mining concessionaire after paying the relevant required fees.
We have full mining rights over the bauxite mines and limestone mines concerned. As a concessionaire under the mining licenses, we are required to pay certain taxes and fees to the PRC government as royalties for our mining activities and sale of mineral products, such as the resource tax of bauxite at the rate of RMB20 Yuan per ton in Guizhou and Shanxi, and the resource tax of limestone at the rate of RMB2 Yuan per ton in Guizhou and Shanxi; the mineral compensation fees, which is computed and collected at a certain ratio of the sales income of mineral products; the mining fees, which shall be paid year by year according to the acreage of the scope of the mining zone at a rate of RMB1,000 Yuan per square kilometer per year; and the price for the mining. As Guizhou Yufeng and Shanxi Wealth acquired the mining rights through the means of transfer, the transfer price has included the mining fees, and Guizhou Yufeng and Shanxi Wealth have paid off the mineral compensation fees. As of December, 2011 and 2010, Guizhou Yufeng and Shanxi Wealth have paid all the requisite fees as required.
In order to retain the mining rights, the mining concessionaire shall conduct mine construction or mining within the term and area approved, conduct efficient protection, rational mining and comprehensive utilization of the mineral resources, accept supervision and inspection from both the competent departments in charge of geology and mineral resources, submit annual reports including the mineral resource forms and mineral resources development and utilization statistics reports, pay the fees as required by relevant laws and regulations, such as Measures for Registration Administration of Mineral Resources Exploitation (effective on February 12, 1998), and Provisions on Administration of Collection of Mineral Resources Compensation Fees (effective on February 27, 1994), and complete the registration procedures for the modification (if applicable). As of December 2011 and 2010, each of Guizhou Yufeng and Shanxi Wealth holds their respective mining rights in good standing.
