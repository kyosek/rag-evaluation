Proposed Transaction. On March 25, 2005, Whitestone Triangle LP (“Whitestone”) a wholly owned subsidiary of ACRT and the 40% owner of the New York City property brought suit against its joint venture partner regarding the exercise of a right of first refusal to purchase ACRT’s interest in the property. On January 5, 2005, Whitestone sent to the joint venture partner a notice of right of first refusal to purchase Whitestone’s interest in the property at a price and other terms as set forth in the notice, subject to an attached form of contract that required both shareholder and board of director approval. Subsequently, ACRT discovered that the calculation used to allocate capital proceeds in the contemplated sale, prepared by a third party, was incorrectly allocated and as a result management and the board of directors of ACRT did not approve the terms of the sale. In addition, ACRT believes the joint venture partner, due to their unique insight into the value of the interest as the manager of the property, was aware that the capital proceeds were incorrectly allocated. The joint venture partner has refused to accept a revised purchase price calculation, which necessitated ACRT bringing suit to halt the sale.
On April 1, 2005, ACRT’s joint venture partner filed a separate lawsuit against Whitestone compelling a sale of ACRT’s interest under the terms of the original right of first refusal.
On October 31, 2005, ACRT’s request for summary judgment against its joint venture partner regarding the joint venture partner’s exercise of a right of first refusal to purchase ACRT’s interest in the New York, NY property was denied. Summary judgment was found in favor of its joint venture partner in enforcement of the right of first refusal to purchase ACRT’s interest as now written. ACRT plans to appeal this ruling. ACRT’s management does not believe that the ruling will have a material adverse impact on ACRT’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
