The historic production peaked during World War II when, base on smelter receipts, the production of direct shipped ore totaled 53,653 tons containing 3,118 ounces of gold, 566,439 ounces of silver, 13,932 pounds of copper, 2,562,318 pounds of lead and 15,593,061 pounds of zinc. In addition to the direct-ship ore, a flotation mill was constructed and operated during the late-1940s and early-1950s. There is no production information available on the tons, grade and concentrate associated with that phase of the operation, but it is estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 tons of ore were mined and process based on the estimated tonnage of mill tailings.
South Mountain Mines controlled the patented claims from 1975 to the time the Company purchased the entity in 2007. They conducted extensive exploration work including extending the Sonneman Level by approximately 1,500 feet to intercept the downdip extension of the Texas sulfide mineralization mined on the Laxey Level some 300 feet above the Sonneman. High grade sulfide mineralization was intercepted on the Sonneman Extension. In 1985 they did a feasibility study based on polygonal ore blocks exposed in the underground workings and drilling. This resulted in a historic resource of approximately 470,000 tons containing 23,500 ounces of gold, 3,530,000 ounces of silver, 8,339,000 pounds of copper, 13,157,000 pounds of lead and 91,817,000 lbs of zinc. Although they determined positive economics, the project was shut down and placed into care and maintenance.
In 2008, the Company engaged Kleinfelder West, Inc., a nationwide engineering and consulting firm, to complete a technical report “Resources Data Evaluation, South Mountain Property, South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho”. The technical report was commissioned by Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. to evaluate all the existing data available on the South Mountain property. Kleinfelder utilized a panel modeling method using this data to determine potential mineralized material remaining and to make a comparison with the resource determined by South Mountain Mines in the mid-1980s.
Additional drilling and sampling will be necessary before the resource can be classified as a mineable reserve, but Kleinfelder West’s calculations provided a potential resource number that is consistent with South Mountain Mines’ (Bowes 1985) reserve model.
During the 2008 field season two core drill holes were drilled to test the downdip extension of the sulfide mineralization in the main mine area, one on the DMEA2 ore shoot and one on the Texas ore shoot. The DMEA 2 target was successful, with two distinct sulfide zones totaling 30 feet being encountered in an overall altered and mineralized intercept of approximately 73 feet. The samples over the entire intercept were detail sampled over the entire 73 feet resulting in a total of 34 discrete sample intervals ranging from 0.5 to 3.7 feet. The samples cut at the Company’s office in Garden City, Idaho and Company personnel delivered the samples to ALS Chemex preparation lab in Elko, Nevada. The analytical results showed two distinct zones of strong mineralization.

These intercepts are down dip approximately 300 feet below of the DMEA 2 mineralized zone encountered in Sonneman Level tunnel, and 600 feet below the DMEA 2 zone on the Laxey Level tunnel. The tenor of mineralization the DMEA 2 on the Sonneman is similar to that intercepted in the core hole, including two distinct zones with differing grades.
The second drill hole, TX-1, was designed to test the Texas Ore Shoot approximately 300 feet down dip of the Sonneman Level. The small core hole achieved a depth of 1250 feet, but deviated parallel to the bedding and the targeted carbonate horizon was not intercepted.
Late in 2009, the Company contracted with Gregory P. Wittman (a Qualified Person under Canadian regulations) of Northwestern Groundwater & Geology to incorporate all the new drill and sampling data into an NI 43-101 Technical Report. This report was needed as part of the Company’s efforts to obtain a listing on the TSX Venture Exchange in 2010. The NI 43-101 can be reviewed on the Company`s website at www.thundermountaingold.com, or on www.SEDAR.com.
Location Map of South Mountain and Clover Mountain Projects
A multi-lithic intrusive breccia outcrop was identified and sampled in 2008 on property leased by the Company. This large area, approximately one mile long and one-half a mile wide, is located several thousand feet south of the main mine area. The intrusive breccia is composed of rounded to sub-rounded fragments of altered intrusive rock and silicified fragments of altered schist and marble. Initial rock chip samples from the outcrop area ranged from 0.49 ppm to 1.70 ppm gold, and follow-up outcrop and float sampling in 2009 yielded gold values ranging from 0.047 ppm to
5.81 ppm. A first pass orientation soil survey completed in 2008 was conducted near the “discovery’ breccia outcrop at a spacing of 100 feet over a distance of 800 feet east/west and 1,000 feet north/south. The soil assays ranged from a trace to 0.31 ppm Gold. Surface mapping indicates that the intrusive breccia covers an area of approximately 5,000 feet x 1,500 feet.
The 2010 drilling focused primarily the breccia gold zone. Centra Consulting completed the storm water plan needed for the exploration road construction on private land, and it was accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Road construction started on August 1, 2010 by Warner Construction and a total of 3.2 miles of access and drill site roads were completed through the end of September.
A campaign of road cut sampling was undertaken on the new roads as they were completed. Three sets of samples were obtained along the cut bank of the road. Channel samples were taken on 25-foot, 50-foot or 100-foot intervals, depending upon the nature of the material cut by the road with the shorter spaced intervals being taken in areas of bedrock. A total of 197 samples were collected and sent to ALS Chemex labs in Elko, Nevada. A majority of the samples contained anomalous gold values and in addition to confirming the three anomalies identified by soils sampling, the road cuts added a fourth target that yielded a 350-foot long zone that averaged 378 parts per billion gold (0.011 ounce per ton). Follow up sampling on a road immediately adjacent to this zone yielded a 100-foot sample interval that ran 5.91 parts per million gold (0.173 ounce per ton).
Drilling on the intrusive breccia target commenced on October 1, 2010 with a Schramm reverse circulation rig contracted through Drill Tech of Winnemucca, Nevada. Five widely-spaced holes on the four significant gold anomalies in the intrusive breccia target were completed with the following results:

Management believes that the “first-pass” drill results from the intrusive breccia target proves the existence of a significant gold system in an intrusive package that is related to the polymetallic mineralization in the carbonate in the historic mine area. Additional work is planned for 2011, including a draped aeromagnetic, resistivity and IP surveys to isolate potential feeder structures and to evaluate the contact between the metasediments and the gold-bearing intrusive.
In addition to the drilling completed in on the Intrusive Breccia target, two reverse circulation drill holes were completed targeting the down dip extension of the polymetallic zones in an effort to confirm continuity of the ore zones to a greater depth. Vertical drill hole LO 6 was placed to intercept the down dip extension of the DMEA 2 ore shoot exposed on both the Laxey and Sonneman levels of the underground workings, as well as the 2008 core hole drilled by the Company that extended the zone 300 feet down dip of the Sonneman level. Drillhole LO 6 cut a thick zone of skarn alteration and polymetallic mineralization at 760 feet to 790 feet. The intercept contained 30 feet of 3.55% zinc, 1.87 ounce per ton silver, and 0.271% copper. Internal to this zone was 15 feet of 0.060 OPT gold and 20 feet of 0.21% lead. Importantly, this intercept proves the continuity of the ore zone an additional 115 feet down dip of the 2008 drill hole, or 415 feet below the Sonneman level. It remains open at depth.
Drill hole LO-7 was placed to test the down dip extension of the Laxey ore zone, the zone that produced a majority of the silver, zinc, copper, lead and gold during the World War II period. A portion of the ore zone was intercepted approximately 180 feet below the bottom of the Laxey Shaft which mined the zone over an 800-foot length. This hole intercepted 25 feet (600-625 feet) of 8.56% zinc and 1.15 ounce per ton (opt) silver. This intercept proves the extension of the Laxey ore zone approximately 120 feet below the maximum depth previously mined when over 51,000 tons of sulfide ore were mined and direct shipped to the Anaconda smelter in Utah. The grade of this ore mined over the 800 feet of shaft and stope mining was 15% zinc, 10 opt silver, 0.06 opt gold, 2.3% lead and 0.7% copper.
Management is encouraged by both of these intercepts as they prove the continuation of the replacement sulfide mineralized ore shoots at depth. Detailed follow-up core drilling will be needed to better define the potential of the ore shoots at depth. The ongoing exploration field work is financed by the Company through sales of unregistered common stock . Future work will be funded in the same manner, or through a strategic partnership with another mining company.
This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7. There are currently no permits required for conducting exploration in accordance with the Company`s current board approved exploration plan.

The property is located approximately 155 air miles northeast of Reno, Nevada, or approximately 20 miles SW of Battle Mountain, Nevada, in Sections 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 27; T.29N.; R.44E. Mount Diablo Baseline & Meridian, Lander County, Nevada. Latitude: 40 23’ 36” North, Longitude: 117 00’ 58” West. The property is accessible by traveling south from Battle Mountain Nevada on state highway 305, which is paved. After traveling approximately 20 miles, turn east off the highway on an unimproved public dirt road, and travel approximately 2 miles to the claims. The property is generally accessible year round. There is no power, no water other than seasonal surface precipitation, and there are no improvements on the property.
The 60 unpatented claims are 100% owned by Thunder Mountain Gold, and located along a northwest structural tend which projects into the Battle Mountain mining district to the northwest and into the Goat Ridge window and the Gold Acres, Pipeline, and Cortez area to the southeast. Northwest trending mineralized structures in the Battle Mountain mining district are characterized by elongated plutons, granodiorite porphyry dikes, magnetic lineaments, and regional alignment of mineralized areas. The Trout Creek target is located at the intersection of this northwest trending mineral belt and north-south trending extensional structures.
The Trout Creek target is based on a regional gravity anomaly on a well-defined northwest-southeast trending break in the alluvial fill thickness and underlying bedrock. Previous geophysical work in the 1980s revealed an airborne magnetic anomaly associated with the same structure, and this was further verified and outlined in 2008 by Company personnel using a ground magnetometer. The target is covered by alluvial fan deposits of unknown thickness shed from the adjacent Shoshone Range, a fault block mountain range composed of Paleozoic sediments of both upper and lower plate rocks of the Roberts Mountains thrust. The geophysical anomaly could define a prospective and unexplored target within a well mineralized region.
The ongoing exploration field work, including claim maintenance and assessment, is financed by the Company through sales of unregistered common stock funded by the Company through private placements with accredited investors. Future work will be funded in the same manner, or through a strategic partnership with another mining company. The Company is attempting to consolidate the land package to cover a larger area of the positive geophysical target in the pediment by acquiring and/or joint venturing adjoining mineral property. There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, a notice of intent may be required with the Bureau of Land Management. This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7.

These Claims are 100% owned by Thunder Mountain Gold Inc.
A geologic reconnaissance program in the fall of 2006 identified anomalous gold, silver, and other base metals in rock chips and soils at Clover Mountain. In February 2007 the Company located the Clover Mountain claim group consisting of 40 unpatented lode mining claims totaling approximately 800 acres. Mineralization appears to be associated with stockwork veining in a granitic stock which has been intruded by northeast and northwest-trending rhyolitic dikes. The property is overlain by locally silicified rhyolitic tuff.
Follow-up rock chip sampling within the area of the anomaly has identified quartz veining with gold values ranging from 3.6 part per million (ppm) to 16.5 ppm. A soil sample program consisting of 215 samples was conducted on 200’x 200’ grid spacing which defined two northeast tending soil anomalies with gold values ranging from 0.020 ppm to 0.873 ppm Au. The gold anomalies are approximately 1,000’ in length and approximately 300’ in width. The gold anomalies are associated with northeast trending structures with accompanying quartz stockwork veining in an exposure of Cretaceous/Tertiary granite. A 2,500’ base metal soil anomaly is observed trending northwest proximal to rhyolite and rhyodacitic dikes which intrude the granitic stock. No significant work was completed on the claim group in 2010, but additional field work is warranted in the future that may include backhoe trenching and sampling in the significantly anomalous area followed by exploration drilling.
During brief field work in 2010, the presence of visible free gold was noted by panning in the area of the strong soil anomaly. The ongoing exploration field work, including claim maintenance and assessment fees, is funded by the Company through private placements with accredited investors. Future work will be funded in the same manner, or through a strategic partnership with another mining company.
There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, a notice of intent or plan of operations may be required with the Bureau of Land Management. This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Industry Guide 7.
Competition
We are an exploration stage company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Employees
The Company had three employees during the year ended December 31, 2011; Eric Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Collord, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Pete Parsley, Vice President and Exploration Manager.
