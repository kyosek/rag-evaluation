The San Sebastian Gold Mine
General Location and Accessibility
The SSGM is situated on a mountainous tract of land owned by Misanse in approximately 1,470 acres of explored and unexplored mining prospects. The SSGM is located approximately three miles off of the Pan American Highway, northwest of the city of Santa Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union, El Salvador. The tract is typical of the numerous volcanic mountains of the coastal range of southeastern El Salvador. The topography is mountainous with elevations ranging from 300 to 1,500 feet above sea level. The mountain slopes are steep, the gulches are well defined, and the drainage is excellent.
There is good roadway access to the SSGM site. The Pan American Highway is a four lane road and runs from the city of San Salvador to the Honduran border. The city of Santa Rosa de Lima (approximately three miles from the SSGM) is one of the larger cities in the Eastern Zone. The SSGM is approximately 30 miles from the city of San Miguel, which is El Salvador’s third largest city, and approximately 108 miles southeast of El Salvador’s capital city, San Salvador. SSGM is also approximately 26 miles from the city of La Union which has port and railroad facilities. Major United States’ commercial airlines provide daily scheduled flights to the Comalapa Airport which is located on the outskirts of the city of San Salvador.
The Company does not have a final feasibility study completed within the past five years, therefore, a determination that the property contains valid reserve estimates is not possible at this time. The Company plans to develop reserves from mineralized material present at the SSGM.
At the turn of the twentieth century, the SSGM was rated as one of the richest gold mines in the world. The United Nations’ 1969 Mineral Survey Report states that “unquestionably the San Sebastian deposit was the jewel of the El Salvador mining industry and one of the most prolific gold mines in Central America.”
The Company estimates that at the SSGM it has 14.4 million tons of virgin mineralized material, including the dump waste material. The dump material and stope fill at the SSGM are the by-products of past mining operations. The dump material was mined in the past in the search for higher grades of gold ore and piled to the side of past excavations as it was considered at that time to be too low of a grade of ore to process economically; however, it was reserved for future processing when the price of gold is at a level to process it profitably. The stope fill that was available was in the past (1900 era) considered to be too low of a grade of mineralized material to process economically, therefore it was primarily used to fill the voids in the underground workings to accommodate the extraction of the higher grade of gold mineralized material in the past SSGM mining activities.
Misanse Mining Lease
The Company (previously through the Joint Venture) leases the SSGM from Mineral San Sebastian, S.A. de C.V. (“Misanse”), an El Salvadoran corporation. The Company owns 52% of the total of Misanse’s issued and outstanding shares. About 100 El Salvador, Central American and United States’ citizens own the balance of the shares. (Reference is made to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7, for related party interests.)
SSGM Mining Lease
On January 14, 2003, the Company entered into an amended and renewed lease agreement with Mineral San Sebastian Sociedad Anomina de Capital Variable (Misanse) pursuant to the approval of the Misanse shareholders and directors at a shareholders’ meeting and thereafter at a directors’ meeting both held on January 12, 2003. The renewed lease is for a period to coincide with the term of its Renewed SSGM concession, which it received on August 29, 2003 from the DHM. It was automatically amended on May 20, 2004 to coincide with the extension of the term of the Renewed SSGM Exploitation Concession from 20 to 30 years. The lease is automatically extendible for one or more equal periods. The Company will pay to Misanse for the rental of this real estate the sum of five percent of the sales of the gold and silver produced from this real estate, however, the payment will not be less than $343.00 per month. The Company has the right to assign this lease without prior notice or permission from Misanse. This lease is pledged as collateral for loans made to related parties (Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7).
Misanse Mineral Concession-Government of El Salvador
In El Salvador, the rights to minerals below the sub-surface are vested with the government. The government through concessions grants mineral rights. Reference is made to the exploration and exploitation maps included in this report.
On July 23, 1987, the Government of El Salvador delivered and granted to Misanse, possession of the mining concession. At that time this provided the right to extract minerals and export gold and silver for a term of 25 years (plus a 25-year renewal option) beginning on the first day of production from the real estate which encompasses the SSGM owned by Misanse. Misanse assigned this concession to the Joint Venture.
Effective February 1996, the Government of El Salvador passed a law which required mining companies to pay to it three percent of its gross gold sale receipts and an additional one percent is to be paid to the El Salvador municipality which has jurisdiction of the mine site. As of July 2001, a series of revisions to the El Salvador Mining Law were made. A principal change is that the fee payable to the GOES has been reduced to two percent of the gross gold and silver receipts.
Renewed San Sebastian Gold Mine Exploitation Concession under El Salvador Agreement Number 591 dated May 20, 2004 and delivered on June 4, 2004 (Renewed SSGM) - approximately 1.2306 square kilometers (304 acres) located in the Department of La Union, El Salvador, Central America
On September 6, 2002, at a meeting held with the El Salvadoran Minister of Economy and the Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines (DHM), it was agreed to submit an application for the Renewed SSGM concession for a 30-year term and to simultaneously cancel the concession obtained on July 23, 1987. On September 26, 2002, the Company filed this application. On February 28, 2003 (received March 3, 2003) the DHM admitted to the receipt of the application and the Company proceeded to file public notices as required by Article 40 of the El Salvadoran Mining Law and its Reform (MLIR). On April 16, 2003, the Company’s El Salvadoran legal counsel filed with the DHM notice that it believed that it complied with the requirements of Article 40, and that there were no objections; and requested that the DHM make its inspection as required by MLIR Article 42. An inspection by the DHM was made. The Company then provided a bond which was required by the DHM to protect third parties against any damage caused from the mining operations, and it simultaneously paid the annual surface tax. On August 29, 2003 the Office of the Ministry of Economy formally presented the Company with a twenty-year Renewed SSGM concession which was dated August 18, 2003. On May 20, 2004 (delivered June 4, 2004) the Government of El Salvador under this Agreement Number 591 extended the exploitation concession for a period of thirty (30) years. This Renewed SSGM concession replaces the collateral that the same parties held with the previous concession.
On or about September 13, 2006, the El Salvador Ministry of the Environment delivered to Commerce’s El Salvadoran legal counsel its revocation of the environmental permits issued for the SSGM and SCMP. The Company is contesting these actions.
New San Sebastian Exploration License under El Salvador Resolution Number 27 - approximately 40.7694 square kilometers (10,070 acres) located in the Departments of La Union and Morazan, El Salvador, Central America
On October 20, 2002, the Company applied to the Government of El Salvador through the DHM for the New San Sebastian Exploration License, which covers an area of 41 square kilometers and includes approximately 1.2306 square kilometers of the Renewed SSGM concession. The New San Sebastian Exploration License area is in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima in the Department of La Union, Republic of El Salvador, Central America. On February 24, 2003, the DHM issued the New San Sebastian Exploration License for a period of four years starting from the date of December 27, 2003, following the notification of this resolution which was received on March 3, 2003. The New San Sebastian Exploration License may be extended for two two-year periods, or for a total of eight years. This license is in the process of being renewed for a period of four years. Besides the San Sebastian Gold Mine, the following three other formerly operative gold and silver mines are included in the New San Sebastian Exploration License area: the La Lola Mine, the Tabanco Mine, and the Santa Lucia Mine.
Historical data reflects the following:
A French company operated the La Lola Mine in 1920; they developed two quartz veins, which were named La Lola and Buena Vista. From 1950 through 1953, Mr. Amadeo Tinetti produced 1,850 ounces of gold and 66,000 ounces of silver.
The Tabanco Mine is south of the La Lola Mine. Records evidence and local citizens confirm that several levels of mining occurred. Isolated rich ore shoots reported to contain sulfides and silver chloride were encountered. The oxidized sulfide ore was mined from a width of three to six feet with a grade of 0.50 ounces per ton of gold and five ounces of silver. Records reflect that the Herrera family produced gold and silver beginning in the year 1780.
In the Tepeyac vein very high-grade ore in one to two foot widths was encountered. A United Nation’s team performed sampling and reported that in a sulfide bearing zone they found 0.31 ounces of gold and 4.52 ounces of silver in a 4.9 foot wide vein. The footwall host rock assayed at 0.22 ounces of gold and 41.29 ounces of silver. This footwall rock area location was not specifically identified, but the result lends strength to the recommendation that in any further sampling or mapping of veins in the epithermal environment, close attention will be directed to the wall rock.
The third mine in this exploration area is the Santa Lucia Mine in which Mr. Humberto Perla developed a 100 meter wide underground vein. This vein is the west continuation of the Granadilla and the Ano Nuevo veins located about two miles west of the SSGM property.
In October 2008 the Directorate of Mines notified the Company that it was not honoring the Company's previous request for an extension of the exploration permits at the San Sebastian and Nueva Esparta areas. The Company is contesting these actions.
Nueva Esparta Exploration License (Nueva Esparta) Resolution Number 271 - 45 square kilometers (11,115 acres) located in the Departments of La Union and Morazan, El Salvador, Central America
On or about October 20, 2002, the Company filed an application with the Government of El Salvador through the DHM for the Nueva Esparta, which consists of 45 square kilometers north and adjacent to the New San Sebastian Exploration License area. This rectangular area is in the Departments of La Union (east) and Morazan (west) and in the jurisdiction of the City of Santa Rosa de Lima, El Salvador, Central America. On May 25, 2004 (received June 4, 2004) the Government of El Salvador under Resolution Number 271 issued the exploration license for a period of four years with a right to request an additional four year extension. An important observation is that these mines form a belt of mineralization following a fault line from the SSGM to the Montemayor Mine for a distance of approximately five miles. Included in the Nueva Esparta are eight other formerly-operated gold and silver mines known as: the Grande Mine, the Las Pinas Mine, the Oro Mine, the Montemayor Mine, the Banadero Mine, the Carrizal Mine, the La Joya Mine and the Copetillo Mine. Historical data reflects the following:
The Montemayor Mine has records that show that an English company commenced production of precious metals sometime about 1860. A report prepared by Mr. Fleury in 1878 stated that the area assayed approximately 48 ounces of silver and 0.85 ounces of gold per ton. Six underground workings were developed, but no records are available. A United Nation’s report reflects a possible grade of twelve ounces of silver and 0.29 ounces of gold from a section of the Montemayor vein stope. The Montañita, Tempique, Guarumo, Santa Gertrudis and El Indio vein findings support expanded exploration. The Company performed preliminary exploration in the Montemayor Mine area from 1995 through 1997. Its findings from the ore samples were very positive and encouraged additional exploration. Exploration will consist of locating workable ore within the known structures through mapping and sampling of vein outcrops and reopening, mapping and sampling of underground work.
The El Banadero Mine is located near the Montemayor Mine. When in production, most of the mineralized material processed at the Montemayor mill came from this area and the quality of the precious metals appeared to have the highest values. The veins identified in the area are the Saravia, Borbollon, Caraguito 1 to 3, Eulalio and the Miserocordia.
At the La Joya Mine the Company, during previous exploration, discovered three parallel wide quartz veins averaging in width from six feet to 27 feet running northwest by southeast dipping at 42 degrees southwest. More exploration will be concentrated in this tract.
El Jimenito and Santa Teresa are two wide veins that the Company found at the Carrizal Mine. They are 1,920 to 2,560 feet apart. The local residents recollect that free gold was found in the Santa Teresa Vein Adit. This mine is located between the La Joya and Copetillo Mines.
One vein was discovered at the Copetillo Mine in an underground adit. It was developed into two sublevels connected to the south with one 100-foot shaft. Residents recall seeing free gold in the Canton Copetillo.
The Las Piñas Mine is located in the Canton Las Cañas and was in operation in 1935. It was developed for a five-year, 100-ton-per-day mill and plant. Records show that the average grade of silver was 5.10 ounces per ton and that the grade of gold averaged 0.06 ounces per ton.
The La Joya Mine is located in the Canton La Joya. Records relating to activities were not preserved. While exploring the region, the Company found three parallel wide quartz veins ranging from six to 25 feet running northwest to southeast for a distance of over one mile. The grass roots exploration suggests that this is an area with great ore potential.
At this time there is no available information about the Oro Mine. It is a short distance south of the Montemayor Mine. This should be a good exploration target.
In October 2008 the Directorate of Mines notified the Company that it was not honoring the Company's previous request for an extension of the exploration permits at the San Sebastian and Nueva Esparta areas. The Company is contesting these actions.
SSGM Current Status
The Company’s main objective and plan has been to operate a moderate tonnage, low-grade, open-pit, heap-leaching operation to mine gold on its SSGM site. Since the death of Commerce’s long-time Chairman Edward L. Machulak on October 21, 2007, the Company has been directing most of its efforts toward finding a compatible acquisition, merger, or other business arrangement. At the present time, the Company cannot proceed with its plans because the government of El Salvador has revoked the necessary permits.
SSGM Ownership of the Property
Misanse, a Salvadoran corporation, owns the San Sebastian Gold Mine real estate consisting of approximately 1,470 acres. The Company owns 52% of Misanse common shares that are issued and outstanding.
Modesto Mine
Modesto Mine Location
The Modesto Mine is located due north of the town of El Paisnal, approximately 19 miles north of the capital city, San Salvador, in the Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
Modesto Mine Present Status
The Joint Venture suspended exploration activities at this site in July 1997 when the Government of El Salvador awarded the concession of the property to another mining company. At the present time, the Government of El Salvador has suspended all mining in El Salvador. If the policies of the Government of El Salvador change, the Company believes that it will be in a good position to explore and develop this mining property because the Company’s late Chairman owns the title to the property.
Montemayor Mine (“Montemayor”)
The Joint Venture has obtained permission from a number of property owners to enter their property for the purpose of exploring, exploiting and developing the property and then, if feasible, to mine and extract minerals from this property. The Company believes that this real estate contains the “heart” of the mine. Montemayor is located about six miles northwest of the SSGM and about two and one-half miles east of the city of San Francisco Gotera in the Department of Morazan, Republic of El Salvador. Historical records evidence that the potential for the Montemayor to become an exploration and development silver-gold producing prospect is excellent. The Company will not be able to develop this mine unless it obtain required permits from the Government of El Salvador.
San Cristobal Mill and Plant (“SCMP”) Recovery and Processing System
SCMP Location
SCMP was located near the city of El Divisadero (bordering the Pan American Highway), and was approximately 13 miles east of the city of San Miguel, the third largest city in the Republic of El Salvador, Central America.
SCMP Lease Agreement
Although the Joint Venture owned the mill, plant and related equipment, it did not own the land and certain buildings.
On November 12, 1993, the Joint Venture entered into an agreement with Corporacion Salvadorena de Inversiones (“Corsain”), an El Salvadoran governmental agency, to lease for a period of ten years (expiring November 12, 2003), approximately 166 acres of land and buildings on which its gold processing mill, plant and related equipment (the SCMP) was located, and which was approximately 15 miles west of the SSGM site. The basic annual lease payment was U.S. $11,500, payable annually in advance, unless otherwise amended, and subject to an annual increase based on the annual United States’ inflation rate. As agreed, a security deposit of U.S. $11,500 was paid on the same date and this deposit was subject to increases based on any United States’ inflationary rate adjustments.
On April 26, 2004, a three-year lease, which includes an automatic additional three-year extension subject to Corsain’s review, was executed by and between Corsain and the Company. This lease was retroactive to November 12, 2003 and the monthly lease payments were $1,418.51 plus the El Salvadoran added value tax. The lease was subject to an annual increase based on the U.S. annual inflationary rate adjustments. The SCMP was strategically located to process mineralized material from other mining projects.
On March 25, 2008 a nineteen-month lease retroactive to November 12, 2006 was executed by and between Corsain and the Company. The total lease payment for this nineteen-month period was $18,608.21. Reference is made to Exhibit 10.16 of the Company’s Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, for a copy of this lease. The lease was renewed on June 12, 2008 for a six-month period to expire on December 11, 2008, with an option to subsequently renew it for additional three-month periods. The Company chose to exercise this option and renewed the lease until it was terminated in October 2009.
SCMP Mill and Plant Process Description
Current Status
The SCMP (a precious metal cyanidation carbon-in-leach system) had a capacity of processing up to 200 tons of virgin mineralized material per day. The following units of operation were required: crushing, grinding, thickening, agitated leaching and recovery of precious metals via a carbon-in-leach (CIL) system. The Company had planned to overhaul the SCMP to give it a production capacity of up to 500 tons per day.
On or about September 13, 2006, the El Salvador Ministry of the Environment delivered to Commerce’s El Salvadoran legal counsel its revocation of the environmental permits issued for the SSGM and SCMP. This Company’s legal counsel on December 6, 2006, filed with the El Salvadoran Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice two complaints relating to this matter. (See the Company’s discussion in the section entitled “Environmental Matters.”) These legal proceedings are pending.
Because of the length of time that the permit status of the SCMP has gone unresolved, the Company terminated its lease in October 2009, liquidated its equipment and is now in the process of liquidating its inventory.
Environmental Matters
Reference is made to San Sebastian Gold Mine “Environmental Matters.” The same information applies. On March 15, 2006, the Office of the El Salvadoran Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) issued an environmental permit (Resolution 3026-003-2006) relative to the Renewed SSGM Exploitation Concession and the San Cristobal Mill and Plant. On or about September 13, 2006, MARN revoked both permits. For more details, reference is made to “Environmental Matters” and to Item 3.
