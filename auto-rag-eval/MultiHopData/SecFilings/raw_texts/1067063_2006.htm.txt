ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
PROPERTY LIST
As of December 31, 2006, the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Properties consisted of 251 in-service office, office/flex and industrial/warehouse properties, as well as two stand-alone retail properties and two land leases. The Consolidated Properties are located primarily in the Northeast. The Consolidated Properties are easily accessible from major thoroughfares and are in close proximity to numerous amenities. The Consolidated Properties contain a total of approximately 28.9 million square feet, with the individual properties ranging from 6,216 to 1,246,283 square feet. The Consolidated Properties, managed by on-site employees, generally have attractively landscaped sites and atriums in addition to quality design and construction. The Operating Partnership’s tenants include many service sector employers, including a large number of professional firms and national and international businesses. The Operating Partnership believes that all of its properties are well-maintained and do not require significant capital improvements.
(a)
Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future (including, at December 31, 2006, a lease with a commencement date substantially in the future consisting of 8,590 square feet scheduled to commence in 2009), and leases expiring December 31, 2006 aggregating 103,477 square feet (representing 0.4 percent of the Operating Partnership’s total net rentable square footage) for which no new leases were signed.
(b)
Total base rent for 2006, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Substantially all of the leases provide for annual base rents plus recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant’s proportionate share of and/or increases in real estate taxes and certain operating costs, as defined, and the pass through of charges for electrical usage.
(c) Excludes space leased by the Operating Partnership.
(d) Total base rent for 2006 minus total 2006 amortization of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other concessions and costs, determined in accordance with GAAP.
(e)
Base rent for 2006 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2006. For those properties acquired during 2006, amounts are annualized, as per Note g.
(f)
Effective rent for 2006 divided by net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2006. For those properties acquired during 2006, amounts are annualized, as described in Note g.
(g)
As this property was acquired by the Operating Partnership during 2006, the amounts represented in 2006 base rent and 2006 effective rent reflect only that portion of the year during which the Operating Partnership owned the property. Accordingly, these amounts may not be indicative of the property’s full year results. For comparison purposes, the amounts represented in 2006 average base rent per sq. ft. and 2006 average effective rent per sq. ft. for this property have been calculated by taking 2006 base rent and 2006 effective rent for such property and annualizing these partial-year results, dividing such annualized amounts by the net rentable square feet leased at December 31, 2006. These annualized per square foot amounts may not be indicative of the property’s results had the Operating Partnership owned the property for the entirety of 2006.
