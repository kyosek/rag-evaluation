ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not own or operate the properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, except for our interest in the Peak Gold JV, and therefore much of the information disclosed in this Form 10-K regarding these properties is provided to us by the operators. For example, the operators of the various properties provide us information regarding metals production, estimates of mineral reserves and additional mineralized material and production estimates. A list of our producing and development stage streams and royalties, as well their respective reserves, are summarized below in Table 1 within this Item 2. More information is available to the public regarding certain properties in which we have stream or royalty interests, including reports filed with the SEC or with the Canadian securities regulatory agencies available at www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com, respectively.
The Company manages its business under two reportable segments, consisting of the acquisition and management of stream interests and the acquisition and management of royalty interests. The description of our principal streams and royalties set forth below includes the location, operator, stream or royalty rate, access and any material current developments at the property. For any reported production amounts discussed below, the Company considers reported production to relate to the amount of metal sales subject to our stream and royalty interests. Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on production estimates, historical production and revenue for our principal properties. The map below illustrates the location of our principal producing stage properties.
Principal Producing Properties
The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which stream and royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business. Estimated future potential revenues from producing properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such stream and royalty interests are no longer principal to our business.
			
		
			
		
Currently, the Company considers the properties discussed below (listed alphabetically by stream and royalty interest) to be principal to our business.
Stream Interests
Andacollo (Region IV, Chile)
RGLD Gold AG (“RGLD Gold”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns the right to purchase 100% of the gold produced from the Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered, 50% thereafter. The cash purchase price equals 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 142,000 ounces of payable gold have been delivered to RGLD Gold.
Andacollo is an open-pit mine and milling operation located in central Chile, Region IV in the Coquimbo Province and is operated by Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (“CMCA”), a 90% owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”). The Andacollo mine is located in the foothills of the Andes Mountains approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the town of Andacollo. The regional capital of La Serena and the coastal city of Coquimbo are approximately 34 miles northwest of the Andacollo mine by road, and Santiago is approximately 215 miles south by air. Access to the mine is provided by Route 43 (R-43) south from La Serena to El Peñon. From El Peñon, D-51 is followed east and eventually curves to the south to Andacollo. Both R-43 and D-51 are paved roads.
Stream deliveries from Andacollo were approximately 51,700 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 47,900 ounces for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Teck indicated that they expect gradually declining grades to be offset largely by planned throughput improvements in the mill. The current life of mine
			
		
			
		
for Andacollo is expected to continue until 2036. Additional permitting or amendments to existing permits will be required to execute the life of mine plan.
Mount Milligan (British Columbia, Canada)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 35% of the payable gold and 18.75% of the payable copper produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold project in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by an indirect subsidiary of Centerra Gold Inc. (“Centerra”). The cash purchase price for gold is equal to the lesser of $435 per ounce, with no inflation adjustment, or the prevailing market price when purchased. The cash purchase price for copper is 15% of the spot price.
The Mount Milligan project is an open-pit mine and is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, approximately 96 miles northwest of Prince George, 53 miles north of Fort St. James, and 59 miles west of Mackenzie. The Mount Milligan project is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the west via Fort St. James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 482 miles from Prince Rupert and 158 miles from Prince George.
Gold stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 78,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 96,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the gold stream rate from 52.25% to 35%. RGLD Gold began receiving gold deliveries reflecting the lower stream percentage in April 2017.
Copper stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 10.35 million pounds of copper during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 2.57 million pounds during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Copper stream deliveries began during our June 2017 quarter. The decrease was also partially a result of the mill processing operations at the mine being temporarily suspended for 39 days beginning on December 27, 2017, due to insufficient water. For the June 2018 quarter, mill throughput 47,000 tonnes per calendar day, compared to 52,000 tonnes per calendar day during the June 2017 quarter.
On December 27, 2017, Centerra temporarily suspended mill operations at Mount Milligan due to insufficient fresh water. Centerra provided a further update on May 1, 2018 that Mount Milligan was operating at an average throughput of approximately 40,000 tonnes per day, and that once the spring snow melt is underway, throughput is expected to increase to a targeted average of 55,000 tonnes per day for the second half of the calendar year. Our fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 results were not impacted by the temporary shutdown of the mill processing facility. Due to the timing of shipments and deliveries of gold and copper, we expect the impact of the temporary shutdown to be reflected in Royal Gold’s first fiscal quarter 2019 results, as some of the deliveries of gold and copper that were expected in the June through August 2018 period have been deferred to a later date.
On August 1, 2018, Centerra reported that Mount Milligan continues to face potential limitations due to water supply, a situation exacerbated by minimal inflow from snow melt and less than expected precipitation experienced in calendar 2018. Centerra announced they filed for an amendment to their environmental assessment certificate to provide additional short-term water sources through 2020, and to initiate the development of a longer term water supply plan for subsequent years.
According to Centerra, if regulatory approvals to access water sources are not received, the Mount Milligan mill would need to operate only one ball mill to conserve water and throughput would be reduced to approximately 30,000 tonnes per day for the December 2018 quarter. In addition to these water matters, throughput in the September 2018 quarter will be reduced as a result of a recent (July 2018) 10-day unscheduled shutdown of the primary crusher for maintenance and a scheduled five-day maintenance shutdown in September 2018. Considering these factors, Centerra reduced their calendar 2018 production guidance at Mount Milligan to 175,000-195,000 payable ounces of gold and 40-47 million payable pounds of copper. If Centerra receives approval to access short-term water sources in the fourth quarter of calendar 2018, second half calendar 2018 throughput could be increased.
			
		
			
		
Pueblo Viejo (Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 7.5% of Barrick’s interest in the gold produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% thereafter. The cash purchase price for gold is 30% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price of gold per ounce delivered thereafter. RGLD Gold also owns the right to purchase 75% of Barrick’s interest in the silver produced from the Pueblo Viejo mine, subject to a minimum silver recovery of 70%, until 50 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.5% thereafter. The cash purchase price for silver is 30% of the spot price of silver per ounce delivered until 23.1 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price of silver per ounce delivered thereafter.
The Pueblo Viejo mine is located in the province of Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic, approximately 60 miles northwest of Santo Domingo, and is owned by a joint venture in which Barrick holds a 60% interest and is responsible for operations, and in which Goldcorp holds a 40% interest. Pueblo Viejo is accessed from Santo Domingo by traveling northwest on Autopista Duarte, Highway #1, approximately 48 miles to Piedra Blanca and proceeding east for approximately 14 miles on Highway #17 to the gatehouse for Pueblo Viejo. Both Highway #1 and Highway #17 are paved.
Gold stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 45,400 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 52,600 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
Silver stream deliveries were approximately 1.89 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 1.78 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
Barrick reported a decrease in production at Pueblo Viejo during the June 2018 quarter due to lower head grade resulting from the expected decline in pit ore grades for the period and delays in transitioning to higher grade ore benches in Moore Pit Phases 5 and 6. Lower throughput during the June 2018 quarter resulted from the first of two-annual planned autoclave and mill shutdowns. Barrick expects production to increase in the September 2018 quarter as Pueblo Viejo transitions to higher grades in Moore Pit Phases 5 and 6. Barrick expects September 2018 quarter throughput to remain in line with the June 2018 quarter as scheduled maintenance of the second autoclave will be completed. Barrick also anticipates higher grades at Pueblo Viejo to persist into the December 2018 quarter, with higher throughput.
Barrick is advancing prefeasibility level studies for a plant expansion at Pueblo Viejo that would increase throughput by 50% to 12 million tonnes per year, allowing the mine to maintain average annual gold production of 800,000 ounces after 2022 (on 100% basis). The project involves the addition of a pre-oxidation heap leach pad with a capacity of eight million tonnes per year, a new mill and flotation concentrator with a capacity of four million tonnes per year, and additional tailings capacity. The project has the potential to convert roughly seven million ounces of mineralized material to proven and probable reserves (on 100% basis). In support of the prefeasibility study, Barrick completed the construction of a pilot pre-oxidation heap leach pad to test metallurgy and recoveries, and is now irrigating ore. Civil works for the pilot flotation circuit have also commenced, and a tender process for structural, mechanical, and electrical contracts is now underway.
Wassa and Prestea (Western Region, Ghana)
RGLD Gold owns the right to purchase 10.50% of the gold produced from the Wassa and Prestea projects, operated by Golden Star, until an aggregate 240,000 ounces have been delivered. Once the applicable delivery threshold is met, the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5% for the remaining term of the transaction.
The Wassa mine and oxide ore mill are located near the village of Akyempim in the Wassa East District, in the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 50 miles north of Cape Coast and 93 miles west of the capital Accra. The main access to the site is from the east, via the Cape Coast to Twifo-Praso road, then over the combined road-rail bridge on the Pra River. There is also an access road from Takoradi in the south via Mpohor. An airport at Takoradi is capable of handling jet aircraft and is serviced by several commercial flights each day.
Prestea currently produces from both open pits and an underground operation producing oxide ore located in the Ashanti gold district in the central eastern section of the Western Region of Ghana, approximately 6 miles south of the town of Bogoso. Access to the property is by commercial air carrier to Accra and then by vehicle on a paved and gravel road.
			
		
			
		
Stream deliveries from Wassa and Prestea were approximately 25,900 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately 19,900 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Golden Star reported that the increase in production during the current period was primarily due to improved grade and tonnes at the Wassa underground mine. As of February 1, 2018, Wassa became an underground-only mining operation, however, stock piled ore continued to be processed throughout the current period. At Prestea, Golden Star announced production decreased during the current period primarily due to the planned reduction from the Prestea open-pits and the slower than expected ramp-up at the Prestea underground mine.
Golden Star indicated that they remain on track to achieve their consolidated calendar year 2018 production guidance, and that they expect production to be weighted to the second half of calendar 2018.
Royalty Interests
Cortez (Nevada, USA)
Cortez is a series of large open-pit and underground mines, utilizing mill and heap leach processing, which are operated by subsidiaries of Barrick. The operation is located approximately 60 air miles southwest of Elko, Nevada, in Lander County. The site is reached by driving west from Elko on Interstate 80 approximately 46 miles, and proceeding south on State Highway 306 approximately 23 miles. Our royalty interest at Cortez applies to the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits, part of the Gap pit and the Crossroads deposit.
The royalty interests we hold at Cortez include:
(a)
Reserve Claims (“GSR1”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area originally known as the “Reserve Claims,” which includes the majority of the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits. The GSR1 royalty rate is tied to the price of gold and does not include indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR1 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(b)
GAS Claims (“GSR2”). This is a sliding-scale GSR royalty for all products from an area outside of the Reserve Claims, originally known as the “GAS Claims,” which encompasses approximately 50% of the Gap deposit and all of the Crossroads deposit. The GSR2 royalty rate is tied to the gold price, without indexing for inflation or deflation. The GSR2 royalty rate is 5.0% at a gold price of $470 per ounce and higher.
(c)
Reserve and GAS Claims Fixed Royalty (“GSR3”). The GSR3 royalty is a fixed rate GSR royalty of 0.7125% and covers the same cumulative area as is covered by our two sliding-scale GSR royalties, GSR1 and GSR2, except mining claims that comprise the undeveloped Crossroads deposit.
(d)
Net Value Royalty (“NVR1”). This is a fixed 4.91% NVR (4.52% with respect to Crossroads) on production from the GAS Claims located on a portion of Cortez that excludes the Pipeline open pit.
We also own three other royalties in the Cortez area where there is currently no production and no reserves attributed to these royalty interests.
Production attributable to our royalty interest at Cortez increased approximately 21% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Waste stripping at Crossroads, which is subject to our NVR1 (Crossroads) and GSR2 royalty interests is currently ongoing. Production from Crossroads, which contains 3.2 million ounces of gold, is expected to begin in late calendar 2018.
Peñasquito (Zacatecas, Mexico)
We own a production payment equivalent to a 2.0% NSR royalty on all metal production from the Peñasquito open-pit mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, and operated by a subsidiary of Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”). The
			
		
			
		
Peñasquito project is located approximately 17 miles west of the town of Concepción del Oro, Zacatecas, Mexico. The project, composed of two main deposits called Peñasco and Chile Colorado, hosts large gold, silver, zinc and lead reserves. The deposits contain both oxide and sulfide material, resulting in heap leach and mill processing. There are two access routes to the site. The first is via a turnoff from Highway 54 onto the State La Pardita road, then onto the Mazapil to Cedros State road. The second access is via the Salaverna by-pass road from Highway 54 approximately 16 miles south of Concepción del Oro. There is a private airport on site and commercial airports in the cities of Saltillo, Zacatecas and Monterrey.
Gold production attributable to our royalty interest at Peñasquito decreased approximately 32% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 , as a result of Goldcorp’s planned transition from the higher-grade area of the Peñasco pit to lower grade ore and stockpiled material during the current period. Zinc production attributable to our royalty interest increased approximately 10% when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, while silver and lead production were in line with the prior year.
Goldcorp indicated that gold production during the current period was lower as a result of the planned transition from high-grade ore in Phase 5D at the bottom of the Peñasco pit, to lower grade ore from stockpiles and the remnants of Phase 5D. Production in Phase 5D was completed during the June 2018 quarter, and equipment was refocused on accelerating stripping activities in Phase 6D and in the Chile Colorado pit.
Goldcorp reported the Peñasquito Pyrite Leach project (“PLP”) completed construction with commissioning further accelerated to the September 2018 quarter, and that the first gold is expected in the December 2018 quarter, two quarters ahead of schedule. Goldcorp further reported at the end of the June 2018 quarter that pre-commissioning activities were 45% complete, and water testing was ongoing on an area and systems basis. During the June 2018 quarter, construction of the Carbon Pre-flotation component of the PLP was completed. This will allow Peñasquito to process ore previously considered uneconomic, including significant amounts already in stockpiles.
With the commissioning schedule of the PLP accelerated into the September 2018 quarter, Goldcorp modified the production plan for the September 2018 quarter with lower than planned mill throughput and low mill head grades, exclusively from the surface stockpile, to accommodate the commissioning of a new major circuit, which is the preferred material to be processing during the commissioning phase where lower recoveries are expected. A resequencing to higher grades and mill tonnage in the December 2018 quarter, subsequent to the commissioning, is expected to allow the mine to meet its full year gold production objectives. Mining activities will transition to the newly developed Chile Colorado pit in late calendar 2018 and into the higher-grade ore in Phase 6D in calendar 2019 in the Peñasco pit.

No gold price was reported for Balcooma, Jaguar Nickel or Kutcho Creek.
3.
Set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Reserve” is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. “Proven (Measured) Reserves” are reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling, and
			
		
			
		
(b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size, shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established. “Probable (Indicated) Reserves” are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance of probable (indicated) reserves, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation.
4.
Royal Gold has disclosed a number of reserve estimates that are provided by operators that are foreign issuers and are not based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definitions for proven and probable reserves. For Canadian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions of these terms as of the effective date of estimation as required by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. For Australian issuers, definitions of "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve," and "probable mineral reserve" conform with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia, as amended ("JORC Code"). Royal Gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
5.
The reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to Royal Gold or which is derived from recent publicly available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code reports filed by operators. Accordingly, Royal Gold is not able to reconcile the reserve estimates prepared in reliance on National Instrument 43-101 or JORC Code with definitions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
