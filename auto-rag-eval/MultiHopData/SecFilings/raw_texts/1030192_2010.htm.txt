NEW JERSEY MINE
Location
The New Jersey mine is an underground mine and mill complex located four kilometers east of Kellogg, Idaho, in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. The property includes the gold bearing Coleman vein system, a base metal Sullivan-type prospect known as the Enterprise, and another gold prospect called the Scotch Thistle. The mine is adjacent to U.S. Interstate 90 and is easily accessed by local roads throughout the entire year. Three phase electrical power is supplied to the New Jersey mill by Avista Utilities. The area is underlain by argillites and quartzites of the Prichard Formation [member of Belt Supergroup] which commonly hosts gold mineralization.
Mineral Property
The Company owns 62 acres of patented mining claims, mineral rights to 108 acres of fee land, and approximately 130 acres of unpatented mining claims. The unpatented claims are on federal land administered by the BLM. The Coleman pit and the current underground workings are located on the patented mining claims wholly owned by the Company.
Mineral Leases
A mineral lease from William Zanetti in the New Jersey mill area contains about 60 acres. The lease provides for the Company's exploration, development and mining of minerals on fee land through October 2008 and thereafter as long as mining operations are deemed continuous. The lessor may terminate the lease upon the Company's failure to perform under the terms of the lease. The land covered by this lease was purchased and the lease was terminated in January of 2011. Please see Note 13 to Financial Statements, Subsequent Events.
A second mineral lease, known as the Grenfel lease, with Mine Systems Design, Inc. (MSD) covers the mineral rights to 68 acres located north of the New Jersey mine area. The lease has a fifteen year term and thereafter so long as mining operations are deemed continuous. The lessor may terminate the lease upon the Company's failure to perform under the terms of the lease. A 3% net smelter return (NSR) royalty will be paid to the lessor if production is achieved. However, the NSR royalty shall not exceed 10% of the net proceeds, except the NSR royalty shall not be less than 1%. No advance royalties or other advance payments are required by this lease.
History
There are at least 14 gold prospects in or near the New Jersey mine area. In the late 1800’s and early 1900’s more than 2,500 feet of development workings including drifts, crosscuts, shafts, and raises, were driven by the New Jersey Mining and Milling Company (an unrelated company) to develop the Coleman vein and the northwest branch of the Coleman vein. A 10 stamp gravity mill was built and operated for a short period.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
A 100 tonne per day flotation mill has been built and commissioned on the New Jersey mine property. A six foot by six foot ball mill is used to grind crushed ore. The crushing plant and grinding circuit were built in 1996, and the flotation circuit was built in 2004. Construction of a Concentrate Leach Plant “CLP” was started in mid-2006, and was completed in November of 2007. The CLP plant uses cyanidation and direct electro-winning to produce a gold-silver dore’ from gold-bearing pyrite concentrates. Based on leach cycles for the Golden Chest pyrite concentrate, the capacity of the leach plant is about 10 tonnes per day.
Since 2001, the Company has drilled 14 holes for a total of 1,765 meters to explore the Coleman vein and associated zones of gold mineralization. The drilling confirmed the continuity of the Coleman vein system and discovered a broad zone of low grade (0.70 gpt gold) gold mineralization known as the Grenfel zone. Ore reserves on the Coleman vein were not increased as the drilling was too widely spaced to meet the criteria for a reserve calculation. The best intercept was in DDH02-02 which assayed 2.76 gpt gold over 12.5 meters including 2.5 meters of 6.80 gpt gold. In 2008, about 400 meters of drilling was completed at the Scotch Thistle gold prospect revealing areas of silica enrichment and alteration, but no economic intervals of gold mineralization.
In 2008, the Company completed an underground exploration program of drifting on the Coleman vein on the 740 level. A total of 84 meters of drifting were completed with 20 meters of that on the vein before it was displaced by a fault. No exploration or development work was completed by the Company in 2009. In 2010, a raise was driven upward on the 740 level to explore a narrow high-grade vein that crosscut the main Coleman vein at nearly a right angle. This raise was driven about 12 meters vertically and produced 367 dry tonnes for the New Jersey mill that assayed 2.68 gpt gold.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a capital cost of $1,143,511 associated with the mineral processing plant and a capitalized development plus investment cost of $604,792 associated with the mine.
Exploration Plans
There are currently no plans for exploration or mining at the New Jersey mine property.
Geology and Reserves
The description of the geology of the New Jersey mine and the calculation of mineral resources have been completed by the Company. The description of the geology of the area can be verified from third party published reports by the U.S. Geological Survey and unpublished reports by Oscar Hershey, former Coeur d'Alene District geologist. The Company is solely responsible for the reserve calculations.
Geology
The Prichard Formation, which is 25,000 feet in thickness, underlies the New Jersey mine area which is adjacent to and north of the major Osburn fault. The Prichard Formation is divided into nine rock units of alternating argillites, siltites, and quartzites, and the units exposed in the New Jersey mine area appear to belong to the lower members. Gold mineralization is associated with sulfide-bearing quartz veins which cut the bedding in Prichard argillite and quartzite. Associated sulfides are pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, low-silver tennatite, galena, and sphalerite.
Reserves
The reserves at the New Jersey mine, as of this date, are those contained in an underground mine plan. The designed stope block extends from the surface to the Keyhole Tunnel level. Grade estimation for the block is based upon calculated head grades from production from the Coleman vein over the past two years.

The reserve tonnage is diluted. That is, the expected dilution from underground mining is accounted for in the grade and tonnage of the reserve block. The ounces stated in the above table are contained ounces. The cutoff grade used was 1.5 grams/tonne gold. The cutoff grade is based on historical costs of underground mining on the Coleman vein with a flotation processing plant recovering 85% of the gold. Gold prices used are based upon a three year average or $32.89/gram ($1,022.95/troy ounce). Proven and probable reserves are combined as they cannot be readily separated.
SILVER STRAND MINE
Location
The Silver Strand mine is an underground mine located in Kootenai County, Idaho, about 20 kilometers east-northeast of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. It is situated on Lone Cabin Creek, a tributary of Burnt Cabin Creek and of the Little North Fork Coeur d'Alene River. Primary access is from Coeur d'Alene via paved and dirt roads from Fernan Lake to Lone Cabin Creek.
Mineral Property
The Company's Silver Strand mine consists of fifteen unpatented lode claims wholly owned by the Company. The claims are on public lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The claims were acquired from Trend Mining Company pursuant to a purchase agreement dated July 14, 2000. Mine Systems Design, Inc. assumed Trend’s royalty on the Silver Strand claims in July 2001. The royalty is a 1.5% NSR capped at $50,000 after which the NSR royalty decreases to 0.5% .
History
The Silver Strand deposit was discovered during nearby logging activity during the 1960's and mined during the 1970's and 1980's for siliceous smelter flux. Production was 13,752 tons grading 0.093 ounces per ton gold (3.19 gpt), 9.6 ounces per ton silver (329 gpt) and 87.1% silica. The mining operation was shut down when the ASARCO Tacoma smelter closed in the early 1980's. Previous owner/operators include Silver Strand Mining Company, Silver Trend Mining Company, and Trend Mining Company. Mine Systems Design, Inc. (MSD) had an exploration agreement with Silver Trend Mining Company that was terminated in 1997. During the term of that lease, MSD made an agreement with U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM), Spokane Research Center to conduct a mining research project at the Silver Strand mine. The USBM monitored water quality and flows from the mine, maintained the underground openings, and conducted some diamond drilling.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
During 2002, the Company completed an exploration drilling program which was successful in extending the ore shoot below the No. 3 Level. Given the successful drilling results, the Company initiated the environmental permitting process for a 1,000 tonne per month seasonal, underground mining operation. In April 2003, the Company submitted a POO to the USFS. In June 2005, the USFS affirmed their original Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the Company’s POO after an environmental group appealed their earlier decision. In August 2006, both the USFS and the Company signed the final operating plan or Decision Notice.
In May of 2007, the Company posted a reclamation bond of $119,725 in order to begin work at the Silver Strand. Work completed at the Silver Strand in 2008 included the completion of the new No. 3 portal. In 2009 no work was completed except for required environmental monitoring. In 2010, the Company started mining operations at the Silver Strand, but mining was suspended after poor metallurgical recoveries were experienced leaching the concentrate in the concentrate leach plant. The concentrate leaching problem was later resolved by laboratory testwork. A total of 112 tonnes were processed at the mill. No surface infrastructure presently exists at the Silver Strand. There is no energy available at the site, and electrical energy requirements are satisfied with an on-site generator.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a capitalized development plus investment cost of $152,576 associated with the Silver Strand mine.
Exploration and Development Plans
The Company plans to sell its interest in the Silver Strand mine and focus its efforts on the Golden Chest mine.
Geology and Reserves
Company geologists have completed the description of the geology of the Silver Strand mine. Reserve calculations were completed by the Company’s geologists and engineers. Verification of the area’s geology can be found from third party published reports by Alfred L. Anderson of the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology (Pamphlet 53).
Geology
The upper part of the Revett Formation outcrops at the mine. The upper Revett member contains alternating sequences of quartzite and siltite-argillite. Beds dip shallowly to moderately to the north (30 to 50 degrees). Alfred L. Anderson of the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology mapped the geology and discussed the mineral resources of Kootenai County in 1940 (Pamphlet 53). There are no large intrusive rock bodies near the Silver Strand mine except for a diabase dike which has intruded the Silver Strand mineralized zone. The Burnt Cabin fault is the major geologic structure near the Silver Strand mine.
The Silver Strand orebody consists of a nearly-vertical, silicified (quartz) replacement zone which cuts the flat to moderately dipping Revett beds. The zone is not a fissure-filling vein. The boundaries and shape of the silicified zone were determined to some extent by a 1997 diamond drilling program completed by a previous operator. The sulfide ore mined to date appears to be enclosed within the quartz zone. The ore is black and very fine-grained. Sulfide minerals are not easy to identify because of the fine-grained texture. Minerals observed by microscopic study during metallurgical tests include: pyrite, tetrahedrite, tennantite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite and stibnite.
Reserves
Ore grades and dimensions of the reserve blocks are based on chip sampling of the vein underground and diamond drilling. Reserves were calculated using a gold equivalent cutoff grade of 5 grams per tonne gold and a minimum mining width of 1.5 meters. The cutoff grade is based on historical and estimated costs of a 1,000 tonne/month underground mining operation, hauling ore to the Company’s mineral processing plant about 40 miles distant, and processing with flotation and recovering 75% of the silver and gold. Silver and gold prices used are based upon a three year average or $0.53/gram ($16.62/troy ounce) and $32.89/gram ($1,022.95/troy ounce), respectively.
The reserve tonnages are diluted. That is, the expected dilution from underground mining is accounted for in the grade and tonnage of the reserve blocks. Proven and probable reserves are combined as they cannot be readily separated.
GOLDEN CHEST
Location
The Golden Chest mine is an underground mine located in Reeder Gulch about 2.4 kilometers east of Murray, Idaho along Forest Highway 9. The property consists of 24 patented mining claims and 21 unpatented claims covering approximately 560 acres. The site is accessible by an improved dirt road. A 30 ft by 20 ft steel-clad pole building is present near the ramp portal and is used as a shop and a dry. Single phase electrical power supplied by Avista Utilities has been installed to the portal site in Reeder Gulch.
Property Ownership
Prior to December 2010 the Company held two mining leases for the Golden Chest
On January 3, 2005, the Company signed a mining lease on the Golden Chest with Metaline Contact Mines (MTLI) and J.W. Beasley Interests, LLC (JWBI) that covers about 270 acres. The Company completed a pre-feasibility study on an open pit resource drilled by Newmont Exploration Limited and issued 50,000 shares of its restricted common stock to both MTLI and JWBI to exercise the mining lease. The term of the lease is fifteen years and as long thereafter as Leased Substances are mined, processed or marketed from the property. A NSR royalty of 3% is payable to the Lessors. An additional NSR royalty up to a maximum 3% is payable based on a sliding scale of increasing gold prices adjusted by the CPI using June 2003 (CPI=183.7) as the base.
Additionally, the Company will issue 50,000 shares of restricted common stock for each increment of 10,000 troy ounces of gold production. Production to date under the Mining Lease Agreement has been 1,471 ounces of gold.
On January 3, 2005, the Company signed a mining lease with Prichard Creek Resource Partners, LLC that covers about 41 acres of unpatented lode claims. Upon exercising the lease the Company issued 30,000 shares of restricted common stock to Prichard Creek Resource Partners. The term of the lease is fifteen years and as long thereafter as Leased Substances are mined, processed or marketed from the Leased Premises. A NSR royalty of 3% is payable to the Lessors. An additional NSR royalty is based on the same sliding scale, presented in the table above, is also payable to Prichard Creek Resource Partners. Finally, if commercial production is commenced from these claims a one-time payment of 30,000 shares of the Company’s common stock is payable to Prichard Creek Resource Partners.
As of December 2010 the Golden Chest is owned by Golden Chest LLC (GC) which is owned 50% by the Company (NJMC) and 50% by Marathon Gold Corporation through its wholly owned US subsidiary Marathon Gold USA Corp. (MUSA). GC purchased the mine from the lease holders for $3,750,000 and paid $500,000 on the closing date of December 16, 2010, and has agreed to pay the sellers $500,000 each year for the next six years and a final payment of $250,000 on the seventh anniversary. The sellers have a first mortgage on the mine as security for future payment owing.
In order to form Golden Chest LLC in December 2010, NJMC contributed to GC certain mining claims it owned, all geological data and certain mining equipment. Also in consideration for its interest in GC, NJMC terminated, for the benefit of GC, two operating leases it held on the mine. MUSA has contributed $1,000,000 cash and has agreed to contribute i) $500,000 by March 31, 2011, ii) $500,000 by June 30, 2011, iii) $1,000,000 by September 30, 2011 and vi) $1,000,000 by November 30, 2011 for a total cash contribution of $4 million. If MUSA does not make all of the $4M payments to GC, its 50% ownership interest will be reduced proportionally. MUSA has the right to contribute an additional $3.5 million by November 30, 2012 to take its ownership interest to 60% of GC. MUSA also has the option to accelerate any of these contributions.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
The Company started work on the property in 2004. A ramp 440 meters in length connecting the surface to the historic No. 3 level, known as the North Ramp, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company has constructed a development rock storage site, a shop building, improved the access road, and installed electrical power to the site.
For each year from 2004 through 2008, the Company completed an exploration core drilling program on the Golden Chest property. A total of 3,415 meters of core drilling has been completed from the surface. The majority of these holes were targeted at extending the Idaho vein below the No. 3 and were successful. In June of 2010, the Company drilled a shallow core hole in the Katie-Dora area and intercepted a narrow, high-grade vein in the hanging wall of the Idaho fault. The intercept assayed 865 gpt over 0.27 meters. An exploration drift and raise were mined from the ramp to the projection of this drill intercept. Difficult ground conditions including caving and wet ground made it unsafe to continue the raise to the intercept, and mining activity was suspended in September.
The Company completed studies in 2007 on a potentially open pitable resource drilled by Newmont in the 1980’s. Handbook and scaled costs were used in conjunction with current gold prices and three-year average prices. It was concluded that the open pit resource would not be feasible as a stand-alone project and does not meet the SEC Guide 7 requirements for reserves.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a capitalized development plus investment cost of $553,205 associated with the Golden Chest mine.
Exploration and Development Plans
The exploration and development plan for the Golden Chest will consist of both surface and underground core drilling as well as underground development. About 7,200 meters of surface drilling and 3,600 meters of underground drilling are planned for 2011. Underground rehabilitation of the No. 3 is also planned to provide drill rig access to the northern part of the mine. The goals of the drilling program will be to increase the density of drilling on the surface for a Canadian NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate and also to extend the mineralization down dip. An underground mapping and sampling program will also be undertaken.
Geology and Reserves
Company geologists have completed the description of the geology of the Golden Chest mine. Reserve calculations were completed by the Company’s geologist and engineer. Verification of the area’s geology can be found from third party published reports by Philip J. Shenon (Idaho Bureau of Mines Pamphlet No. 47) and unpublished reports by Newmont Mining Corporation.
Geology
Gold mineralization occurs in veins associated with a thrust fault that has exploited the top of a quartzite unit on the east limb of a north-trending synclinal fold. The mineralization occurs in two types of quartz veins which are generally conformable to bedding of the Prichard Formation of Proterozoic age. Thin banded veins, occurring in argillite, contain visible gold, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. Thicker, massive veins occur in quartzite and contain pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, scheelite and rare visible gold. Gold mineralization is of Mesozoic age and related to granitic intrusive rocks.
Reserves
Ore grades and dimensions of the reserve block are based on ten diamond drillholes through the Idaho vein with an average spacing of 40 meters and 30 drift samples. Reserves were calculated by the Company’s geologist and chief mine engineer using a polygonal method with a cutoff grade of 2.0 gpt gold, and a minimum mining width of 2 meters.
The reserves were calculated using estimated costs and operating parameters of a 100 tonne-per-day underground mining and mineral processing operation. The estimated costs are based on the Company’s actual costs of mining and processing ore from the Golden Chest. Overall metallurgical recovery of gold is expected to be 92% based on the Company’s experience at the New Jersey mill and CLP. Gold prices used are based upon a three year average or $32.89/gram ($1,022.95/troy ounce).

NIAGARA PROJECT
Location
The Niagara copper-silver deposit is located near the forks of Eagle Creek about seven kilometers northwest of the Company's Golden Chest operation. The property is without known ore reserves, and consists of 39 unpatented claims that cover about 775 acres. Access to the site is maintained through the use of a USFS road which is closed to the general public. No electrical energy is present at the site.
Mineral Agreement
The Company signed an exploration agreement with Revett Metals Associates (“RMA”) in December 2006. The exploration agreement has a term of five years, beginning on December 2, 2006, and is for nine unpatented claims that cover the deposit. In addition, the exploration agreement covers an area of mutual interest within ½ mile of the property excluding properties which are valued primarily for their gold mineralization. Upon signing the agreement, the Company issued 30,000 shares of restricted common stock to RMA and paid $4,500. At each anniversary of the signing, the Company has agreed to pay $3,000 and issue 30,000 shares of restricted common stock to RMA. Any time prior to the expiration of the exploration agreement, the Company can exercise an option to convert the exploration agreement to a mining agreement. If exercised, the mining agreement would have a term of 25 years, and the Company would pay a NSR royalty to RMA of 3.0% on ores or concentrates mined on the property. The Company is granted the option to purchase 90% of the NSR royalty from RMA for $2,500,000 which would leave a remaining royalty of 0.3% .
As part of the terms of the Company’s Toboggan Exploration Joint Venture agreement with Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont retains an option to include the Niagara property into the Toboggan Project which is exercisable starting March 20, 2009 and extending for two years. If Newmont elects to include the Niagara property, it would be required to spend at least another $1,000,000 or twice what NJMC spends on exploration of the Niagara, whichever is greater, to earn its 51% interest.
History
An exploration program completed by Earth Resources Company on the Niagara property in the 1970's identified a large volume of copper-silver mineralization within the Revett formation. Their exploration program included eight drill holes and six trenches on the outcrop of the mineralized strata. Earth Resources also completed metallurgical testwork that indicated conventional flotation will achieve recoveries of 94% for copper and 90% for silver. Earth Resources also completed preliminary economic studies on the deposit. Kennecott owned the claims that cover the Niagara deposit for a period of time after Earth Resources. RMA re-staked the property in 2004 after Kennecott dropped the claims.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
During 2008, the Company completed five holes of core drilling for a total of 1,062 meters at the Niagara project. Three of the holes were targeted to intercept the copper-silver deposit in the Revett formation and were successful. The drilling increased the area of copper-silver mineralization of the Niagara deposit. As an example, drillhole 08-9 drilled through 19.4 meters grading 0.51% copper, 25 gpt silver and 0.029 gpt gold. A preliminary engineering study assessing the economic potential of open pit mining at the Niagara was completed. Two holes for a cumulative total of 413 meters were drilled in the hanging wall of the Murray Peak fault in the Prichard formation to investigate a gold-in-soil anomaly and magnetic high. Low level, anomalous gold and tellurium mineralization were found by this drilling.
Also during 2008, the Company staked claims over an area of gold-telluride mineralization near the Niagara deposit and known as the Progress prospect. Soil sampling indicates a gold anomaly 80 meters wide and 350 meters long. A series of old prospect trenches and adits were found and sampled. No work was completed at the Niagara in 2010.
Exploration and Development Plans
The Company has submitted a POO to the USFS for a core drilling program at the Progress gold prospect. The POO is scheduled for approval by the USFS in May of 2011, but the timing of the drilling will be dependent on the Company’s ability to raise funds.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company had an investment cost of $52,500 associated with the Niagara project.
Geology
The Niagara deposit occurs in a section of mineralized upper Revett Formation near the axis of a north-south striking syncline. The western limb of the syncline has been truncated by the north-south striking Murray Peak fault, a steep, west dipping reverse fault. Other faults offset the mineralized zone slightly. In the Niagara deposit, the mineralization occurs in the upper Revett Formation, which here is a light gray, massive quartzite with thin siltite interbeds. The mineralized horizon crops out along the East Fork Eagle Creek and is approximately 30 meters below the contact with the overlying St. Regis Formation. Copper minerals include bornite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, native copper, and some copper oxide minerals. Silver minerals include stomeyerite and jalpaite. Pyrite and galena also occur in trace amounts
TOBOGGAN PROJECT
Location
The Toboggan project is an exploration property without known ore reserves. The Toboggan project is a joint venture with Newmont North American Exploration Limited, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM), exploring for gold deposits within a 38 square mile area north of Murray, Idaho. The project consists of 414 unpatented lode claims covering an area of approximately 8,000 acres in and near the East Fork of Eagle Creek drainage. The Toboggan project consists of the following prospects: Gold Butte, Mineral Ridge, Golden Reward, Progress South, and Independence. The claims can be accessed from May through November using a USFS dirt road. No electrical energy is available at the site.
Mineral Agreement
On March 25, 2008, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement with Newmont North American Exploration Limited, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) under which the parties created a joint venture, the Toboggan Project, to explore for gold deposits within a 38 square mile area north of Murray, Idaho. Under the terms of the agreement, Newmont can earn a 51% interest in the joint venture by spending $2,000,000 over three years. Newmont can increase its interest to 70% by spending an additional $10,000,000 or completing a feasibility study in the years four through seven, whichever comes first.
As part of the terms of the agreement, Newmont retains an option to include the Niagara property into the Toboggan Project which is exercisable starting March 21, 2009, and extends for two years. If Newmont elects to include the Niagara property, it would be required to spend at least another $1,000,000 or twice what NJMC spends on exploration of the Niagara, whichever is greater, to earn its 51% interest.
History
Historic workings are present at the Gold Butte prospect and consist of seven adits connected by a system of narrow roads. Most of the underground work appears to have been completed by 1941. Two holes were drilled on the Gold Butte prospect in the 1980’s. Prior geophysical exploration work by Cominco-American in the Toboggan Creek area in the mid 1980’s found a large CSAMT geophysical anomaly, roughly two square kilometers in area. In 1987, Cominco American drilled a hole 500 meters in depth that was located on the eastern edge of the anomaly. It appears that the hole was located too far to the east, and that it was not drilled deep enough to investigate the large geophysical anomaly. Nord-Pacific completed a gold exploration program in the Mineral Ridge area including a soil sampling program and a reverse-circulation drilling program in 1992. Nord-Pacific identified several anomalous gold zones with their soil sampling and completed nine holes totaling 850 meters in their drilling program. All of the drillholes intercepted anomalous gold mineralization including a 1.5 meter intercept of 18.9 gpt gold. Historic workings at the Mineral Ridge prospect, which were completed before Nord-Pacific’s work, include six adits as well as numerous pits and trenches. The Independence area was originally staked in 1906 and was active intermittently through the 1900’s. Work completed included four adits, and numerous pits and trenches.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
During 2008, Newmont completed a comprehensive early-stage exploration program. Work completed included the staking of additional claims significantly increasing the area of the joint venture, soil sampling, rock sampling, geologic mapping, a ground-based geophysical survey at the Gold Butte, and an airborne geophysical survey over the entire joint venture area. During 2009, Newmont completed a core drilling program that consisted of six holes for a total of 1,359 meters. Two holes were drilled at each of the following prospects: Mineral Ridge, Golden Reward and Gold Butte. The best gold intercept drilled was at the Gold Butte where a pyritic quartz vein was found at 24.0 meters below the surface that assayed 2.5 gpt gold over 4.0 meters including a higher grade section that assayed 7.15 gpt gold over 1.0 meter. Thick intercepts of anomalous, but low-grade gold mineralization were drilled at the Mineral Ridge and the Golden Reward prospects. Newmont also completed geologic mapping, surface rock sampling, soil sampling, and additional claim staking. During 2010, Newmont completed both core and reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at the Toboggan project. A total of eight core holes totaling 914.2 meters and seven RC holes totaling 941 meters were drilled. Six of the core holes were drilled at Gold Butte and intercepted a fault with anomalous gold mineralization. The remaining two core holes were drilled at Mineral Ridge and both holes were terminated before hitting the target due to difficult ground conditions. The seven RC holes were drilled at various prospects near Toboggan Creek and RC-7 was the most promising with 100 meters of 100 ppb gold at the Golden Reward prospect. Unfortunately, Newmont was unable to obtain the required USFS permit to drill their highest priority targets.
Exploration and Development Plans
The exploration plan for the Toboggan project is unknown at this time.
Geology
Gold mineralization tends to occur in structurally controlled zones within the Prichard Formation which are associated with large potential feeder structures such as the Murray Peak fault, the Bloom Peak fault, and the Niagara fault. The gold mineralization can occur either as discrete, high-grade quartz veins or within wide zones of brecciation. Geochemical analysis of soils and rocks has led to the discovery of very high levels of tellurium associated with zones of higher grade gold mineralization. Electron microprobe analysis has shown the presence of gold-silver electrum and the telluride mineral petzite. The presence of telluride minerals along with the presence of alkaline intrusive rocks and areas of potassic alteration has led the Company to believe the gold mineralization is associated with a deeply buried alkaline intrusion. Alkaline rocks are a type of igneous intrusive rock characterized by high potassium and sodium and frequently associated with gold mineralization.
GIANT LEDGE
The Giant Ledge prospect is an exploration project without known ore reserves. It lies about six kilometers southeast of Murray, Idaho, in the Granite Creek drainage and is accessed by an historic road that has been washed out in areas. No electrical power is present at the site. The Company’s land position consists of 29 wholly owned unpatented lode claims covering an area of 586 acres. The property hosts polymetallic lead, copper and gold mineralization in and along the contact of an igneous intrusive.
History
The Giant Ledge prospect was active in the 1920’s when a 122 meter deep shaft was sunk and about 450 meters of drift development was completed. A flotation mill was erected and a minor amount of production was achieved. Bunker Hill Mining Company examined and mapped the mine workings in the 1950’s. Sunshine Mining Company conducted exploration at the Giant Ledge in the mid-1980’s and drilled two core holes.

NJMC was able to procure the core from Sunshine’s drilling program, and the core was re-logged and assayed. The best of the mineralization showed 4.6 meters of 0.908 gpt gold and 0.24% combined copper and lead. An extensive soil sampling program was completed in conjunction with a VLF and magnetometer survey. Results of the soil sampling show a 600 meter diameter gold anomaly and the magnetometer survey shows a magnetic low coincident with the gold anomaly. No work was completed at the Giant Ledge property in 2010.
Exploration and Development Plans
If sufficient funds are available, the Company will perform a ground-based geophysical survey utilizing induced polarization (IP).
MAC PROSPECT
The Mac prospect is an exploration project without known ore reserves. It lies about three kilometers northwest of Murray, Idaho and is accessed by USFS dirt roads. No electrical power is present at the site. The Company’s land position at the Mac Prospect consists of 32 wholly owned unpatented lode claims covering an area of 528 acres. The Mac is a gold exploration project hosted within the rocks of the Prichard formation and geochemical analysis of the gold mineralization indicates anomalous levels of tellurium similar to prospects within the Toboggan Joint Venture. Historic placer and underground mining has taken place on the property, although it is not well documented. Work completed by the Company in 2008 included claim staking, soil sampling, geologic mapping and rock sampling. No work was completed on the Mac prospect in 2010. Exploration plans are dependent on the Company’s ability to raise funds, but may include more soil sampling and geologic analysis to define core drilling targets.
COPPER CAMP
Summary
The Copper Camp is an exploration project without known ore reserves. Copper Camp lies about eight kilometers northwest of Murray, Idaho and is accessed by the Lost Creek USFS road. Electrical power is located adjacent to the site. The Company signed an exploration agreement with RMA in December of 2007 which covers nine unpatented claims with an area of about 180 acres. Terms of the agreement call for an exploration period of five years, and during or at the end of the exploration period NJMC can decide to enter a mining agreement. Upon entering a mining agreement, NJMC could exercise an option to buy 90% of the royalty interest for $2.5 million or NJMC could decide to pay the full Net Smelter Royalty of 3% on any production with annual minimum royalty requirements. Upon signing of the agreement, the Company issued 30,000 shares of restricted common stock plus $4,500. During the subsequent five-year exploration period, the required annual payments are 30,000 shares and $3,000.
The Copper Camp showing is an early-stage copper and silver exploration project, having been explored with limited drilling by previous operators which include Kennecott, Cominco, and U.S. Borax. Previous operators drilled core holes down dip from the outcrop and three holes penetrated the favorable Revett Formation beds showing low-grade copper-silver mineralization. At least three intercepts were made averaging 10 meters in thickness and grading 0.10% to 0.20% copper and 1.7 to 3.3 grams per tonne (gpt) silver. One short 0.18 meter interval at 173.2 meters of depth had structurally controlled bornite mineralization grading 4.45% copper and 84.0 gpt silver. The Company has submitted a POO to the USFS for a core drilling program at Copper Camp. Approval of the POO is expected in 2011. The timing of drilling will be dependent on the Company’s ability to secure adequate funding. An additional 13 unpatented lode claims were also staked increasing the property area to about 440 acres. No work was completed on the Copper Camp prospect in 2010.
WISCONSIN-TEDDY PROSPECT
Summary
The Wisconsin-Teddy is an exploration project without known ore reserves. The project area lies north of the New Jersey mine and is accessed by a local frontage road. Electrical power is available adjacent to the site. The Company's claims cover 83 acres. The claims are unpatented and are on public land administered by the BLM. The project is a base metal exploration project in the Prichard Formation. Several tunnels with an aggregate length of 2,000 feet were driven on the property prior to 1930. This development was related to two veins systems: a copper-gold vein and a zinc-lead-silver vein. Work completed by the Company included the opening of the Teddy underground workings, sampling on the surface and underground, and geologic mapping. Two exploration holes were drilled in the summer of 2003 and anomalous base metal mineralization was found. No exploration work has been completed since 2003 and there are no plans for additional exploration work in 2011.
SILVER BUTTON/ROUGHWATER PROSPECT
Summary
The Silver Button is an exploration project without known ore reserves, covers an area of 20 acres, and is located in the Clark Fork mining district of northern Idaho. Clark Fork is about 96 kilometers north of Kellogg, Idaho. The property was staked by the Company in 2004 and is located in the Lightning Creek drainage. Float collected from over a 100 m length of a vein subcrop on a talus slope contained silver minerals as identified by microscopic and chemical analyses. Access to the site is via foot trail and no electrical power is available at the site. Only preliminary field sampling and claim staking have taken place at the prospect. A POO for a helicopter-mobilized core-drilling program has been submitted to the USFS. Modifications to the POO were made after meeting with the USFS in June of 2005. A site visit was made with USFS personnel in 2006, but the USFS has yet to indicate if or when the POO will be approved. Exploration drilling will be dependent on the Company’s ability to raise sufficient funds and the receipt of a permit from the USFS. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had an investment cost of $25,500 associated with this property.
