Our Real Estate Loan Investments
Mortgage loan investments have been a very minor source of our revenue since our inception. As a general policy, we are not in the business of originating mortgage loans.
During 2008, we sold undivided interests in the Garden Gateway Plaza and Sparky’s Palm Self-Storage properties. In connection with these sales, we took back notes from the buyers in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.9 million. The notes are secured by the buyers’ interests in these properties.
In 2011, we purchased a note from a national bank at a discount. The debtors were two of DMHI Funds we own and a model home income fund that we manage. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $0.1 million due from the income fund that we manage.
