Item 2. Operating Properties.
General
As of December 31, 2007, our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 108 consolidated operating properties, located in nine states in the Sunbelt region of the United States. In addition, we maintain non-controlling partial interests ranging from 5% to 50% in an additional 92 properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures. These 200 properties, including consolidated and unconsolidated properties, are located in eleven states in the Sunbelt region of the United States.
For purposes of the tables included in this Item 2, “Total 2007 Operating Property Revenue from Continuing Operations” is calculated by adding Minimum rent, Minimum rent from affiliates, Percentage rent, Tenant recoveries and Other property related revenues from our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Total 2007 Operating Property Revenue in the following tables includes revenue from continuing operations and well as discontinued operations, which corresponds to the manner in which we analyze our operating results. We generally reinvest disposition proceeds into new operating communities and developments and, therefore, believe it is most useful to present continuing and discontinued operations revenues on a combined basis (see Note 5 and Note 10 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). In addition, for purposes of the tables included in this Item 2, we define “stabilized occupancy as having occurred once a property has attained 93% physical occupancy.
The following table sets forth certain summary information about our consolidated operating properties as of December 31, 2007:

For-Sale Residential
As of December 31, 2007, we had eight consolidated for-sale developments and one partially-owned development. See Note 8 - Undeveloped Land and Construction in Progress in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a list of our for-sale residential projects. As of December 31, 2007, net of the $42.1 million impairment charge recorded on our consolidated assets, we had approximately $118.2 million of capital cost (based on book value, including pre-development and land costs) invested in these eight consolidated projects. See Note 6 - For-Sale Activities and Impairment in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion.
Undeveloped Land
We own various parcels of land that are held for future developments. Land adjacent to multifamily properties typically will be considered for potential development of another phase of an existing multifamily property if we determine that the particular market can absorb additional apartment units. For expansions at office and retail properties, we own parcels both contiguous to the boundaries of the properties, which would accommodate additional office buildings, expansion of the shopping center, and outparcels which are suitable for restaurants, financial institutions, hotels, or free standing retailers.
Property Markets
The table below sets forth certain information with respect to the geographic concentration of our consolidated properties as of December 31, 2007.

Total Operating Property Revenue from Continuing Operations can be calculated by adding Minimum rent, Minimum rent from affiliates, Percentage rent, Tenant recoveries and Other property related revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
We believe that the demographic and economic trends and conditions in the markets where our operating properties are located indicate a potential for continued growth in property net operating income. Our consolidated and unconsolidated operating properties are located in a variety of distinct submarkets within Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. However, Birmingham, Alabama; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; and Austin, Dallas and Houston, Texas are our primary markets. We believe that our markets in these 11 states are characterized by stable and increasing populations and as a result of the recent economic downturn moderate employment growth. These markets should continue to provide a steady demand for multifamily, office and retail properties.
Mortgage Financing
As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.6 billion of collateralized and unsecured indebtedness outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% and a weighted average maturity of 5.8 years. Of this amount, approximately $62.1 million was collateralized mortgage financing and $1.6 billion was unsecured debt. Our mortgaged indebtedness was collateralized by four of our consolidated properties and carried a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% and a weighted average maturity of 5.5 years. The following table sets forth our collateralized and unsecured indebtedness in more detail.
Mortgage Debt and Notes Payable
(dollars in thousands)

Certain of the properties were developed in phases and separate mortgage indebtedness may encumber each of the various phases. In the listing of property names, CG has been used as an abbreviation for Colonial Grand and CV as an abbreviation for Colonial Village.
(2)
This unsecured credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, based on LIBOR plus a spread of 75 basis points. The facility also includes a competitive bid feature that allows us to convert up to $250 million under the unsecured credit facility to a fixed rate, for a fixed term not to exceed 90 days. At December 31, 2007, we had no amounts outstanding under the competitive bid feature.
(3)
Represents variable rate debt.
In addition to our consolidated debt, all of our unconsolidated joint venture properties are also subject to mortgage loans. Under these unconsolidated joint venture non-recourse mortgage loans, we could, under certain circumstances, be responsible for portions of the mortgage indebtedness in connection with certain customary non-recourse carve-out provisions, such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds, and material misrepresentations. Our pro-rata share of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 was $544.2 million. In addition, we have made certain guarantees in connection with our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures (see Note 19 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
