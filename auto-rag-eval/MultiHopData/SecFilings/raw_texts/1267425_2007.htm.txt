Item 2. Properties
The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below. The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit. Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as “Qualified Occupancy.” The Operating Partnerships and the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus. The general partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
Please refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.

Liquidity
The Fund’s primary source of funds is the proceeds of each Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions held pending investment or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has and will invest and (iii) a line of credit. All sources of liquidity are available to meet the obligations of the Fund. The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions in the long or short term from operations of the Operating Partnerships.
The Fund had entered into a line of credit financing agreement with an agent bank under which the Fund can borrow up to $40 million for up to 90 days to meet short-term cash needs required for the investment in some Operating Partnerships. Under the terms of the agreement, the Fund pledged its interest in a particular Operating Partnership in order to draw funds from the line. The repayment of any draws was anticipated to be made once the Fund has received sufficient investor proceeds. Repayments on the line were tied to specific Operating Partnerships, which were then released as collateral by the bank. The obligations under the line of credit were non-recourse to the Fund, its partners and assets, other than the interest in the particular Operating Partnerships pledged. The Fund did not have any draws outstanding on the line of credit as of March 31, 2006. The line was guaranteed by Boston Capital Holdings, L.P. and various affiliates and expired on March 26, 2006.

Results of Operations
The Fund incurs a fund management fee to the general partner and/or its affiliates in an amount equal to 0.5% of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of partnership management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The annual fund management fee incurred, net of fees received, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $1,070,407, $981,445, and $635,518, respectively. The amount is anticipated to increase in subsequent fiscal years as additional Operating Partnerships are acquired.
The Fund’s investment objectives do not include receipt of significant cash flow distributions from the Operating Partnerships in which it has invested or intends to invest. The Fund’s investments in Operating Partnerships have been and will be made principally with a view towards realization of Federal Housing Tax Credits for allocation to its partners and BAC holders.
(Series 47). As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100% and 98.8%, respectively. The series had a total of 15 properties as of March 31, 2007, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.
For the tax years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the series, in total, generated $4,160,104 and $3,060,588, respectively, in passive income tax losses that were passed through to the investors. The series also provided tax credits to the investors of $.99 for 2006 and $.54 for 2005.
As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, Investments in Operating Partnerships for Series 47 was $20,384,990 and $22,577,872, respectively. The decrease is primarily the result of the way the Fund accounts for such investments, the equity method. By using the equity method, the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership’s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
For the year ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the net loss of the series was $2,614,783, $3,107,786, and $1,514,651, respectively. The major components of the current year amount were share of losses from Operating Partnerships, partnership management fees, and interest income. It is anticipated that the net loss will begin to stabilize in future years as the Operating Partnerships become fully leased-up and stabilize operations.
(Series 48). As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100% and 97.9%, respectively. The series had a total of 11 properties as of March 31, 2007, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.

As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, Investments in Operating Partnerships for Series 48 was $13,928,846 and $15,603,290, respectively. The decrease is primarily the result of the way the Fund accounts for such investments, the equity method.

For the year ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the net loss of the series was $1,960,375, $1,966,680, and $508,620, respectively.

The series also provided tax credits to the investors of $.54 for 2006 and between $.15 and $.11 for 2005, depending on the investors’ date of admission.
As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, Investments in Operating Partnerships for Series 49 was $42,356,282 and $42,877,880, respectively. The increase was the result of the acquisition of 3 additional Operating Partnerships. The amount was also affected by the way the Fund accounts for its investments, the equity method. By using the equity method, the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership’s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
For the year ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the net loss of the series was $3,101,134, $864,117 and $141,617, respectively. The major components of the current year amount were share of losses from operating partnerships, partnership management fees, amortization and interest income. It is anticipated that the net loss for Series 49 will fluctuate in future years until the series finishes acquiring Operating Partnerships, construction is completed on the properties of the Operating Partnerships and they become fully leased-up and stabilize operations.
Columbia Blackshear Senior Residences L.P. (Columbia Blackshear Senior Residences) is a 78 unit senior development under construction in Atlanta, GA. Substantial delays have been encountered during the construction period, but it was completed in May of 2007, four to five months behind schedule. Due to these delays, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the operating general partner reached an agreement with the State Credit Agency to exchange the Operating Partnership’s reservation of 2004 tax credits for an allocation of 2005 tax credits. This agreement shifted the Operating Partnership’s reservation expiration date from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007, allowing ample time to complete construction without jeopardizing the operating Partnership’s allocation of tax credits. Lease-up is presently expected to begin 5 months behind schedule. The operating general partner continues to press the general contractor to complete work as quickly as possible, and has leasing staff preparing to commence move-ins as soon as the certificate of occupancy is issued and the building is released by the contractor. The investment general partner continues to monitor construction work and pre-leasing activity closely.
Contractual Obligations
As of March 31, 2007, the Fund has the following contractual obligations (payments due by period):
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions. A summary of significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to the financial statements. The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of Fund’s financial condition and results of operations. The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which is primarily investments in limited partnerships. The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
If the book value of the Fund’s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership and includes this reduction in equity in loss of investment of limited partnerships.
As of March 31, 2004, the Fund adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 - Revised (“FIN 46R”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” FIN 46R provides guidance on when a company should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in its financial statements and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses, the majority of the expected returns, or both.
Based on the guidance of FIN 46R, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE. However, management does not consolidate the Fund’s interests in these VIEs under FIN 46R, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary. The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheet, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
The Fund’s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The Fund’s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the local general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
