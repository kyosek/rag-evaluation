HOTEL FINANCINGS
On December 18, 2013: (i) Justice Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Operating”), entered into a loan agreement (“Mortgage Loan Agreement”) with Bank of America (“Mortgage Lender”); and (ii) Justice Mezzanine Company, a Delaware limited liability company (“Mezzanine”), entered into a mezzanine loan agreement (“Mezzanine Loan Agreement” and, together with the Mortgage Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”) with ISBI San Francisco Mezz Lender LLC (“Mezzanine Lender” and, together with Mortgage Lender, the “Lenders”). The Partnership is the sole member of Mezzanine, and Mezzanine is the sole member of Operating.
The Loan Agreements provide for a $97,000,000 Mortgage Loan and a $20,000,000 Mezzanine Loan. The proceeds of the Loan Agreements were used to fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and the pay-off of the prior mortgage.
The Mortgage Loan is secured by the Partnership’s principal asset, the Hotel. The Mortgage Loan bears an interest rate of 5.275% per annum and matures in January 2024. The term of the loan is ten years with interest only due in the first three years and principal and interest payments to be made during the remaining seven years of the loan based on a thirty-year amortization schedule. The Mortgage Loan also requires payments for impounds related to property tax, insurance and capital improvement reserves. As additional security for the Mortgage Loan, there is a limited guaranty (“Mortgage Guaranty”) executed by Portsmouth in favor of the Mortgage Lender.
The Mezzanine Loan is secured by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan. The Mezzanine Loan had an interest rate of 9.75% per annum and a maturity date of January 1, 2024. Interest only payments were due monthly. On July 31, 2019, Mezzanine refinanced the Mezzanine Loan by entering into a new mezzanine loan agreement (“New Mezzanine Loan Agreement”) with Cred Reit Holdco LLC in the amount of $20,000,000. The prior Mezzanine Loan was paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan is 7.25% and the loan matures on January 1, 2024. Interest only payments are due monthly. As a result of the refinance, Justice has generated $500,000 in annual interest expense savings. As additional security for the new mezzanine loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by the Partnership and Portsmouth in favor of Cred Reit Holdco LLC (the “Mezzanine Guaranty” and, together with the Mortgage Guaranty, the “Guaranties”).
The Guaranties are limited to what are commonly referred to as “bad boy” acts, including: (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentations; (ii) gross negligence or willful misconduct; (iii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, security deposits, insurance or condemnation proceeds; and (iv) failure to pay taxes or insurance. The Guaranties are full recourse guaranties under identified circumstances, including failure to maintain “single purpose” status which is a factor in a consolidation of Operating or Mezzanine in a bankruptcy of another person, transfer or encumbrance of the Property in violation of the applicable loan documents, Operating or Mezzanine incurring debts that are not permitted, and the Property becoming subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Guaranties, the Partnership is required to maintain a certain minimum net worth and liquidity. Effective as of May 12, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under the environmental indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership’s $97,000,000 mortgage loan and the $20,000,000 mezzanine loan. Pursuant to the agreement, InterGroup is required to maintain a certain net worth and liquidity. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, InterGroup is in compliance with both requirements. Due to the Hotel’s current low occupancy and low rates and their negative impact on the Hotel’s cash flow, Justice Operating Company, LLC is not meeting certain of its loan covenants such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”) which would trigger the creation of a lock-box and cash sweep by the Lender for all cash collected by the Hotel, and under certain terms, would allow the Lender to request Operating to replace its hotel management company. The DSCR for Operating has been below 1.00 for the last two quarters during fiscal year 2020 while it is required to maintain a DSCR of at least 1.10 to 1.00 for two consecutive quarters. However, such lockbox has been created and utilized from the loan inception and will be in place up to loan maturity regardless of the DSCR. Justice has not missed any of its debt service payments and does not anticipate missing any debt obligations even during these uncertain times for at least the next twelve months and beyond.
Each of the Loan Agreements contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, reporting requirements, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which impose restrictions on, among other things, organizational changes of the respective borrower, operations of the Property, agreements with affiliates and third parties. Each of the Loan Agreements also provides for mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances (including casualty or condemnation events) and voluntary prepayments, subject to satisfaction of prescribed conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements.
On July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $4,250,000 at 12% per year fixed interest, with a term of two years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a 3% loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The proceeds of the loan were applied to the July 2014 payments to Justice Holdings Company, LLC (“Holdings”) in connection with the redemption of limited partnership interests. The loan was extended to July 1, 2021. The balance of this loan is $3,000,000 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and is eliminated in the consolidated balance sheets.
On April 9, 2020, Justice entered into a loan agreement (“SBA Loan”) with CIBC Bank USA under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Justice received proceeds of $4,719,000 from the SBA Loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, Justice has used proceeds from the SBA Loan primarily for payroll costs. As of June 30, 2020, Justice had used $3,568,000 in qualified expenses and had a balance of $1,151,000 available for future qualified expenses. The SBA Loan is scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022 with a 1.00% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the CARES Act. All payments of principal and interest are deferred until October 2020, and the repayment obligations under the loan may be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll and other qualified expenses. We anticipate applying for loan forgiveness shortly. All unforgiven portion of the principal and accrued interest will be due at maturity.
