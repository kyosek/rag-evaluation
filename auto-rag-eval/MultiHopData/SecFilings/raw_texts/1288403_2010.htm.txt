Item 2. Properties
Substantially all of our fields are located in the Gulf of Mexico. These fields are found in water depths ranging from less than ten feet up to 4,200 feet. The reservoirs in our fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability, which typically result in high production rates. The following describes our ten largest fields as of December 31, 2010, based on quantities of proved reserves on a natural gas equivalent basis. At December 31, 2010, these fields accounted for approximately 77% of our proved reserves.
(1) Determined by the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price per Mcfe for oil and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price per Mcf for natural gas.
(2) W&T operates all down hole operations on well bores in which we have 100% working interests.
On December 31, 2010 we had two fields of major significance (having proved reserves which comprise 15% or more of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis). The Ship Shoal 349 field is located on the conventional shelf and the Viosca Knoll 783/784 field (Tahoe/SE Tahoe) is located in the deepwater. Below is a description of these fields.
Ship Shoal 349 Field. Ship Shoal 349 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 235 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 375 feet of water. The field area covers Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359, with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349. Phillips Petroleum discovered the field in 1993. We initially acquired a 25% working interest in the field from BP in 1999. In 2003, we acquired an additional 34% working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59%, and we became the operator of the field in December 2004. In early 2008, we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation and we now own a 100% working interest in this field. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 176 Bcfe gross. This field is a sub-salt development with five productive horizons below salt at depths ranging to 17,000 feet. As of December 31, 2010, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 13 have been successful. During 2010, we developed a reservoir simulation model to determine the most optimal future development plan. As a result, in 2011, we plan to drill two development wells. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in this field were 113.3 Bcfe at December 31, 2010.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from Ship Shoal 349 field over the past three fiscal years.
(1) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs. The increase in 2009 production costs per Mcfe compared to 2008 primarily relates to higher insurance costs in 2009. In addition to our standard insurance policies for well control and hurricane damage, we have an additional $100 million of insurance for well control and hurricane damage on our Ship Shoal 349 field.
Viosca Knoll 783 Field. (Viosca Knoll 783 Field (Tahoe) and Viosca Knoll 784 Field (SE Tahoe) The Viosca Knoll 783 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 140 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,500 to 1,700 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll blocks 783 and 784, with a subsea tieback to a platform in Main Pass 252. Shell discovered Tahoe field in 1984 and SE Tahoe field in 1996. We acquired a 70% working interest in Tahoe field and a 100% working interest in SE Tahoe field from Shell in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 507 Bcfe gross. Tahoe field is a supra-salt (above the salt layer) development with two productive horizons at depths ranging to 10,300 feet. SE Tahoe field is also a supra-salt development with one productive horizon at a depth of 9,325 feet. As of December 31, 2010, 16 wells have been drilled at the Tahoe field, of which 6 have been successful and one successful well has been drilled at the SE Tahoe field. Total proved reserves associated with our interest in these fields were 72.4 Bcfe at December 31, 2010.
The following presents historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from Viosca Knoll 783 from the acquisition date of November 4, 2011 through December 31, 2011. As we have had limited history with Viosca Knoll 783, the amounts below may not be representative of future results.
(1) Includes lease operating expenses and gathering and transportation costs.
The following is a description of the remainder of our top ten properties, measured by proved reserves at December 31, 2010, of which five are located on the conventional shelf, two are located in the deepwater and one is located on the deep shelf. We do not believe that individually any of these properties are of major significance (each has proved reserves which comprise less than 15% of the Company’s total proved reserves, calculated on a natural gas equivalent basis).
Main Pass 108 Field. Main Pass 108 field consists of Main Pass blocks 94, 107, 108 and 109. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 50 miles east of Venice in 50 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 33% to 100%, in a transaction with Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Big Hum. As of December 31, 2010, 52 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 38 were successful. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 283 Bcfe gross. During 2010, additional wells were successfully drilled, recompleted or workovers were performed to increase production and add reserves. However, the third party pipeline that is used to transport production from the field has been shut in since June 2010. We currently expect production from the field to resume in the first half of 2011.
Mississippi Canyon 243 Field. (Matterhorn) Mississippi Canyon 243 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 2,552 feet of water. The field area covers Mississippi Canyon block 243, with a single production platform on Mississippi Canyon block 243. Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine discovered the field in 2002. We acquired a 100% working interest in the field from Total in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 117 Bcfe gross. This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 9,850 feet. As of December 31, 2010, 17 wells have been drilled, of which 8 have been successful. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 4.2 MMcf of natural gas per day and 3,393 Bbls of oil per day, or 24.6 MMcfe per day.
Viosca Knoll 823 Field. (Virgo) Viosca Knoll 823 field is located off the coast of Louisiana, approximately 125 miles southeast of New Orleans, in 1,014 feet of water. The field area covers Viosca Knoll block 823 and Viosca Knoll block 822, with a single production platform on Viosca Knoll block 823. Total discovered the field in 1997. We acquired a 64% working interest in the field from Total in 2010. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 115 Bcfe gross. This field is a supra-salt development with 17 productive horizons at depths ranging to 13,335 feet. As of December 31, 2010, 12 wells have been drilled, of which 10
have been successful. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 3.9 MMcf of natural gas per day and 170 Bbls of oil per day, or 4.9 MMcfe per day.
Brazos A-133 Field. Brazos A-133 field is located 85 miles east of Corpus Christi, Texas in 200 feet of water. The field was discovered in 1978 by Cities Service Oil Company with production commencing in the same year. There are five active platforms, three of which are production platforms. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 849 Bcfe gross from the Middle Miocene Tex W and Big Hum sections. The bulk of the production is from the Big Hum CM-7 sand, which is a 4-way closure downthrown to the Corsair Fault and bisected by antithetic faults. The top of the CM-7 sand is at a subsea depth of 12,000 feet. Since its discovery, 22 wells have been drilled, of which 17 were successful. We own a 25% working interest that was obtained through a transaction with Kerr-McGee. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 6.7 MMcf of natural gas per day and 18 Bbls of oil per day, or 6.8 MMcfe per day.
Main Pass 283 Field. Main Pass 283 field consists of Main Pass blocks 284, 279 and 283 and Viosca Knoll Block 734. This field is located off the coast of Louisiana approximately 75 miles east of Venice in 315 feet of water. We acquired our working interests in these blocks, which range from 50% to 100%, in a transaction with ConocoPhillips. The field produces from a number of low relief, predominantly stratigraphically trapped sands. The productive interval ranges in age from Upper Miocene Big A through Middle Miocene Cristellaria I. As of December 31, 2010, 12 wells have been drilled in this field, of which 10 were successful. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 141 Bcfe gross. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 10.2 MMcf of natural gas per day and 1,136 Bbls of oil per day, or 17.0 MMcfe per day.
West Delta 30 Field. West Delta 30 field is located approximately six miles off the coast of Louisiana in 40 feet of water. Our interests in this field are in West Delta Block 29, which straddles the eastern side of a major piercement salt dome with large accumulations of oil and natural gas sands found in traps along the salt flanks. In 1997, we entered into a farmout agreement with Chevron to further explore and develop potential reserves. Following a thorough 3-D seismic analysis, we have drilled a total of 17 exploration and development wells, all but one of which have been successful. Our working interests in these wells range from 75% to 100%. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 703 Bcfe gross. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 0.1 MMcf of natural gas per day and 262 Bbls of oil per day, or 1.7 MMcfe per day. We currently have rig interventions scheduled in 2011, which we expect will increase the production from this field.
Mobile 823 Field. Mobile 823 field is located off the coast of Alabama in approximately 60 feet of water. It is a natural gas field comprised of two OCS blocks, Mobile Blocks 822 and 823. The field was discovered by Mobil Oil Corporation in 1983, with initial production commencing in 1991. We acquired our 12.5% working interest in 2003 from ConocoPhillips. ExxonMobil currently operates the majority of the field. We operate one well, a Miocene “Luce” sand discovery drilled in 2006. Production is primarily from the Jurassic Norphlet sandstone at 21,500 feet, with minor production from Miocene sands at 3,000 to 7,000 feet. The trapping mechanism is a combination structural and stratigraphic trap. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 797 Bcfe gross from eleven productive wells. The field has one processing platform and three independent structures. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 3.7 MMcf of natural gas per day and 169 Bbls of oil per day, or 4.7 MMcfe per day.
East Cameron 321 Field. East Cameron 321 field is located approximately 97 miles off the Louisiana coastline in 225 feet of water. Two production facilities, the “A” and “B” platforms, are located on the block. This field has multiple sands that are productive in faulted, structural traps. As of December 31, 2010, 75 wells have been drilled of which 57 have been successful. Cumulative field production through 2010 is approximately 552 Bcfe gross. We own a 100% working interest in the field and are the operator of the field. During December 2010, production from this field, net to our interest, averaged 1.9 MMcf of natural gas per day and 1,520 Bbls of oil per day, or 11.0 MMcfe per day.
Proved Reserves
Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2010 totaled 485.4 Bcfe as computed under the revised SEC requirements that were effective for periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. Approximately 81% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 19% were classified as proved undeveloped. Classified by product, 53% of our proved reserves were natural gas and 47% were oil and natural gas liquids, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price per Mcfe for oil and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price per Mcf for natural gas. Our proved reserves were estimated by an independent petroleum consultant, NSAI.
Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2010 are summarized below. These reserve amounts are consistent with filings we make with other federal agencies.
(1) One billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) and one million barrel equivalent (MMBoe) are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids (totals may not add due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the price per Mcfe for oil and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price per Mcf for natural gas. Similarly, the price per barrel for oil and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price per Boe for natural gas.
(2) We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net revenues of estimated proved reserves as calculated by our independent petroleum consultant using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs and estimated future development costs. PV-10 after ARO includes the present value of ARO related to proved reserves using a 10% discount rate. Neither PV-10 or PV-10 after ARO are financial measures prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); therefore, the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe the use of pre-tax measures are valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.
The reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2010 is as follows (in millions):
3) Includes approximately 29.6 Bcfe of reserves that were shut-in at December 31, 2010 due to two pipeline outages impacting several fields, including our Main Pass 108 field. We anticipate that the majority of these reserves will be reclassified to producing in 2011.
(4) In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2010 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year end December 31, 2010. Prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional price differentials. For oil and natural gas liquids, the average West Texas Intermediate posted price was used in the calculation and a net price of $75.96 per barrel was used in computing the amounts above. For natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was used in the calculation and a net price of $4.38 per MMcf was used in computing the amounts above. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production, development costs and ARO are based on year-end costs with no escalations.
Changes in Proved Reserves
Our total proved reserves increased to 485.4 Bcfe at December 31, 2010 from 371.0 Bcfe at December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of properties from Shell and Total discussed in Item 1, Business. Proved reserves associated with the properties acquired from Shell and Total were 80.0 Bcfe and 65.6 Bcfe, respectively, and other smaller acquisitions increased reserves by 6.4 Bcfe as of December 31, 2010. Estimated proved reserves also increased 29.2 Bcfe due to extensions and discoveries resulting from our participation in the drilling of four successful exploratory wells and also increases resulting from well completions, recompletions and workovers. In addition, reserves increased from revisions of previous estimates by 20.2 Bcfe. Partially offsetting these increases were declines associated with production of 87.0 Bcfe. See Item 8 Financial Statements - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures for additional information.
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31, 2010 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, NSAI, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The primary technical person at NSAI responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates presented herein has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and has been a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas for 22 years and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers for over 26 years. He has over 33 years total experience in the oil and gas industry, with over 19 years of reservoir engineering experience. His areas of experience are the continental shelf and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, San Juan Basin, onshore and offshore Mexico, offshore Africa, and unconventional gas sources worldwide. NSAI has
informed us that he meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in the application of industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as the application of SEC and other industry definitions and guidelines.
We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data, methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates. Additionally, our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis.
Reserve Technologies
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of:
•
the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•
estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes, development costs and workovers, all of which may vary considerably from actual results;
•
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas; and
•
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Reporting of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Reserves
We produce natural gas liquids as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of natural gas liquids in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. In our December 31, 2010 reserve report prepared by our independent petroleum consultant, natural gas liquids represented approximately 5% of our total proved reserves. Natural gas liquids are products sold by the gallon. Therefore, in reporting reserve and production amounts of natural gas liquids, we include natural gas liquids in the oil category using a ratio of 42 gallons/barrel. Prices for natural gas liquids in 2010 were approximately 44% lower on average than prices for equivalent volumes of oil. Natural gas liquids accounted for 17% of our combined reported production for oil, condensate and natural gas liquids combined. We report our average oil prices realized after taking into account the effect of the lower prices received for sales of natural gas liquids. We report all production information related to natural gas net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of natural gas liquids.
Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2010, as estimated by our independent petroleum consultant, were 94.1 Bcfe. Future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2010 were estimated at $156.6 million. In 2010, we developed approximately 1% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009, consisting of one gross (0.1 net) well and spent $0.9 million in 2010 with respect to our interest in this well. We believe that we will be able to develop all of the reserves classified as proved undeveloped at year end 2010 within the next five years.
More than 76% of our proved undeveloped reserves are concentrated in two fields; Ship Shoal 349, which is our Mahogany field, and our Main Pass 108 field. We have two development wells planned in each of those fields in 2011. We anticipate that one development well in each field planned for 2011 will reach its targeted depths by the end of the year in 2011 while the other two development wells may not reach total vertical depth until 2012. Any change in classification of reserves between proved developed and undeveloped is solely dependent on when such wells reach total vertical depth and any resulting production.
Acreage
The following summarizes gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2010. Net acreage is our percentage ownership of gross acreage. Deepwater refers to acreage in over 500 feet of water.
Approximately 82% of our total gross acreage is held-by-production, which permits us to maintain all of our exploration, exploitation and development rights (including deep rights below currently producing zones) to the leased area as long as production continues. We have the right to propose future exploration and development projects, including deep exploration projects, on the majority of our acreage.
Approximately 156,456 of our gross acreage is undeveloped leasehold. Our rights to approximately 15% could expire in 2011, 1% in 2012, 25% in 2013, 24% in 2014 and 35% in 2015 and beyond, if not extended by exploration and production activities prior to the applicable lease expiration dates. In making decisions regarding our drilling activity for 2011 we will give consideration to our undeveloped leasehold that may expire in 2011 in order to retain the opportunity to exploit such acreage, based on the appropriate technical criteria, before expiration of the lease.
Certain non-producing oil and gas leases expired or were formally relinquished, which reduced our total gross and net acreage. These reductions were partially offset by additions from the property interests acquired from Total and Shell. Overall, our total gross and net acreage decreased 5.9% and 4.4%, respectively, from December 31, 2009.
Production
During 2010, our net production averaged approximately 238 MMcfe per day. Net production was deferred in 2010 at our Main Pass 108 field as a result of a pipeline outage beginning in June 2010 and continuing through year end. We estimate that as a result of this pipeline outage we have had approximately 4.9 Bcfe of production deferred during 2010. We currently expect production from the field to resume in the first half of 2011.
Production History
The following presents historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from all of our producing fields over the past three fiscal years.
(1) Production decreased in 2010 primarily due to two pipeline outages impacting several fields, including our Main Pass 108 field, and divestitures completed in 2009, partially offset by the acquisition of properties from Total and Shell in 2010.
Refer to the descriptions of our ten largest fields earlier in Item 2 - “Properties” for historical information about our produced oil and natural gas volumes from our Ship Shoal 349 field and Viosca Knoll 783 field over the past three fiscal years, which have proved reserves comprising 15% or more of our total proved reserves. Also refer to Item 6 Selected Financial Data-- Historical Reserve and Operating Information for additional historical operating data.
Productive Wells
The following presents our ownership interest at December 31, 2010 in our productive oil and natural gas wells, including wells that were temporarily shut-in on that date primarily because of two pipeline outages impacting several fields, including our Main Pass 108 field. A net well is our percentage working interest of a gross well.
(1) Includes 5 gross (3.2 net) oil wells and 4 gross (2.9 net) gas wells with multiple completions.
The following table presents the number of wells included in the above table that were temporarily shut-in at December 31, 2010 due to the pipeline outages.
Drilling Activity
During 2010, we participated in the drilling of six offshore and two onshore wells. The two onshore wells, which were both high risk/high potential exploration wells, were unsuccessful but five of the six offshore wells were successful. Of the five successful wells, four were exploration wells and one was a development well. All five of the successful wells were on the conventional shelf. We operate three of the five successful wells. As of December 31, 2010, we were in the process of drilling two onshore exploration wells in Southeast Texas and one offshore exploration well on the conventional shelf.
The level of our investment in oil and gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil and natural gas, acquisition opportunities and the results of our exploration and development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and equipment of $415.7 million included $60.2 million for exploration activities, $77.2 million for development activities and $41.3 million for seismic, capitalized interest and other leasehold costs.
Development Drilling
The following sets forth information relating to our development wells drilled over the past three fiscal years.
Our success rates related to our gross development wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 100%, 67% and 100%, respectively.
Exploration Drilling
The following sets forth information relating to our exploration drilling over the past three fiscal years.
Our success rates related to our gross exploration wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 57%, 80% and 75%, respectively.
Current Drilling Activity
During the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending February 25, 2011, we participated in the drilling of one gross (0.5 net) onshore exploratory well and one gross (1.0 net) offshore exploratory well, both of which were successful. We were in the process of drilling one gross (0.25 net) onshore exploratory well as of February 25, 2011.
Item 3.
