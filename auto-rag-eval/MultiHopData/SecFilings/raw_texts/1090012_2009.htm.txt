Properties
Property Overview
Our oil and gas operations are concentrated in various North American onshore areas in the United States and Canada. We also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. As previously mentioned, we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets. Our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions. These interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.
We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region in north Texas. These assets include approximately 3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued development and growing production in the Woodford Shale, located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a capacity of 200 MMcf per day.
Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This 220-mile dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal near Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline.
The following sections provide additional details of our oil and gas properties, including information about proved reserves, production, wells, acreage and drilling activities.
Property Profiles
The locations of our key North American Onshore properties are presented on the following map.
The following table presents proved reserve information for our key properties as of December 31, 2009, along with their production volumes for the year 2009. Additional summary profile information for our key properties is provided following the table. Our key properties include those that currently have significant proved reserves or production. These key properties also include properties that do not have current significant levels of proved reserves or production, but are expected be the source of future significant growth in proved reserves and production.
(1)
Gas reserves and production are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of gas and oil prices. NGL reserves and production are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.

Haynesville Shale - Our Haynesville Shale acreage spans across east Texas and north Louisiana with an average working interest of 92%. To date, our drilling activity has been focused on de-risking the 157,000 acres located in Panola, Shelby and San Augustine counties in east Texas. We drilled 8 gross wells in 2009 and plan to drill approximately 30 gross wells in 2010.
Canada
Jackfish - Jackfish is our 100%-owned thermal heavy oil project in the non-conventional oil sands of east central Alberta. We are employing steam-assisted gravity drainage at Jackfish. In late 2009, Jackfish’s gross production reached 33.7 MBbls of oil per day. Gross peak production is expected to be 35 MBbls per day with a flat production profile for greater than 20 years. We are currently constructing the second phase of Jackfish and evaluating the potential for a third phase. The second and third phases of Jackfish are each expected to also eventually produce 35 MBbls per day of heavy oil production.
Northwest - The Northwest region includes acreage within west central Alberta and northeast British Columbia. We hold approximately 1.9 million net acres in the region, which produces primarily natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in the area is approximately 73%. In 2009, we drilled 36 gross wells and plan to drill approximately 55 gross wells in 2010.
Lloydminster - Our Lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without steam injection. We hold 2.5 million net acres and have an 89% average working interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2009, we drilled 239 gross wells and plan to drill approximately 140 gross wells in 2010.

Our leases include approximately 170,000 net acres with a 100% working interest. We drilled 2 gross wells in 2009. During 2010, we plan to drill 11 gross wells, consisting of 7 horizontal wells and 4 vertical stratigraphic-test wells.
Preparation of Reserves Estimates and Reserves Audits
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be considered proved, oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the “Group”). These same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators (“Qualified Estimators”), as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards.
The Group, which is led by Devon’s Director of Reserves and Economics, is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates. We ensure the Group’s Director and key members of the Group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates. Such qualifications include any or all of the following:
•
an undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering from an accredited university, or equivalent;
•
a petroleum engineering license, or similar certification;
•
memberships in oil and gas industry or trade groups; and
•
relevant experience estimating reserves.
The current Director of the Group and the Group’s key members all have the qualifications listed above. Additionally, the Group reports independently of any of our operating divisions. The Group’s Director reports to our Senior Vice President of Strategic Development, who reports to our President. No portion of the Group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.
Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum consultants discussed below. The Group also ensures our Qualified Estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.
The Group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by third-party consulting firms. During 2009, we engaged three such firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of our proved reserves. Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared the 2009 reserve estimates for all of our offshore Gulf of Mexico properties and for 99% of our International proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the 2009 reserve estimates for 93% of our domestic onshore properties. AJM Petroleum Consultants audited 91% of our Canadian reserves.
Set forth below is a summary of the North American reserves that were evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007.
“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant. “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates, in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles.
In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews, we also have a Reserves Committee that consists of three independent members of our Board of Directors. Although we are not required to have a Reserves Committee, we established ours in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process. The Reserves Committee was designed to assist the Board of Directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves, much like our Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements. Besides being independent, the members of our Reserves Committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process.
The Reserves Committee meets at least twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies, and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants. The responsibilities of the Reserves Committee include the following:
•
perform an annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil, gas and NGL reserves;
•
verify the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting system;
•
evaluate, prepare and disclose our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to our oil, gas and NGL reserves;
•
investigate and verify the qualifications and independence of our independent engineering consultants;
•
monitor the performance of our independent engineering consultants; and
•
monitor and evaluate our business practices and ethical standards in relation to the preparation and disclosure of reserves.
Proved Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves
The following table presents our estimated proved reserves by continent and for each significant country as of December 31, 2009. These estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations” in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(1)
Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids reserves are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.
No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2009 except in filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate.
Proved Developed Reserves
As presented in the previous table, we had 1,922 MMBoe of proved developed reserves at December 31, 2009. Proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at December 31, 2009.
(1)
Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids reserves are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
The following table presents the changes in our total proved undeveloped reserves during 2009 (in MMBoe).
During 2009, our proved undeveloped reserves increased 91%. A large contributor to the increase was our 2009 drilling activities, which increased our proved undeveloped reserves 316 MMBoe. Also as a result of 2009 drilling activities, we converted 81 MMBoe, or 19%, of the 2008 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
Our proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2009 largely relate to our operations at Jackfish and the Barnett Shale. Additionally, the 2009 positive revisions due to prices largely related to Jackfish. At the end of 2008, none of our Jackfish reserves were classified as proved due to low oil prices. However, as oil prices rebounded during 2009, our Jackfish reserves, including the reserves that were undeveloped at the end of 2008, once again became economic and were classified as proved at the end of 2009. The positive revision related to Jackfish reserves was partially offset by decreases in proved undeveloped gas reserves related to certain of our North American Onshore properties.
At the end of 2009, approximately 1% of our proved reserves had been classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years. The majority of such reserves relate to our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations where sanctioned development projects often take longer than five years to complete.
Proved Reserves Cash Flows
The following table presents estimated cash flow information related to our December 31, 2009 estimated proved reserves. Similar to reserves, the cash flow estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations” in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
(1)
Estimated pre-tax future net revenue represents estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs and site restoration and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not give effect to depreciation, depletion and amortization, or to non-property related expenses such as debt service and income tax expense.
Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2009. These prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions yielded average prices over the life of our properties of $47.80 per Bbl of oil, $3.12 per Mcf of gas and $22.78 per Bbl of NGLs. Costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner. The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to December 31, 2009. There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.
The present value of after-tax future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum (“standardized measure”) was $11.4 billion at the end of 2009. Included as part of standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of $3.4 billion. Excluding these taxes, the present value of our pre-tax future net revenue (“pre-tax 10% present value”) was $14.8 billion. We believe the pre-tax 10% present value is a useful measure in addition to the after-tax standardized measure. The pre-tax 10% present value assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies. The after-tax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company, while the pre-tax 10% present value is based on prices and discount factors,
which are more consistent from company to company. We also understand that securities analysts use the pre-tax 10% present value measure in similar ways.

Production, Production Prices and Production Costs
The following tables present our production and average sales prices by continent and for each significant field and country for the past three years.
(1)
Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids reserves are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.
The following table presents our production cost per Boe by continent and for each significant field and country for the past three years. Production costs do not include ad valorem or severance taxes.
Drilling Activities and Results

Net acres are gross acres multiplied by our fractional working interests on the acreage.
Operation of Properties
The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions.
We are the operator of 24,221 of our wells. As operator, we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.
Title to Properties
Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business.
As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review of local records, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.
