Item 2. Properties (b) Real Estate Development for ownership), had ownership interests in a 33 acre parcel and a 13 acre parcel of partially developed land in Temecula, California (Riverside County). The 33 acre parcel was sold on June 1, 2001.
In September 1994, Vail Ranch Limited Partnership (VRLP) was formed as a partnership between Old Vail Partners, L.P., a California limited partnership, (OVP), a subsidiary of the Company, and Landgrant Corporation (Landgrant) to develop a 32 acre parcel of land of which 27 acres was developable. Landgrant is not affiliated with the Company. VRLP completed construction of a community shopping center on 10 acres of land in May 1997 and sold approximately 3.6 partially improved acres in the year ended June 30, 1997 and .59 partially improved acres during the year ended June 30, 1998 to unaffiliated purchasers for cash of $2,365,000 and $400,000, respectively. The cash proceeds from these sales were applied to reduce the construction loan balance. On January 2, 1998, VRLP sold the shopping center to New Plan Excel Realty Trust, Inc. (Excel) for
$9,500,000 cash. On August 7, 1998, VRLP entered into a an operating agreement (Agreement) with ERT Development Corporation (ERT), an affiliate of Excel, to form Temecula Creek, LLC, a California limited liability company (TC). TC was formed for the purpose of developing, constructing and operating the remaining 13 acres of land as part of the community shopping center in Temecula, California. VRLP contributed the 13 acres of land to TC and TC assumed the balance of the assessment district obligation payable. For purposes of maintaining capital account balances in calculating distributions, VRLP's contribution, net of the liability assumed by TC, was valued at $2,000,000. ERT contributed $1,000,000 cash which was immediately distributed by TC to VRLP. VRLP, which is the managing member, and ERT are each 50 percent members. ERT also advanced approximately $220,000 to TC to reimburse VRLP for certain predevelopment costs incurred by VRLP for the 13 acres. The Agreement provides that ERT will advance funds to fund predevelopment costs, other than property taxes and assessment district costs. Each member is required to advance 50 percent of the property taxes and assessment district costs as they become due (approximately $163,000 annually). The development plan is for 109,910 square foot shopping center on approximately 13 acres of land. In July 2000, TC completed development of 54,107 square feet of the shopping. As of August 31, 2001 a total of 75,692 square feet had been constructed of which 100% is currently leased. The balance of the build out is expected to be completed by February 2002.
Old Vail Partners, a California general partnership, (OVPGP), a subsidiary of the Company, owned a 33 acre parcel which was originally designated as commercially-zoned, however, the City of Temecula adopted a general development plan as a means of down-zoning the property to a lower use, which if the Company was not successful in having a development planned approved, might have significantly impaired the value of the property. The Company contested this action, and as described below, was successful in having a development plan approved in October 2000 that enabled the Company to sell the property in June 2001.
(3) Commercial Real Estate Rental - Real estate rental operations consist of one office building in the Sorrento Mesa area of San Diego, California, a sublessor interest in land leased to condominium owners in Palm Springs, California, and a 50 percent ownership interest in a 542 unit apartment project in San Diego, California.
Downtown Properties Development Corporation (DPDC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owned a 36,000 square foot office building in the Sorrento Mesa area of San Diego, California. The building was originally acquired in 1984 by 5230, Ltd., which was 75 percent owned as a limited and general partner by Sports Arenas Properties, Inc. (SAPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company occupied approximately 14 percent of the office building. On December 28, 2000 the Company sold its office building for $3,725,000 and recorded a gain of $2,764,483. The Company has been released from liability under the existing loan except for those acts, events or omissions that occurred prior to the loan assumption. The Company had occupied approximately 5,000 square feet of space in the building since 1984. The existing lease expires in September 2011. In conjunction with a lease modification with the new owner to the office building, the Company vacated the premises on April 6, 2001 and moved into the factory space occupied by its subsidiary, Penley Sports, LLC. However, because the lease commitment was a condition to the original loan agreement, the lender will only allow the Company to be conditionally released from its remaining lease obligation. In the event there is an uncured event of default by the new owner of the office building under the existing loan agreement, the Company's obligations under its lease will be reinstated to the extent there is not an enforceable lease on the Company's former space.

DPDC is also the lessee of 15 acres of land in the Palm Springs, California area under a ground lease expiring in September 2043. The land is subleased to owners of condominium units which were constructed on the property in 1982. The development was originally planned by DPDC and then sold to another developer, but DPDC retained the rights to the subleases. The subleases also expire in September 2043. The master lease provides for the payment of rent equal to the greater of a minimum rent, which is adjusted for increases in the consumer price index every five years, or 85 percent of the rents collected on the subleases, which are also adjusted for increases in the consumer price index every five years.
UCVGP, Inc. and Sports Arenas Properties, Inc. (SAPI), wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, are a one percent managing general partner and a 49 percent limited partner, respectively, in UCV, L.P. (UCV), which owns an apartment project (University City Village) located in San Diego, California. University City Village contains 542 rental units and was acquired in August 1974. UCV employs approximately 30 persons. The following is a schedule of selected operating information over the last five years:

(4) Golf club shaft Manufacturer - On January 22, 1997, the Company purchased the assets of the Power Sports Group doing business as Penley Power Shaft (PPS) and formed Penley Sports, LLC (Penley) with the Company as a 90 percent managing member and Carter Penley as a 10 percent member. PPS was a manufacturer of graphite golf club shafts that primarily sold its shafts to custom golf shops. PPS's sales had averaged approximately $375,000 in calendar 1995 and 1996. PPS marketed its shafts in limited quantities through phone contact and trade magazine advertisements directed at golf shops. Although PPS's manufacturing process was not automated, it had developed a good reputation in the golf industry as a manufacturer of high performance golf club shafts, in addition to maintaining relationships with the custom golf shops. Penley's plans are to market its products to golf club manufacturers and golf club component distributors. To compliment the program of marketing to higher volume purchasers, Penley purchased over $1,100,000 of equipment since January 22, 1997 to automate some of the production processes. Additionally, in June 2000 Penley moved from its 8,559 square foot facility into a 38,025 square foot facility, of which approximately 10,000 square feet are subleased to another tenant through October 2002.
Until January 2000, Penley's sales were principally to custom golf shops where the orders are for 2 to 10 shafts per order at prices averaging $18 per shaft. In January 2000, Penley commenced sales to two of the largest golf component distributors. As a result of the sales to these two distributors and other small golf club manufacturers, golf club shaft sales increased by $735,654 in the year ended June 30, 2000 and $407,660 in the year ended June 30, 2001. Penley currently has products in testing by several large golf club manufacturers. However, there can be no assurances that the Penley will be able to enter into any significant sales contracts or that, if it does, the contracts will be profitable to Penley.
Penley has implemented an extensive program to market directly to golf club manufacturers through the distribution of direct mail materials and videos and participation in several large golf shows during the year. Penley is principally using its internal sales staff in the marketing and sale of its shafts to manufacturers, distributors and golf shops. Penley is also promoting its shafts to professional golfers as a means of achieving acceptance with the club manufacturers as the golfers endorse the shafts.
Management believes Penley has been successful in building a reputation as a leader in new shaft design and concepts. Penley has applied for several patents on shaft designs, of which one was issued and the others are pending. Although Penley has developed several new products, no assurance can be given that they will meet with market acceptance or that Penley will be able to continue to design and manufacture additional new products.
The primary raw material used in all of Penley's graphite shafts is carbon fiber, which is combined with epoxy resin to produce sheets of graphite prepreg. Due to low production levels, Penley currently purchases most of its graphite prepreg from two suppliers. There are numerous alternative suppliers of graphite prepreg. Although Management believes that it will be able to establish relationships with other graphite prepreg suppliers to ensure sufficient supplies of the material at competitive pricing as production increases, there can be no assurances the unforeseen difficulties will not occur that could lead to interruptions and delays to Penley's production process.
Penley uses hazardous substances and generates hazardous waste in the ordinary course of its manufacturing of graphite golf club shafts and other related products. Penley is subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Management believes it is in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and to date has not incurred any liabilities under environmental laws and regulations nor has it received any notices of violations. However, there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not arise in the future which may affect Penley's business.
Penley is trying to enter a highly competitive environment among established golf club shaft manufacturers. Although Penley has made significant progress in establishing its reputation for technology, the unproven production capability of Penley is making it difficult to attract the golf club manufacturers as customers.
Penley currently has one patent and two other patents pending and several copyrighted trademarks and logos. Although Management believes these items are of value to the business and Penley will protect them to the fullest extent possible, Management does not believe these items are critical to Penley's ability to develop business with the golf club manufacturers.
Penley currently has approximately 35 full and part-time employees.
Due to Penley's low sales volume, there is currently no impact from the seasonality of sales (expected to be from April through September), no significant backlog of sales orders, or customer concentration (based on consolidated revenues).

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES ------------------ (a) Bowling Centers: --------------------- The Company's remaining bowling center occupies the following facility: Name Location Size Expiration Date of Lease ---- -------- ---- ------------------------ Grove Bowl San Diego, California 60 lanes June 2003- options to 2018
The Grove Bowl occupies its facility pursuant to a long-term operating lease described in Note 8(a) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b) Real Estate Development: ---------------------------- As of June 30, 1999, Downtown Properties Inc. (DPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owned 507 acres of undeveloped land in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. The land was collateral for a $75,927 bank loan (first deed of trust). On September 7, 1999 the property was sold to a third party for $215,000 cash, less selling expenses of $24,638, and the loan was paid from the proceeds.
RCSA Holdings, Inc. (RCSA) and OVGP, Inc., wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, own a combined 50 percent general and limited partnership interest in Old Vail Partners, L.P., a California limited partnership (OVP), which owns a 60 percent limited partnership interest in Vail Ranch Limited Partnership (VRLP). As described in Note 6(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are four other partners in OVP in the form of liquidating limited partnership interests. Three of the four partners had received the limit of their distributions through June 30, 2001 and their partnership interests were liquidated. The remaining partner in OVP is entitled to 50 percent of the cash distributions from OVP, not to exceed $2,450,000, of which $1,410,000 has been paid as of June 30, 2001.
RCSA and DPI were the general partners of Old Vail Partners (OVPGP), a California general partnership, which owned 33 acres of unimproved land in Temecula, California. OVPGP contributed the land to OVP when the litigation regarding the zoning was settled (see below). In June 2001, OVP sold the unimproved land.
The 33 acres of land owned by OVPGP as of June 30, 2000 was located within a special assessment district of the County of Riverside, California (the County) which was created to fund and develop roadways, sewers, and other required infrastructure improvements in the area necessary for the owners to develop their properties. Property within the assessment district is collateral for an allocated portion of the bonded debt that was issued by the assessment district to fund the improvements. The principal balance of the allocated portion of the bonds was $1,384,153 as of June 30, 2000. The annual payments (due in semiannual installments) related to the bonded debt are approximately $144,000 for the 33 acres. The payments continue through the year 2014 and include interest at approximately 7-3/4 percent. OVP was delinquent in the payment of property taxes and assessments for over the last eight years and the property was subject to default judgments to the County of Riverside, California totaling approximately $2,132,421 as of June 30, 2000 regarding delinquents assessment district payments ($1,776,243) and property taxes ($356,178).
In November 1993, the City of Temecula adopted a general development plan that designated 33 acres of property owned by Old Vail Partners, a general partnership (the predecessor to Old Vail Partners, L.P., a California limited partnership) (OVPGP) as suitable for "professional office" use, which was contrary to its zoning as "commercial" use. As part of the adoption of its general development plan, the City of Temecula adopted a provision that, until the zoning is changed on properties affected by the general plan, the general plan shall prevail when a use designated by the general plan conflicts with the existing zoning on the property. The result was that the City of Temecula has effectively down-zoned the 33 acres from a "commercial" to "professional office" use. As described above, the parcel was subject to assessment district obligations, which were allocated in 1989 based on a higher "commercial" use. Since the assessment district obligations were not subject to reapportionment as a result of re-zoning, a "professional office" use was not economically feasible due to the disproportionately high allocation of assessment district costs.
The County had scheduled the 33 acres for public sale for the defaulted property taxes on September 27, 1999. OVPGP had unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a payment plan with the County subject to the successful resolution of the zoning problems with the property. On September 23, 1999, OVPGP filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in the United States Bankruptcy Court. The primary claim affected by this action was the County's secured claim for delinquent taxes and assessment district payments. OVPGP's plan was to use the relief from stay to continue its efforts to negotiate a settlement of the zoning issues and restore the economic value of the property. The bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed on February 15, 2000 with the concurrence of OVPGP. This dismissal allowed the County of Riverside to proceed with a public sale of the property within 45 days after giving notice. On June 23, 2000, the County of Riverside agreed to remove the property from the planned public sale originally schedule for June 26, 2000 in exchange for an immediate payment of $330,000 with the balance of property taxes due on December 29, 2000. Separately, the County of Riverside stated that a foreclosure sale related to the default judgement for assessment district payments would not be scheduled until some time after January 1, 2001. On January 19, 2001, the County of Riverside agreed to extend the due date to March 30, 2001 with three options to that would extend the due date to August 1, 2001. Each extension option requires a payment of $25,000. Payments were made to date to extend the agreement to May 31, 2001.
On May 6, 1998, OVPGP filed suit against the City of Temecula, California in the California Superior Court for the County of Riverside. OVPGP claimed that, if the effective re-zoning is valid, the action would be a taking and damaging of OVPGP's property without payment of just compensation. OVPGP was seeking to have the effective re-zoning invalidated and an unspecified amount of damages. OVPGP has previously suffered adverse outcomes in other suits filed in relation to this matter. A stipulation was entered that dismissed this suit without prejudice and agreed to toll all applicable statute of limitations while OVPGP and the City of Temecula attempted to informally resolve this litigation.
On October 23, 2000, the City of Temecula's city council granted preliminary approval of OVPGP's request for re-zoning and general plan amendment related to a development plan which includes a combination of multi-family and commercial uses. On November 28, 2000 the re-zoning and general plan amendment requested by OVPGP were adopted by the City of Temecula and OVPGP abandoned its legal claims against the City of Temecula.
On June 1, 2001, the Company sold the 33 acres to an unrelated developer for $6,375,000 cash plus assumption of the non-delinquent balance of the assessment district obligation ($1,001,274) and recorded a gain of $5,544,743. The cash proceeds were used to pay $2,459,477 of delinquent taxes and assessments related to the property and $299,458 of selling expenses. In addition, payments of $2,172,410 were made to the limited partners in OVP from the proceeds.

ITEM 3.
