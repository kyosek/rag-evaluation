ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO BUILDING
On February 26, 1991, the Company purchased a commercial building, located in Huntington Beach, California.
Constructed in 1991, the building is one-story, has a total of 5,200 rentable square feet and is located on an 18,225 square foot parcel of land. The building is 100% occupied by one tenant, Blockbuster Video, through 2001, on a triple net lease. The tenant's lease calls for rental payments of $11,180 per for the years one through five (1991-1995) and $13,416 per month for years six through ten (1996-2000). This is equivalent to $2.15 and $2.58 per square foot, respectively. This lease requires the tenant to pay insurance, taxes, maintenance, and all other operating costs. During 1996, property taxes, paid by the tenant as part of its lease, were approximately $18,000.
The Building was originally acquired for all cash in 1991 for a total acquisition cost of $1,676,210. However, in February 1994, the Company financed the Building by incurring mortgage debt secured by the Building for $600,000. The loan is amortized over a twenty-five year period and is due in ten years. The monthly payment is currently $4,934 per month with the interest rate set to be adjusted at the end of the fifth year of the loan to 350 basis points above the five-year Treasury Bond yield. The current rate is 8.25%.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 31.5 years using a straight-line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and income tax bases for the property are the same. In the opinion of the General Partner, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. ("WCRM"), an affiliate of the corporate General Partner.
The building is located in Orange County, California, which has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in California, based on its stable base of employers ranging from big businesses to smaller retailers. Management is aware that future planned closures of military bases and aerospace firms could soften the business environment in the Orange County area. The Advisor, however, does not expect these economic factors to have a significant impact on the ability of the tenant to meet its lease obligation.
FRESNO VILLAGE SHOPPING CENTER BUILDING
On May 14, 1993, the Company purchased a free standing commercial building located in a shopping center in Fresno, California.
Total consideration paid for the property was $1,414,893. Long-term financing used to acquire the property was $665,000 and matures in August 1, 2003. Payments are made at the rate of 8.25% with a twenty-five year amortization schedule. In 1998, the interest rate on the loan will adjust to 3.25% above the five-year Treasury Bond yield at that time.
The Fresno Property was a newly developed retail building (the "Fresno Building") with construction completed in April 1993. The Fresno Building is located at 1614 North Blackstone, Fresno, California. The Fresno Building is located close to the center of Fresno, California on the northeast corner of Blackstone and McKinley. Fresno is located in Central California. The Fresno Building is located on a lot size of 23,855 square feet, with a building size of 8,915 square feet. The exterior of the Fresno Building consists of stucco and glass construction.
The Fresno Building is 100% occupied by two tenants -- Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc. ("The Wherehouse" - a music and video retailer), and RTO, Inc. (which stands for "Rent To Own" - a home furnishing and appliance rental company) (collectively "Tenants").
The building and improvements are depreciated over 39 years using a straight- line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and tax bases for the property are the same. In the opinion of the Advisor, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by WCRM.
As part of a larger neighborhood shopping center anchored by a major department store, all of the tenants are dependent upon the vitality of the consumer market in the general area. Although there are other shopping centers in the area, being located in a densely populated area north of downtown Fresno, and across the street from a large community college, the high daily traffic count provides a large customer base for all the retail and service businesses in the general area. Although all areas of Central California have been affected by the economic slowdown, it is not expected to significantly impact the occupancy of the Center.
The Wherehouse entered into a ten year lease which commenced April 1, 1993 and was to continue through March 31, 2003. The Wherehouse occupies approximately 6,000 square feet of the Fresno Building.
Prior to the modification of The Wherehouse lease, as described below, monthly rental payments were to be as follows:
April, 1993 to March, 1998; $7,680 per month (1.28/sq.ft./month) April, 1998 to March 2003; $8,820 per month (1.41/sq.ft./month)
As possible additional rent, The Wherehouse was scheduled to pay the Company 3% of gross sales after applying a formula that involves recapture of rent and expenses that The Wherehouse would pay as a triple net lease tenant. There were no amounts due on this additional rent through December, 1996.
On August 2, 1995, The Wherehouse filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Wherehouse continued to pay its rent under the terms of the original lease through January 1997. In November 1996, the Company and The Wherehouse agreed to the terms of a new lease, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the terms of the First Amendment to Lease (the "Amendment") dated November 30, 1996, commencing February 1, 1997, The Wherehouse's lease was converted from a "net" lease to a "gross" lease. At a minimum, the Company will be paid rent of $54,000 per year ($4,500 per month) until January 31, 1998 unless the Wherehouse exercises its one time option to terminate the lease on March 31, 1998. If the lease is not terminated, the Company will be paid $82,800 per year ($6,900 per month) thereafter to January 31, 2003. The Amendment also provides that commencing January 20, 1997, the gross rent will be adjusted to an amount equal to 6.5% of gross sales from the previous eleven months, but such rent shall never be less than the rent paid during the said period. On April 20, 1998 and each three months thereafter, the gross rent will be adjusted to an amount equal to 8.2% of gross sales from the previous calendar quarter, but the rent shall never be less than the rent paid during the said quarter. At this time, the Company does not feel that the gross rent calculation will exceed the minimum rental amount payable in 1997. The Wherehouse will also pay for any percentage increase in property taxes over and above the amount assessed for calendar year 1996, on its pro rata share of occupied space of the property. The terms and conditions pertaining to options to renew the lease remain unmodified and are described below.
As a result of the Amendment, the monthly rent payments (based on minimum rental amounts) was decreased from $1.28 per square foot to $.75 per square foot (or $4,500 per month) effective February 1, 1997. In addition, the Company expects to absorb an additional $18,000 in operating expenses that were previously allocated to The Wherehouse. The total decrease in income as a result of the Amendment is therefore estimated to be $38,160 per year until February 1, 1998 when the total decrease will be reduced to $28,800 per year. Based on approximately 1.6 million shares of the Company outstanding, the Amendment would decrease distributable income by approximately $.02 per share per year, and thus is not material to the operating results of the Company.
OPTO-22 BUILDING
On September 15, 1993, the Company acquired the property described below (the "OPTO-22 Property" or "Building"). The funds used to acquire the OPTO-22 Property were obtained from the sale of the Company's shares and from seller- provided financing in connection with the acquisition of the OPTO-22 Property.
The OPTO-22 Property is located within the master-planned Huntington Beach Industrial Park at 15461 Springdale (at the intersection of Springdale Street and McFadden Avenue), Huntington Beach, California. The Building was built in 1977, and was occupied by a company named OPTO-22 from 1979 through 1992. In August 1992, OPTO-22 subleased the Building to Claremont High School, a private school, whose sublease runs through April 1997. The Building was deeded over to the Seller in May 1993 by the John Lusk Corporation via a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure.
Situated on approximately 3.34 acres of fee land, the Building is concrete tilt- up construction. The Building has approximately 25,866 square feet of fully improved office area, 24 foot high clearance, is fully sprinklered, and has two overhead truck doors as well as one exterior, two-bay truck loading well. In addition, the site contains ample parking with approximately 201 spaces, and has three separate driveway entrances for ingress and egress.
The Huntington Beach Industrial Park is a master-planned development of the Lusk Company. This industrial park contains over 1.5 million square feet of space, and benefits from its close proximity to labor markets and desirable housing as well as access to the San Diego (405) Freeway. Also located within one mile are the Westminster Mall, Golden West Community College, and a McDonnell Douglas Corporation facility.
The OPTO-22 Property is currently being occupied by Claremont High School, a private school, under a sublease that commenced in August 1992 and continues until April 1997. Claremont High School in a non-profit, public-benefit, tax- exempt educational institution that serves students in the 7th through 12th grade levels, and has been in existence since 1975. Claremont is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and is also certified by the University of California system. Since taking occupancy of the Building, Claremont has spent an estimated $200,000 on improvements and upgrades to the interior of the building.
The Building was previously occupied by OPTO-22, the primary lease, which took occupancy in 1979, and subleased the Building to Claremont High School in August 1992. OPTO-22's lease on the Building ends at the same time that Claremont High School's sublease ends with OPTO-22. The primary lease on the property currently calls for rent of $19,709.41 per month. Claremont High School currently pays a sublease rent $3,690.59 per month higher than OPTO-22's rent.
At this time, the Company is negotiating with Claremont High School in an attempt to retain the school as a tenant. The Company expects to at least retain the school as a tenant on a month-to-month basis through August 1997. Failure to re-negotiate an extension of the existing lease could require the Company to expend $100,000 to $200,000 in capital refurbishing costs (in order to attract a qualified tenant) and result in a vacancy at the property for two to four months.
The lease is "triple-net" with the Tenant responsible for all operating expenses including utilities, maintenance, taxes and insurance.
The OPTO-22 Building was acquired from Glendale Federal Bank (the "Seller") - an unrelated third party. In determining the propriety of the investment in the Building, the Advisor reviewed 1991 and 1992 sales information on several similar properties in the vicinity. Based on the sales price of $2,350,000, the OPTO-22's acquisition price was approximately $38.90 per square foot. In contrast, the comparative sales in the area ranged from $42 to $65 per square foot, with the average of all the building equal to $45 per square foot. In addition, the Advisor took note that the monthly rental being paid by OPTO-22 is less than the current market rents in the area, especially in comparison to the sub-lease rent being paid to OPTO-22 by Claremont High School for this property. Based on (1) comparison of the price per square foot of the OPTO-22 Building, and the comparative recent sales price per square foot of several properties comparable in quality to the OPTO-22 Building, and (2) the comparison of current rental revenue on the building to current market rental rates for the area, it is the opinion of the Advisor that the acquisition price of the OPTO-22 Building is reasonable.
The OPTO-22 Building is managed by West Coast Realty Management, Inc. ("WCRM") (the "Property Manager"), an affiliate of the Company. WCRM charges the Company 3% of the gross rents collected as a management fee for managing the Property, as allowed by the Property Management Agreement. In the opinion of the Advisor, the OPTO-22 Building is adequately insured. Although the tenant is obligated by their leases to pay property taxes, the property tax in 1996 was approximately $24,000.
Total consideration for the OPTO-22 Building paid by the Company was approximately $2,500,000. The total acquisition cost included $2,350,000 paid to the Seller, approximately $7,000 in legal, appraisal, audit and closing costs, and a $143,000 Acquisition Fee paid to Descolin, Incorporated, an affiliate of the Advisor. Financing of $1,750,000 was obtained from the Seller, with the remainder of the acquisition costs, approximately $779,000, paid in cash. The $1,750,000 financing was in the form of a ten year note, that is being amortized over a thirty year period. The note has an adjustable interest rate that began at approximately 7.0%, and will adjust to three hundred basis points (3.00%) above the Federal Reserve Board Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate every year. Payments on the note are currently $12,723 per month.
The purchase price was arrived at through arms-length negotiations with the Seller. The source of funds for the purchase were proceeds from the sales of the Company's Shares, and Seller-provided financing (the Seller is a large bank and lender).
The computation of depreciation is based on the cost of the OPTO-22 Property, including Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the OPTO-22 Property to the various asset is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation will be computed on a straight -line basis over the component useful life of the assets.
NORTH PALM STREET
On March 4, 1994, the Company acquired an industrial/research and development building located in Brea, California.
The Building was acquired for total consideration of $2,248,343. Seller financing of $1,000,000 was provided in order to allow for the purchase. This financing was in the form of two purchase money notes for $500,000 each, with one due an payable March 4, 1995 and the other due March 4, 1996. Payments were interest only at the rate of 8% and totaled $6,667 per month. The seller financing was refinanced in February 1995 with a $1,000,000 promissory note at a variable rate amortized over 25 years, secured by a Deed of Trust on the Brea property, interest rate is 9.5% until March 1, 2000 (and each succeeding March 1st) when the interest rate adjusts to the Moody's corporate bond index daily rate plus 0.125%, monthly principal and interest payments vary depending upon interest rates and are currently $8,737, and due March 1, 2020.
Constructed in 1989, the building contains approximately 42,000 rentable square feet, and is located within a master-planned business park. The building is currently leased to two tenants. M.L.E., which occupies 27,831 square feet, is a contract office furniture supplier. M.L.E., which has been in business since 1982, commenced their lease on February 1, 1991, and the lease terminates on May 31, 1999. The lease calls for payments of $11,143 per month. Surgical Technologies ("Surgical"), which occupies 14,100 square feet, provides contract sterilization, assembly, and packaging of medical devices. Surgical's lease runs from December 15, 1993 to December 14, 1999, with lease payments equal to $6,819 per month through December 14,1998 and $7,077 per month through December 14, 1999. Both the M.L.E. and Surgical leases are triple net.
The building is located in Brea, California in an established industrial area of North Orange County. Many of the economic factors pertaining to the OPTO-22 and Blockbuster Video Buildings pertain to this property as well.
The building and improvements are depreciated over 39 years using a straight- line method for both financial and income tax reporting purposes. The financial and tax bases for the property are the same. In the opinion of the Advisor, the property is adequately insured. The property is managed by WCRM.

JAVA CITY PROPERTY
On August 2, 1996, the Company acquired the investment described below (the "Java City Property" or the "Property"). The funds to acquire the Java City Property were available as the result of the sale of the Company's Shares in the previous offering, and the receipt of proceeds from bank financing assumed in connection with the acquisition.
The Java City Property consists of two single story light industrial buildings located in the Northgate Industrial Park in Sacramento, California. The addresses of the two properties are 717 and 721 West Del Paso Road. The building sites are in the northern part of Sacramento, with access to Interstate 80, Interstate 5, and other major freeways.
The buildings are located on a site of approximately 62,173 square feet. Total building square footage for both buildings is approximately 20,000 square feet. The subject lot is zoned M-1 industrial by the City of Sacramento. This zoning allows for a variety of uses, including the existing use. 721 West Del Paso Road consists of 8,964 total square feet and 717 West Del Paso Road consists of 11,035 total square feet. Per the provisions of the current lease, 721 West Del Paso consists of 4,347 rental square feet of warehouse space and 4,293 rental square feet of office space. Per the provisions of the current lease, 717 West Del Paso consists of 5,398 rentable square feet of warehouse space and 5,802 of rental square feet of office space. The properties were originally constructed in 1988. The Company believes that there are no deferred maintenance items that need to be corrected or addressed. The buildings are constructed using concrete footings (foundation and slab), wood frame wall designs, and flat/tar gravel roofs. The building has sprinklers for fire prevention and safety. There is adequate parking in the general business park area for cars that utilize the Property.
The primary tenant of the Property is Cucina Holdings, Inc. The company owns and operates forty-one Java City Bakery Cafes and five La Petite Boulangerie cafes. The Company is popularly known as "Java City". Java City outlets are located in various areas of California and Arizona, and are generally in high- visibility, high-traffic locations. These outlets sell high quality, specialty coffees in a pleasant retail environment setting. In addition, these outlets sell a selection of sandwiches and baked goods that complement the sale of coffee. Java City also operates a wholesale operation that serves approximately seven hundred customer accounts located primarily in Northern California. The Company's wholesale customers include supermarkets, gourmet shops, convenience stores, restaurants, universities, airports, and offices, some of which resell the coffee in whole bean form for home consumption, while others brew and sell coffee beverages. Approximately 86% of the Company's sales are from its retail cafe operations and 14% from its wholesale operations. The tenant was effectively formed in 1993 when Cucina Holdings, a corporation formed by current management and InterWest Partners (a Menlo Park Based venture capital firm), purchased the assets of la Petite Boulangerie from a private investor group in June 1993, and then purchased Java City in September 1993. Cucina Holdings and Java City are privately held, and not publicly traded companies.
Java City leases 100% of the rentable square feet in the two buildings located on the Property. Each building has a separate lease, and both leases are triple net leases. Both leases expire on August 1, 2003 and there are no options for extension or purchase of the Property. Java City operates its administrative offices, coffee bean processing, warehousing facilities, and a Java City retail outlet out of these two buildings.
The computation of depreciation for the Java City Property is based on the cost of the Property, including Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the Property to various asset categories is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over 39 years for both financial and income tax reporting purposes.
TYCOM PROPERTY
On January 17, 1997, the Company acquired the Tycom Property--- two story building, with underground parking, located at 17862 Fitch Street, Irvine, California. Total building square footage is approximately 63,225 square feet (both floors), while the property has 164 striped parking spaces. The building is approximately twelve years old. There are substantial new tenant improvements that were substantially complete at time of acquisition that will enhance the building for office usage. These improvements include improved air conditioning, Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, a complete fire sprinkler system, new electrical, new restrooms, and new carpet.
The sole tenant of the Property is Tycom Corporation ("Tycom" or "the Tenant"). Tycom, a privately held company, is a manufacturer of drill bits and assorted items used by the semi-conductor and dental industries, and has been in business for approximately ten years. The Tenant initially purchased this building and has invested approximately $1.4 million in improvements and renovations. Tycom sold the building to Brutten/Reynolds/Shidler Investment Corp. (the property's seller) on December 19, 1996 for an unknown amount. The Tenant began occupying the building on December 19, 1996, at which time the provisions of the lease became effective. The term of the lease is eleven years, and is intended to be a "triple-net" lease with the Tenant paying virtually all taxes, insurance, utilities, and other operating costs of the Property. The base rent is $37,302.75 per month.
Total consideration paid by the Company for the Tycom Property was $4,902,500. Financing was utilized in connection with the acquisition of the Tycom Property. A short-term 9.25% promissory note for $2,300,000 was provided by First National Bank of San Diego. The note provides for interest only payments of $17,729 and is due in full February 1, 1998. The Company plans on replacing this financing prior to the due date with a first trust deed mortgage from a bank.
The computation of depreciation for the Tycom Property is based on the cost of the property, including Acquisition Fees and Expenses. The allocation of the cost of the Property to various asset categories is estimated, based on allocations in the appraisal report. Depreciation is computed on a straight- line basis over the component useful life of the assets. The financial and tax bases for the property are the same. In the opinion of the Advisor, the Property is adequately insured. The Property is managed by West Coast Realty Management.

ITEM 3.
