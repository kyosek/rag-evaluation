PIPELINES
Our refined product pipelines transport light refined products from Holly’s Navajo Refinery in New Mexico and Alon’s Big Spring Refinery in Texas to their customers in the metropolitan and rural areas of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and northern Mexico. The refined products transported in these pipelines include conventional gasolines, federal, state and local specification reformulated gasoline, low-octane gasoline for oxygenate blending, distillates that include high- and low-sulfur diesel and jet fuel and LPGs (such as propane, butane and isobutane).
Our intermediate product pipelines consist of two parallel pipelines that originate at Holly’s Lovington, New Mexico refining facilities and terminate at Holly’s Artesia, New Mexico refining facilities. These pipelines transport intermediate feedstocks and crude oil for Holly’s refining operations in New Mexico.
Our pipelines are regularly inspected and are well maintained, and we believe they are in good repair. Generally, other than as provided in the pipelines and terminal agreements with Holly and Alon, all of our pipelines are unrestricted as to the direction in which product flows and the types of refined products that we can transport on them. The FERC regulates the transportation tariffs for interstate shipments on our refined product pipelines and state regulatory agencies regulate the transportation tariffs for intrastate shipments on our pipelines.

The following table details the average aggregate daily number of barrels of petroleum products transported on our pipelines in each of the periods set forth below for Holly and for third parties.
The following table sets forth certain operating data for each of our petroleum product pipelines. Except as shown below, we own 100% of our refined product pipelines. Throughput is the total average number of barrels per day transported on a pipeline, but does not aggregate barrels moved between different points on the same pipeline. Revenues reflect tariff revenues generated by barrels shipped from an origin to a delivery point on a pipeline. Revenues also include payments made by Alon under capacity lease arrangements on our Orla to El Paso pipeline. Under these arrangements, we provide space on our pipeline for the shipment of up to 20,000 barrels of refined product per day. Alon pays us whether or not it actually ships the full volumes of refined products it is entitled to ship. To the extent Alon does not use its capacity, we are entitled to use it. We calculate the capacity of our pipelines based on the throughput capacity for barrels of gasoline equivalent that may be transported in the existing configuration; in some cases, this includes the use of drag reducing agents.
For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, Holly shipped an aggregate of 52.6% and 50.4%, respectively, of the petroleum products transported on our refined product pipelines and 100% of the petroleum products transported on our Intermediate Pipelines. For the same periods, these pipelines transported approximately 95% of the light refined products produced by Holly’s Navajo Refinery.

Rio Grande Pipeline
We own a 70% interest in Rio Grande, a joint venture that owns a 249-mile, 8-inch common carrier LPG pipeline regulated by the FERC. The other owner of Rio Grande is a subsidiary of BP. The pipeline originates from a connection with an Enterprise pipeline in West Texas at Lawson Junction which serves as its primary receipt point, although there is an additional receipt point near Midland, Texas. The pipeline terminates at the Mexico border near San Elizario, Texas. The pipeline transports LPGs for ultimate use by Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX, the government-owned energy company of Mexico.) Rio Grande does not own any facilities or pipelines in Mexico. The pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 27,000 bpd. This pipeline was originally constructed in the mid 1950’s, was first reconditioned in 1988, and subsequently reconditioned in 1996 and 2003. Approximately 75 miles of this pipeline has been replaced with new pipe, and an additional 50 miles has been recoated.
Rio Grande was formed in 1996, at which time we contributed nearly 220 miles of pipeline from near Odessa, Texas to outside El Paso, Texas in exchange for a 25% interest in the joint venture. Rio Grande Pipeline began operations in 1997. In June 2003, we acquired an additional 45% interest in the joint venture from Juarez Pipeline Co., an affiliate of The Williams Companies, Inc., for $28.7 million. The pipeline has recently completed a reconditioning project that could facilitate an expansion to 32,000 bpd. Currently, only LPG’s are transported on this pipeline, and BP is the only shipper. BP’s contract provides that BP will ship a minimum average of 16,500 bpd for the duration of the agreement. This contract expires in July 2007, but will continue year-to-year thereafter unless cancelled by either party at the beginning of a contract year in which the contract was not cancelled. The tariff rates and shipping regulations are regulated by the FERC.
In January 2005, Rio Grande appointed us as operator of the pipeline system effective April 1, 2005 through January 31, 2010. We paid $745,000 to the then-current operator as an inducement to and consideration for its early resignation. As operator, we receive a management fee of $1.1 million per year, adjusted annually for any changes in the PPI.
An officer of HLS is one of the two members of Rio Grande’s management committee.

REFINED PRODUCT TERMINALS AND TRUCK RACKS
Our refined product terminals receive products from pipelines, Holly’s Navajo and Woods Cross refineries and Alon’s Big Spring Refinery. We then distribute them to Holly and third parties, who in turn deliver them to end-users and retail outlets. Our terminals are generally complementary to our pipeline assets and serve Holly’s and Alon’s marketing activities. Terminals play a key role in moving product to the end-user market by providing the following services:
•
distribution;
•
blending to achieve specified grades of gasoline;
•
other ancillary services that include the injection of additives and filtering of jet fuel; and
•
storage and inventory management.
Typically, our refined product terminal facilities consist of multiple storage tanks and are equipped with automated truck loading equipment that operates 24 hours a day. This automated system provides for control of security, allocations, and credit and carrier certification by remote input of data by our customers. In addition, nearly all of our terminals are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated blending to individual customer specifications.
Our refined product terminals derive most of their revenues from terminalling fees paid by customers. We charge a fee for transferring refined products from the terminal to trucks or to pipelines connected to the terminal. In addition to terminalling fees, we generate revenues by charging our customers fees for blending, injecting additives, and filtering jet fuel. Holly currently accounts for the substantial majority of our refined product terminal revenues.
The table below sets forth the total average throughput for our refined product terminals in each of the periods presented:

PIPELINE AND TERMINAL CONTROL OPERATIONS
All of our pipelines are operated via geosynchronous satellite, microwave, radio and frame relay communication systems from our central control room located in Artesia, New Mexico. We also monitor activity at our terminals from this control room.
The control center operates with modern, state-of-the-art System Control and Data Acquisition, or SCADA, systems. Our control center is equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor operational data, including refined product and crude oil throughput, flow rates, and pressures. In addition, the control center monitors alarms and throughput balances. The control center operates remote pumps, motors, engines, and valves associated with the delivery of refined products and crude oil. The computer systems are designed to enhance leak-detection capabilities, sound automatic alarms if operational conditions outside of pre-established parameters occur, and provide for remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations on the pipelines. Pump stations and meter-measurement points on the pipelines are linked by satellite or telephone communication systems for remote monitoring and control, which reduces our requirement for full-time on-site personnel at most of these locations.
