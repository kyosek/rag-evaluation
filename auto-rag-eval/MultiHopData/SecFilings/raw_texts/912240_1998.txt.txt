ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The MOB Properties consist of 25 high quality MOBs, an adjacent parking facility and two retail facilities and three MOBs indirectly-owned by the Company. The Senior Care Properties consist of 7 Senior Care Facilities and one hospital. As of January 31, 1999, the MOBs were approximately 92.8% leased to over 390 tenants and the Senior Care Properties were approximately 76.4% occupied. The Company's MOB tenants are primarily established medical practitioners representing a cross section of medical practices.
Description of the MOB Properties and Senior Care Properties
MOB Properties
The Company, through its MOB operations, acquires, develops, manages and leases MOBs, a parking facility and two retail facilities. Developing and managing MOBs differs from developing and managing conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of physicians and their patients. Because doctors now perform a variety of medical procedures in their offices, many MOBs have become sophisticated ambulatory centers that allow for outpatient surgery and procedures. In addition, MOBs generally have higher maintenance requirements in the public areas due to heavy foot traffic, many short appointments that increase demand on parking facilities, the use of sophisticated medical equipment requiring increased plumbing and electrical capacity and expanded environmental regulations that impose more stringent restrictions on the disposal of medical waste. The management of MOBs also generally requires experience in specialized tenant improvements and higher levels of responsiveness required by medical practitioners. Additional important management functions include the placement of tenants to accommodate increased space needs and managing the tenant mix at properties to facilitate referrals by practitioners with different specialties within the building. The Company stresses meeting these and other special demands of MOB tenants.
Senior Care Properties
The Company, as part of its overall strategy, acquires, develops and leases Senior Care Facilities. The Company leases its Senior Care Properties to third party senior care operators. The operation of Senior Care Facilities requires a high level of experience and expertise due to the specific needs of the residents and the complex administrative functions surrounding the admission and care of residents and the administering of government programs. The operators of Senior Care Facilities must also maintain a positive relationship with local hospitals and other medical providers in order to attract new residents. The Company considers all of the above factors when leasing its facilities to third party operators.
The health care industry is facing various challenges, including increased government and private payor pressure to reduce medical delivery costs. Substantially all of the Company's tenants are in the medical profession and could be adversely affected by the new Medicare prospective payment system, cost containment and other health care reform proposals. Proposals that limit access to medical care or reduce reimbursement for physicians' services may impact the ability of the Company's tenants to pay rent. However, the Company believes that the aging population in the United States, combined with other recent trends in the health care industry, such as the performance of non-acute procedures outside of hospitals, could spur increased demand for space in full service MOBs that contain surgery centers and out-patient facilities, such as those owned by the Company.
The following tables set forth certain information regarding each of the MOB Properties and Senior Care Properties as of January 31, 1999. All of the MOB Properties and Senior Care Properties are held in fee by the Company or, in the case of jointly-owned properties, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company.

Leases
MOB Properties
As of January 31, 1999, the MOB Properties were approximately 92.8% leased. New leases and extensions are normally granted for a minimum of five years and provide for annual rent increases. Office tenants generally have gross leases whereby rents may be adjusted for a tenant's proportionate share of any increases in the cost of operating the building. Most retail tenants have net leases and pay their share of all operating expenses including property taxes and insurance. The following is a lease expiration table setting forth the number, square feet and associated annual rent for those leases expiring in future years.
MOB Properties--Lease Expirations
_______________________________________________ 1) Does not include month-to-month leases or vacant space. There are 86 month-to-month tenants who occupy approximately 93,000 square feet of space and pay approximately $185,000 per month in rent.
The Company was successful in obtaining lease renewals, achieving a weighted average renewal rate of approximately 86.7% on MOB leases that expired during 1998. Although there can be no assurance that this renewal level will be maintained, the Company believes this high renewal rate is due in part to the tendency of medical practitioners to continue to practice in the same space over a number of years. Also, the Company's tenants frequently invest large sums of money in equipment and fixtures for their offices. Furthermore, relocating a doctor's office can be disruptive to the patients who are familiar with the doctor's office location.
The following table sets forth the scheduled annual rent increases for the leases with respect to the MOB Properties in effect at December 31, 1998.
MOB Properties--Rent Increases
______________________________ 1) Does not include 1.4% and 6.2% of the total rented square feet, which is management and vacant space, respectively. 2) Percent of total rented square feet that has been rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent. 3) Approximately 21% of these leases are month-to-month.

Senior Care Loans
Lending Operations
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had ten loans outstanding which total approximately $15.6 million before reserves of $3.5 million. Two of the ten loans, which total approximately $12.9 million before reserves, are first deeds of trust secured by healthcare facilities in California and Maryland. The ten loans are described in the following paragraphs.
On June 17, 1996, the Company funded a $6.1 million loan for the acquisition of a nursing home facility in Baltimore, Maryland (the "Carroll Manor facility") by Heritage Care, Inc. ("Heritage Care"), a non-profit corporation. The Company received a first deed of trust on that facility and Carroll Manor, Inc. ("Carroll Manor"), the seller, received a second deed of trust which secures its $500,000 loan to Heritage Care. Heritage Care is currently in default under the $6.1 million loan, which matured on March 31, 1997 (including loan extensions) and which currently bears interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum (the default rate). The balance owing on the loan as of December 31, 1998 is $9.3 million. In addition to the $6.1 million, the Company made additional advances in 1997, which total $2.6 million, to enable Heritage Care to meet its payroll and other current expenses necessary to remain in operation and thereby protect the value of the Company's security interest in the Carroll Manor facility. The additional advances are secured by the Company's first deed of trust pursuant to the language thereof and are therefore secured loans, although they are subordinate in priority to the $500,000 second trust deed in favor of Carroll Manor. The facility is currently being operated by Future Care, an experienced Maryland operator of nursing homes. Future Care took over operations on or about June 1997 and has turned around the operations and has substantially increased the occupancy and therefore the profitability of the facility. As a result, the Company received $1.0 million in debt service payments from the facility in 1998. During 1998, the Carroll Manor facility was appraised for $11.5 million and the Company is currently reviewing its exit strategies with respect to the loan to Heritage Care, which include the possibility of (i) causing the transfer of the Carroll Manor facility to another non-profit entity that could obtain long-term financing to replace the existing indebtedness or (ii) taking title to the facility through foreclosure and subsequently leasing it to an operator or selling it to a third party.
In December 1997, the Company funded $4.6 million into an escrow, to be loaned to Aspen Paso Robles, Inc. ("Aspen") at the close of escrow. This loan was to be secured by (i) a 59-bed nursing and rehabilitation center in Chico, California; (ii) a 38-bed skilled nursing facility in Paso Robles, California; and (iii) a 57-bed intermediate care center in Beaumont, California. The loan closed on February 25, 1998 although certain funds were held in escrow pending the close of the Chico and Beaumont facilities. The purchase of the Chico facility subsequently closed. The funds for the Beaumont facility remained in escrow until October 1998 at which time the Company secured the return of those funds and applied them to pay down the loan balance to $3.6 million. The remaining $3.6 million balance of the loan is currently in default and the two facilities securing the loan have been closed. The Company is currently reviewing its options concerning the recovery of this loan, which include (i) taking title to the facilities through foreclosure and subsequently leasing them to an operator or selling them to a third party and (ii) pursuing legal action against the borrower and others based on allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the loan, the Company has increased its loan loss reserves for a portion of the outstanding loan balance.
On April 25, 1996, the Company entered into a loan participation agreement with Iatros to fund two loans secured by third and fifth trust deeds in the amount of approximately $750,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, to facilitate the purchase of a nursing home in Olathe, Kansas (the "Crystal Park facility"). Following the acquisition of the Crystal Park facility, the borrower engaged an affiliate of Iatros to operate the facility. On May 16, 1997, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and engaged a new operator for the Crystal Park facility, which has since closed. As of September 30, 1997, the Company's interest in the third and fifth trust deeds was approximately $1.3 million, including principal (at face value) and accrued, unpaid interest. In October 1997, the Company assigned its remaining interest in the participation agreement and the promissory notes to Iatros in exchange for an $800,000 note and title to the accounts receivable of the former owner of the facility which had served as additional collateral for the promissory note. The Company is still in the process of collecting
these accounts receivable. The $800,000 note is due October 1, 2004 and accrues interest at 10.0% per annum. Interest payments are due monthly based upon 5.0% per annum of the outstanding balance. The promissory note is currently in default and the Company has deemed it appropriate to reserve for this note.
In addition to the notes on the Carroll Manor and Aspen facilities and the $800,000 note due from Iatros, the Company had seven other loans outstanding at December 31, 1998, with an aggregate face value of $1.7 million, excluding approximately $0.3 million of additional accrued, unpaid interest. The following is a summary of the seven other loans as of December 31, 1998:
. $150,000 note secured by second deed of trust, interest payable semiannually at a rate of 10.0% per annum.
. $300,000 unsecured promissory note issued by Iatros due May 31, 1999, interest payable quarterly at 9.0% per annum. This note is currently in default because no interest payments have been made.
. $47,000 unsecured promissory note issued by Iatros due January 23, 1998, interest accrues at 14.0% per annum. This note is currently in default.
. $300,000 unsecured promissory note due April 1, 2003, interest payable quarterly at 8.0% per annum. This note is currently in default and accrues interest at the default rate of 12.0% per annum.
. $715,000 unsecured promissory notes payable upon demand, interest accrues at 12.0% per annum.
. $115,000 unsecured credit line due May 31, 1998, interest payable annually at 12.0% per annum. Unpaid principal accrues interest at 12.0% per annum after maturity date. This amount is currently in default.
. $44,000 unsecured promissory note due June 30, 1999, interest payable at 10.0% per annum.
Due to uncertainties, related to the Company's portfolio of mortgage loans and bonds receivable, the Company increased its reserves for doubtful notes receivable from $0.8 million at the end of 1997 to $3.5 million as of December 31, 1998. Management believes that $3.5 million is appropriate in relation to the status of the loans in the Company's portfolio as of March 19, 1999.
GLN
GLN was formed with Nomura for the purpose of making short-term loans to third parties to purchase senior care facilities. GLN funded two loans during 1997, one of which was repaid in February 1998. Also in 1997, GLN purchased the Company's Series A and B bonds issued by the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency, Inc. that were secured by the Hampden Properties. These bonds were repaid in late 1997 in full satisfaction of the outstanding balance. Since 1997, GLN has not funded any additional loans. Due to market conditions and other financial constraints, it does not appear likely that GLN will be used by the Company or Nomura to make future loans. Any future lending activities involving the Company will most likely be performed directly by the Company. As of December 31, 1998, GLN had one loan outstanding.
In May 1997, GLN acquired a 50% limited partnership interest in a limited partnership created to acquire a recreational vehicle (''RV'') park in Florida for approximately $1.2 million. In connection with the acquisition of the RV park, GLN funded a secured loan of approximately $1.5 million to the limited partnership. This loan bears interest at a rate of approximately 9.0% per annum, matures on May 1, 1999, and provides for monthly payments of interest only. At maturity, the full $1.5 million will be due. As of December 31, 1998, monthly interest payments had not been made since March 1998. However, management does anticipate the repayment of this loan along with accrued interest in 1999. The RV park is operated by Camper Clubs of America, Inc., (''Camper Clubs'') the largest RV park operator in the U.S. and a limited partner in the limited partnership.
Insurance
The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to the MOB Properties and Senior Care Properties. There are certain types of losses which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable; moreover, there can be no assurance that policies maintained by the Company will be adequate in the event of a loss. The Company carries earthquake and flood insurance for coverage of losses up to $35 million on the MOB Properties and Senior Care Properties located in California and Arizona, which amount represents approximately 23% of the net book value of these properties. This coverage is subject to a 10% deductible up to the amount of insured loss. The Senior Care Properties located in Washington and Massachusetts do not carry earthquake or flood insurance. Twenty-four of the 36 properties directly owned by the Company are located in Southern California, which has a history of seismic activity, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake that damaged the Holy Cross Medical Plaza property. Two Senior Care Properties owned by the Company are located in Phoenix, Arizona, in an area with a history of flood activity. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in, and anticipated earnings and cash flow from, a property.
