Montana Tunnels Mine
The mine was originally owned and operated by Pegasus Gold, a mining company incorporated in Canada. The mine commenced operations in 1987 and in 1998, Pegasus filed for bankruptcy. In 2002, Apollo purchased Montana Tunnels Mining, Inc. (“MTMI”), from the receiver in the bankruptcy proceeding.

On July 28, 2006, Apollo entered into a joint venture (“JV Agreement”) with Elkhorn Tunnels LLC (“Elkhorn”), in respect of the Mine. The JV Agreement called for Elkhorn to contribute $13 million in return for a 50% interest in the Mine. Apollo is the operator of the mine.
Location
The Mine is an open pit, poly-metallic mine and mill located about five miles west of Jefferson City, Montana. The Mine is located in the historic “Wickes-Corbin” mining district in Section 8 of Township 7 North, Range 4 West, Jefferson County. The Mine’s elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,300 feet with moderately mountainous topography. The Mine is easily accessible by way of interstate highway and paved roads. The mine and mill receive power supply from Northwestern Energy from overland power lines.
Production
At Montana Tunnels the mining of the open pit was suspended on October 21, 2005 for safety reasons due to increased wall activity on the eastern side of the open pit. Following suspension of mining, the mill continued to process ore from stockpiled low grade material and produce gold doré and lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates until May 12, 2006 when all operations ceased and the property was placed on care and maintenance.
Following the signing of the JV Agreement the Mine commenced an open pit wall remediation program on August 10, 2006, which called for removal of approximately 7 million tons of waste over a six month period and encompassed the laying back of the east and south east sectors of the pit wall and rebuilding the access ramp to the pit bottom. Upon reaching the open pit bottom in January 2007, waste material removal commenced to expose the ore body. Mill personnel were hired in late 2006 and early 2007 to begin maintenance work in preparation for the mill start up which occurred on March 1, 2007.
For the ten months of operation ending December 31, 2007, the mill processed 3,971,000 tons of ore producing gold doré and lead-gold and zinc-gold concentrates containing 37,300 ounces of gold, 659,000 ounces of silver, 12,162,000 pounds of lead and 28,576,000 million pounds of zinc. Payable metal is shown in the table below.
Montana Tunnels Mine Production History
Statistics for 2007 below are for 100% of the Montana Tunnels mine, Apollo’s share of production is 50%
(1)
Only 10 months of ore processing (March to December)
(2)
Only 5 months of ore processing (January to May)
The mine has produced the following aggregate amounts of the listed metals from its inception in 1987 through December 31, 2007:
Description of Land, Geology, Process and Equipment
Property Ownership Status.
More than 99% of the Montana Tunnels mineable deposit is overlain by private property wholly owned by MTMI. One 0.3 acre BLM parcel is controlled by an unpatented mining claim. More than 90% of the property located within the permit boundary is private property owned by MTMI. In October 2007 Montana Tunnels purchased an additional private parcel of land to secure a 1,000 foot section of the mine access road. Properties controlled by MTMI in the vicinity of the mine and the permit boundary are summarized in the table below:
Property Holdings
Royalty.
None of the royalties listed below apply to the currently permitted L Pit reserve deposit. The design layback of the M Pit encompasses a very small amount of mineralized material beneath three leased patented claims in the Clancy Creek area. Ores mined from these claims will be minimal and subject to a 4.5% net smelter royalty (“NSR”).
Royalty Agreements
Geology.
The Montana Tunnels deposit is hosted in the central part of the diatreme, an upward-sloping passage forced through sedimentary rock by volcanic activity. The diatreme is a heterolithic breccia, characterized by a sand-size fragmented matrix of quartz latitic composition surrounding subangular to well-rounded fragments of Cretaceous Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics, Tertiary Lowland Creek Volcanics, and clasts derived from the Cretaceous Butte Quartz Monzonite pluton.
There are two main zones of mineralization at Montana Tunnels: (i) a central, pipe-like core of contiguous mineralization, and (ii) discontinuous zones of mineralization peripheral to the core deposit, termed fringe mineralization. The core of the deposit in plan view is oblong in shape and ranges from about 200 feet to 1000 feet in width, and from 1400 to 2000 feet in length, with a vertical extent of at least 2000 feet. The core zone strikes approximately N30 E and dips steeply (60 degrees to 80 degrees) to the northwest. Metallurgical projections are based on historical feed grade versus tails grade trends; mill throughput tonnage, ore properties relative to pit location and bench elevation; and ore blending requirements.
Process and Equipment.
Open pit mining at Montana Tunnels is conducted 24 hours per day seven days per week. Mining is performed by two shovels, twelve 150 ton and two 85 ton haul trucks in addition to ancillary equipment. When operational, mine production currently averages approximately 30,000 tons per day of ore and waste.
When in full production a primary and secondary crusher is used, in series, to generate a coarse ore stockpile ahead of the concentrator. The crusher has an approximate capacity of 16,500 tons per day. The grinding circuit consists of a SAG mill, ball mill and tertiary crusher (SABC circuit) followed by conventional differential flotation. A gravity circuit, in closed loop with the ball mill, recovers 10-15% of gold produced by the concentrator. The remainder of the mill’s production is in the form of concentrates: a zinc-gold concentrate and a lead-gold-silver concentrate. The concentrates are shipped, via rail, to a smelter. The original plant was constructed during 1986 and 1987, and is currently in good working order.
At the same time Apollo entered into the JV Agreement, Apollo also entered into two other agreements with Elkhorn Goldfields Inc. (“EGI”), an affiliate of Elkhorn. The first agreement is an option agreement pursuant to which EGI was granted an option to purchase Apollo’s Diamond Hill mine for $0.8 million. The option has an exercise term of two years. The underground Diamond Hill gold mine is situated 28 miles southeast of Helena, Montana and has been on care and maintenance since 2000.
The second agreement is a custom milling agreement pursuant to which EGI will have the right to have MTMI process the ore from EGI’s Elkhorn mine, located 20 miles to the south of the Montana Tunnels mine, through the 1,000 ton per day Diamond Hill mill which is situated within the Montana Tunnels mill complex. The custom milling agreement also gives EGI a two-year option to purchase the Diamond Hill mill for $1.0 million.
Mineral Reserves
The table below shows the mineral reserves at Montana Tunnels.
Montana Tunnels Mine Reserve Statement at December 31, 2007(1)
(Apollo’s 50% interest)
(1)
Recovery rates are expected to be 80% for gold, 71% for silver, 85% for lead, and 84% for zinc.
The three years average metal prices for 2005 - 2007 were used for the calculation of the year-end 2007 reserves, which are as follows:
Environmental
The permitted plan of operations allows mining of ore reserves from the L Pit mine design. Unstable pit walls in the ramp sector on the east side of the mine closed down the open pit in October 2005. A pit wall layback and pit ramp reconstruction in the east sector of the open pit was subsequently developed using extensive geotechnical analysis to ensure stability and safety for ongoing mining operations. A permit revision for the pit wall layback and associated changes was approved by the Department of Environmental Quality in December 2005. This work was initiated in August 2006 following completion of the JV Agreement with Elkhorn.
Following the closure of the open pit in October 2005, milling of low grade stockpiles continued until May 2006 at which time the mill was shut down and the property placed on care and maintenance. As a result of the unplanned milling of the low grade stockpiles, a revision to the operating permit was obtained in the fourth quarter of 2006 allowing the Mine to raise the tailings embankment thus increasing the tailings capacity to accommodate the mill tailings from the L Pit ore reserves. The raising of the tailings embankment was completed during 2007.
A major mine plan amendment continues to progress through an Environmental Impact Statement permitting process. If approved by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and Bureau of Land Management, the M Pit mine expansion amendment would provide approximately 35 million tons of additional ore for processing and add approximately seven years to the life of the mine.
The current bonding requirements for the Montana Tunnels L Pit mine are met by the following bond instruments:
(1)
Apollo’s share of the amounts shown is 50%.
National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, a unit of Continental Casualty Company (“CNA”), provides $14,988,000 of the total reclamation bonding for the Montana Tunnels mine plan of operations at a deferred bond premium cost of $14 per $1,000 of bonding under a Term Bonding Agreement dated August 1, 2002.
Bonding requirements are subject to adjustment by the State of Montana for various reasons from time to time.
Drilling
As of December 31, 2007, the Montana Tunnels mine database contains 896 reverse circulation, rotary, core and blasthole drill holes, totaling 470,299 feet that were drilled from the mid-1970s to the present by numerous mining and exploration companies.
From through 2004 thirteen reverse-circulation holes for 11,000 feet were drilled to increase confidence levels in the M Pit reserve. The drill holes were placed as mine development phases provided locations to collar specific holes. Results from both the 2002 and 2004 drilling programs were favorable, providing a higher degree of definition to the current ore reserve and established the geometric distribution of the polymetallic grade mineralization in the M Pit design.
The Montana Tunnels mine drill hole spacing is generally within the gold variogram range of 30 feet to 140 feet in the core.
Black Fox Project
The Black Fox property was formerly known as the Glimmer mine. In April 1996, Exall Resources Ltd. (“Exall”) purchased 60% of the property from Hemlo Gold Inc., and Glimmer Resource Inc. (“Glimmer”) held the remaining 40%.
In September 2002, we purchased all of the real estate and related assets of the Glimmer Mine from Exall and Glimmer. The mine, which ceased operations in May 2001, was renamed Black Fox. Apollo paid Exall and Glimmer an aggregate purchase price consisting of Cdn$3 million in cash and an aggregate of 2,080,000 of our common shares. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, an additional Cdn$3 million was payable to Exall and Glimmer. This additional sum of Cdn$3 million was paid on January 6, 2006.
From until 2001, the mine produced approximately 210,000 ounces of gold.
Figure - Black Fox Project location along Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone in Province of Ontario, Canada
Location
The Black Fox Project is located approximately five miles east of the township of Matheson and 40 miles east of Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The property encompasses over 2,702 acres within the Hislop and Beatty Townships. Access and surface rights are owned solely by Apollo. The property is easily accessible by interstate highway and power is supplied by Hydro One.
Black Fox sits astride the Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone (DPFZ), which is a deep break in the Precambrian rocks of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. This fault system hosts many of the deposits in the Timmins area. The system regionally strikes east-west and dips variably to the south. Black Fox lies on the southern limb of a large scale fold on a flexure in the DPFZ Fault where the strike changes from east-west to southeast. Folded and altered ultra mafic and mafic are the host rocks for mineralization. Gold occurs as free gold in quartz veining and stockworks in altered ultra mafics and in gold associated with pyrite in altered tholeiitic basalts.
Property, plant and equipment at the mine consists of an administration office, change house facilities, core sheds and surface infrastructure for the mine (pumps, heating, etc.), all of which are in good working condition.
The Black Fox Project consists of Apollo owned lands of 2,236 acres, 319 acres of leased properties and 147 acres of mining claims.
None of the currently defined resources or reserves are subject to production royalties. However, Apollo owns properties totaling 1,414 acres that are subject to net smelter return royalties, ranging from 2.0% to 3.25%, if there is production in the future from any reserves found on that property.
Exploration and Development 2003-2006
In 2003, we commenced a drilling program which was concluded at the beginning of 2006 at which time we had completed 453 surface core holes and 386 underground core holes for a total of 839 holes giving a total of 206,000 meters.
Mineral Reserves
The probable mineral reserves estimates disclosed below for Black Fox were in a NI 43-101 report completed in August 2007 and were calculated based on a gold price of $525 per ounce. The average total cash cost per ounce of gold production was calculated at $236 per ounce.
Black Fox Probable Reserve Statement as of December 31, 2007
(1)
Underground reserves include dilution of 66,000 tonnes of indicated material with an average grade of 1.26 g/t Au.
The reserve estimates were based on information from 1,826 drill holes totaling 324,625 meters. All assays over 170 grams of gold per tonne (5.5 oz of gold per ton) were capped at this level, representing 0.25% of the assays.
Combined Open Pit and Underground Economics
The pre-feasibility study economics, using reserves only, assuming a gold price of US$525 per ounce and assuming a milling capacity of 1,500 tonnes per day showed a Net Present Value (“NPV”) of US$104 million at a 4% discount rate and an Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) of 33%. The total cash cost per ounce of gold produced was calculated at $236 per ounce. Various gold prices with associated NPV’s at a 4% discount rate and IRR’s are as follows:

Note: Based on Life of Mine (“LOM”) costs for open pit and underground mining as well as toll and owner operated milling.
Capital Costs (LOM and sustaining capital)
The pre-feasibility study assumed that mining would commence in 2009 with ore being toll treated initially and then treated by an on-site mill from 2012 onwards.
Recommendations
Contained within the August 2007 NI 43-101 there were two main recommendations made by SRK Consulting (US), Inc.(“SRK”):
1.
Continue with the advanced feasibility level studies for the project including commissioning the bankable feasibility project as soon as possible;
2.
Continue to core drill specific areas of the ore body to further upgrade and extend the geological modeling for the project;
The report further stated, “At the time of this report, SRK has provided Apollo a listing of approximately 62 drill holes of additional required drilling. The main focus of this campaign would be to target infill areas of known mineralization in order to convert inferred resource into indicated category and subsequently incorporate into a reserve.”
Following a review of the NI 43-101 Apollo implemented the recommended drilling program at Black Fox starting August 2007.
Exploration and Development 2007
During 2007 a further 66 holes were added to the surface and underground drilling programs. As of December 31, 2007, Apollo had completed a total of 504 surface diamond drill holes, totaling 149,548 meters as well as 396 underground holes totaling 78,644 meters giving a to-date total for both of 228,192 meters.
Apollo’s drilling supplemented the data from the 286 surface and 707 underground drill holes drilled by the previous owners. A table of total drill holes is shown below.
Black Fox Project Drill Hole Database
Following the recommendation of the August 2007 NI 43-101 we commenced an infill drilling program in August 2007 consisting of 66 core drill holes, 41 surface holes and 25 underground core holes. This drill program was completed in December 2007 and the results and assays of which were included within a new reserve statement announced by us on February 29, 2008 showing an increase in the gold reserve of 328,000 ounces to a total gold reserve of 1,330,000 ounces. We expect to file a NI 43-101 report within 45 days of February 29, 2008. We expect the NI 43-101 to be a full feasibility study done to a bankable standard (“bankable feasibility study”). A bankable feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis of a project’s economics (+/- 15% precision) used by the banking industry for financing purposes.
Permitting of the project began in 2005 and progressed well during 2007 with the concept of a combined open pit and underground operation with a 1,500 tonnes per day on-site mill. The permitting assumes that mining would commence in late 2008 or early 2009 with ore being toll treated initially and then treated by the on-site mill from onwards.
Black Fox Reserves at February 29, 2008
On February 29, 2008, we announced a new reserve statement that incorporates the results of the infill drilling program. We expect to file a NI 43-101 report within 45 days of February 29, 2008. We expect the NI 43-101 to be a full feasibility study done to a bankable standard. The probable mineral reserve was calculated based on a gold price of US$650/oz.
Black Fox Probable Reserve Statement as of February 29, 2008

Underground reserves assume 95% mining recovery 17% planned dilution and 5% unplanned dilution both at 0 grams per tonne grade.
Bonding
We met the bonding requirement of Cdn$644,650, established by the Province of Ontario, for the Black Fox Project through a letter of credit issued by TD Canada Trust secured by a pledged deposit account of Cdn$644,650.
The obligations to reimburse TD Canada Trust for any drawing under the letter of credit are secured by Apollo’s maintenance of an amount equal to the amount available for drawing in a deposit account pledged to TD Canada Trust. The annual letter of credit fee is 1% of the amount available for drawing. Interest is earned on the deposit account at a rate established by TD Canada Trust from time to time.
Exploration Stage Properties
Huizopa
We own Mexican subsidiaries which own 100% of the concessions at the Huizopa exploration project. Pursuant to an agreement with the previous owner (the “Previous Owner”) of one of those Mexican subsidiaries, we have a joint venture with the Previous Owner with Apollo holding an 80% interest and the Previous Owner holding a 20% free carry interest. If our Mexican subsidiary chooses not to go forward with the Huizopa project, it is obligated to transfer a controlling interest in the subsidiary that holds the option back to the Previous Owner, and to transfer 91% of the concessions it owns at the Huizopa project back to the Previous Owner.
The Huizopa project is located in the northern part of the Sierra Madres in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, near the border with the State of Sonora, and encompasses a block of mining concession claims of approximately 170 sq. km. During 2007, we acquired new claims to the east of our holdings that expanded our land position from 128 sq. km. to 170 sq. km.
Huizopa is located about 17 km southwest of the Dolores project and approximately 33 km to the northeast of the Mulatos project. Mulatos and Dolores are both multi-million ounce gold-silver deposits owned by other companies that are currently in development. Sporadic shallow underground mining limited to a few high-grade zones was done in the past but no mining has taken place at Huizopa since 1936. The property is very remote and will be accessed initially by helicopter. To maintain the exploration and exploitation rights for the “Rosa” and “Donna” concessions, we were required to pay $0.1 million in April 2007 and $1.5 million (plus applicable taxes in Mexico) in October 2007. These concessions represent approximately 17% of the Huizopa property. These payments were made ahead of schedule on February 28, 2007 when the Company issued 1,000,000 shares and paid $2.55 million in settlement of these contractual land payments and certain other claims on its Huizopa properties.
The geology is characterized by a series of parallel, low sulfidation gold-silver, quartz veins hosted by Tertiary-age volcanic rocks. Silver to gold ratios in the veins and from the material on historic mine dumps indicate the Huizopa area hosts an extensive gold-bearing hydrothermal system. Two major parallel quartz vein systems with north trending structures contain many single vein outcrops to 10 meters thick suggesting a series of stacked veins. Strike lengths are over 2.0 km on the property with untested down dip potential. The stratigraphy of the Huizopa area has two sections of relatively mafic lava flows with intercalated volcanic clastics. The dominant strike azimuths of faults are 340º and 160º with dips ranging from vertical to 33º. Most of these structures, including the major faults with associated thick gouge or breccia zones, dip eastward. These east dipping faults are the faults associated with quartz veins, brecciation, and mineralization.
Initial favorable geochemical sampling and field studies by the Previous Owner in December 2003 were confirmed by us when we reviewed the data and conducted a field evaluation in 2004.
We established an extensive remote field camp at the project and refurbished an existing airstrip. The camp is supplied by fixed wing aircraft and helicopter.
Mapping of the mining concession began in June 2004 and have been ongoing through 2007. The results were compiled and transferred to new topography maps and air photos as well as the Mexican government’s Chabacan topographical sheet which has been enlarged from 1:50,000 scale to 1:10,000. Geologic mapping suggests that the faults that host gold-silver mineralization may be more numerous and more continuous than earlier field work indicated. Petrographical examination revealed the presence of native gold, silver, and electrum in many samples and widespread vein features indicative of repeated boiling and explosive brecciation. Overall vein textures are consistent with high-level exposures of epithermal quartz-adularia and/or fault breccia veins.
In 2006, a geophysical program was initiated on the property and the process to select initial drilling targets commenced in 2007. High quality drill targets were selected and a contract signed with a drilling contractor to commence helicopter supported core drilling in 2008. This initial drilling program commenced in February 2008 and is for 30 to 40 shallow core drill holes.
In the first quarter of 2006, Apollo entered into an agreement with the Ejido Huizopa (the “Ejido”), which is a group of local inhabitants who, under Mexican law, are granted rights to conduct agricultural activities and control surface access on the property. Pursuant to the agreement, and in consideration for certain payments to the Ejido, the Company has a right to use Ejido land covering the Company’s mining concessions in Huizopa for all activities necessary for the exploration, development, and production of potential ore deposits in our Huizopa project area. The Company may, in the future, apply for a change of use of land without any additional obligations to the Ejido. In addition, the Company may traverse adjoining and nearby Ejido land outside the boundaries of the Huizopa mining concessions for the purpose of constructing, operating, and maintaining improvements or facilities necessary for the Huizopa project.
In engineering, permitting and right of way issues were addressed in contemplation of the construction of a dirt road in 2008 to allow easier access to the site. Following construction of the road we anticipate that a second drill program, which will not require helicopter assistance, could commence consisting of both core drilling and reverse circulation drilling.
Diamond Hill
The Diamond Hill mine, which has been on care and maintenance since 2000, is owned by Montana Tunnels Mining, Inc. The mine is an underground gold mine and is located approximately 28 miles southeast of Helena, Montana, in Broadwater County and on the east flank of the Elkhorn Mountains, within the Hassel Mining District. The Diamond Hill mine was in production from 1996 to 2000, during which time, 775,000 tons of ore were mined at an average grade of 0.233 ounces of gold per ton.
On July 28, 2006, Apollo entered into an agreement with Elkhorn Goldfields Inc. (“EGI”), an affiliate of Elkhorn. The agreement is an option agreement pursuant to which EGI was granted an option to purchase the Diamond Hill mine for $0.8 million. The option has an exercise term of two years.
The Diamond Hill mine covers over 2,590 acres of patented and unpatented claims. We have 100% ownership of the main patented claims that contain the current deposits, subject to a 0.5 to 1% net smelter return and a 10% net profits royalty. We also have 50% ownership of four additional patented claims, which are peripheral to the main land package. As of December 31, 2007, we hold 103 unpatented claims and lease 19 unpatented claims. The current mine permit covers 270 acres with most of the disturbance within a 27 acre area.
The Diamond Hill ore bodies and mine workings are in solid unfractured rock and accordingly are amenable to low cost sublevel open stoping methods. Ore was transported to the Montana Tunnels mill facility by truck where it was processed in a separate circuit designed for Diamond Hill ore. Most of the gold was recovered into a high grade pyrite concentrate and sold to Japanese smelters. The deposit is classed as a skarn hosted sulfide deposit where the predominant ore mineralogy is gold associated with pyrite and lesser other metal sulfides.
The bonding requirements for Diamond Hill, totaling approximately $623,000, are incorporated as part of the bonding at Montana Tunnels.
ITEM 3.
