Item 2. Properties.
The following sections provide information regarding our principal plants, pipelines and other assets by segment. For information regarding our significant historical throughput, production and processing rates, please read Item 7 of this annual report.
Our real property holdings fall into two basic categories: (i) parcels that we and our unconsolidated affiliates own in fee (e.g., we own the land upon which our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator is constructed) and (ii) parcels in which our interests and those of our unconsolidated affiliates are derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations. The fee sites upon which our significant facilities are
located have been owned by us or our predecessors in title for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to such fee sites. We and our unconsolidated affiliates have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our rights pursuant to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license, and we believe that we have satisfactory rights pursuant to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
NGL Pipelines & Services
The following table summarizes the significant NGL pipelines and related storage assets of our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment at February 1, 2006.
(1)
The maximum number of barrels that these systems can transport per day depends upon the operating balance achieved at a given time between various segments of the systems. Because the balance is dependent upon the mix of products to be shipped and the demand levels at the various delivery points, the exact capacities of the systems cannot be stated. We measure the utilization rates of our NGL pipelines in terms of throughput (on a net basis in accordance with our ownership interest). Total net volumes for our NGL pipelines during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 1,360 MBPD, 1,343 MBPD and 1,196 MBPD, respectively.
(2)
This system crosses thirteen states: Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
(3)
We hold a 65.9% interest in this system through a majority owned subsidiary, Dixie Pipeline Company (“Dixie”).
(4)
We hold a 90% interest in this system through a majority owned subsidiary, Seminole Pipeline Company (“Seminole”).
(5)
Acquired in connection with the GulfTerra Merger in September 2004.
(6)
Of the 655 total miles for this system, we own 100% of 559 miles; 44.3% of 53 miles; and 32.2% of the remaining 43 miles.
(7)
Our ownership interest in this pipeline is held indirectly through our equity method investment in K/D/S Promix LLC (“Promix”).

The following information highlights the general use of each of our principal NGL pipelines. We operate our NGL pipelines with the exception of Tri-States and a small portion of the Louisiana Pipeline System.
§
The Mid-America Pipeline System is a regulated NGL pipeline system consisting of three primary segments: the 2,548-mile Rocky Mountain pipeline, the 2,740-mile Conway North pipeline and
the 1,938-mile Conway South pipeline. The Rocky Mountain pipeline transports mixed NGLs from the Rocky Mountain Overthrust and San Juan Basin areas to the Hobbs hub located on the Texas-New Mexico border. The Conway North segment links the NGL hub at Conway, Kansas to refineries, petrochemical plants and propane markets in the upper Midwest. In addition, the Conway North segment has access to NGL supplies from Canada’s Western Sedimentary Basin through third-party connections. The Conway South pipeline connects the Conway hub with Kansas refineries and transports NGLs from Conway, Kansas to the Hobbs hub (with interconnections with our Seminole pipeline at the Hobbs hub). We also own fifteen unregulated propane terminals that are an integral part of the Mid-America Pipeline System.
Approximately 60% of the volumes transported on the Mid-America system are mixed NGLs originating from natural gas processing plants located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Hugoton Basin of southwestern Kansas, the San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico, and the Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. The remaining volumes are generally purity NGL products originating from NGL fractionators in the mid-continent areas of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, as well as deliveries from Canada.
§
The Dixie Pipeline is a regulated propane pipeline extending from southeast Texas and Louisiana to markets in the southeastern United States. Propane supplies transported on this system primarily originate from southeast Texas, southern Louisiana and Mississippi.
§
The Seminole Pipeline is a regulated pipeline that transports NGLs from the Hobbs hub and the Permian Basin area to southeastern Texas. The primary source of throughput for the Seminole pipeline is the Mid-America Pipeline System.
§
The Texas NGL System is a network of NGL gathering and transportation pipelines located in south Texas. The system includes 379 miles of pipeline used to gather and transport mixed NGLs from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities to our South Texas NGL fractionation facilities. The pipeline system also includes approximately 660 miles of pipelines that deliver NGLs from our South Texas fractionation facilities to refineries and petrochemical plants located from Corpus Christi to Houston and within the Texas City-Houston area, as well as to common carrier NGL pipelines.
§
The Louisiana Pipeline System is a network of nine NGL pipelines located in Louisiana. This system transports NGLs originating in southern Louisiana and Texas to refineries and petrochemical companies along the Mississippi River corridor in southern Louisiana. This system also provides transportation services for our natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators and other facilities located in Louisiana.
§
The Promix NGL Gathering System is a NGL pipeline system that gathers mixed NGLs from natural gas processing plants in Louisiana for delivery to the Promix NGL fractionator. This gathering system is an integral part of the Promix NGL fractionation facility.
§
The Houston Ship Channel pipeline system is a collection of pipelines extending from our Houston Ship Channel import/export facility and Morgan’s Point facility to Mont Belvieu, Texas. This system is used to deliver NGL products to third-party petrochemical plants and refineries as well as to deliver feedstocks to our Mont Belvieu facilities.
§
The Lou-Tex NGL pipeline system is used to provide transportation services for NGLs and refinery grade propylene between the Louisiana and Texas markets. We also use this pipeline to transport mixed NGLs from certain of our Louisiana gas processing plants to our Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility.
Our NGL and related product storage facilities are integral parts of our pipeline and other operations. In general, these underground storage facilities are used to store our and our customers’ NGLs
and petrochemicals. Our underground storage facilities include locations in Arizona, Kansas and Utah that were acquired in July 2005 from Ferrellgas L.P. We operate these facilities, with the exception of certain storage locations operated for us by a third party in Louisiana and Mississippi.
The following table summarizes the significant natural gas processing and NGL fractionation assets of our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment at February 1, 2006.

At the core of our natural gas processing business are twenty-four processing plants located in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico. Our natural gas processing facilities can be characterized as two distinct types: (i) straddle plants situated on mainline natural gas pipelines owned either by us or by third parties or (ii) field plants that process natural gas in connection with gathering pipelines. We operate the Toca, Chaco, North Terrebonne, Calumet and Neptune plants and all of the Texas facilities.
Our NGL marketing activities utilize a fleet of approximately 600 railcars, the majority of which are leased. These railcars are used to deliver feedstocks to our facilities and to distribute NGLs throughout the United States. We have rail loading and unloading facilities in Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. These facilities service both our rail shipments and those of our customers.
