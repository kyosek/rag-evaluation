NEW JERSEY MINE and MILL
Location
The New Jersey Mine is an underground mine and mill complex located four kilometers east of Kellogg, Idaho, in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. The property includes the gold bearing Coleman vein system, and another gold prospect called the Scotch Thistle. The mine is adjacent to U.S. Interstate 90 and is easily accessed by local roads throughout the entire year. Three-phase electrical power is supplied to the New Jersey Mill by Avista Utilities. The area is underlain by argillites and quartzites of the Prichard Formation [member of Belt Supergroup], which commonly hosts gold mineralization.
Mill Joint Venture Agreement
On January 7, 2011, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with United Mine Services (UMS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Silver Corporation, to increase the capacity of the New Jersey Mill. UMS funded the expansion of the mill to process 350 tonnes per day and received a 35% interest in joint venture assets plus the right to process 7,000 tonnes of its ore per month. NJMC is the manager of the joint venture and retains a 65% interest in the joint venture assets plus the right to process 3,000 tonnes per month of its own ores. The property covered by the joint venture agreement includes the crushing circuit, grinding circuit, flotation circuit, concentrate leach plant, buildings and surface rights over patented and unpatented mining claims.
Mineral Property
The Company owns 41 hectares (102 acres) of private land with surface and mineral rights, 44 hectares (108 acres) of private land with mineral rights only, 16 hectares (40 acres) of private land with surface rights only, and approximately 53 hectares (130 acres) of unpatented mining claims. The unpatented claims are on federal land administered by the BLM. The Coleman pit and the current underground workings are located on the patented mining claims that are wholly owned by the Company.
History
There are at least 14 gold prospects in or near the New Jersey Mine. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, New Jersey Mining and Milling (an unrelated company) drove more than 760 meters (2,500 feet) of development workings on the Coleman Vein and the northwest branch of the Coleman Vein, including: drifts, crosscuts, shafts, and raises. The historic development also included a 10-stamp gravity mill that was operated for a short period.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
In 2012, construction was completed on an expanded mill capable of processing 360 tonnes per day of sulfide ore to produce a single flotation concentrate. The mill expansion cost approximately $3.2 million, which was funded completely by UMS. The expansion project included the installation of a new cone crusher, a new fine ore bin, new conveyors, a new 2.4m by 4.0m ball mill, additional flotation cells, a new paste thickener, associated pumps, and a new building. The Concentrate Leach Plant (CLP) was not renovated at that time. Subsequent to the mill expansion in 2012, the expanded New Jersey Mill processed a total of 8,470 dry tonnes of silver ore from the Crescent Mine.
In April 2014, Hale Capital Partners, through its subsidiary Crescent Silver LLC (“Crescent Silver”), acquired the assets of United Mine Services in a consensual foreclosure process. This transaction included the UMS stake in the New Jersey Mill JV. Hence, Crescent Silver is the Company’s current joint venture partner at the New Jersey Mill. Crescent Silver produced no ore during 2014. In December of 2014, NJMC, acting as manager of the mill joint venture, began processing small amounts of material from the Golden Chest Mine, receiving compensation on a per tonne basis from Gold Hill Reclamation and Mining Inc. Production at the mill is expected to increase through the first quarter of 2015, reaching steady state throughput of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 tonnes per month during the second quarter of 2015.
Pursuant to the Golden Chest mineral lease agreement with Gold Hill Reclamation and Mining Inc, the Companies outlined an arrangement by which NJMC will process Gold Hill’s ores so as to collect the gold and silver in a flotation concentrate, which will be sold to a smelter. The average milling charge will be approximately $44/tonne of ore, but it will be higher for the ramp-up period (estimated to be the first 3 months of operation), $50/tonne of ore. In anticipation of the commencement of milling late in 2014, NJMC proceeded to make certain upgrades to the New Jersey Mill. The Company installed a new gravity circuit, added a lift to the tailings impoundment, and made other improvements, as it deemed appropriate. Crescent Silver opted not to participate in these investments. Gold Hill also advanced approximately $200,000 to NJMC as a no-interest loan against future milling fees to NJMC to facilitate the plant upgrades.
Regarding the mining assets on the New Jersey property, the Company last conducted material work on the New Jersey Mine in 2010, when it drove a raise upward from the 740 level to explore a narrow vein that intersected the Coleman Vein. The 12-meter raise generated approximately 370 tonnes of millable material grading 2.68 gpt gold. Prior to that, NJMC drifted approximately 84 meters on the 740 level in 2008, including approximately 20 meters of material from the Coleman Vein.
NJMC also conducted two drilling programs in 2008 (400 meters) and 2001 (1,765 meters). In addition to an intercept of 12.5 meters grading 2.76 gpt gold, including 2.5 meters of 6.80 gpt gold, the drilling also encountered broad low-grade mineralization (0.70 gpt gold) in the Grenfel Zone. In 2008, the Company tested a new prospect call the Scotch Thistle, but drilling encountered only silicification and alteration with no significant gold mineralization.
The Company conducted no underground development or drilling on the New Jersey Mine Property during 2014.
As of December 31, 2014, the Company had a net capital cost of $4,611,102 associated with the mineral processing plant and a capitalized development plus investment cost of $288,365 associated with the mine.
Exploration Plans
In 2015, the Company plans to compile the historic data and conduct a small underground mapping and sampling program in the Coleman underground mine in order to assess the potential for more significant high-grade mineralization.
Age, Modernization and Physical Condition of Plant and Equipment
The construction of an expanded mill capable of processing 360 tonnes per day of sulfide ore to produce a single flotation concentrate was completed in 2012. The mill expansion cost approximately $3.2 million, which was funded completely by United Mine Services under the terms of the joint venture agreement (Ex. 10.1). The expansion project included the installation of a new cone crusher, a new fine ore bin, new conveyors, a new 2.4m by 4.0m ball mill, additional flotation cells, a new paste thickener, associated pumps, and a new building. The Concentrate Leach Plant (CLP) has not been renovated. Three-phase electrical power is supplied to the New Jersey mill by Avista Utilities.
Geology
The Prichard Formation, which is more than 7,500 meters in thickness, underlies the New Jersey Mine area. The property occurs adjacent to and north of the major Osburn Fault, an important geological structure in the evolution of the Silver Valley. The Prichard Formation is divided into nine units of alternating argillites, siltites, and quartzites; the units exposed in the New Jersey Mine area appear to belong to the lower members. Gold mineralization is associated with sulfide-bearing quartz veins that cut the bedding in Prichard argillite and quartzite. Associated sulfides are pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, low-silver tennantite, galena, and sphalerite.
Reserves
While the Company has conducted significant drilling, underground development, and even limited gold production from the property, there are no mineral reserves as recognized by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) at the New Jersey Mine at the present time.
GOLDEN CHEST PROJECT
Figure - Photo of New Skookum Mine Portal in October 2014
Location
The Golden Chest Project is an exploration project and an underground mine located in Reeder Gulch about 2.4 kilometers east of Murray, Idaho along US Forest Service Highway 9. The property consists of 24 patented mining claims and 70 unpatented claims covering approximately 515 hectares (1,270 acres). The site is accessible by several improved dirt roads from the paved highway. An 11-meter by 21-meter (36 x 70 feet) steel-clad pole building stands at the top of the most easterly driveway to the property; it is used primarily for office space and core logging. A second 9-meter by 6-meter (30 x 20 feet) steel-clad pole building is present near the northern ramp portal and could be used as a shop or dry. There is single-phase electrical power to the office building; and Avista Utilities installed three-phase electrical power to the Skookum Portal area during 2014.
History
The Golden Chest Mine was developed in the late 1800s or early 1900s as part of the early gold production from the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. Gold production in the Murray area pre-dated the larger scale silver mining of the Silver Valley by several years. Historical accounts vary, but the district is believed to have produced approximately 300,000 oz of gold from placer production, including the Guggenheim dredging operations of the 1920s that are documented in historic video on the University of Idaho website. While it is difficult to be precise, the historic hard rock mining operations at Golden Chest are estimated to have produced more than 75,000 oz of gold.
Several large and small companies conducted exploration at the Golden Chest during various periods, including some drilling by Newmont Mining in the 1980s. New Jersey Mining started work on the property in 2004, conducting exploration drilling and underground development. NJMC connected the surface to the historic No. 3 Level by driving a ramp 440 meters in length, known as the North Ramp. This projected was completed in the fourth quarter of 2008.
For each year from 2004 through 2008, the Company completed an exploration core-drilling program on the Golden Chest Property, drilling a total of 3,415 meters of core during that period. These holes met with some success in extending the Idaho Vein below the No. 3 Level.
NJMC formed a joint venture with Marathon Gold in 2010. Since Marathon Gold is a Canadian issuer (TSX: MOZ), the newly formed joint venture operated and issued technical disclosures in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).
During 2011, the GC joint venture partners completed the most aggressive exploration project in the history of the property, totaling 11,300 meters of surface drilling in 102 NQ-2 size core holes. Other surface work completed included the construction of a new core shed, construction of new roads, surface geological work, surface and underground surveying, and the reestablishment of patented claim corners. The work program also included the rehabilitation of the No. 3 Level and an exploration crosscut on the Intermediate Level. In 2012, the Golden Chest joint venture completed a total of 7,000 meters of drilling in 42 holes. Additionally, Golden Chest LLC drove an exploration drift on the Popcorn Vein, revealing a strike length of 40 meters averaging 23 gpt gold across a true thickness of 0.5 meter. Based on the results of the 2012 work program, the joint venture delineated an updated gold resource and filed a technical report in compliance with NI 43-101.
Property Ownership
Pursuant to a 2010 joint venture agreement, the Golden Chest Project is owned by Golden Chest LLC (GC), which is owned 52% by Marathon Gold Corporation through its wholly-owned US subsidiary, Marathon Gold USA Corp. (MUSA) and 48% by NJMC. Golden Chest LLC purchased the mine from Metaline Contact Mines and J.W. Beasley Interests for $3,750,000. As of December 31, 2014, GC had paid $2,125,000, and has agreed to pay the sellers $1,625,000 over the next two years. The sellers have a first mortgage on the mine as security for future payments owing. There are no production royalties underlying the Golden Chest property.
In 2013, the Golden Chest Joint Venture leased a portion of the Golden Chest Project to Juniper Resources LLC, the agreement was later assigned to Gold Hill Reclamation and Mining Inc. (“Gold Hill”), an affiliated private Idaho corporation. During 2014, Gold Hill succeeded in placing the Golden Chest Mine into production. At year-end 2014, the mine and mill are ramping up towards full planned production of approximately 300 tonnes per day.
Exploration and Development Plans
Gold Hill projects a mine life of approximately 18 months at a production rate of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 tonnes per month.
NJMC geologists believe there is potential for additional mineralization downdip, updip, and laterally from the Skookum Mine development, but considerable drilling and testing will be required to define any new mining areas. The Golden Chest JV will likely consider drill testing these near-mine projects during 2015. Development of such new discoveries in conjunction with Gold Hill during the term of the mining lease would require an agreement among the parties.
Age, Modernization and Physical Condition of Plant and Equipment
An 11-meter by 21-meter (36 x 70 feet) steel-clad pole building (2011) stands at the top of the most easterly driveway to the property; it is used primarily for office space and core logging. A second 9-meter by 6-meter (30 x 20 feet) steel-clad pole building (2005) is present near the northern ramp portal and could be used as a shop or dry. There is single-phase electrical power to the office building; and Avista Utilities installed three-phase electrical power to the Skookum Portal area during 2014.
Gold Hill has made many improvements to the property in the last year including approximately 1,000 meters of underground development at a nominal cross section of 4 meter by 4 meter, the establishment of a secondary escape-way and ventilation raises, the installation of three-phase power, and many surface improvements such as a septic field and new haul road.
Geology
Gold mineralization occurs in veins associated with multiple faulting and folding events in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The gold mineralization is of a broad type known as orogenic gold, but it also appears to have an association with igneous rock activity. Hence, the vein deposits may be described as intrusion-related orogenic gold. The principle vein being exploited at the Skookum Mine is associated with the Idaho Fault, which juxtaposes the quartzites of the lower Prichard Formation against finer-grained argillites, also of the lower Prichard Formation.
Veins occur in the Idaho Fault and to a lesser extent in the hangingwall and footwall of the fault. The mineralization occurs in two types of quartz veins that are generally conformable to bedding of the Prichard Formation of Proterozoic age. Thin-banded veins, occurring in argillite, contain visible gold, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. Thicker, massive veins occur in quartzite and contain pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, scheelite and rare visible gold.
Reserves
While there has been significant recent drilling and underground development that has resulted in industrial scale mining and recovery of gold, there are currently no mineral reserves at the Golden Chest Project, as recognized by the SEC.
TOBOGGAN PROJECT
Location
The Toboggan Project is an exploration property without known ore reserves. The project consists of 106 unpatented lode claims covering an area of approximately 850 hectares (2,100 acres) in and near the East Fork of Eagle Creek drainage. The Toboggan Project consists of the following prospects: Gold Butte, Mineral Ridge, Golden Reward, Progress, Little Baldy, Snowslide, CA, Lost Eagle, and Independence. The claims can be accessed from May through November using a USFS dirt road. No electrical energy is available at the site.
Mineral Agreement
The Toboggan Project is comprised of 106 unpatented mining claims wholly owned by the Company, of which 39 claims related to the Little Baldy prospect are leased to Hecla Silver Valley. The lease has a 20-year term and calls for annual payments to NJMC of $24,000, which was re-negotiated in 2014 to $10,000 for the third through fifth year, then escalating to $15,000 for three years, $20,000 for one year, and $48,000 thereafter. Should gold production be realized from the leased claims, a 2% net smelter return royalty is due NJMC. The Company is currently in the third year of the lease.
History
Historic workings are present at the Gold Butte prospect and consist of seven adits connected by a system of narrow roads. Most of the underground work appears to have been completed prior to 1941. Two holes were drilled on the Gold Butte prospect in the 1980s. Prior geophysical exploration work by Cominco-American in the Toboggan Creek area in the mid 1980s found a large CSAMT geophysical anomaly, roughly two square kilometers in area. In 1987, Cominco American drilled a hole 500 meters in depth that was located on the eastern edge of the anomaly. It appears that the hole was located too far to the east, and that it was not drilled deep enough to investigate the large geophysical anomaly. Nord-Pacific completed a gold exploration program in the Mineral Ridge area including a soil sampling program and a reverse-circulation drilling program in 1992. Nord-Pacific identified several anomalous gold zones with their soil sampling and completed nine holes totaling 850 meters in their drilling program. All of the drillholes intercepted anomalous gold
mineralization including a 1.5 meter intercept of 18.9 gpt gold. Historic workings at the Mineral Ridge prospect, which were completed before Nord-Pacific’s work, include six adits as well as numerous pits and trenches. The Independence area was originally staked in 1906 and was active intermittently through the 1900s. Work completed during that time included four adits, and numerous pits and trenches.
For the period from March 2008 through March 2011, the Toboggan project was an exploration joint venture between Newmont Mining Corporation and the Company. Newmont completed three seasons of exploration work spending approximately $2,000,000, and then exited the joint venture. Newmont quitclaimed all the mining claims back to the Company, and also returned the data generated from three seasons of exploration.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
During 2008, Newmont completed a comprehensive early-stage exploration program. Work completed included soil sampling, rock sampling, geologic mapping, a ground-based geophysical survey at Gold Butte, an airborne geophysical survey over the entire joint venture area, and additional claim staking that significantly increased the area of the joint venture. During 2009, Newmont completed a core-drilling program consisting of six holes for a total of 1,359 meters. Two holes were drilled at each of the following prospects: Mineral Ridge, Golden Reward and Gold Butte. The best drill intercept was at Gold Butte where a pyritic quartz vein was intersected at 24.0 meters below the surface assaying 2.5 gpt gold over 4.0 meters, including a higher grade section that assayed 7.15 gpt gold over 1.0 meter. Thick intercepts of anomalous, but low-grade gold mineralization were drilled at the Mineral Ridge and Golden Reward prospects. Newmont also completed geologic mapping, surface rock sampling, soil sampling, and additional claim staking. During 2010, Newmont completed both core and reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at the Toboggan Project, including eight core holes totaling 914 meters and seven RC holes totaling 941 meters. Six of the core holes were drilled at Gold Butte and intercepted a fault with anomalous gold mineralization. The remaining two core holes were drilled at Mineral Ridge and both holes were terminated before hitting the target due to difficult ground conditions. The seven RC holes were drilled at various prospects near Toboggan Creek; and RC-7 was the most promising with 100 meters of 100 ppb gold at the Golden Reward prospect. After the 2010 exploration season, Newmont finally obtained the USFS permit necessary to drill their best targets, but they terminated the joint venture before proceeding.
No significant exploration work has been completed on the project since 2010.
Exploration and Development Plans
Since mining has recommenced in the district at the Golden Chest, the Company is currently re-evaluating the potential of the Toboggan Project. Along with other earlier stage exploration assets in the Company’s portfolio, NJMC will consider multiple options to realize value from this project.
Geology
The gold mineralization at the Toboggan Project is primarily hosted in the Prichard Formation. The gold is structurally controlled in nature, occurring in discrete high-grade quartz veins or within wider zones of brecciation. There is a spatial relationship between the best gold values and major structures in the district, such as the Murray Peak Fault, the Bloom Peak Fault, and the Niagara Fault. Some of the controlling structures may be related to the Idaho Fault, which hosts the high-grade gold being mined to the south at the Golden Chest Mine. Geochemically, the gold at Toboggan is often associated with tellurium and bismuth. Telluride minerals have also been observed by electron microprobe. Geologists have noted widespread potassic alteration and the presence of alkaline intrusive rocks; these characteristics are consistent with alkalic-related orogenic gold systems.
Reserves
There are currently no mineral reserves at the Toboggan Project as recognized by the SEC.
McKINLEY PROJECT
The McKinley Project is an early stage exploration project having no mineral reserves. It was acquired by the Company in December 2013 through the acquisition of Idaho Champion Resources (ICR) and includes the historic McKinley Gold Mine and various gold prospects located north of Riggins, Idaho.
Location
The project is located north of Riggins, Idaho and east of Lucile, Idaho. The total property position is almost 1,800 hectares (4,368 acres), including: a purchase option on the patented claims at the McKinley Mine (25 hectares or 62 acres); a much larger mineral lease (700 hectares or 1,728 acres); a group of unpatented mining claims (429 hectares or 1,060 acres); and additional lands with certain rights for access and surface disturbance (614 hectares or 1,518 acres). The project extends from 4 kilometers north of Riggins, Idaho northward for nearly 8 kilometers. While there is no electrical power on the property as yet, it is easily accessible by a series of public and private dirt roads from highway US 95.
Property Ownership
The 25 hectares of patented mining claims that make up the McKinley Mine are held under a purchase option from a trust for a price of $285,000. The Company can perform certain due diligence, including exploration drilling, prior to the exercise date of November 18, 2015. The terms of the purchase require 10% to be paid on or before the exercise date with the remaining balance amortized over 15 years at a 5% interest rate with quarterly payments for 5 years followed by a balloon payment for the remaining balance. A previous lessee of the McKinley Mine (Ex. 10.5) is due a 1.0% to 2.0% NSR sliding scale royalty based on the price of gold, which is capped at a total of $500,000. Another 1,314 hectares of land is held through a lease, including total surface and some mineral rights, (Rupp Lease - Ex. 10.7) that requires an annual rental payment of $6,100; and if an ore reserve of 250,000 oz of gold is achieved, there is a 1% NSR royalty on future production less recoupment of capital costs. About 316 hectares (780 acres) of the mineral rights subject to the Rupp Lease royalty are held through unpatented claims that also require an annual claim fee payment to the U.S. BLM. During 2014, NJMC made a total of $19,000 in property option payments.
History of Operations
The McKinley Mine has four levels and approximately 1,190 meters (3,900 feet) of underground workings that remain in good condition. The area was first worked in 1891 with intermittent activity over the following decades by unknown operators. Hunt Energy explored the property in the late-1970s and 1980s, and Kennecott Exploration evaluated the property in the early 1990s. In the 1990s a lessee built a small mill but processed a very small quantity of material. The mill site burned in a 2012 forest fire that came through the area. There are other small historic mines on the property, one of which includes more than 360 meters (1,200 feet) of underground workings.
Present Condition and Work Completed on the Property
While the McKinley Project is an exploration project, the 1,190 meters of underground workings at the McKinley Mine are accessible and have facilitated exploration in three dimensions. There are two main levels separated by approximately 90 meters (300 feet) with two intermediate sublevels, all of which are connected by a series of sub-vertical raises. The Company and its recent predecessor, ICR, have completed underground sampling programs that included chip and channel sampling of mineralized areas. Recent results from the channel sampling program are summarized below (See Company news releases dated March 10, 2014 and March 25, 2014 for more detail):
·
9.0 meters averaging 17.47 gpt gold
o
including 1.5-meters at 79.3 gpt gold
·
2.1 meters averaging 5.5 gpt gold
·
1.1 meters averaging 17.25 gpt gold
·
4.3 meters averaging 47 gpt gold
o
including 2.0 meters at 111 gpt gold
·
1.7 meters at 72 gpt gold
The weighted average grade of the continuous zones is based on the sample weights as reported by ALS Chemex. There is insufficient geological information to ascertain accurate orientations of veins and other structures, so the channel lengths reported above are likely not true widths across the vein system.
Pursuant to the encouraging results from trench sampling, the Company proceeded with a small core-drilling program. Working with support from Timberline Drilling Inc. and local fabricators, the team developed a highly portable custom drill that could be deployed in the confined space of historical underground workings. While the length and angle of the drill holes was somewhat constrained, the drill did facilitate quality core samples of numerous underground targets. NJMC reported results from a total of approximately 388 meters in 21 small diameter short drill holes (See Company news releases dated June 3, 2014 and January 2, 2015 for more details). Highlights from the drilling included:
·
2.5 meters averaging 43.7 gpt gold
·
3.5 meters averaging 18.5 gpt gold
o
including 0.7 meters of 85.3 gpt gold
·
0.8 meters averaging 15.8 gpt gold
Surface exploration work completed at the project included a ground magnetic survey, approximately 2.4 kilometers wide and 5.6 kilometers long, across the McKinley property. The survey appears to represent the mineralization at the McKinley Mine while indicating several potential target areas along the known trend, which includes several historic mines and prospects.
The Company spent $266,064 in 2014 on exploration work including small-diameter core drilling, geologic mapping, channel sampling, and underground surveying.
Age, Modernization and Physical Condition of Plant and Equipment
There is no usable plant or associated equipment at the site, though, some junk equipment has been left at the site by a previous operator. There is no electrical energy available at the site.
Exploration and Development Plans
The Company will consider its next round of exploration on the McKinley Project based on its budget for exploration in 2015. The high-grade results achieved to date are encouraging, so the next phase of work will likely involve attempts to extend or enhance the higher grade intercepts.
Geology and Mineralization
The McKinley Project is located within the rocks of the Riggins and Seven Devils Groups of the Blue Mountains Island-Arc Complex. Rocks of the accreted Riggins Group and Seven Devils Terrane are widely considered to be the source of coarse gold found in the extensive historic placer operations near Lucile. The types of gold mineralization encountered in the rock samples, channel samples, and drill core from McKinley contain both coarse and microscopic gold, which is associated with low to moderate levels of geochemical pathfinder elements such as silver, arsenic, copper, cobalt, nickel, and others. The McKinley Project covers an extensive area of alteration/mineralization that can be classified as an orogenic gold model also known as quartz-carbonate vein type deposits.
Reserves
There are currently no mineral reserves at the McKinley Project as recognized by the SEC.
EASTERN STAR PROJECT
New Jersey Mining acquired the Eastern Star Property on April 18, 2014. It is a commercial sawmill site with adjacent patented lode and placer mining claims consisting of portions of the Red Elk Group, the Elk group, and the Wolverine Lode Mining Claim. It is an early stage exploration project with no mineral reserves consisting of approximately 90 hectares (220 acres) of patented mining claims.
Location
The property is located 6.5 kilometers west of Elk City Idaho on the South Fork of the Clearwater River along Idaho State Highway 14. There is no electrical power on the property, but it is easily accessible by improved dirt roads from the paved highway.
Property Ownership
NJMC acquired fee simple title to the property from Premium Exploration Inc. for a purchase price of $425,000. It had previously belonged to Green Future, an Idaho LLC. In accordance with the note, the Company has made two payments for a total of $250,818; and a final payment of $175,000 plus interest accrued on that payment at an annual rate of 5% is due on July 15th, 2015. The payments that have been made have released the mortgage encumbering prorated portions of the property to the Company. The only remaining portion encumbered by the mortgage is the Red Elk Group of mining claims.
History of Operations
The property was operated as a saw mill until 2004 when the mill shut down. NJMC’s predecessor purchased the property and drilled 3 core holes, targeting a bulk minable gold deposit. Upon acquisition, NJMC completed an initial mapping and sampling program followed by approximately 670 meters (2,200 feet) of trenching. The Company’s objective is to evaluate the potential for high-grade gold-bearing quartz veins that led to limited historic production and patenting of the mineral claims on the property.
Present Condition of Work Completed on the Property
Consistent with its status as an early stage exploration project with very limited modern exploration, NJMC conducted geologic mapping, sampling, and a modest trenching program during 2014. Company geologists identified a number of quartz veins that had been exploited by historic prospect pits and small shafts. Surface samples from these veins included some encouraging results, up to 69 gpt gold.
Since the rocks are deeply weathered on the property, geologists excavated some trenches to access fresher rock. The channel samples in the trenches intercepted notable gold mineralization, including contiguous samples up to 10.4m of 2.25 gpt gold and 6.4m of 7.97 gpt gold. The latter interval included 4.3m of 11.34 gpt gold. Other trench samples included quartz vein related samples of 35.9, 30.6, 23.5, and 12.0 gpt gold.
The Company invested $77,822 in exploration expenditures on the property in 2014.
Exploration and Development Plans
The first season of field work returned some encouraging results, but it is too early to put these results in proper geological context, so the Company will consider additional mapping, sampling, and target generation during 2015 and beyond.
ITEM 3.
