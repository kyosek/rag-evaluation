Only exploration and no research as of now
The Company has not conducted any research or development activities since its incorporation nor did Strateco prior to the transfer of Discovery Property and Montbray properties to Cadiscor, since only exploration programs have been conducted up to now.
Canadian and U.S. regulations regarding estimation of resources are not the same. Please see Cautionary Notes and definitions in previous section entitled: BUSINESS
All properties are at an exploration stage and without known reserves. There is no plant or equipment on any of these properties. For power, in the case of all properties, the provincial power grid is located within a 20 kilometres range and could be extended to each property if warranted, eventually. Water is plentiful on all properties and in the region and it is generally pumped from wells or ancient diamond drill holes if needed.
General
The Company owns 100% of four mining properties and has an option on two additional properties. These six gold properties are all located in Quebec, and total 400 claims covering a total of 8,319 hectares, not counting the Sleeping Giant mine. In 2007, a total of $3,667,436 was spent on exploration on the properties, including $3,107,182 on the Discovery property.
The following map shows the location of the properties in Northwestern Québec, Canada:

Discovery Project
100% interest
DISCOVERY PROPERTY
The Discovery property consists of 124 mining claims covering an area of 3,371 hectares. It lies 35 kilometres northwest of Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Québec, in Bruneau and Desjardins townships.
Property Description
The Discovery property is the result of the merger of the Discovery project (the “Discovery Claims Block”) and the Cameron project (the “Cameron Claims Block”). These two projects were the subject of an Option and Venture Agreement between Strateco Resources Inc. (“Strateco”) and GéoNova Explorations Inc (“GéoNova”) since October 2, 2002 by which Strateco could obtain 51% interest in these two projects. On February 15, 2006, when Strateco purchased from GéoNova a 100% interest in the two projects instead of pursuing the option Agreement, Discovery Project and Cameron Project were called thereafter by Strateco and GéoNova for the purpose of the purchase/sale Agreement the “Discovery Property”.
Location, access and Mining Claims
The Discovery property is located (see Map of Properties Location) approximately 35 km northwest of the town of Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Québec, Canada and consists of a total of 124 mining claims in Desjardins and Bruneau townships for a total surface area of 3,371 hectares. Since August 17, 2006, the Company holds a 100% interest in these 124 mining claims.
Gold Potential
The project is strategically located in the eastern extension of the Harricana-Turgeon belt, which hosts the Matagami, Joutel and Casa-Bérardi mining camps. The project lies along a southeastern-striking section of a regional network of interconnected deformation corridors that extend eastward from the Quebec-Ontario border, crossing the Northern Volcanic Zone of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. This network of deformation zones (Cameron-Casa-Bérardi deformation zone) represents a major geological discontinuity characterized by the interruption of structural and stratigraphic interference patterns.
Exploration Work
Previous exploration conducted on the Discovery project from 1986 to 2006, particularly by Homestake Canada Ltd., GéoNova and Strateco led to the delineation of the Discovery gold-bearing zone for a distance of over 800 metres and to a depth of 700 metres. The Discovery mineralized zone splits into three subvertical gold-bearing lenses, each 100 to 200 metres wide. On the East lens, the deepest hole drilled below the -400-metre level returned intersections of 11.97 g/t Au over 4.35 metres. On the Central lens, the deepest hole, drilled at over 600 metres below surface, returned 4.33 g/t Au over 7.59 metres, including 5.51 g/t Au over 5.11 metres. These two zones remain open at depth.
In May 2006, InnovExplo Inc., a mining and exploration Consulting Firm in Mines and Exploration based in Val-D’Or, Québec, completed an National Instrument 43-101 compliant report that indicates that the Discovery zone contains an indicated resource of 381,100 tonnes @ 6.74 g/t Au and an inferred resource of 847,200 tonnes @ 6.35 g/t Au. The report indicates that the gold-bearing zones are continuous, and that the potential for converting the
- 7 -
inferred resource into an indicated resource is high. The report also mentions that there is strong potential for increasing the resource through additional drilling, particularly at depth, below the known gold-bearing zones.
For the Discovery Claims Block, the following parameters were used to define the indicated and inferred resources:
Indicated Resource
The indicated resource was defined in areas where the mineralized lenses can be delineated by a series of drill hole intercepts with a grade greater than 3.00 g/t over 1.6 m and a maximum drill holes spacing of 60 m. In some areas where there was insufficient information to confirm the presence of the mineralized zone on the other side of the fault, the limits of the lenses were confined by these late faults.
Only the B zone contains an indicated resource, in three distinct lenses. The other zones are characterized only by an inferred resource.
Inferred Resource
A radius of 40 metres from a single diamond drill hole intercept was used to define the inferred resource.
In the B zone, one mineralized lens located between Sections 600 W and 350 W and between elevations-350 m and 0 m is defined by four diamond drill hole intercepts with grade higher than 3.00 g/t over 1.6 m. The maximum distance between drill holes is 130 m and the minimum is 100 m. The shape of the inferred lenses is based on the shape and size of indicated lenses. All the volume contained within these other lenses has been defined as inferred.
The late faults were not used to limit the inferred resource. These faults cause a few meters of displacement, but even though the exact location of the mineralized zone is not well known, the zone should continue on the other side, and therefore the volume is not affected.

Methodology
InnovExplo chose to use the polygonal method on longitudinal section. The interpretation was done on cross-sections at 10-meter spacing at a scale of 1:500. The cross-section interpretation was transferred onto a set of five plan views at 100-meter spacings to validate the interpretation in the other dimension. The geological interpretation was digitized and the composites and horizontal thicknesses were then calculated using Gemcom Software. All the calculated composites were validated individually on the cross-sections to confirm that the grade and thickness were properly calculated. The diamond drill hole intercepts were then located on five longitudinal sections, one for each zone. The polygons were traced, and the volume and grade were calculated using Gemcom Software. A list of the volume and grade for each drill hole intercept above the 3.00 g/t Au cut-off is included in Appendix D to the technical report.

The specific gravity database used for the current estimate includes measurements from various drilling programs. InnovExplo used an average specific gravity of 2.82 g/cm3 calculated by SRK Consulting (“SRK”). from the available data.
For the 2003 resources evaluation, SRK used a capping of 15 g/t Au for the 2 m composites. InnovExplo Inc. did not use compositing and worked with the original sample length. The capping grade was calculated at 35 g/t Au on the original sample length based on the log normal probability plot and on the log normal histogram.

Mineral Resource Estimate
The resource for the Discovery Claims Block was revised with two goals: (1) to re-estimate the resource using a method better suited to a narrow, high-grade vein-type gold deposit; and (2) to prepare the project for a pre-feasibility study on an underground operation. InnovExplo judged that the interpolation block model method used in 2003 did not apply to this type of narrow high grade vein mineralization. Generally speaking, applying this method to this type of mineralization tends to create a smearing effect of high grade values into the barren walls of the veins, thus causing tonnage to rise and grade to fall. The total number of ounces can be similar, but the accuracy required for a detailed economic assessment of a possible conventional underground operation is not obtained with the block model method.
The polygon method on longitudinal section selected by InnovExplo. enhances local accuracy. Moreover, this method’s main advantage is to force geologists to interpret each zone manually using each diamond drill hole. The geological continuity is thus established first, based on strict geological criteria such as structural elements, alteration zones, veins and lithologies, and not strictly on gold values.
The resource was calculated at three different cut-off grades: 3.00 g/t Au, 5.00 g/t Au and 7.00 g/t Au (see tables below). The 3.00 g/t Au cut-off grade was used to determine the continuity and shape of the mineralized lenses and to provide a comparison with SRK’s 2003 resource estimate. Compared to SRK’s estimate, the indicated resource tonnage increased by 12%, grade by 36% and ounces by 89%. The inferred resource tonnage decreased by 49%, grade increased by 47% and ounces decreased by 25%.
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the reader should use the figures based on the 3.00 g/t Au cut-off, which produces an indicated resource of 381,100 tonnes grading 6.73 g/t Au, or 82,406 ounces and an inferred resource of 847,200 tonnes grading 6.35 g/t Au, or 173,091 ounces.
Estimation of the Cut-off Grade
The estimation of the cut-off grade is based on cost published by Infomine USA, 2006. These numbers are an average cost from several similar mines and represent an order of magnitude number. Real cost estimate will have to be determined in a pre-feasibility study. InnovExplo considers that the numbers presented are reasonable figures for the cut-off grade estimation of the Discovery project. The two (2) methods proposed were selected according to the mineralized zones geometry, continuity and thickness and are considered adequate for the project. All units are metric, and all cost and metal price are in 2006 at $600/once US dollars.

*Daily rate used was the most representative one presented in Infomine and 800 tpd for Shrinkage mining was not available.
It is expected that the Discovery project could be mined using both mining methods depending on the thickness of the mineralized zones. The ratio between both methods has to be determined. Considering 50% by shrinkage mining method and 50% by sublevel longhole mining method, the average total mining cost would be 58.50 $ per tonne.
The gross metal values, using $600.00 per ounce for the different cut-off grades used, are:
·
3.0 g/t = $52.50/t
·
5.0 g/t = $87.60/t
·
7.0 g/t = $122.40/t
The metallurgical process for the Discovery mineralized material determined by Lakefield Research (1998) is by whole rock cyanidation and the anticipated recovery is 96%.
The cost for milling and transportation (if required) or for the construction of a mill plant will have to be determined in the pre-feasibility study. The order of magnitude for the milling using cyanidation process in the Abitibi area varies from $6.00 per tonne to $25 per tonne depending on the mill location and mill daily rate tonnage. The Sleeping Giant Mine located nearby has milling cost of $18 per tonne.
The average grade determined for the Discovery deposit is 6,74g/t Au for the indicated resources. The in situ calculated value is 117.85$/t using $600.00 per ounce.
In Canada, according to NI 43-101, in order to calculate a resource you have to use parameters that reflect the possibility of a resource to be eventually qualified as a reserve. Therefore a consultant will fix minimum requirement of grade, true widths and continuity for him to be able to do a calculation of the resources. The consultant, InnovExplo recommends using a minimum cut-off of 3g/t AU in evaluating the resources of the Discovery property.
The resource was also calculated using a 5.00 g/t. The results show that continuity is still good at this cut-off. The 7.00 g/t Au cut-off value indicates some high grade zones in the deposit. The tonnage and ounces are sensitive to grade and decrease rapidly at the higher 7.00 g/t Au cut-off, indicating the limited amount of high grade tonnage currently in the deposit.
In May 2007, the Company obtained new results from a second evaluation pursuant to norms of Canadian NI 43-101 based on 39 drill holes covering an area of 26,300 meters realised between October 2006 and March 2007. The new Measured and Indicated resources are now estimated at 1,163,186 tonnes at an average grade of 5.53 g/t for a total of 206,624 ounces of gold, representing an increase of more than 150% in gold content over the previous May 2006 43-101 estimate for the same categories (381,100 tonnes at 6.74 g/t for 82,406 ounces of gold).
In addition to these Measured and Indicated resources, a total of 966,864 tonnes at an average grade of 6.06 g/t for 188,510 ounces of gold are now classified as Inferred resources. This represents a 9% increase in ounces contained over the previous May 2006 43-101 estimate for the same category (847,200 tonnes at 6.35 g/t for 173,091 ounces of gold).
The average horizontal width of the intercepts for the Measured and Indicated gold resources is more than 3.9 meters. Furthermore, InnovExplo concludes in its report that the gold zones remain open at depth and along strike.

The same technical parameters were used in the 2006 and 2007 resource estimates, as follows:
-
The polygonal method on longitudinal section was used.
-
A cut-off grade of 3 g/t Au and a minimum horizontal width of 1.6 metres.
-
High gold values capped to 35 g/t.
-
An average density of 2.82 tonnes/cubic meter.
Based on these results, Cadiscor will undertake a Scoping Study (Preliminary Feasibility Study) of the Discovery gold deposit. Using the new 43-101 resource estimate, the study will evaluate the economical potential of the Discovery gold deposit and propose an underground exploration program for further assessment of the geological and grade continuities of the deposit. It will also cover an underground bulk sampling program and additional underground drilling at depth.
43-101 Regulations, Qualified Person, Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC):
The 43-101 report on the Discovery property was carried out by Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P. Geol., and Christine Beausoleil, B.Sc., P. Geol., from InnovExplo, a mining and exploration Consulting Firm in Mines and Exploration based in Val-d'Or, Québec. Mr. Pelletier and Ms. Beausoleil are Qualified, Independent Persons as defined under Regulation 43-101. The same persons supervised the drilling campaign. Sampled core was sawed in half with one half sent to a commercial laboratory and the other half retained for future reference. A strict QA/QC program is followed which includes mineralized standards, blanks and duplicates. Assays were performed by ALS-Chemex - Chimitec of Val-d'Or, Québec.
Drilling
As of June 2007, the Company was preparing a new surface drilling program on Discovery of 6,000 meter program to test the depth (-700 meters) and lateral extensions of the gold zones that presently remain open at depth and along strike. The drilling program budget was then estimated at $750,000.
From April until the end of December 2007, 15 holes totalling 10,088 metres were drilled on the Discovery project. The results for holes B-07-150-A, 152, 153, 154B and 157, were as follows:

These holes were drilled to test the 1200 East sector, an area where previous drilling (in 1996, 1997 and 2002) by former owners GéoNova Exploration and Strateco Resources returned excellent results that were nonetheless never followed up by drilling or a resource estimate.
Holes B-07-150-A, 152, 154B and 157 intersected mineralization typical of the Discovery zone, and confirmed that the 1200 East zone dips strongly to the east, where it remains open at a depth of 560 metres. They also confirmed the property’s excellent exploration potential. Cadiscor intends to aggressively pursue exploration of the lateral and depth extensions of this gold zone in 2008.
The drilling program initiated in 2006 continued in 2007. This work led to a new NI 43-101-compliant resource estimate. The identification of new gold-bearing structures also led the Company to pursue drilling work in 2007. A total of 23,612 metres in 31 holes were drilled on the property.
The Company retained the services of InnovExplo Inc. of Val-d’Or to conduct a scoping study on the main Discovery zones as a basis for an underground exploration program to include bulk sampling and underground drilling. The report is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008.

In October 2006, the Company initiated a drilling program aimed at increasing the Discovery zone resource and upgrading it from inferred to indicated. At December 31, 2006, 11,763 metres had been drilled in 23 holes.
The Company disclosed assays for 24 holes as of December 12, 2006 and February 19, 2007. The following is a summary of the most significant drill results:

These results confirm the presence and continuity of strong gold mineralization at depth and surrounding the three Discovery zone lenses. More particularly, Hole B-06-123, which returned 13.11 g/t Au over 5.40 metres, showed that the East lens remains open at a depth of 600 metres below surface.
In the 600E section, 600 metres east of the Discovery zone, holes drilled by Strateco led to the identification of a new area of interest, where three mineralized zone were intersected, two of which returned interesting results, namely 7.00 g/t Au over 1.75 metres and 5.85 g/t Au over 2.20 metres. Hole B-06-132, which returned 10.94 g/t Au over 2.75 metres confirmed the potential of this relatively unexplored area of the property.
As of September 2007, the new 6,000-metre program started with the drilling of Hole B-07-152 in the 1200 E Sector, 600 metres to the east of the easternmost gold zone included in the last NI 43-101 resource estimate.
Hole B-07-152 intersected 5.15g/t Au over 6.90 metres at a depth of 430 metres, and is the deepest hole in this sector. The gold zone remains open at depth and laterally.
Hole B-07-152 was drilled to test the extension at depth of Hole B-07-150-A, which intersected 14.1 g/t Au over 2.97 metres,.
Hole B-07-152 is located 240 metres down and 75 metres east of Hole B-07-150-A. Both holes were drilled to explore an area where historical drilling (1996, 1997 and 2002) by previous owners, GeoNova. and Strateco., delivered very good results without follow-up drilling or a resource calculation (See Longitudinal Section - 600E and 1200E Sectors under Discovery Property on Cadiscor’s website at www.cadiscor.com).
Holes B-07-152 and B-07-150-A both intersected typical Discovery-type mineralization, indicating the presence of an additional gold zone on Discovery and confirming the excellent exploration potential of the property. This sector was not included in the NI 43-101 resource estimate. Cadiscor intends to continue drilling the lateral and depth extensions of this gold zone, which remains open at a depth of 430 metres.

The true width of the mineralized sections has not yet been determined. Sampled core was sawed in half, with one half sent to ALS-Chemex-Chimitec of Val-d’Or (Quebec) and the other half kept for future reference. The Company follows a strict QA/QC program that includes mineralized standards, blanks and field duplicates.
As of December 2007, the Company had received results from drilling holes BD-07-153, 154-B and 157 located in the 1200 E Sector, 600 metres to the east of the easternmost gold zone included in the last Canadian NI 43-101 Discovery resources estimate.
Hole BD-07-157 intersected 5.26 g/t Au over 3.25 metres (including 7.71 g/t Au over 2.0 metres) at a depth of 560 metres. Hole BD-07-157 was drilled to explore the depth extension of holes BD-07-150A (14.1 g/t Au over 2.97 metres) and BD-07-152 (5.15 g/t Au over 6.9 metres). Hole B-07-157 is located 130 metres down and 50 metres east of Hole B-07-152. (See Longitudinal Section- 600E and 1200E Sectors in Discovery Property on Cadiscor Resources website, at www.cadiscor.com).
Hole BD-07-153 intersected 3.46 g/t Au over 3.23 metres at a depth of 625 metres. Hole B-07-153 is located 195 metres down and 100 metres west of Hole B-07-152. Hole BD-07-154B intersected 9.18 g/t Au over 0.5 metre at a depth of 320 metres confirming the grade of the zone intersected in Hole BD-02-64 (6.89 g/t Au over 0.55 metre).
Holes BD-07-150A, 152, 154B and 157 intersected typical Discovery-type mineralization and confirm that the 1200E zone shows a steep rake to the east which is still open at a depth of 560 metres. Hole BD-07-157 is directly located in the rake of the mineralized zone and validate its geometry. These drill results confirms the excellent exploration potential of the Discovery property.
The true width of the mineralized intervals has not yet been determined. Sampled core was sawed in half, with one half sent to a commercial laboratory and the other half kept for future reference. A strict QA/QC program is applied, including mineralized standards, blanks and field duplicates. Assaying was performed by AlS-Chemex-Chimitec of Val d’Or (Québec).
Historical Sampling, Assaying and QAQC Protocol
Innovexplo was mandated by Cadiscor Resources to report on previous drilling and to design an appropriate QAQC protocol for the Cadiscor drilling program.
Sampling techniques did not vary much through the three stages of activity on the Discovery Project. Assay samples have been collected in half core to provide sample of variable lengths depending on geology but no longer than 1.5 m. Early samples were collected by mechanically splitting core in half. From 1996 onward, assay samples from presumed mineralized sections were collected by sawing core in half. The remaining half was put back in core boxes for witness. The core is in good condition and there is no evidence of misplaced pieces. Sample tags are generally still readable
.
Samples collected by GéoNova were assayed at two laboratories in the Abitibi region: Technilab or Abilab with check assays at the other lab. GéoNova did extensive checks of the assays which were very consistent. In the more recent drilling programs performed by Strateco, blanks and standards were inserted in the sample stream and the results carefully monitored.
During the 2004 drilling program executed by Strateco, the drilling cores were sampled with a diamond saw. Usually, samples are 0.75 m to 1.25 m long. Half of the cut core was kept as witness sample and the other half was sent for analysis to the ALS Chemex/Chimitec laboratory in Val-d’Or. The preparation and gold analysis protocols of 2002 and 2003 drilling programs were modified in order to improve the reproductibility of gold analyses.
Samples were crushed at 90% -2mm. A representative portion of 1000 g to minus 10 mesh was pulverized at 85% minus 200 mesh and homogenized. A 50-gram pulp portion was analyzed by fire assay with atomic absorption finish. Analysis verifications were systematically made on rejects (pulp 2) by fire assay with atomic absorption

finish on samples grading over 2 g/t Au and with gravimetric finish for those grading over 5 g/t Au. Approximately 10% of the first pulps were sent to the Bourlamaque Laboratory in Val-d’Or for additional analytical verifications. Specific gravity determinations (density) were obtained for gold zones of economic interest. Standard samples were added to the samples sent to the ALS Chemex/Chimitec laboratory as an integral part of a quality control program.
InnovExplo believes the quality of the analytical data is reliable and that the sample preparation, analysis and security measures were carried out in accordance with best practices and industry standards.

Sampling, Assaying and QAQC Protocol
Objectives
The objectives of the QA/QC program designed for Cadiscor Resources by InnovExplo are to monitor and document the quality and integrity of the sampling, preparation and assaying of samples for the Discovery property drilling campaign.
The QA/QC program documents all sampling, preparation and assaying protocols, monitors and documents results and documents evaluations of results pro-actively. Establishing proper QA/QC protocols allows pro-active monitoring of several key elements in the sampling, sample preparation and assaying process. Using a series of quality control samples, the entire sampling, sample preparation and assaying process is monitored and evaluated for:
·
Suitability of field sample size by measuring precision of field duplicate samples;
·
Integrity of field sampling and sample shipment by monitoring results of field blanks and sample shipment procedures;
·
Possible contamination through the sample preparation and assaying process by monitoring results of field blank standards submitted as regular samples and the monitoring of laboratory analytical blank standard results;
·
Suitability of crushing/splitting/pulverization sizes by measuring precision of coarse and pulp duplicate samples;
·
The level of accuracy in the assaying can also be monitored by measuring the accuracy of the laboratories internal certified reference standards and by assaying of “blind” certified reference standards in each batch of samples.
The following is a breakdown of the protocols used for the number, type and distribution of QC samples in each batch of samples shipped from the field and fused in the furnaces at selected laboratory. The number of QC samples has been co-ordinated with the maximum furnace batch size.
For a Field sub-batch of 24 regular samples including 21 regular samples;field. One duplicate sample was selected at random; One field blank standard was selectively placed after possible high grade samples (submitted as regular samples, blind to laboratory) and One Certified reference material (CRM) sample. Samples shipped from the field were identified by individual sample number including batch and sub-batch identification. For each sub-batch, 1 of each of the following samples was prepared by the laboratory people and inserted into each sub-batch of 24 samples: 1 coarse crush duplicate sample split selected at random and 1 pulp duplicate sample split selected at random. The laboratory randomly added to the sub-batches one internal analytical blank standard and 2 internal CRM’s inserted at random.
- 16 -
Samples
The regular samples are provided from NQ drill core that will be split to provide a one half split of the original whole core. The remaining half split core will be kept in the core box as witness. The minimum sample length should be 0.5 m and the maximum length 1.5 m.
Standards (Certified reference material)
“Blind” CRM’s - Three differing grade certified reference standards (CRM’s) were inserted into the batch by the on-site geologist. The recommended CRM’s used are from Rocklabs of New Zealand and are identified below:
CRM#
SJ32
2.645 g/t Au (+/-0.027)
containing 3.0% sulphide in matrix
SN26
8.543 g/t Au (+/- 0.072)
containing 3.2% sulphide in matrix
SP27
18.10 g/t Au (+/-0.27)
containing 3.5% sulphide in matrix
The goal of the lower grade CRM is to monitor the accuracy of assaying at grades that are considered significant albeit below the cut-off grade level for the Discovery project which is 3 g/t Au.
Other Considerations
Visible Gold & High Sulphide Samples - Each field sample that contains visible gold or a large amount of sulphides is systematically assayed using a metallic screen analysis.
Analytical Finish Re-assaying - The protocols for initial analytical determination use AAS. Since the precision of AAS analytical gold determinations above 3.0 to 5.0 g/t Au is considered less accurate, all samples with initial results reported above 3.0 g/t Au were immediately re-assayed using a gravimetric finish with both results reported by the laboratory.
For the current resource estimate, InnovExplo averages all the assays contained in the database for each sample, without any rules of precedence. Even though some assaying method like “metallic sieve” have better precision than method by fire assay with gravimetric or atomic absorption finish, each assaying method has its percentage of error on the precision. A large portion of this error is coming directly at the sampling and at the preparation. The precision of the assay is dependent on the size of the initial sample and the initial crush/split specifications. Because those different samples and sub-sample are generally too small to completely avoid the nugget effect in gold deposit, even a “metallic sieve” assaying method can not be perfectly accurate. By averaging more than one assaying point in the same sample, it minimized the nugget effect and minimized the total error on the final value.
Cameron Shear Project
Option to acquire a 50% interest
Location and Access
The Cameron Shear project lies adjacent to the eastern part of the Discovery project. It lies 35 kilometres northwest of Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Québec, in Desjardins Township. The project is accessible via a gravel road linking Lebel-sur-Quévillon to Matagami. A large network of logging roads facilitates property access.

Mining Claims
The project is wholly-owned by Canadian Royalties Inc. and it consists of 193 claims covering an area of 2,997 hectares. In December 2006, the Company signed a letter of intent with Canadian Royalties Inc. stipulating that the Company may acquire an undivided 50% interest by funding $1,000,000 in exploration expenses and making payments of $50,000 over a five-year period. The Company also issued 75,000 shares to Canadian Royalties Inc. upon signature of the agreement. Once it has earned its 50% interest, the Company may earn an additional 10% interest by financing the entire cost of a bankable feasibility study. The Company is the project operator.
Gold Potential
The property covers an eight-kilometre section of the Cameron deformation zone between the Flordin gold deposit and Discovery. The Cameron deformation zone is part of a regional network of interconnected deformation corridors extending east from the Québec-Ontario border and crossing the Northern Volcanic Zone of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. This network of deformation zones represents a major geological discontinuity characterized by an interruption of the structural and stratigraphic pattern.
Exploration Work
The property is relatively unexplored. Sporadic work was reported from 1937 to 1986. From 1986 to 1988, a joint venture between Quinterra, Noramco and Golden Triangle led to exploration work on a vast property that included

the Cameron Shear property. A hole drilled by Klondike Gold in 1997, during the last reported work program, returned 0.5 g/t Au over 7.6 metres.
The Company had planned to conduct a $100,000 exploration program in 2007, consisting primarily of a magnetometry and electromagnetic helicopter-borne survey that was carried out in February 2007.
At the beginning of 2007, Cadiscor commissioned an airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey covering the entire property. The survey was completed in February and results were analysed in light of the Company's knowledge of the neighbouring Discovery property. Using the geological and geophysical data, four priority areas were identified on the property. One of these corresponds to high gold anomalies in till at the bedrock contact, sampled by an overburden drilling program in the 80’s. As of June 2007, a geological team was mandated on the property to conduct geological and geochemical surveys. Follow-up drilling was planned, depending on the results
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company acts as the project operator. In 2007, the Company incurred $157,188 in exploration expenses. Work consisted primarily of geophysical and geochemical surveys and identified gold anomalies that will be drilled in 2008.
Montbray Project
100 % interest
Location and Access
The Montbray property lies in central Montbray Township some 30 kilometres west of Rouyn-Noranda, Québec. The property is accessed by trails off a gravel road that connects to the paved road linking Rouyn-Noranda and La Sarre.
Mining Claims
The project consists of 28 claims covering an area of 1,120 hectares. In November 2006, the Company signed a letter of intent with Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (“Agnico”) providing for Agnico to acquire a 50% undivided interest by funding $750,000 in exploration and making payments of $60,000 over a four-year period. Agnico was the exploration project operator. Once it has earned its 50% interest, Agnico has a three-year option to increase its interest to 60% by financing alone $10,000,000 in additional exploration or conducting a bankable feasibility study.
Exploration Work
Previous exploration on the Montbray project from 1996 to 2001, particularly by Altavista Mines and Strateco , led to the discovery of three mineralized showings, including the Montbray showing, where channel sampling returned 17.53 g/t Au over 0.75 metres and 4.51g/t Au over 2.5 metres. The subsequent drilling program confirmed the extension of the Montbray showing at depth. The best values were 7.67 g/t Au over 2.35 metres and 2.96 g/t Au over 2.18 metres. During the most recent work done on the property in 2001, a drilling program located the eastern extension of the gold-bearing structure on the Agnico property adjacent to the western part of the Montbray property. The most significant result was 1.38 g/t Au over 1.55 metres associated with a fault zone.
As of June 2007, Agnico has advised Cadiscor that it has completed the geological compilation of the property. A program comprising line cutting and an Induced Polarisation survey was also carried out on the property. Geological mapping, stripping and sampling was planned for the summer 2007, with follow-up drilling scheduled for the fall.
After spending $118,000 on drilling and making a payment of $20,000 to the Company, Agnico advised the Company at the end of December 2007 that it was dropping the option.

Sleeping Giant Mine
The Company has signed an agreement with IAMGOLD Québec-Management Inc. (“IAMGOLD’’) a wholly owned subsidiary of IAMGOLD Corporation, that provides the Company with an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Sleeping Giant Mine and its related milling facilities (‘‘Mine’’). The option grants the Company the right to take possession of the Mine at the end of production from current reserves and in any event not later than April 1st, 2009.
Location and access
The Sleeping Giant Mine is located approximately 100 km north of Amos, Quebec, in the Abitibi region.
The gold mine has been in operation since 1988. At the end of 2006, IAMGOLD had produced 825,000 gold ounces from 2,306,000 tonnes of ore, at an average grade of 11.1g/t Au. The production schedule calls for the end of the production by IAMGOLD at the end of 2008, at the exhaustion of actual known reserves. The mine has an on site 900 t/d C.I.P. mill. The 2007 Mine production target by IAMGOLD was 50,000 ounces of gold.
Option Agreement:
The main terms of the Option Agreement are the following:
1- Upon execution of the Option Agreement, the Company will pay to IAMGOLD a cash amount of $300,000 and will issue to IAMGOLD 600,000 Cadiscor common shares . The Company will also issue to IAMGOLD on such date 1,000,000 common share purchase warrants, each such warrant entitling IAMGOLD to purchase one common share of the Company at a price of $1.00 until April 1st, 2009.
2- On the earlier of (i) April 1st, 2009 or (ii) the date of completion of the mining and processing of the current reserves of the Mine, the Company will take possession of the Mine by paying to IAMGOLD an amount of $5,000,000, payable, at Cadiscor’s sole discretion, either in cash or by the issuance of the relevant number of common shares of Cadiscor at a price equivalent to the volume-weighted average price of the previous 20 trading days, less the maximum allowable discount permitted by the TSX Venture Exchange.
3- After acquiring the Mine and after the Company has milled, at the Mine milling facilities, a total of 300,000 tonnes of ore from any source, the Company will pay to IAMGOLD an amount of $1,000,000, payable at the Company’s sole discretion, either in cash or by the issuance of the relevant number of common shares of Cadiscor at a price equivalent to the volume-weighted average price of the previous 20 trading days, less a discount of 5%.
4- After the acquisition of the Mine, the Company will commit to grant to IAMGOLD the following royalties: (a) a 1.0 % NSR royalty on future gold production from the Mine property, with the Company having the right to buy back such royalty for an amount of $1,000,000 at any time; and (b) a 1.5% NSR royalty on any future base metal production from the Mine property, it being understood that such royalty will only be granted if there exists more than 5,000,000 tonnes of Measured and Indicated resources on the property, as established by a Canadian Regulation 43-101 compliant resource estimate.
5- Upon execution of the Option Agreement, the Company shall also have the right to carry out a surface or underground exploration program on any portion of land included in the Mine property by assuming all costs related to it. IAMGOLD will give to the Company access to the necessary facilities to conduct the exploration program and will charge to the Company, at cost, all the expenses in connection therewith.
All issuances and potential issuances of Cadiscor shares under the deal are subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.

At signature of the agreement, the Company made a cash payment of $300,000 and issued 600,000 common shares to IAMGOLD, as well as 1,000,000 common share purchase warrants. Each warrant entitles IAMGOLD to purchase one common share of Cadiscor at a price of $1.00 until April 1, 2009.
Exploration work during the Option period
As of February 2008, the Company obtained the first results from underground exploration drilling at the Sleeping Giant Mine, (“Mine”) on which it has an option to acquire a 100% interest from IAMGOLD.
In December 2007, the Company started a 9,000-meter underground exploration program to test the continuity of the gold zones at depth, below the deepest mining level (-975 meters).
These results are significant as they confirm the presence of the gold zones down to 445 meters below the current mine workings, with grades that are similar to the grades in the mine. Drilling will continue until the end of the second quarter of 2008. The results will then be evaluated to consider the feasibility of extending the mine shaft.
The Sleeping Giant Mine entered production in 1988. The mine has since been deepened twice to follow the gold zones. The main mine production zones are, in order of importance, Zones #30, 8, 20, 3 and 18. Three underground drill rigs are testing the next 400 meters of Zones #8, 30 and 18 below the deepest mining level.
The mine’s gold zones are narrow quartz veins that are mainly mined by shrinkage stoping. Typically, mine planning uses a minimum width of 1.6 orthogonal meters. Results from the immediate extension of the mined zones or areas where geological control is sufficient to determine the gold zone attitude with confidence, are reported using this minimum 1.6 orthogonal meters width. Results from areas where the gold zone attitude can not be determined with confidence are reported using the core length.
The new drill results are shown below. Zone #8 was intersected down to a depth of 445 meters under the current mine, at its projected position in space, which indicates continuity at depth. The deepest mining level is 975 meters below surface.

*Holes 66-911 and 97-27 were drilled by IAMGOLD and Hole 66-911B was started by IAMGOLD.
Hole 66-923 was deepened past Zone #8 to test Zone #30. Two veins were intersected and returned 5.9 g/t Au over 0.8 m and 6.5 g/t Au over 1.1 m, indicating the presence of Zone #30 at a depth of about 225 m below the deepest

mining level. Holes 66-911 and 66-924 also intersected values of 8.9 g/t Au over 1.0 m and 36.2 g/t Au over 0.5 m respectively before the #8 Zone intersection, in new structures previously unknown at the mine. Additional drilling is planned to test these structures.
Prior to the current exploration program, one exploration hole, Hole 97-27, intersected the extension of Zone #30 at elevation 3960, 65 meters below the last mine level. It returned a value of 8.3 g/t Au over 1.6 meters, indicating the possibility of extending the mined zones at depth.
The Company is also in the process of reassessing the historical production, development and exploration data of the current mine to identify resources in the vicinity of the existing underground infrastructure, in the context of a higher gold price. The 7 g/t Au cut-off grade presently used at the mine is based on a gold price of $US600/oz. This reassessment should be completed by the end of second quarter of 2008. Cadiscor will then evaluate the economic potential of the resources located close to actual mine infrastructures.
The assay determinations were carried by the Sleeping Giant Mine laboratory. A QA/QC program is in place at the lab and includes the use of blanks, standards and re-analysis by outside independent laboratories.
As soon as the agreement was signed, Cadiscor initiated an underground exploration program at the Sleeping Giant Mine. The program is aimed at testing the continuity of the currently-mined zones at depth below the last level at 975 metres. At the end of 2007, Cadiscor had invested $261,897 in this work.
The first holes drilled under the existing mine workings had intersected the extensions at depth of the two gold zones currently being mined. The deepest intersection is at 445 metres under the deepest mine level, and returned 10.7 g/t Au over 1.6 metres, at the location predicted based on projections. A full compilation of previous work in the current mine is also underway to determine whether there are unmined zones that have become economic with the rise in the gold price.
Florence property
100% interest
The Company staked the Florence project, adjacent to the Cameron Shear project to the north, (see figure 1) to cover a series of geochemical anomalies. The property is wholly-owned by Cadiscor and consists of 15 claims covering 240 hectares staked in September 2007. Drilling will be carried out on the geochemical anomalies in 2008.
The property covers the possible extension of certain gold anomalies identified on the Cameron Shear property to the south. Drilling is planned on these targets in 2008.
Flordin property
100% interest
The Flordin property consists of 40 claims covering a surface area of 591 hectares (see Figure 1). The project is wholly-owned by the Company, which acquired it from IAMGOLD Québec Management Inc. (“IAMGOLD”) in 2007. It lies immediately east of the Cameron Shear property, and hosts the Flordin and Cartwright gold deposits. The Flordin deposit has not been explored since 1988. The Company carried out compilation work then began a four-hole drilling program on the Flordin deposit. As at the end of 2007, two holes were drilled for a total of 638 metres and a total of $138,964 had been invested in the property.
On July 9, 2007, the Company had acquired the Flordin property, immediately east of the Cameron Shear property. This property hosts the Flordin deposit, which Cambior estimated to contain 815,000 tonnes grading 5.1 g/t Au in 1988. In 1989, a ramp and underground exploration work led to bulk sampling that confirmed the presence of gold-bearing zones. Work was suspended due to the low gold price at the time (US $390 per ounce). At the end of 2007, the Company began drilling four holes to verify the previous results and test the extensions of the deposit at depth.

Conclusion
With its Discovery, Cameron Shear, Flordin and Florence properties, the Company now controls a 21-kilometre section of geological context favourable to gold mineralization.
