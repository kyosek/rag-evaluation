Item 2. Properties
United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 244.8 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 152.3 million square feet. Total estimated retail sales at the properties in 2009 were approximately $58 billion.
Regional malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 162 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from
approximately 400,000 to 2.3 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,600 occupied stores, including approximately 710 anchors, which are mostly national retailers. For comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls acquired from The Mills Corporation in 2007, or the Mills Regional Malls, from the information on our other regional malls.
Premium Outlet Centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center. Our 41 Premium Outlet Centers range in size from approximately 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet Centers are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Palm Springs, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.
The Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The Mills Regional Malls typically range in size from 700,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers.
Community/lifestyle centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 67 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 900,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.
We also have interests in 15 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA, are considered non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.
The following table provides representative data for our U.S. properties on a gross basis as of December 31, 2009:
As of December 31, 2009, approximately 92.1% of the owned GLA in regional malls and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 97.9% of owned GLA in the Premium Outlet Centers was leased, approximately 93.9% of the owned GLA for The Mills and 89.3% of owned GLA for the Mills Regional Malls was leased, and approximately 90.7% of owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.
We hold a 100% interest in 200 of our properties, effectively control 18 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 103 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 311 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.
The following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, the Mills Regional Malls and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2009.

In addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. Simon Ivanhoe and GCI are fully integrated European retail real estate developers, owners and managers.
Our properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan, primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe. These centers comprise over 13.4 million square feet of GLA and were 95.9% leased as of December 31, 2009.
On February 4, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners will receive consideration of â‚¬715 million for their interests, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We expect our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe to be approximately $300 million. The transaction is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
We and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.

We also hold real estate interests in eight joint venture properties in Japan, one joint venture property in Mexico, and one joint venture property in Korea.

We have a 40% interest in this property consistent with the ownership structure of our other Japanese investments. We also completed construction and opened a 171,800 square foot expansion at Kobe-Sanda Premium Outlets in Hyougo-ken, Japan. Also in December 2009, we recognized a loss on our joint venture interests in
our shopping centers in China. We sold our interests to affiliates of our Chinese partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million.

Land
We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 700 acres of land held in the United States for future development.
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency
Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, excluding new developments and expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 238 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 17% percent reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties and reflects an annual value of over $27.5 million in avoided operating costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 140,000 metric tons CO2e.
We were awarded NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth year in a row. We are the only company to have achieved the Leader in the Light distinction every single year since NAREIT launched the program in 2005. We were included in the 2009 Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. The 2009 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index highlights 50 companies worldwide that have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance with respect to climate change disclosure practices. We were the only real estate company to be recognized.
